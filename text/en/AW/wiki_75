<text>The Thousand Islands (, ) constitute a North American archipelago of 1,864 islands that straddles the Canada–US border in the Saint Lawrence River as it emerges from the northeast corner of Lake Ontario. They stretch for about downstream from Kingston, Ontario. The Canadian islands are in the province of Ontario and the U.S. islands in the state of New York.

The islands range in size from over to smaller islands occupied by a single residence, or uninhabited outcroppings of rocks. To count as one of the Thousand Islands, emergent land within the river channel must have at least of land above water level year-round, and support at least two living trees.

== Geography ==
The Thousand Islands archipelago is at the outlet of Lake Ontario at the head of the Saint Lawrence River. The region is bisected by the Canada–United States border and covers portions of Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties in the U.S. state of New York, in addition to parts of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and Frontenac County in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Geologically, most of the islands are where a branch of the Canadian Shield, known as the Thousand Islands – Frontenac Arch region, runs south across the river to join with the Adirondacks. This region was designated a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002.

===Transportation===
The Thousand Islands Bridge connects New York State and Ontario by traversing Wellesley Island at the northernmost point of Interstate 81 in Jefferson County and meets Highway 137, which leads to Highway 401. The waterfront is served by New York State Routes 12 and 37 and by the Thousand Islands Parkway in Ontario. Ontario also has the Waterfront Trail alongside the Parkway for cyclists who wish to see the area in an alternative way.

Seawaymax lake freighters often ply the Saint Lawrence Seaway. As is usual in inland waters of the United States and Canada, vessels must use maritime pilots to help them travel safely. In places, a vessel less than offshore can find itself in over of water. Conversely, rocks and shoals less than underwater can be found in the center of otherwise deep waters. Due to the great number of rocks and shoals just above or below the water&#x27;s surface, navigation outside of the marked channels at night can be dangerous.

Before the introduction of the zebra mussel, visibility of only was usual, slightly decreasing as the years passed. Water clarity improved markedly in the mid-1990s with the arrival of zebra mussels, which feed on algae. The water is so clear in some areas a rocky bottom can be observed in of water. The area has several shipwrecks, and although most are over underwater, some are a mere down and can be seen from the surface.

=== Population centers ===
The single largest city in the region is Kingston, Ontario, which has a metropolitan population of more than 170,000 (2021). The city marks the western end of the region in Canada, while Brockville, Ontario, to the east, is the other large population center. The American region along the river is much less dense; the largest city is Watertown, New York, which has a population of 25,000 (2020) and is inland. There are a number of seasonal communities which grow significantly in the summer, like Thousand Island Park in New York.

In New York, United States

This region is within Jefferson County:

* Alexandria Bay
* Cape Vincent
* Clayton
* Henderson Harbor
* Sackets Harbor 
* Northern Tug Hill 
* Watertown

In Ontario, Canada

This region includes the southern areas of Frontenac and Leeds &amp; Grenville counties:

* Brockville
* Gananoque
* Kingston
* Prescott
* Thousand Islands Parkway
===Notable islands===

* The largest island in the group, Wolfe Island, is entirely in Ontario. Other large islands in the archipelago include New York&#x27;s Grindstone Island and Wellesley Island, and Ontario&#x27;s Howe Island.
* Adjacent to Wolfe Island but part of New York is Carleton Island, the site of a ruined fort, Fort Haldimand, built in 1779 by the British during the American Revolutionary War. The island was captured by three American soldiers during the War of 1812 and remains part of the United States.
* Deer Island, about north of Alexandria Bay, is owned by the secret society of Skull and Bones.
* A pair of islands southwest of Grenadier Island are collectively called Zavikon Island. A popular but incorrect tale is that the larger island is in Canada, while the smaller one is in the United States, and the foot bridge between them is the shortest international bridge in the world. Zavikon Island is entirely in Canada and belongs to the Leeds and Grenville municipal unit.
* Longue Vue Island is the only artificial island in the region.
* Ironsides Island is home to one of the largest great blue heron rookeries in northern New York State, where over one thousand herons return to breed each April. The uninhabited rocky island near Alexandria Bay, New York, is owned by The Nature Conservancy and was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1967.
* Calumet Island is near Clayton, New York. The privately owned island formerly featured a &quot;castle&quot; mansion belonging to New York tobacco tycoon Charles G. Emery, and later hosted a marina in the 1960s.
* Just Room Enough Island is the smallest inhabited island in the world.

== History ==

Prior to European colonization, the Thousand Islands region was home to, or visited by, members of the Iroquois Confederacy and Ojibwa people. Their name for the islands was &quot;Manitouana&quot; or the &quot;Garden of the Great Spirit&quot;.

The region was a part of the War of 1812 between the British Empire and the United States. Many sites from the war can be found, such as Fort Wellington in Prescott, Ontario and the garrison on Chimney Island, Mallorytown, Ontario. Museums about the war can be found on both the Canadian and American side of the river.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many distinguished visitors made the region widely known as a summer resort. During the half century (1874–1912) of the resort&#x27;s greatest prominence, most wealthy vacationers came from New York City, joined by prominent families from Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and other cities of the United States and Canada. Several grand hotels provided luxurious accommodations while steamboats offered extensive tours among the islands. Wealthy and middle-class summer residents built summer homes, and the region retains a historically important collection of vacation homes from this time.

Among the lavish homes built during this time were several masonry &quot;castles&quot;, some of which remain as international landmarks. The region&#x27;s first castle, Castle Rest, was built in 1888; it was destroyed in the mid-20th century. The most famous extant examples are &quot;The Towers&quot; on Dark Island, now called Singer Castle, and the previously long-neglected Boldt Castle on Heart Island, which had been left unfinished for over 75 years upon the untimely death of George Boldt&#x27;s wife. It has since been completed over the recent decades in accord with Boldt&#x27;s original plans.

The Thousand Islands have long been a center for recreational boating. Large steam yachts, many designed by Nathanael Herreshoff, required distinctive yacht houses. The region was known also for innovative power boating during this period. Three local yacht clubs hosted the Gold Cup Races of the American Power Boat Association for nine consecutive years.

==Recreation==

===Public parks===
To be considered an island, a piece of land must stay above water throughout the year and support a living tree. Many of the islands are publicly owned. A group of 21 islands form the Thousand Islands National Park, the oldest of Canada&#x27;s national parks east of the Rocky Mountains. The park hosts campgrounds, inland walking trails, annual family events, as well as a national heritage building.

Thirty New York state parks are managed as part of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation&#x27;s Thousand Islands Region, including many on river islands or along the New York shore. Many of these river parks were established in the late 19th and early 20th century as part of the St. Lawrence Reservation, and were among New York&#x27;s earliest land acquisitions for the purpose of preservation and recreational development. Among the larger parks are Wellesley Island State Park, which includes the largest camping complex in the region, and Robert Moses State Park.

===Other boating, fishing and vacationing locations===

*One of the few beaches in the Thousand Islands, Potter&#x27;s Beach (conserved by the Thousand Islands Land Trust) on the American Grindstone Island has a fine, shallow sandy bottom with a very gradual slope, and serves as a location for boats to set anchor and spend a day at the beach or hiking on the trails that extend around Grindstone Island. 
*A popular location for swimming or anchoring out of the wind, the Lake of the Isles is a secluded area cut off from the rest of the St. Lawrence River by Wellesley Island and neighboring Canadian Hill Island. Access is limited through two narrow passages, one around the northeastern end of the island, and the other being the International Rift, which is a small, shallow, winding canal that leads you through to the north side of the island passing right underneath the customs bridge.
*Known for its fishing, especially pike, Eel Bay is a shallow bay just southwest of Wellesley Island.
*The Thousand Islands Land Trust (TILT) conserves over of land in the Thousand Islands region. This land includes many creeks, nature preserves and over of trails open to the public, year-round, free of charge. The Trust&#x27;s annual series of programs – TILTreks, TeenTreks, KidsTreks and TILTKids Camp – give individuals and families the opportunity to participate in regional field trips and recreational activities as well as attend presentations on wildlife or habitat preservation. TILT&#x27;s community events help further their conservation efforts in the Thousand Islands region.

*Boldt Castle, a testament of one man&#x27;s love of his wife, has been under renovation by its owner, the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority since 1977, and can be visited by boat or tour cruise. This 120-room mansion is on Heart Island just across the shipping channel from Alexandria Bay. The grounds consist of the main castle, the power house, the play house, and a boat house tucked in across the bay on the inside of the island.
*Though not as famous as George Boldt&#x27;s Castle, Singer Castle on Dark Island is privately renovated and is open to tourists. Frederick Bourne had his castle constructed with secret passageways and hidden wine cellars so he could spy on his guests while keeping his liquor out of sight during the prohibition era.
*The Antique Boat Museum in Clayton, New York houses antique wooden boats used or built in the region. The museum also features exhibits on the region&#x27;s maritime culture and is home to &quot;La Duchesse&quot;, George Boldt&#x27;s luxury houseboat.
*Thousand Islands Boat Museum in Gananoque, Ontario is a young, hands-on waterfront museum celebrating the heritage of the St. Lawrence River. Workshops, events and a collection of 36 boats are on offer.
*The Thousand Islands also facilitates freshwater shipwreck diving. Numerous wrecks lay at the bottom of the seaway including &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Islander&quot;, and &quot;Keystorm&quot;. There are wrecks that are appropriate for all diving skill levels.

==Aviation and airports==

Passenger air service to the Thousand Islands region is available in both Ontario and New York. Watertown International Airport (ART) in Watertown, New York has daily service on American Airlines connecting through Philadelphia (PHL). Norman Rogers Airport (YGK) in Kingston, Ontario offers service on FlyGTA Airlines connecting through Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport as well as service out of Montréal–Trudeau International Airport via Pascan Aviation. Both airports also offer private aviation services.

Maxson Airfield (FAA LID: 89NY) is a privately owned, private-use general aviation airport south of the central business district of Alexandria Bay, a village in Jefferson County, New York. It once had commercial service provided by Mohawk Airlines. At that time, the airport bore the IATA airport code AXB. Maxson is available to the public by Maxson Airfield, LLC.

Brockville-Thousand Islands Regional Tackaberry Airport (IATA: XBR, TC LID: CNL3), also known as Brockville Municipal Airport, is a registered aerodrome in Elizabethtown-Kitley Township, northwest of the city of Brockville, Ontario, Canada.

==Thousand Island dressing==

According to &quot;The Oxford Companion of Food and Drink&quot;, the name for Thousand Island dressing &quot;presumably comes from the Thousand Islands between the United States and Canada in the St. Lawrence River.&quot; However, several different versions of the dressing&#x27;s origin exist. One common story describes how a fishing guide&#x27;s wife, Sophia LaLonde, made the condiment as part of her husband George&#x27;s shore dinner. Often in this version, actress May Irwin requested the recipe after enjoying it. Irwin in turn gave it to another Thousand Islands summer resident, George Boldt, who built Boldt Castle between 1900 and 1904. Boldt, as proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, instructed the hotel&#x27;s &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, Oscar Tschirky, to put the dressing on the menu in 1894.

Sociologists attempting to determine the true origin of Thousand Island dressing found several conflicting origin stories exist, and they vary between the various islands and villages of the Thousand Islands region. None appear to have any strong written evidence to support their specific claims.

<doc id="172921" wikidata="Q146924" url="?curid=172921" title="Limes (Roman Empire)">
<text> (Latin; , : ) is a term used primarily for the Germanic border defence or delimiting system of ancient Rome marking the borders of the Roman Empire. The term has been extended in modern times to refer to the frontier defences in other parts of the empire, such as in the east and in Africa.

==Overview==

The Roman frontier stretched for more than from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The positions of the borders changed especially during the main periods of Roman expansion and contraction, and first became more stable during the early Empire period under Augustus, but the borders continued to change with time in different provinces. The borders had different constituents depending on local needs; often they consisted of natural boundaries (e.g. rivers) with roads behind for easier movement of troops between linked forts (e.g. Danubian Limes), or else roads with linked forts (e.g. Stanegate, Fosse Way).

The remains of the frontiers today consist of vestiges of roads, forts, fortresses, walls and ditches, and associated civilian settlements. The soldiers at a border were referred to as &quot;limitanei&quot;. They were not expected to win large-scale wars, but rather to deter small-to-medium-sized raiding parties.

Notable examples of Roman frontiers include:
*Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in northern England
*Antonine Wall – in Scotland
* Saxon Shore, late Roman coastal forts in South-East England
*Limes Arabicus, the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea facing the desert
*Limes Tripolitanus, the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara
*Fossatum Africae, the southern frontier of the Roman Empire, extending south of the Roman province of Africa in North-Africa.
*Germanic Limes including the:
**Lower Germanic Limes
**Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes
*Danubian Limes including the:
**Rhaetian Limes (only those elements along the Danube)
**Noric Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Noricum, from the River Inn along the Danube to Cannabiaca (Zeiselmauer-Wolfpassing) in Austria.
**Pannonian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Pannonia, along the Danube from Klosterneuburg Austria to Taurunum in Serbia.
**Moesian Limes, the frontier of the Roman province Moesia, from Singidunum Serbia along the Danube to Moldavia.
*Dacian Limes including:
**Limes Alutanus, the eastern border of the Roman province of Dacia
**Limes Transalutanus, the later advanced eastern frontier of Dacia

==Etymology==
The stem of &quot;limes&quot;, &quot;limit&quot;-, which can be seen in the genitive case, &quot;limitis&quot;, marks it as the ancestor of an entire group of words in many languages related to Latin; for example, English &quot;&quot; or French &quot;&quot;. The Latin noun &quot;līmes&quot; (; Latin  &quot;&quot;) had a number of different meanings: a path or balk delimiting fields; a boundary line or marker; any road or path; any channel, such as a stream channel; or any distinction or difference. The term was also commonly used after the 3rd century AD to denote a military district under the command of a &quot;dux limitis&quot;.

An etymology by Julius Pokorny in &quot;Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot; says that &quot;limes&quot; comes from Indo-European &quot;el-&quot;, &quot;elei-&quot;, &quot;lei-&quot;, &quot;to bow&quot;, &quot;to bend&quot;, &quot;elbow&quot;. According to Pokorny, Latin &quot;limen&quot;, &quot;threshold&quot;, is related to &quot;limes&quot;, being the stone over which one enters or leaves the house. Some scholars have viewed the frontier as a threshold. The Merriam–Webster dictionaries take this view, as does J. B. Hofmann in &quot;Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen&quot; under &quot;leimon&quot;. &quot;The White Latin Dictionary&quot; denies any connection, deriving &quot;limen&quot; from *&quot;ligmen&quot;, as in &quot;lien&quot; from *leig-, &quot;tie&quot;. In this sense, the threshold ties together the doorway. W. Gebert also wrote an article discussing the term.

The first use of the term &quot;limes&quot; as meaning &quot;land border&quot; appears for the first time in 98 AD by Tacitus:

&quot;...nec iam de limite imperii et ripa, sed de hibernis legionum et de possessione dubitatum&quot; (...not only were the frontier of the empire and the banks [of the Danube] in danger but also the winter-quarters of the legions and the provinces).

Its definitive use for the Danubian border seems to date from about 122 in the time of Hadrian:

&quot;Per ea tempora et alia frequenter in plurimis locis, in quibus barbari non fluminibus sed limitibus dividuntur, stipitibus magnis in modum muralis saepis funditus iactis atque conexis barbaros separavit&quot; (During this period and on many other occasions also, in many regions where the barbarians are held back not by rivers but artificial barriers, [Hadrian] shut them out by tall stakes planted deep in the ground and fastened together in the manner of a palisade).

Some experts suggested that the Germanic &quot;limes&quot; may have been called &quot;Munimentum Traiani&quot; (Trajan&#x27;s Bulwark) by contemporaries, referring to a passage by Ammianus Marcellinus, according to which emperor Julian had reoccupied this fortification in 360 AD.

== In Europe ==
=== Britain===

The frontier in Britain existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD. Initially the Fosse Way road was a frontier. From the 1st to the 2nd century first the Gask Ridge and then the Stanegate, with their chains of forts and watchtowers, marked the northern boundary of Britannia. Later Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was built as the frontier and for a short time the Antonine Wall further north. The defence of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was achieved through the incorporation of forts and &quot;castella&quot;. Security and monitoring on the coasts in the west and southeast were achieved by forts and by chains of watchtowers or signal towers, both along the coastline.

The garrisons, &quot;Exercitus Britannicus&quot;, consisted mostly of cohorts of auxilia. The strategic reserve comprised three legions based in Eburacum (York), Isca Silurum and Deva. The observation and surveillance of the waters around the British Isles was the responsibility of the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, whose headquarters were in &quot;Rutupiae&quot; (Richborough). Legions, auxilia and the fleet were commanded by the provincial governors. From the 3rd century, units of &quot;comitatenses, limitanei&quot; and &quot;liburnaria&quot; (marines) came under the command of two generals:

* &quot;Comes Britanniarum&quot;
* &quot;Dux Britanniarum&quot;
=== Saxon Shore ===

This section of the &quot;limes&quot; existed from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD and covered the provinces of:

* &quot;Britannia Inferior&quot;
* &quot;Belgica&quot;
* &quot;Lugdunensis&quot;
* &quot;Aquitania&quot;

This &quot;limes&quot; of the Late Antiquity ran through the territory of the present-day United Kingdom and France. In the 3rd century, a separate military district, the &quot;Litus Saxonicum&quot;, was established on the British side of the English Channel between the estuaries of the Wash and the Solent, to repel Saxon pirates and plunderers. The Gallic side of the English Channel and Atlantic coast were included therein. Monitoring and coastal surveillance were carried out by a chain of watchtowers or signal towers, forts and fortified ports (Gaul). Most of the Saxon Shore camps probably served as naval bases.

The garrisons of the forts were composed of infantry and several cavalry regiments. Monitoring and surveillance of the Channel were the responsibility of the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot; and &quot;Classis Sambrica&quot;, whose headquarters were in &quot;Locus Quartensis&quot; (Port d&#x27;Etaple), guarding the mouth of the River Somme. The units of &quot;comitatenses, limitanei&quot; and &quot;liburnaria&quot; in this area came under the command of three generals:

* &quot;Comes litoris Saxonici per Britanniam&quot; (Count of the Saxon Shore)
* &quot;Dux Belgicae secundae&quot;
* &quot;Dux tractus Armoricani et Nervicani&quot;
=== Lower Germania ===

This section of &quot;limes&quot; existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD and ran through the province of Lower Germania (&quot;Germania Inferior&quot;).

It lies on the territory of today&#x27;s Netherlands and Germany. This &quot;limes&quot; was a river border (&quot;limes ripa&quot;) on the Rhine, defended by a chain of camps, that ran from the North Sea (Katwijk-Brittenburg camp) to Vinxtbach (opposite Rheinbrohl fort on the Upper Germanic Limes), forming the border between the Roman provinces of &quot;Germania Inferior&quot; and &quot;Germania Superior&quot;. By contrast with the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, it was not marked by a solid palisade or wall. Neither can any defensive ditch or rampart be identified. The guards were stationed in nearby &quot;castra&quot; and watchtowers usually built immediately on the Rhine. The &quot;limes&quot; was served by a well-developed military road. Each camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area, because the Rhine not only formed the border but was also the most important transport and trade route in the region. In the first section, between the camps of &quot;Rigomagus&quot; (Remagen) and &quot;Bonna&quot; (Bonn), there were only a few camps. In the second, middle, section between &quot;Bonna&quot; and &quot;Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum&quot; (Nijmegen), there were considerably more. Here there were also larger legion camps; with one exception, all were cavalry barracks. The landscape of the third section between &quot;Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum&quot; and &quot;Mare Germanicum&quot; (the North Sea) was characterised by numerous small streams and boggy marshland. Consequently, in this area there was only one cavalry camp. Border security here consisted mainly of tightly packed, relatively small cohort forts.

The occupying troops, &quot;Exercitus Germaniae Inferioris&quot;, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts. From the 2nd century, the strategic reserve comprised three legions stationed in &quot;Bonna/&quot;Bonn, &quot;Novaesium/&quot;Neuss, &quot;Vetera/&quot;Xanten and &quot;Noviomagus/&quot;Nijmegen. The control and surveillance of the waters of the North Sea, the Rhine estuary and the Lower Rhine was the responsibility of the &quot;Classis Germanica&quot; whose headquarters was in &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;/Cologne. Legions, auxilia and fleet units were commanded by the respective provincial governor. From the 3rd century the &quot;ripenses&quot; (river guards), &quot;comitatenses&quot;, and &quot;liburnaria&quot; were under the command of the &quot;Dux Belgicae secundae&quot;.
=== Upper Germania and Rhaetia ===

This &quot;limes&quot; existed from the 1st to 5th centuries AD and guarded the provinces of:

* &quot;Germania Superior&quot;
* &quot;Rhaetia&quot;

It lay on the territory of the present German states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. To the north, it bordered those parts of the Roman province of &quot;Rhaetia&quot; that lay north of the Danube and guarded the eastern border of that part of &quot;Germania Superior&quot; that lay east of the Rhine. In Upper Germania the border defences initially consisted only of a post road. From about 162/63 AD, the Romans constructed a defensive barrier with watchtowers and signal towers, palisades, ditches and earthworks. On one short section of the Rhaetian Limes, a solid stone wall was erected. In its final stages, the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes was about 550 kilometres long and ran from Rheinbrohl, in the county of Neuwied in northern Rhineland-Palatinate, as far as Hienheim on the Danube. Between the villages of Osterburken and Welzheim, the &quot;limes&quot; ran for 81 kilometres almost in a straight line southwards. In the scholarly literature, this unusual section is considered as evidence that this type of boundary wall had never been used for defensive purposes.

The land of &quot;Agri Decumates&quot; that was guarded by this &quot;limes&quot; had to be vacated by the Romans in 260–285 AD. They moved their bases back to the banks of the Rhine and Danube, which were much easier to defend militarily. The exact route of the &quot;limes&quot; along the border between Upper Germania and Raetia has not been fully explored. In the late 4th and early 5th centuries, the Rhaetian Limes was reorganized and divided into three sections. The northern border of &quot;Rhaetia&quot; formed the &quot;pars superior&quot; (upper part), the western border was the &quot;pars media&quot; (central part) with the fortified town of Cambodunum and bases from &quot;Vemania&quot; (Isny im Allgäu) to &quot;Cassilacum&quot; (Memmingen); the &quot;pars inferior&quot; (lower part) was the section between &quot;Castra Regina&quot; (Regensburg) and &quot;Batavis&quot; (Passau).

The defending troops, &quot;Exercitus Germaniae superioris&quot; and &quot;Exercitus Raeticus&quot;, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts. From the 2nd century, the strategic reserve was formed from three legions stationed in &quot;Mogontiacum/&quot;Mainz, &quot;Argentorate/&quot;Strasbourg and &quot;Castra Regina&quot;/Regensburg. The monitoring of the Upper Rhine was the responsibility of the &quot;Classis Germanica&quot;; that of the Rhaetic Danube came under the &quot;Classis Pannonia&quot;, whose headquarters was in &quot;Aquincum&quot;/Budapest. Legions and auxilia cohorts were under the command of the governor. From the 3rd century the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian border troops (&quot;comitatenses, repenses&quot;, and &quot;liburnaria&quot;), were commanded by three generals:

* &quot;Dux Raetiae&quot;
* &quot;Dux Mogontiacensis&quot;
* &quot;Comes tractus Argentoratensis&quot;
=== Danube-Iller-Rhine Limes (DIRL) ===

This &quot;limes&quot; existed from the 3rd to the 5th centuries AD and guarded the provinces of:

* &quot;Germania Superior&quot;
* &quot;Rhaetia&quot;

It lies on the territory of present-day Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. As early as the period 15 BC to about 70 AD, the border between Rome and Germania ran mostly along the line of the late antique Danube-Iller-Rhine Limes (DIRL) before the Romans advanced further north into the &quot;Agri decumates&quot;. Because of troop withdrawals and massive barbarian invasions, the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes were abandoned in the late 3rd century and the Roman forces pulled the border back to the banks of the three rivers. Especially around the year 300, the Emperor Diocletian had new fortifications built directly on the river banks or on major roads in the hinterland here. Around 370 AD, the line of fortifications was considerably strengthened under the Emperor Valentinian I to counter the Alemanni, who were steadily advancing southwards. By contrast with the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, the DIRL primarily fulfilled defensive purposes; its camps had much stronger and higher walls than their High Imperial predecessors. Furthermore, they had in most cases been built to conform to the local topography. This meant that they could not be built in the classical &#x27;pack of cards&#x27; shape. Between them a dense chain of watchtowers and signal towers were constructed to provide an additional security measure (&quot;burgi&quot;).

Flotillas of patrol boats were stationed on the large lakes in this region.

* Lake Constance: &quot;Numerus Barcariorum&quot; (HQ at &quot;Brigantium&quot;/Bregenz)
* Lake Neuchâtel: &quot;Classis Barcariorum&quot; (HQ at &quot;Eburodunum&quot;/Yverdon).

&quot;Comitatenses&quot;, &quot;ripenses&quot;, and &quot;liburnaria&quot; in this section of the limes were under the command of four generals:

* &quot;Dux Raetiae&quot;
* &quot;Dux provinciae Sequanicae&quot;
* &quot;Comes tractus Argentoratensis&quot;
* &quot;Dux Germaniae primae&quot;
=== Noricum ===
This section of the &quot;limes&quot; existed from the 1st to the 5th century AD and guarded part of the Roman province of &quot;Noricum&quot;.

It is on the soil of the present-day Austrian states of Upper and Lower Austria. It ran along the Danube from Passau/&quot;Boiodurum&quot; to Zeiselmauer/&quot;Cannabiaca&quot;. This is also a &quot;ripa&quot; (river border), which was guarded by a loose chain of cohort forts. The main road on the Norican Limes was the &quot;via iuxta amnem Danuvium&quot;. The initially simple wood and earth structures were systematically converted under Emperor Hadrian into stone encampments. During the 4th century, they were brought once more up to date and massively reinforced. Between the camps, in strategic places or good points of observation, were watchtowers or signal towers and, in the Late Antiquity, &quot;burgi&quot;. In the middle section, between the camps of &quot;Favianis&quot; and &quot;Melk&quot;, watchtowers were built only sporadically. Here the narrow valley of the Wachau, with its densely forested escarpments, made access to the riverbank more difficult, providing some defensive function. Every camp had its own river port or landing stage and a storage area because the Danube was not only a border zone, but also the most important transport and trade route in the region. Over time civilian settlements or &quot;vici&quot; were established immediately next to the camps. In the immediate hinterland of the &quot;limes&quot;, walled towns or &quot;municipia&quot; were founded – for example, &quot;Aelium Cetium&quot; or &quot;Ovilava&quot; (Wels). They were the administrative or commercial centres of the region. In late antiquity, the Norican area was divided into two parts (&quot;pars inferior&quot; and &quot;pars superior&quot;). It is probable that a second, defensive line was created to the rear (&quot;Castrum Locus Felicis&quot;).

The occupying troops, &quot;Exercitus Noricus&quot;, consisted mostly of auxilia cohorts and a legion stationed in &quot;Lauriacum/&quot;Enns acted as the strategic reserve. The surveillance and security of the Danube and its tributaries were the responsibility of the &quot;Classis Pannonia&quot;. Units of the legions, naval and auxiliary forces were commanded by the respective governors. In late antiquity – according to &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; – four newly established flotillas undertook this task. From the 3rd century, the Norian &quot;comitatenses&quot;, &quot;ripenses&quot; and &quot;liburnari&quot; were under the command of two generals:

* &quot;Comes Illyrici&quot;
* &quot;Dux Pannoniae Primae et Norici Ripensis&quot;
=== Pannonia ===
This stretch of &quot;limes&quot; was in use from the 1st to the 5th centuries AD and helped to guard the provinces of:

* &quot;Pannonia inferior&quot;
* &quot;Pannonia&quot;

The Pannonian Limes is situated on the territory of present-day Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. Although this section of the frontier was relatively well protected by the Danube river border or &quot;Ripa&quot;, the Roman military presence here was always exceptionally strong (three military camps in Pannonia, but only one in Lower Pannonia) because especially after the abandonment of &quot;Roman Dacia&quot; in the late 3rd century, the pressure of migrant peoples from the east on this section of the &quot;limes&quot; intensified. The tributaries emptying into the Danube offered cheap transport routes, but also made good approach routes for invaders and raiders. The military camps were therefore built by the most important fords or confluences and road termini. The legion- and auxilia camps were mainly located in the immediate vicinity of the riverbank. The initial wood and earth structures, were systematically converted under Emperor Hadrian into stone barracks and, in the 4th century, redesigned and massively strengthened in order to match new strategic requirements. The gaps between the camps were closed by a chain of watchtowers or signal towers. In late Roman times huge inland camps were built and towns in the hinterland were fortified to create a second line of defence. In addition, at vulnerable points, units of the Danube fleet were stationed. In the time of Emperor Marcus Aurelius the first mention is made in Pannonia of stone watchtowers (&quot;burgi&quot;, panelled towers and fortlets (&quot;praesidia&quot;). In late antiquity, the Pannonian military district was divided into two parts (&quot;pars inferior&quot; and &quot;pars superior&quot;). Advance defences were provided by bridgehead camps (e.g. &quot;Castra Contra Aquincum&quot; or &quot;Celemantia&quot;) and military stations on main transport routes in the &quot;Barbaricum&quot; (e.g. near Musov).
=== Lower Danube === 
== In Africa ==
At the greatest extent of the Roman Empire, the southern border lay along the deserts of Arabia in the Middle East (see History of the Romans in Arabia) and the Sahara in North Africa, which represented a natural barrier against expansion. The Empire controlled the Mediterranean shores and the mountain ranges further inland. The Romans attempted twice to occupy the Siwa Oasis and finally used Siwa as a place of banishment. However Romans controlled the Nile many miles into Africa up to the modern border between Egypt and Sudan.

In Africa Romans controlled the area north of the Sahara, from the Atlantic Ocean to Egypt, with many sections of limes (Limes Tripolitanus, Limes Numidiae, etc.).

The &quot;Fossatum Africae&quot; (&quot;African ditch&quot;) of at least 750 km controlled the southern borders of the Empire and had many similarities of construction to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

There are similar, but shorter, &quot;fossatae&quot; in other parts of North Africa. Between the Matmata and Tabaga ranges in modern Tunisia there is a &quot;fossatum&quot; which was duplicated during World War II. There also appears to be a 20 km &quot;fossatum&quot; at Bou Regreg, in Morocco, although this would not have been within the scope of the proclamation of the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; because at that time the province was not in Africa, administratively speaking.

In the south of Mauritania Tingitana the frontier in the third century lay just north of Casablanca near Sala and stretched to Volubilis.

Septimius Severus expanded the &quot;Limes Tripolitanus&quot; dramatically, even briefly holding a military presence in the Garamantian capital Garama in 203 AD. Much of the initial campaigning success was achieved by Quintus Anicius Faustus, the legate of Legio III Augusta.

Following his African conquests, the Roman Empire may have reached its greatest extent during the reign of Septimius Severus, under whom the empire encompassed an area of 2 million square miles ( million square kilometers).

=== Fossatum Africae ===

Fossatum Africae (&quot;African ditch&quot;) is a linear defensive structure (&quot;limes&quot;) that extended over 750 km or more in northern Africa constructed during the Roman Empire to defend and control the southern borders of the Empire in the Roman province of Africa. It is considered to have many similarities of construction to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall at the northern border of the Empire in Britain.
Generally the Fossatum consists of a ditch and earth embankments on either side using the material from the ditch. Sometimes the embankments are supplemented by dry stone walls on one or both sides; rarely, there are stone walls without a ditch. The width of the Fossatum is generally 3–6 m but in exceptional cases may be as much as 20 m. Wherever possible, it or its highest wall is constructed on the counterscarp.
Excavations near Gemellae showed the depth there to be 2–3 m, with a width of 1 m at the bottom widening to 2–3 m at the top.

The Fossatum is accompanied by many small watchtowers and numerous forts, often built within sight of one another.

== In Asia == 
The Limes Arabicus was the frontier of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, facing the desert. It runs from the Gulf of Aqaba to northern Syria, for about 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) at its greatest extent

==Post-Roman &quot;limites&quot;==
The &quot;Limes Saxoniae&quot; in Holstein was established in 810 AD, long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Charlemagne considered his empire (later called the Carolingian Empire) as the true successor to the Roman Empire and called himself &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;. Official edicts were issued in Latin, which affected the naming of the Empire&#x27;s frontier as well.

==In fiction==
*The novel series &quot;Romanike&quot; is set at the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot; in the decades until the first assault of Germanic peoples in 161 AD.
*&quot;Roman Wall: A Novel&quot;, by Winifred Bryher is set in 265 during the Limesfall.

<text>BoPET (biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate) is a polyester film made from stretched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and is used for its high tensile strength, chemical stability, dimensional stability, transparency reflectivity, and electrical insulation. When metallized, it has gas and moisture barrier properties. The film is &quot;biaxially oriented&quot;, which means that the polymer chains are oriented parallel to the plane of the film, and therefore oriented in two axes. A variety of companies manufacture boPET and other polyester films under different brand names. In the UK and US, the best-known trade names are Mylar, Melinex, Lumirror and Hostaphan. It was the first biaxially oriented polymer to be manufactured on a mass commercial scale.

== History ==
BoPET film was developed in the mid-1950s, originally by DuPont, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), and Hoechst.

In 1953 Buckminster Fuller used Mylar as a skin for a geodesic dome, which he built with students at the University of Oregon.

In 1955 Eastman Kodak used Mylar as a support for photographic film and called it &quot;ESTAR Base&quot;. The very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range U-2 reconnaissance flights.

In 1964, NASA launched Echo II, a diameter balloon constructed from a thick mylar film sandwiched between two layers of thick aluminium foil bonded together.

== Manufacture and properties ==

The manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being extruded onto a chill roll, which quenches it into the amorphous state. It is then biaxially oriented by drawing. The most common way of doing this is the sequential process, in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction, i.e., orthogonally to the direction of travel, in a heated oven. It is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously, although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate. Draw ratios are typically around 3 to 4 in each direction.

Once the drawing is completed, the film is &quot;heat set&quot; and crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above . The heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane. The orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented PET film, which has a typical Young&#x27;s modulus of about . Another important consequence of the molecular orientation is that it induces the formation of many crystal nuclei. The crystallites that grow rapidly reach the boundary of the neighboring crystallite and remain smaller than the wavelength of visible light. As a result, biaxially oriented PET film has excellent clarity, despite its semicrystalline structure.

If it were produced without any additives, the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up, similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked. To make handling possible, microscopic inert inorganic particles, such as silicon dioxide, are usually embedded in the PET to roughen the surface of the film.

Biaxially oriented PET film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium, gold, or other metal onto it. The result is much less permeable to gases (important in food packaging) and reflects up to 99% of light, including much of the infrared spectrum. For some applications like food packaging, the aluminized boPET film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene, which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance. The polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the boPET side shiny. Other coatings, such as conductive indium tin oxide (ITO), can be applied to boPET film by sputter deposition.

== Applications ==

Uses for boPET polyester films include, but are not limited to:

=== Flexible packaging and food contact ===

* Laminates containing metallized boPET foil (in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss, achieving long shelf life. Examples are coffee &quot;foil&quot; packaging and pouches for convenience foods.
*Pop-Tarts are sold in pairs wrapped in silver boPET. They were previously wrapped in foil.
* White boPET web substrate is used as lidding for dairy goods such as yogurt.
* Clear boPET web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals. Due to its excellent heat resistance, it can remain on the package during microwave or oven heating.
* Roasting bags
* Metallised films
* Laminated sheet metal (aluminium or steel) used in the manufacture of cans (bisphenol A-free alternative to lacquers)

===Covering over paper===
* A clear overlay on a map, on which notations, additional data, or copied data, can be drawn without damaging the map
* Metallized boPET is used as a mirror-like decorative surface on some book covers, T-shirts, and other flexible cloths.
* Protective covering over buttons/pins/badges
* The glossy top layer of a Polaroid SX-70 photographic print
* As a backing for very fine sandpaper
* boPET film is used in bagging comic books, in order to best protect them during storage from environmental conditions (moisture, heat, and cold) that would otherwise cause paper to slowly deteriorate over time. This material is used for archival quality storage of documents by the Library of Congress (Mylar type D, ICI Melinex 516 or equivalent) and several major library comic book research collections, including the Comic Art Collection at Michigan State University. While boPET is widely (and effectively) used in this archival sense, it is not immune to the effects of fire and heat and could potentially melt, depending on the intensity of the heat source, causing further damage to the encased item.
* Similarly, trading card decks (such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;) are packaged in pouches or sleeves made of metallized boPET. It can also be used to make the holographic artwork featured on some cards, typically known as &quot;holos&quot;, &quot;foils&quot;, &quot;shinies&quot;, or &quot;holofoils&quot;.
*For protecting the spine of important documents, such as medical records.

===Insulating material===
* An electrical insulating material
* Insulation for houses and tents, reflecting thermal radiation
* Five layers of metallized boPET film in NASA&#x27;s spacesuits make them radiation resistant and help regulate temperature.
* Metallized boPET film emergency blankets conserve a shock victim&#x27;s body heat.
* As a thin strip to form an airtight seal between the control surfaces and adjacent structure of aircraft, especially gliders.
* Light insulation for indoor gardening.
* Aluminized proximity suits used by fire fighters for protection from the high amount of heat release from fuel fires.
* Used in sock and glove liners to lock in warmth
* Gasketing material in fuel cells and related devices

===Solar, marine, and aviation===
* Metallized boPET is intended to be used for solar sails as an alternative means of propulsion for spacecraft such as Cosmos 1
* Translucent Mylar film, as wide as 48&quot; and in up to 12&#x27; in length, found widespread use as a non-dimensional engineering drawing media in the aerospace industry due to its dimensional stability (also see Printing Media section below). This allows production and engineering staff to lay manufactured parts directly over or under the drawing film in order to verify the fidelity of part profiles, hole locations and other part features.
* Metallized boPET solar curtains reflect sunlight and heat away from windows.
* Aluminized, as an inexpensive solar eclipse viewer, although care must be taken, because invisible fissures can form in the metal film, reducing its effectiveness.
* High performance sails for sailboats, hang gliders, paragliders and kites
* Use boPET films as the back face of the PV modules in solar panels
* Metallized boPET as a reflector material for solar cooking stoves
* To bridge control surface gaps on sailplanes (gliders), reducing profile drag

===Science===
* Amateur and professional visual and telescopic solar filters. BoPET films are often annealed to a glass element to improve thermal conductivity, and guarantee the necessary flat surface needed for even telescopic solar observation. Manufacturers will typically use films with thicknesses of , in order to give the films better resilience. thickness films with a heavy aluminium coating are generally preferred for naked-eye Solar observation during eclipses.
* Films in annular ring mounts on gas-tight cells, will readily deform into spherical mirrors. Photomultiplier cosmic-ray observatories often make use of these mirrors for inexpensive large (1.0 m and above), lightweight mirror surfaces for sky-sector low and medium energy cosmic ray research.
* As a light diaphragm material separating gases in hypersonic shock and expansion tube facilities.
* As a beamsplitter in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, typically with laser applications. Film thicknesses are often in the 500 micrometre range.
* Coating around hematocrit tubes.
* Insulating material for a cryocooler radiation shield.
* As a window material to confine gas in detectors and targets in nuclear physics.
* In CT scanners it acts as a physical barrier between the X-ray tube, detector ring and the patient allowing negligible attenuation of the X-ray beam when active.
* Spacecraft are insulated with a metallized BoPET film.
* The descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module was covered with BoPET to control the temperature of equipment for lunar exploration carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly.

===Electronic and acoustic===
* Carrier for flexible printed circuits.
* BoPET film is often used as the diaphragm material in headphones, electrostatic loudspeakers and microphones.
* BoPET film has been used in the production of banjos and drumheads since 1958 due to its durability and acoustical properties when stretched over the bearing edge of the drum. They are made in single- and double-ply versions, with each ply being in thickness, with a transparent or opaque surface, originally used by the company Evans.
* BoPET film is used as the substrate in practically all magnetic recording tapes and floppy disks.
* Metallized boPET film, along with other plastic films, is used as a dielectric in foil capacitors.
* Clear boPET bags are used as packaging for audio media such as compact discs and vinyl records.
* Clear and white boPET films are used as core layers and overlays in smart cards.

===Printing media===
* Before the widespread adoption of computer aided design (CAD), engineering drawings or architectural drawings were plotted onto sheets of boPET film, known as drafting film. The boPET sheets become legal documents from which copies or blueprints are made. boPET sheets are more durable and can withstand more handling than bond paper. Although &quot;blueprint&quot; duplication has fallen out of use, mylar is still used for its archival properties, typically as a record set of plans for building departments to keep on file.
* Overhead transparency film for photocopiers or laser printers (boPET film withstands the high heat).
* Modern lithography printing plates aka &quot;Pronto Plates&quot; (boPET resists oil)

===Other===
* Balloons, metallic balloons
* Route information signs, called rollsigns or destination blinds, displayed by public transport vehicles
* For materials in kites
* Covering glass to decrease probability of shattering
* In theatre effects such as confetti
* As the adhesive strip to attach the string to a teabag
* One of the many materials used as windsavers or valves for valved harmonicas
* On farmland and domestic gardens, highly reflective aluminized PET film ribbons are used to keep birds away from plants
* Measuring tape
* Protecting pinball machine playfields from wear
* Used in dentistry when restoring teeth with composite
* In nail polish, as a coloured and finely shredded additive to create a glitter effect
* NumismaticsStoring coins for long periods of time. PVC was previously used for this, but over long periods of time PVC can release chlorine, which reacts with the silver and copper in coins. BoPET does not have this problem.
* In fishing fly tying, metallized Mylar strips are sometimes wound around the hook shank for reflective striping or shimmer in certain patterns.
* Military uniform accoutrements are often accented by gold mylar, such as shoulder epaulets or shoulder knots. For example: US Army Officer&#x27;s Mess Dress Uniform.

<doc id="172931" wikidata="Q45727" url="?curid=172931" title="Ignition (The Offspring album)">
<text>Ignition is the second studio album by American punk rock band the Offspring, released on October 16, 1992, by Epitaph Records. Issued during the alternative rock and grunge era, the album brought the band small success in Southern California as they started to gather a following. This success would continue to grow with their next album, &quot;Smash&quot; (1994).

&quot;Ignition&quot; was certified gold on January 22, 1996, nearly two years after the release of &quot;Smash&quot;, and has sold over one million copies worldwide. For the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2012, The Offspring played &quot;Ignition&quot; in its entirety for some selected concerts. They also performed the album in 2017 at a benefit concert for 924 Gilman Street.

The band re-recorded &quot;Ignition&quot;&#x27;s sixth track &quot;Dirty Magic&quot; for their ninth studio album &quot;Days Go By&quot;, released twenty years later.

==Background and recording==
In 1991, The Offspring teamed up with producer Thom Wilson to record the &quot;Baghdad&quot; 7-inch EP. This EP was instrumental to the band&#x27;s signing with Epitaph Records. Wilson had been trying to get The Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that &quot;The Offspring&quot; was just not quite pronounced enough for his label, but &quot;Baghdad&quot; convinced him to give the band a shot. Thanks to the success of &quot;Baghdad&quot;, The Offspring managed to record their second full-length album. The band entered two recording studios, Westbeach Recorders and Track Record, in June 1992 to record &quot;Ignition&quot;, in a similar fashion to the production schedule for &quot;The Offspring&quot; and &quot;Baghdad&quot;, which were both recorded in just one month (March 1989 and February 1991 respectively).

Some of the material (including &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, which was originally recorded in 1991 for a Flipside magazine compilation, &quot;The Big One&quot;, and &quot;Get It Right&quot;, which appeared on &quot;Baghdad&quot;) are updated versions of songs that were recorded around &quot;The Offspring&quot;/&quot;Baghdad&quot;-era. The album also had one outtake, &quot;Mission from God&quot;, which was later slightly remixed and then released on the compilation album &quot;Punk-O-Rama Vol. 10&quot; in 2005. &quot;Mission from God&quot; was then released as a bonus download when &quot;Ignition&quot; was reissued on vinyl, albeit in its original 1992 mix.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Ignition&quot; was released through Epitaph Records on October 16, 1992. Like their self-titled debut album, &quot;Ignition&quot; did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; however, The Offspring began to gather small success in the Southern region of California, mainly the areas of San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles, and spent a-year-and-a-half touring relentlessly behind the album. Although no videos were released for &quot;Ignition&quot;, &quot;Kick Him When He&#x27;s Down&quot; was released as an airplay-only single in 1995. &quot;Ignition&quot; was certified Gold on January 22, 1996, nearly two years after the release of &quot;Smash&quot;.

The album has received generally favorable reviews in the years since its initial release, with several reviewers having deemed &quot;Ignition&quot; one of The Offspring&#x27;s best albums. In October 2011, the album was ranked number two (between Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot; and Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Generator&quot;) on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.

On June 17, 2008, Epitaph re-released &quot;Ignition&quot; (along with &quot;Smash&quot;) in remastered form. This reissue was released on the same day as then-current album &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot;.

==Touring and promotion==
The Offspring toured for a-year-and-a-half to promote &quot;Ignition&quot;. Their audience continued to hone, supporting such bands as Youth Brigade, The Vandals, Bad Religion, D.I., Guttermouth, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Glue Gun, Momentum, Final Conflict, Face to Face, Pennywise, Rancid, Unwritten Law, RKL, Untrust, Cadillac Tramps and Korn. The Offspring then managed to secure a slot in three major tours in 1993. They opened for NOFX on their &quot;White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean&quot; tour, and in that summer, the band supported Lunachicks and Iceburn. After the tour ended, The Offspring took a break and went back into the studio to record their third album &quot;Smash&quot;. In early 1994, The Offspring landed the opening slot for Pennywise on their &quot;Unknown Road&quot; tour. The &quot;Ignition&quot; tour ended on April 1, 1994, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, just one week before the release of &quot;Smash&quot;.

<doc id="172932" wikidata="Q2420628" url="?curid=172932" title="Prescott, Ontario">
<text>Prescott is a town on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River in province of Ontario, Canada. The town is a part of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. In 2021, it had a population of 4,078. The Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge, east of Prescott at Johnstown, crosses the Canada–United States border and connects the town with the city of Ogdensburg, New York.

Prescott was founded in the early 19th century by Edward Jessup, a Loyalist soldier during the American Revolution, who named the village after a former Governor-in-Chief, Robert Prescott. Before 1834, the town was a part of Augusta township; however, in that year, the town became a police village and severed its ties with Augusta. The land here was ideal for settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries as it was situated between Montreal and Kingston along the St. Lawrence River at the head of the rapids.

==History==
===French period===

Before the arrival of Europeans to the Grenville County area, it was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquois. The French began occupation of the area in the late 17th century, starting with a supply depot and fortified outpost named La Galette en route to Fort Frontenac (Kingston), which was built in the 1670s. Some sources place La Galette at Prescott, while others place it at neighbouring Johnstown. Fort de La Présentation was later built in 1749 on the other side of the river, at Lighthouse Point near present-day Ogdensburg, New York. This was soon abandoned in favour of Fort Lévis, which was located on Isle Royale (Chimney Island) in the centre of the river.

The area became a battleground during the 1754−1763 French and Indian War between Britain and France, as both parties wanted to control what was a strategic stretch of the Saint Lawrence River. This led to the 1760 Battle of the Thousand Islands when a 10,000-strong British–Iroquois force besieged the French at Fort Lévis. Despite a spirited defence by the 300-strong French garrison, the British took the fort after an extensive artillery bombardment. Afterward, the British occupied the fort, renaming it Fort William Augustus, though they soon abandoned it in favour of the older Fort de La Présentation, which they renamed Fort Oswegatchie. The ruins of Fort Lévis, and the island the fort stood on, were later submerged during the creation of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

===Arrival of the Loyalists===

British settlement in the area began with a group of United Empire Loyalists led by Edward Jessup. During the American Revolutionary War, Jessup fought with the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York and later led his own Loyal Rangers, which served in a defensive capacity along the Saint Lawrence. After the war, members of the regiment were resettled in what would later become Eastern Ontario. Jessup, his son, and their followers settled in Augusta and Edwardsburgh townships. Johnstown in Edwardsburgh Township was an initial landing place and was the town site to be settled in 1789. In 1792, it was briefly the administrative seat for the Eastern District before a more permanent administration was established at New Johnstown (now Cornwall); later, it was the seat of the eponymous Johnstown District before again losing its position, this time to Elizabethtown (Brockville). In 1796, provisions of the Jay Treaty led to a British evacuation from Fort Oswegatchie, as the land had legally become a part of the United States. Within months, this area was soon occupied by American settlers, who named it Ogdensburgh (later Ogdensburg) after Samuel Ogden, a prominent landowner and speculator.

===Fort Wellington===
In 1810, Jessup and his son laid out a townsite within Augusta Township near Johnstown, which they named Prescott in honour of General Robert Prescott, who had been governor-in-chief in The Canadas and had participated in British campaigns in the area, being the aide-de-camp tasked with delivering the news of the fall of Fort Lévis fifty years earlier. Jessup began to take the first steps toward building a concentrated settlement by constructing a log schoolhouse along with a teacher&#x27;s residence, which was built from stone. With the outbreak of the War of 1812, American troops began using Ogdensburg and Fort Oswegatchie as a base to raid settlements in Upper Canada. Soon, the two Jessup home plots were expropriated by the British Army for use as barracks. The army also later constructed a purpose-built fort, which was named Fort Wellington. The fort served its intended purpose of impeding American use of the Saint Lawrence for military purposes and was never directly attacked. Following the end of the war, the fort was soon abandoned and began to deteriorate.

During the Upper Canada Rebellion, Fort Wellington was repaired and reactivated. It became the main supply base for government forces in the region, which made it a tempting military target. In 1838, a group of Hunter Patriots attempted to land at Prescott, hoping to use Fort Wellington as a beachhead for an invasion of Upper Canada. They were repelled by the town militia and fled downriver, then landed at the small hamlet of Newport, which afforded them a strong defensive position dominated by a large stone windmill. The Battle of the Windmill ensued, leading to the defeat of the Hunter Patriot group.

===Transport industry===
Prescott&#x27;s harbour developed considerably in the early 19th century, supporting the growing Great Lakes shipping industry. It became notable for its freight forwarding businesses, as local forwarders shuttled Great Lakes freight between Prescott and Montreal. This was commemorated at the Forwarders&#x27; Museum, which was housed in a building originally constructed in the 1820s by local forwarder William Gilkinson.

By the mid-19th century, however, the forwarding industry began to decline. Navigability of the Saint Lawrence had improved, allowing more Great Lakes ships to reach Montreal directly. Soon, Upper Canada experienced a railway boom, which provided competition for the maritime shipping industry. The Bytown and Prescott Railway began operating in 1854, connecting Prescott to Bytown (now Ottawa). This was followed by the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway mainline between Toronto and Montreal, which connected to the Bytown and Prescott Railway at Prescott Junction. With parallel railway development occurring across the river in Ogdensburg, railway car ferry services began between the two towns, which later evolved into the Canadian Pacific Car and Passenger Transfer Company. Freight traffic declined abruptly during the Great Depression, though a recovery took place after the outbreak of the Second World War. Traffic volumes slowly declined again after the war, and ferry service ended entirely in the early 1970s.

===Project Jericho===

Project Jericho, which was one of the largest and most highly publicized sexual abuse investigations in Canada, took place in the 1980s–1990s and focused on a case of multi-generational child sexual abuse in Prescott, which was &quot;staggering in its reach and its routine violation of hundreds of victims.&quot; When the investigation concluded, the total victim count was 275 (including 113 adults who disclosed that they were abused as children), and the total perpetrator count was 119. The case was sensationalized as an example of Satanic ritual abuse, though it was never linked to a satanic cult, but rather, &quot;a group of adults of limited intelligence who lived on the margins of society.&quot; Many of both the perpetrators and the victims were developmentally disabled. By 1994, of the cases which went to trial, the conviction rate was . However, the Prescott case bears many similarities to other instances of &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; that happened in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Demographics==

==St Lawrence Shakespeare Festival==

The St Lawrence Shakespeare Festival (SLSF) runs annually in Prescott, Ontario, in July and August, attracting thousands of audience members each season. SLSF contracts professional actors through the Canadian Actors Equity Association, is a member of PACT (the Professional Association of Canadian Theatres), and is a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association. The offerings of the Festival are based on two mainstage shows that run from mid-July to mid-August (often, but not always, both plays by Shakespeare) as well as additional productions that are presented in shorter runs of fewer performances.

== Cemeteries ==

Prescott contains two cemeteries, Prescott Cemetery (known as Sandy Hill) and St. Mark&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery. Prescott Cemetery is located along Edward Street across from South Grenville District High School and is one of the oldest burying grounds in the area. The land for this cemetery was given to the town in 1830, in Edward Jessup III&#x27;s will, which stated the area then known as Sand Hill was to become a “burial ground for the different churches in the town of Prescott.”. Prior to becoming the town&#x27;s cemetery, the area was already used as a burial ground for the Jessup family. The earliest-known burial was that of Susannah Jessup&#x27;s father, who died in 1798. Edward Jessup I, the original recipient of the land here, was also buried in the cemetery early in 1816. Along the south side of the front of the cemetery are many unmarked graves of pioneers who died of cholera. In 1929, the cemetery was expanded, and the entrance gates were added. In 1967, the stone steps leading up the hill to the Jessup family graves were placed. This cemetery is still in use today.

The Roman Catholics of Prescott were initially buried in Prescott Cemetery, which had a reserved area specifically for Roman Catholic burials. During the 1850s, the Roman Catholic community desired to have their own cemetery. In 1859, a local reverend bought land from a resident for $1 for this specific purpose. Additional such land was purchased in 1875. This cemetery is located north of the 401 on the west side of County Road 18 and is known as St. Mark&#x27;s Cemetery. The older, back section of the cemetery was blessed in 1860, and the newer part in 1935. The earliest legible tombstone in the cemetery dates to before the land was purchased and belonged to Thomas Allen, who died in 1845. This cemetery is also currently still in use.

== Churches ==

Currently, Prescott contains six churches, all of which are still in operation. The town includes a Presbyterian, Anglican, Roman Catholic, United, Pentecostal and an Evangelist church. The Pentecostal church, called Seaway Christian Church, is located on Churchill Road and the Evangelist church, called Harvest Church, is located on Edward Street; services are currently held in these churches regularly.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian church is located on the corner of Centre and Dibble Street in Prescott. The first St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian, located on the same site as the current church, was constructed in 1821 and dedicated in 1822. The first church was a frame structure built on land donated by Susannah Jessup. This church was replaced in 1850 by a stone church, which burned in 1892. The present building that replaced it was constructed in 1893. Prior to this church, the Presbyterian congregation met in the schoolhouse at the corner of West and King Street. St. Andrew&#x27;s is still in use today.

St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church in Prescott is located at the corner of James and Centre Street. The original St. John&#x27;s Church on this site was a frame building constructed in 1821. The land for the church was donated by Susannah Jessup. The present church, which is still in use, was constructed in 1860 in a Gothic style to replace the original frame building. Some parts of the building are currently being renovated into apartments.

The Roman Catholic church, known as St. Mark&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, was built in the 1830s on land purchased from the Jessup family. Prior to its construction, a Roman Catholic priest served the area out of homes or community buildings. The present church stands in the exact location as the original St. Mark&#x27;s on Dibble Street.

Currently, St. Paul&#x27;s United Church is located on George Street; however, the former site of St. Paul&#x27;s United Church was on Dibble Street, near St. Mark&#x27;s church. Between 1854 and 1856, the Wesleyan Methodist congregation in Prescott planned, financed and erected their own church. This church became known as St. Paul&#x27;s United Church. On July 28, 1979, the church was burned beyond repair and demolished. Sometime after the fire, a new St. Paul&#x27;s United Church was built to serve the congregation; this school is still used today.

<doc id="172933" wikidata="Q2304163" url="?curid=172933" title="Transportation Security Administration">
<text>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that has authority over the security of transportation systems within and connecting to the United States. It was created as a response to the September 11 attacks to improve airport security procedures and consolidate air travel security under a combined federal law enforcement and regulatory agency.

The TSA develops key policies to protect the U.S. transportation system, including highways, railroads, bus networks, mass transit systems, ports, pipelines, and intermodal freight facilities. It fulfills this mission in conjunction with other federal, state, local and foreign government partners. However, the TSA&#x27;s primary mission is airport security and the prevention of aircraft hijacking. It is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports, employing screening officers, explosives detection dog handlers, and bomb technicians in airports, and armed Federal Air Marshals and Federal Flight Deck Officers on aircraft.

At first a part of the Department of Transportation, the TSA became part of DHS in March 2003 and is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia. As of the fiscal year 2023, the TSA operated on a budget of approximately $9.70 billion and employed over 47,000 Transportation Security Officers, Transportation Security Specialists, Federal Air Marshals, and other security personnel.

The TSA has screening processes and regulations related to passengers and checked and carry-on luggage, including identification verification, pat-downs, full-body scanners, and explosives screening. Since its inception, the agency has been subject to criticism and controversy regarding the effectiveness of various procedures, as well as incidents of baggage theft, data security, and allegations of prejudicial treatment towards certain ethnic groups. Undercover tests conducted by the Department of Homeland Security have shown that the TSA&#x27;s failure rate frequently ranges between 80% and 95%.

==History and mission==

The TSA was created largely in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which revealed weaknesses in existing airport security procedures. At the time, a myriad of private security companies managed air travel security under contract to individual airlines or groups of airlines that used a given airport or terminal facility. Proponents of placing the government in charge of airport security, including Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, argued that only a single federal agency could best protect passenger aviation.

Congress agreed, and authorized the creation of the TSA in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. Bush nominated John Magaw on December 10, and he was confirmed by the Senate the following January. The agency was initially placed under the United States Department of Transportation but was moved to the Department of Homeland Security when that department was formed on March 9, 2003.

The new agency&#x27;s effort to hire screeners to begin operating security checkpoints at airports represents a case of a large-scale staffing project completed over a short period. The only effort in U.S. history that came close to it was the testing of recruits for the armed forces in World War II. During the period from February to December 2002, 1.7 million applicants were assessed for 55,000 screening jobs.

==Administration and organization==
=== Leadership ===
When TSA was part of the Department of Transportation, the head of the agency was referred to as the Undersecretary of Transportation for Security. Following the move to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003, the position was reclassified as the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.

There have been seven administrators and six acting administrators in the TSA&#x27;s 19-year history. Several have come to the job after previously serving as Coast Guard flag officers, including Loy, Neffenger, and Pekoske.

Following the passage of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which included a provision known as the TSA Modernization Act, the administrator&#x27;s term was set as a five-year term retroactive to the start of current Administrator David Pekoske&#x27;s term. It also made the deputy administrator a politically appointed position.
===Organizational structure===
At the helm of the TSA is the Administrator, who leads the organization&#x27;s efforts in safeguarding the nation&#x27;s airports, railways, seaports, and other critical transportation infrastructure. Assisting the Administrator is a Deputy Administrator, whose role is to provide support and guidance in executing the agency&#x27;s mission. In addition, the TSA benefits from the expertise and leadership of several Deputy Assistant Administrators and other executive officers, who contribute their knowledge and skills to various aspects of the agency&#x27;s operations. Together, this structured leadership team forms the backbone of the TSA, working collectively to uphold and enhance the security of the nation&#x27;s transportation networks. The Executive Assistant Administrator for Law Enforcement is also the executive director of the Federal Air Marshal Service.

=== Airport-level rank insignias ===
===New headquarters===
In August 2017, the General Services Administration announced a new headquarters for the TSA would be built in Springfield, Virginia. The new, 625,000-square-foot headquarters was built near the outskirts of Fort Belvoir and the Franconia-Springfield Metro station, and cost $316 million.

=== Insignia ===

On September 11, 2018, TSA adopted a new flag representing its core values and founding principles. The design features a white, graphically stylized American eagle sitting centrally located inside rings of red and white against a field of blue, with its dynamically feathered wings outstretched in a pose signifying protection, vigilance, and commitment. The eagle&#x27;s wings, which break through the red and white containment rings, indicate freedom of movement. There are nine stars and 11 rays emanating out from the top of the eagle to reference September 11. There is also a representation of land (roads) and sea which is representative of the modes of transportation.

==Operations==

The center for operations is located at the Freedom Center in Herndon, Virginia and was built in 2003.

=== Finances ===
For fiscal year 2020, the TSA had a budget of roughly $7.68 billion.
Part of the TSA budget comes from a $5.60 per-passenger fee, also known as the September 11 Security Fee, for each one-way air-travel trip originating in the United States, not to exceed $11.20 per round-trip. In 2020, this passenger fee totaled $2.4 billion or roughly 32% of the budget allocated by Congress that year.

Additionally, a small portion of TSA&#x27;s budget comes from the loose change and small denomination cash left behind by travelers at airport security checkpoints, which TSA has been allowed to retain since 2005 under Section 44945 of title 49, United States Code. From FY 2008 through FY 2018, a total of $6,904,035.98 has been left behind, including a record $960,105.49 in FY 2018. In fiscal year 2019, $926,030.44 was unclaimed.

=== Airport screening ===
Private screening did not disappear entirely under the TSA, which allows airports to opt-out of the federal screening and hire firms to do the job instead. Such firms must still get TSA approval under its Screening Partnership Program (SPP) and follow TSA procedures. Among the handful of U.S. airports with privately operated checkpoints are San Francisco International Airport, Kansas City International Airport, Greater Rochester International Airport, Tupelo Regional Airport, Key West International Airport, and Charles M. Schulz–Sonoma County Airport.
However, the bulk of airport screening in the U.S. is done by the TSA&#x27;s 46,661 (as of FY 2018) Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).
 They examine passengers and their baggage, and perform other security duties within airports, including controlling entry and exit points, and monitoring the areas near their checkpoints.

=== Employees ===

Among the types of TSA employees are:
===Uniforms===
In 2008, TSA officers began wearing new uniforms that have a royal blue duty shirt, dark blue (almost black) pants, and black belt. The first airport to introduce the new uniforms was Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Starting on September 11, 2008, all TSOs began wearing the new uniform. One stripe on the outer edge of each shoulder board denotes a TSO, two stripes a Lead TSO, and three a Supervisory TSO.

Officers are issued badges and shoulder boards after completing a trainee period including 3-week academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.

=== Personnel system and pay ===
The personnel system used by TSA was originally based on the FAA&#x27;s personnel system.

Unlike a majority of the federal government, TSA employees are not on the General Schedule pay system. Instead, a pay band system with performance-based increases was used.

In June 2021, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas issued a memorandum which directed the TSA Administrator among other items to pay employees &quot;at a level that is no less than that of their counterparts on the General Schedule pay scale.&quot; It also directed that TSOs be offered expanded collective bargaining rights mirroring Title 5 of the United States Code, and appeals of adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board.

In July 2023, a new pay system mirroring the General Schedule was introduced following appropriations made by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. For TSOs, the career ladder begins at the D band and progresses to F band. Lead TSOs and supervisory TSOs are at the F and G band levels. Career ladders are also being worked on for non-TSOs.

In 2011, former Administrator John Pistole granted limited collective bargaining rights to Transportation Security Officers following a union election between to federal employee unions, the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union. In May 2024, an expanded collective bargaining agreement with a 7-year term was signed between TSA and AFGE.

===Incidents===
====2013 Los Angeles airport shooting====

On Friday, November 1, 2013, TSA officer Gerardo I. Hernandez, age 39, was shot and killed by a lone gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport. Law enforcement officials identified the suspect as 23-year-old Paul Anthony Ciancia, who was shot and wounded by law enforcement officers before being taken into custody. Ciancia was wearing fatigues and carrying a bag containing a hand-written note that said he &quot;wanted to kill TSA and pigs&quot;. Hernandez was the first TSA officer to be killed in the line of duty.

====2015 New Orleans airport attack====
On March 21, 2015, 63-year-old Richard White entered the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport armed with six Molotov cocktails, a gasoline lighter, and a machete. White began assaulting passengers and Transportation Security Administration officers by spraying them with a can of wasp killer, then started swinging his machete. A TSA agent blocked the machete with a piece of luggage, as White ran through a metal detector. A Jefferson Parish deputy sheriff shot and killed White as he was chasing a TSA officer with his machete.

==== COVID-19 pandemic in the United States ====
TSA continued working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, TSA cumulatively had 4,978 federal employees test positive for COVID-19: 4,219 of those employees recovered, and 12 died as a result of the virus.

==Screening processes and regulations==
===Passenger and carry-on screening===

====Identification requirements====
The TSA requires passengers 18 and older to show a valid ID at the security checkpoint before boarding their flight. Valid forms of identification include passports from the U.S. or a foreign government, state or tribal-issued photo identification, or military ID. Passengers that do not have ID are often still allowed to fly if their identity can be verified through alternate means satisfying a certificate of identity.

===== REAL ID requirements =====
Passed by Congress in 2005, the Real ID Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver&#x27;s licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies, like TSA, from accepting licenses and identification cards for official purposes from states that do not meet these standards. Implementation has been deferred for over a decade by DHS, and enforcement has never begun.

====== Current list of acceptable IDs ======
* Federally recognized:
** Driver&#x27;s licenses, enhanced driver&#x27;s licenses or other photo identity cards issued by U.S. state or territorial Departments of Motor Vehicles.
** Tribal photo identification issued by a tribe federally recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
** Canadian provincial or territorial driver&#x27;s licence, photo card or Indigenous Services Canada card

Passenger names are compared against the No Fly List, a list of about 21,000 names () of suspected terrorists who are not allowed to board. Passenger names are also compared against a longer list of selectees; passengers whose names match names from this list receive a more thorough screening before being potentially allowed to board. The effectiveness of the lists has been criticized on the basis of errors in how those lists are maintained, for concerns that the lists are unconstitutional, and for its ineffectiveness at stopping Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to detonate plastic explosives in his underwear, from boarding an aircraft.
At the airport security checkpoint, passengers are screened to ensure they are not carrying prohibited items. These include most sorts of sharp objects, many sporting goods such as baseball bats and hockey sticks, guns or other weapons, many sorts of tools, flammable liquids (except for conventional lighters), many forms of chemicals and paint. In addition, passengers are limited to of almost any liquid or gel, which must be presented at the checkpoint in a clear, one-quart zip-top bag. These restrictions on liquids were a reaction to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot.

The number of passengers who have been detected bringing firearms onto airplanes in their carry-on bags has increased in recent years, from 976 in 2009 to 4,239 in 2018, according to the TSA. Indeed, a new record high for firearms found in carry-on bags has been set every year since 2008. In 2010 an anonymous source told ABC News that undercover agents managed to bring weapons through security nearly 70 percent of the time at some major airports. Firearms can be legally checked in checked luggage on domestic flights.

In some cases, government leaders, members of the US military and law-enforcement officials are allowed to bypass security screening.

====TSA PreCheck====

In a program that began in October 2011, the TSA&#x27;s PreCheck Program allows selected members of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Virgin America, Southwest Airlines, Air Canada, JetBlue, and Sun Country Airlines frequent flyer programs, members of Global Entry, Free and Secure Trade (FAST), NEXUS, SENTRI and members of the US military, along with cadets and midshipmen of the United States service academies to receive expedited screening for domestic and select international itineraries. As of March 2019, this program was available at more than 200 airports. After completing a background check, being fingerprinted, and paying an $85 fee, travelers will get a Known Traveler Number. The program has led to complaints of unfairness and longer wait lines. Aeromexico, Etihad Airways, Cape Air, and Seaborne Airlines joined the program bringing the total number of member carriers to 16. On December 15, 2015, the program expanded to include Allegiant Air. On June 21, 2016, it was announced that Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines will also join the program starting in the fall of 2016. On August 31, 2016, the program expanded to include Lufthansa, and on September 29, 2016, Frontier Airlines was added. In 2017, 11 more airlines were added on January 26, and another seven were added on May 25. As of March 2019, a total to 65 carriers were participating in the program.

In October 2013, the TSA announced that it had begun searching a wide variety of government and private databases for information about passengers before they arrive at the airport. They did not say which databases were involved, but TSA has access to past travel itineraries, property records, physical characteristics, law enforcement, and intelligence information, among others.

====Large printer cartridges ban====
After the October 2010 cargo planes bomb plot, in which cargo containing laser printers with toner cartridges filled with explosives were discovered on separate cargo planes, the U.S. prohibited passengers from carrying certain printer cartridges on flights. The TSA said it would ban toner and ink cartridges weighing over 16 ounces (453 grams) from all passenger flights. The ban applies to both carry-on bags and checked bags, and does not affect average travelers, whose toner cartridges are generally lighter.

====November 2010 enhanced screening procedures====
Beginning in November 2010, TSA added new enhanced screening procedures. Passengers are required to choose between an enhanced patdown (allowing TSOs to more thoroughly check areas on the body such as waistbands, groin, and inner thigh) or instead to be imaged by the use of a full body scanner (that is, either backscatter X-ray or millimeter wave detection machines) in order to fly. These changes were made in reaction to the Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab bombing attempt.

=====Pat-downs=====
The new pat-down procedures, which were originally not made public, &quot;routinely involve the touching of buttocks and genitals&quot; as well as breasts. These procedures were controversial, and in a November 2010 poll, 50% of those polled felt that the new pat-down procedures were too extreme, with 48% feeling them justified. A number of publicized incidents created a public outcry against the invasiveness of the pat-down techniques, in which women&#x27;s breasts and the genital areas of all passengers are patted. Pat-downs are carried out by agents of the same gender as the passenger.

Concerns were raised as to the constitutionality of the new screening methods by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union. As of April 2011, at least six lawsuits were filed for violation of the Fourth Amendment. George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Rosen has supported this view, saying &quot;there&#x27;s a strong argument that the TSA&#x27;s measures violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot; Concerns were also raised about the effects of these pat-downs on survivors of sexual assault. In January 2014, Denver police launched an investigation against a screener at Denver International Airport over what the passenger stated was an intrusive patdown.

=====Full body scanners=====

TSA has used two kinds of full body imaging technology since first deploying them in airports in 2010. Previously backscatter X-ray scanners were used which produced ionizing radiation. After criticism the agency now uses only millimeter wave scanners which use non-ionizing radiation. The TSA refers to both systems as Advanced Imaging Technologies or AIT. Critics sometimes refer to them as &quot;naked scanners,&quot; though operators no longer see images of the actual passenger, which has been replaced by a stick figure with boxes indicating areas of concern identified by the machine. In 2022, TSA announced it will allow passengers to select the gender marker of their choice and alter algorithms used by the machines to be inclusive of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming individuals. Previously the agency required screeners to select a male or female button based on a brief glance at the passenger as they entered the machine.Passengers are directed to hold their hands above their heads for a few seconds while front and back images are created. If the machine indicates an anomaly to the operator, or if other problems occur, the passenger is required to receive a pat-down of that area. Full-body scanners have also proven controversial due to privacy and health concerns. The American Civil Liberties Union has called the scanners a &quot;virtual strip search.&quot; Female passengers have complained that they are often singled out for scanning, and a review of TSA records by a local CBS affiliate in Dallas found &quot;a pattern of women who believe that there was nothing random about the way they were selected for extra screening.&quot;

The TSA, on their website, states that they have &quot;implemented strict measures to protect passenger privacy which is ensured through the anonymity of the image,&quot; and additionally states that these technologies &quot;cannot store, print, transmit or save the image, and the image is automatically deleted from the system after it is cleared by the remotely located security officer.&quot; This claim, however, was proven false after multiple incidents involving leaked images. The machines do in fact have the ability to &quot;save&quot; the images and while this function is purported to be &quot;turned off&quot; by the TSA in screenings, TSA training facilities have the save function turned on.

As early as 2010, the TSA began to test scanners that would produce less intrusive &quot;stick figures&quot;. In February 2011, the TSA began testing new software on the millimeter-wave machines already used at Amsterdam&#x27;s Schiphol Airport that automatically detects potential threats on a passenger without the need for having an officer review actual images. Instead, one generic figure is used for all passengers and small yellow boxes are placed on areas of the body requiring additional screening. The TSA announced in 2013 that the Rapiscan&#x27;s backscatter scanners would no longer be used since the manufacturer of the machines could not produce &quot;privacy software&quot; to abstract the near-nude images that agents view and turn them into stick-like figures. The TSA continues to use other full-body scanners.

Health concerns have been raised about both scanning technologies.

With regards to exposure to radiation emitted by backscatter X-rays, and there are fears that people will be exposed to a &quot;dangerous level of radiation if they get backscattered too often&quot;. Ionizing radiation is considered a non-threshold carcinogen, but it is difficult to quantify the risk of low radiation exposures. Active millimeter wave scanners emit radiation which is non-ionizing, does not have enough energy to directly damage DNA, and is not known to be genotoxic.

=====Reverse screenings=====
In April 2016, TSA Administrator, Peter V. Neffenger told a Senate committee that small airports had the option to use &quot;reverse screening&quot; – a system where passengers are not screened before boarding the aircraft at departure, but instead are screened upon arrival at the destination. The procedure is intended to save costs at airports with a limited number of flights.

=====Reactions=====
After the November 2010 initiation of enhanced screening procedures of all airline passengers and flight crews, the US Airline Pilots Association issued a press release stating that pilots should not submit to full-body scanners because of unknown radiation risks and calling for strict guidelines for pat-downs of pilots, including evaluation of their fitness for duty after the pat-down, given the stressful nature of pat-downs. Two airline pilots filed suit against the procedures.

In March 2011, two New Hampshire state representatives introduced proposed legislation that would criminalize as sexual assault invasive TSA pat-downs made without probable cause. In May 2011, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill that would make it illegal for Transportation Security Administration officials to touch a person&#x27;s genitals when carrying out a patdown. The bill failed in the Senate after the Department of Justice threatened to make Texas a no-fly zone if the legislation passed. In the United States House of Representatives, Ron Paul introduced the American Traveler Dignity Act (H.R.6416), but it stalled in committee.

On July 2, 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a lawsuit in federal court asking to halt the use of full-body scanners by the TSA on Fourth amendment grounds, and arguing that the TSA had failed to allow a public notice and rulemaking period. In July 2011, the D.C. Circuit court of appeals ruled that the TSA did violate the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to allow a public notice and comment rule-making period. The Court ordered the agency to &quot;promptly&quot; undertake a public notice and comment rulemaking. In July 2012, EPIC returned to court and asked the court to force enforcement; in August, the court granted the request to compel the TSA to explain its actions by the end of the month. The agency responded on August 30, saying that there was &quot;no basis whatsoever for (The DC Circuit Court&#x27;s) assertion that TSA has delayed implementing this court&#x27;s mandate,&quot; and said it was awaiting approval from the Department of Homeland Security before the hearings take place. The TSA also said that it was having &quot;staffing issues&quot; regarding the issue, but expects to begin hearings in February 2013. The comment period began on March 25, 2013 and closed on June 25, 2013, with over 90% of the comments against the scanners. As of October 2015, no report has been issued.

Two separate Internet campaigns promoted a &quot;National Opt-Out Day,&quot; the day before Thanksgiving, urging travelers to &quot;opt out&quot; of the scanner and insist on a pat-down. The enhanced pat-down procedures were also the genesis of the &quot;Don&#x27;t touch my junk&quot; meme.

==== March 2017 electronic device restrictions ====
On March 21, 2017, the TSA banned electronic devices larger than smartphones from being carried on flights to the U.S. from 10 specific airports located in Muslim-majority countries. The order cited intelligence that &quot;indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation and are aggressively pursuing innovative methods to undertake their attacks, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items&quot;. The restrictions were ended in July following changes in screening procedures at the specified airports.

===Checked baggage===

In order to be able to search passenger baggage for security screening, the TSA will cut or otherwise disable locks they cannot open themselves. The agency authorized two companies to create padlocks, lockable straps, and luggage with built-in locks that can be opened and relocked by tools and information supplied by the lock manufacturers to the TSA. These are Travel Sentry and Safe Skies Locks. TSA agents sometimes cut these locks off instead of opening them, and TSA received over 3,500 complaints in 2011 about locks being tampered with. Travel journalist and &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; editor Christopher Elliott describes these locks as &quot;useless&quot; at protecting the goods within, whereas SmarterTravel wrote in early 2010 that the &quot;jury is out on their effectiveness&quot;, while noting how easy they are to open.

In November 2014, The &quot;Washington Post&quot; inadvertently published a photograph of all seven of the TSA master keys in an article about TSA baggage handling. The photograph was later removed from the original article, but it still appears in some syndicated copies. In August 2015, this gained the attention of news sites. Using the photograph, security researchers and members of the public have been able to reproduce working copies of the master keys using 3D printing techniques. The incident has prompted discussion about the security implications of using master keys.

=== Non-airport regulation ===
While most known for their role in airports, the TSA is also responsible for other transportation related regulations, including those without passengers. For example, the TSA was responsible for setting up cybersecurity regulations after the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021. As of August 2022, they issued revised cybersecurity directives for oil and gas providers more focused on performance-based measures, following extensive input from federal regulators and private industry stakeholders.

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Effectiveness of screening procedures ===

Undercover operations to test the effectiveness of airport screening processes are routinely carried out by the TSA&#x27;s Office of Investigations, TSA&#x27;s red team, and the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General&#x27;s office.

A 2004 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that TSA officials had collaborated with Covenant Aviation Security (CAS) at San Francisco International Airport to alert screeners to undercover tests. From August 2003 until May 2004, precise descriptions of the undercover personnel were provided to the screeners. The handing out of descriptions was then stopped, but until January 2005 screeners were still alerted whenever undercover operations were being undertaken. When no wrongdoing on the part of CAS was found, the contract was extended for four years. Some CAS and TSA workers received disciplinary action, but none were fired.

A report on undercover operations conducted in October 2006 at Newark Liberty International Airport was leaked to the press. The screeners had failed 20 of 22 undercover security tests, missing numerous guns and bombs. The Government Accountability Office had previously pointed to repeated covert test failures by TSA personnel. Revealing the results of covert tests is against TSA policy, and the agency responded by initiating an internal probe to discover the source of the leak.

In July 2007, the &quot;Times Union&quot; of Albany, New York reported that TSA screeners at Albany International Airport failed multiple covert security tests conducted by the TSA. Among them was a failure to detect a fake bomb.

In December 2010, ABC News Houston reported in an article about a man who accidentally took a forgotten gun through airport security, that &quot;the failure rate approaches 70 percent at some major airports&quot;.

In June 2011, TSA fired 36 screeners at the Honolulu airport for regularly allowing bags through without being inspected.

In 2011, an artist, Geoff McGann, was detained by the TSA, arrested, and charged for wearing a watch which contained visible wiring and fuse-like elements, despite containing no explosive ingredients.

In March 2012, American attorney Jonathan Corbett published video demonstrating a vulnerability in TSA&#x27;s body scanners that would allow metallic objects to pass undetected. TSA downplayed, though did not deny, the vulnerability, and researchers later confirmed its existence.

In May 2012, a report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General stated that the TSA &quot;does not have a complete understanding&quot; of breaches at the nation&#x27;s airports, with some hubs doing very little to fix or report security breaches. These findings will be presented to Congress. Rep. Darrell Issa, then-chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. John Mica, then-chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, were reported in 2012 to have had several joint hearings concerning the cost and benefits of the various safety programs including full-body scanners, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), and the behavior detection program, among others.

A 2015 investigation by the Homeland Security Inspector General revealed that undercover investigators were able to smuggle banned items through checkpoints in 95% of their attempts.

Some measures employed by the TSA have been accused of being ineffective and fostering a false sense of safety. This led security expert Bruce Schneier to coin the term &quot;security theater&quot; to describe those measures.

====Unintended consequences of screening enhancements====
Two studies by a group of Cornell University researchers asserted that increased airport security may have increased road fatalities, as would-be air travelers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident. In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month. In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. The study attributes the change in traveler behavior to two factors: fear of terrorist attacks and the wish to avoid the inconvenience of strict security measures; no attempt is made to estimate separately the influence of each of these two factors.

In 2007, the researchers studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002. Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Nate Silver remarked that this is equivalent to &quot;four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year.&quot; The 2007 study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business.

===Sexual assaults===

In April 2015, NBC Denver news ran a story on two related employees coordinating amongst themselves to falsely flag attractive passengers for groping. According to NBC, while the TSA fired the employees, it took steps to protect the identity of the employees, which NBC suggested was an effort to shield them from state prosecution. The state prosecutor eventually declined to charge the individuals, as none of the unknowingly groped passengers had come forward to complain. Following the incident, Time magazine ran a story quoting a former TSA employee, who claimed groping is business as usual.

In August 2015, a TSA agent was charged for sexually assaulting a Korean exchange student at New York LaGuardia Airport. After the woman complied with his order to go into the restroom for further screening, the agent assaulted her. TSA in a press release after firing the worker stated passengers should be aware it does not screen people after the pass through security — this despite TSA having dogs in secure areas sniffing luggage for contraband that would require a human inspection.

In 2021, former TSA agent Jonathan Lomeli was convicted of assault after an incident where he tricked a woman into showing her breasts under the guise of it being part of a security screening.

=== Smuggling drugs and weapons ===
In 2012, a number of people including TSA employees were arrested in Los Angeles Airport after they were found to be a part of a drug smuggling gang.

In 2021, a TSA employee was arrested at JFK Airport after she tried to smuggle guns through a metal detector.

=== Baggage theft ===

The TSA has been criticized for an increase in baggage theft after its inception. Reported thefts include both valuable and dangerous goods, such as laptops, jewelry, guns, and knives. Such thefts have raised concerns that the same access might allow bombs to be placed aboard aircraft.

In 2004, over 17,000 claims of baggage theft were reported. As of 2004, 60 screeners had been arrested for baggage theft, a number which had grown to 200 screeners by 2008. 11,700 theft and damage claims were reported to the TSA in 2009, a drop from 26,500 in 2004, which was attributed to the installation of cameras and conveyor belts in airports. A total of 25,016 thefts were reported over the five-year period from 2010 to 2014.

, the TSA employed about 60,000 screeners in total (counting both baggage and passenger screening) and approximately 500 TSA agents had been fired or suspended for stealing from passenger luggage since the agency&#x27;s creation in November 2001. The airports with the most reported thefts from 2010 to 2014 were John F. Kennedy International Airport, followed by Los Angeles International Airport and Orlando International Airport.

In 2008, an investigative report by WTAE in Pittsburgh discovered that despite over 400 reports of baggage theft, about half of which the TSA reimbursed passengers for, not a single arrest had been made. The TSA does not, as a matter of policy, share baggage theft reports with local police departments.

In September 2012, ABC News interviewed former TSA agent Pythias Brown, who admitted to stealing more than $800,000 worth of items during his employment with the agency. Brown stated that it was &quot;very convenient to steal&quot;, and that poor morale within the agency led agents to steal from passengers.

in September 2023, NBC Miami ran a story regarding 3 TSA employees who were arrested for grand theft after being filmed on security cameras stealing cash, and goods from handbags.

The TSA has also been criticized for not responding properly to theft and failing to reimburse passengers for stolen goods. For example, between 2011 and 2012, passengers at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport reported $300,000 in property lost or damaged by the TSA. The agency only reimbursed $35,000 of those claims. Similar statistics were found at Jacksonville International Airport – passengers reported $22,000 worth of goods missing or damaged over the course of 15 months. The TSA only reimbursed $800 total of this amount.

===Data security incidents===

====Employee records lost or stolen====
In 2007, an unencrypted computer hard drive containing Social Security numbers, bank data, and payroll information for about 100,000 employees was lost or stolen from TSA headquarters. Kip Hawley alerted TSA employees to the loss, and apologized for it. The agency asked the FBI to investigate. There were no reports that the data was later misused.

====Unsecured website====

In 2007, Christopher Soghoian, a blogger and security researcher, said that a TSA website was collecting private passenger information in an unsecured manner, exposing passengers to identity theft. The website allowed passengers to dispute their inclusion on the No Fly List. The TSA fixed the website several days after the press picked up the story. The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigated the matter, and said the website had operated insecurely for more than four months, during which more than 247 people had submitted personal information. The report said the TSA manager who awarded the contract for creating the website was a high-school friend and former employee of the owner of the firm that received the contract. It noted: Neither Desyne nor the Technical Lead on the traveler redress website have been sanctioned by TSA for their roles in the deployment of an insecure website. TSA continues to pay Desyne to host and maintain two major web-based information systems. TSA has taken no steps to discipline the Technical Lead, who still holds a senior program management position at TSA.

In December 2009, someone within the TSA posted a sensitive manual titled &quot;Screening Management SOP&quot; on secret airport screening guidelines to an obscure URL on the FedBizOpps website. The manual was taken down quickly, but the breach raised questions about whether security practices had been compromised. Five TSA employees were placed on administrative leave over the manual&#x27;s publication, which, while , had its redaction easily removed.

===Other criticisms===

Other common criticisms of the agency have also included assertions that TSA employees have slept on the job, bypassed security checks, and failed to use good judgment and common sense.

TSA agents are also accused and convicted of having mistreated passengers; having sexually harassed passengers; having used invasive screening procedures, including touching the genitals, along with those of children; misusing body scanners to ogle female passengers; having searched passengers or their belongings for items other than weapons or explosives; and having stolen from passengers.
The TSA fired 28 agents and suspended 15 others after an investigation determined they failed to scan checked baggage for explosives.

The TSA was also accused of having spent lavishly on events unrelated to airport security, having wasted money in hiring, and having had conflicts of interest.

The TSA was accused of having performed poorly at the 2009 Presidential Inauguration viewing areas, which left thousands of ticket holders excluded from the event in overcrowded conditions, while those who had arrived before the checkpoints were in place avoided screening altogether.

In 2013, dozens of TSA workers were fired or suspended for illegal gambling at Pittsburgh International Airport, and eight TSA workers were arrested in connection with stolen parking passes at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

A 2013, GAO report showed a 26% increase in misconduct among TSA employees between 2010 and 2012, from 2,691 cases to 3,408. Another GAO report said that there is no evidence that the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) behavioral detection program, with an annual budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, is effective.

A 2013 report by the Homeland Security Department Inspector General&#x27;s Office charged that TSA was using criminal investigators to do the job of lower-paid employees, wasting millions of dollars a year.

On December 3, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (H.R. 2719; 113th Congress) in response to criticism of the TSA&#x27;s acquisition process as wasteful, costly, and ineffective. If the bill became law, it would require the TSA to develop a comprehensive technology acquisition plan and present regular reports to Congress about its successes and failures to adhere to this plan. An April 2013 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General indicated that the TSA had 17,000 items with an estimated cost of $185.7 million stored in its warehouses on May 31, 2012. The auditors found that &quot;TSA stored unusable or obsolete equipment, maintained inappropriate safety stock levels, and did not develop an inventory management process that systematically deploys equipment.&quot;

In January 2014, Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA screener at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, said that fellow staff members assigned to review body scan images of airline passengers routinely joked about fliers&#x27; weight, attractiveness, and penis and breast sizes. According to Harrington, screeners would alert each other to attractive female passengers with the code phrase &quot;Hotel Papa&quot; so that staff would have an opportunity to view the passengers&#x27; nude form in body scanner monitors and retaliated against rude flyers by delaying them at the checkpoint. TSA Administrator John Pistole responded by saying that all the scanners had been replaced and the screening rooms were disabled. He did not deny that the behaviors described by Harrington took place.

In May 2016, actress Susan Sarandon claimed that during the entire time of the Bush administration she was &quot;harassed every time I came into the country&quot;. She said that she hired two lawyers to contact the TSA to determine why she had been targeted but that she assumed it was because she was critical of the Bush administration. She said the harassment stopped after her attorneys followed up a second time with the TSA.

In July 2018, a case heard in the Third Circuit Appeals Court ruled that TSA agents are not &quot;investigative or law enforcement officers&quot; and thus are not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The case extended from a woman who had been detained and arrested by TSA in 2006 but later the criminal charges were acquitted in court; she had sought damages under the FTCA for damages related to the false arrest and related matters.

An ACLU study found that the TSA disproportionately targets Arabs, Muslims and Latinos, despite DHS claims to the contrary.

===Public opinion===
A CBS telephone poll of 1137 people published on November 15, 2010, found that 81% percent of those polled approved TSA&#x27;s use of full-body scans. An ABC/Washington Post poll conducted by Langer Associates and released November 22, 2010, found that 64% of Americans favored the full-body X-ray scanners, but that 50% think the &quot;enhanced&quot; pat-downs go too far; 37% felt so strongly. Besides, the poll states opposition is lowest among those who fly less than once a year. A later poll by Zogby International found 61% of likely voters oppose the new measures by TSA. In 2012, a poll conducted by the Frequent Business Traveler organization found that 56% of frequent fliers were &quot;not satisfied&quot; with the job the TSA was doing. 57% rated the TSA as doing a &quot;poor job,&quot; and 34% rated it &quot;fair.&quot; Only 1% of those surveyed rated the agency&#x27;s work as excellent. On the contrary, a 2018 Rasmussen Reports telephone poll of 1,000 Adult Americans found that 45% of respondents had an opinion of the TSA ranging from somewhat favorable to very favorable, while 39% had an unfavorable opinion.

===Investigations of the TSA===
In 2013, The Office of Inspector General published a report titled &quot;TSA&#x27;s Actions Insufficient to Address Inspector General Recommendations to Improve its Office of Inspection&quot;. The report touched upon several topics of misconduct but the main focus of the report was of the TSA criminal investigators who received a premium on their pay despite not meeting the minimum qualification to be eligible for this pay.

The TSA Office of Accountability Inspection Act of 2015 published by the Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, was based on a report of an investigation that found issues with the TSA. The act also followed up the Office of Inspector General&#x27;s 2013 report, mandating that the TSA should comply with Federal Regulation and correct the wage of the TSA&#x27;s Criminal Investigators. Had no action been taken this misuse of funds was estimated to cost taxpayers, in a span of five years, $17 million.

In response, the TSA contracted a consulting firm to assist the TSA with the Office of Inspector General recommendations. However, the Office of Inspector Generals has found the TSA&#x27;s response lacking as they have yet to fix a majority of the issues brought up in the report.

===Calls for abolition===
Numerous groups and figures have called for the abolition of the TSA in its current form by persons and groups which include Sen. Rand Paul, (R-KY), Rep. John Mica, (R-FL), The Cato Institute, Downsize DC Foundation, FreedomWorks, and opinion columnists from &quot;Forbes,&quot; &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;National Review,&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

The TSA&#x27;s critics frequently cite the agency as &quot;ineffective, invasive, incompetent, inexcusably costly, or all four&quot; as their reasons for seeking its abolition. Those seeking to abolish the TSA have cited the improved efficacy and cost of screening provided by qualified private companies in compliance with federal guidelines.

<doc id="172936" wikidata="Q840130" url="?curid=172936" title="Smash (The Offspring album)">
<text>Smash is the third studio album by American rock band the Offspring, released on April 8, 1994, through Epitaph Records. After touring in support of their previous album &quot;Ignition&quot; (1992), the band recorded their next album for nearly two months at Track Record in North Hollywood, California. &quot;Smash&quot; was the band&#x27;s final studio album to be produced by Thom Wilson, who had worked with them since their 1989 debut album &quot;The Offspring&quot;. &quot;Smash&quot; was put together on the spot in the studio and there was no systematic work behind the recording of the album.

The rise of grunge, especially Nirvana&#x27;s successful release of &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), paved the way for American punk rock to reach a wider audience, with punk rock serving as an important base to the grunge sound. While &quot;Ignition&quot; had exceeded both the band&#x27;s and the label&#x27;s commercial expectations, it did not give the Offspring a major commercial breakthrough; &quot;Smash&quot; was the Offspring&#x27;s introduction into worldwide popularity. It produced a number of hit singles, including &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;. Along with Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;Smash&quot; was responsible for bringing punk rock into the mainstream, and helped pave the way for the then-emerging pop punk scene of the 1990s. 

As a fan favorite, the album received generally positive reviews from critics and garnered attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom the band would sign in 1996. Peaking at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Smash&quot; has sold over eleven million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album released by an independent record label; it was also the first Epitaph release to obtain gold and platinum status. In the United States, &quot;Smash&quot; has sold over six million copies and has been certified six times platinum by the RIAA.

==Background and recording==
After its heyday in the 1970s and first half of the 1980s, punk rock had declined in popularity. By the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, it had faded into an underground genre, though niche subgenres and fusions of punk such as grunge began to develop. Punk&#x27;s fates began to change in September 1991 when Nirvana released &quot;Nevermind&quot; and its lead single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Both the album and the single were very successful, and grunge became mainstream. The popularity of Nirvana and grunge&#x27;s overlap with punk rock paved the way for American punk rock bands to reach a wider audience.

In 1991, the Offspring released the &quot;Baghdad&quot; 7&quot;. This EP was the turning point for the band; due to its success the band signed with Epitaph Records. Thom Wilson, who produced the Offspring&#x27;s first two albums, had been trying to get the Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that the Offspring was just not quite pronounced enough for his label, but &quot;Baghdad&quot; convinced him to give the band a shot. Wilson and the Offspring entered the studio again and recorded &quot;Ignition&quot;. Released in 1992, &quot;Ignition&quot; exceeded all of the label&#x27;s and band&#x27;s expectations. Following the subsequent touring to support &quot;Ignition&quot;, the Offspring began writing new material for their third album in mid-1993. 

&quot;Smash&quot; was recorded in 20 days between January and February 1994 at Track Record in North Hollywood. On the recording process of the album, frontman Dexter Holland told &quot;Flux Magazine&quot; in 1994, &quot;When we recorded this album, our last one has sold maybe 15,000 copies, so the possibility of us getting played on the radio or anything like that was pretty much nonexistent. Especially because this kind of music is not generally considered acceptable by the mainstream - so, for something like this to happen, it really took us by surprise.&quot; 

&quot;Smash&quot; had a small budget of $20,000, which frequently restricted the band. According to guitarist Noodles, &quot;[we] were constantly calling our studio to find out when it was empty just so we could sneak in at a discount price&quot;. The last four songs recorded for the album were worked on through just two nights.

==Writing and composition==

Punk rock bands like Green Day and Rancid were gaining popularity, and riding on this wave of popularity, &quot;Smash&quot;&#x27;s singles became radio rock hits. An example of this was the success of the Offspring&#x27;s first major single release, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, which reached No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The second single released from the album, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, became a radio hit, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The third single, &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Being the last song written for the album, the lyrics describe a point in Dexter&#x27;s life when he was suffering from extreme pressure due to the then-upcoming deadline of the album. &quot;What Happened To You&quot; is driven by a Jamaican ska beat.

The only cover in the album was &quot;Killboy Powerhead&quot;, by the Didjits.

==Reception==

===Professional reviews===
Critical reviews of &quot;Smash&quot; were mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it a &quot;solid record, filled with enough heavy riffs to keep most teenagers happy&quot;. Erlewine praised the music as &quot;relentlessly heavy&quot;. For the album, he claims that the Offspring had &quot;crossed over&quot;, because of the success of its single &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, which &quot;stopped and started just like Nirvana.&quot; Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno called it &quot;a fun album to listen to.&quot; Robert Christgau was less favorable, giving the album a &quot;neither&quot; rating.

===Chart performance and sales===

Despite obtaining early support from the Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ, &quot;Smash&quot; initially received little attention from radio and television stations. On October 29, 1994, it peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and since then, was in various places on the chart for 101 weeks. It also peaked at number one on the Heatseeker&#x27;s Chart. On June 19, 1999, &quot;Smash&quot; peaked at number 12 on the Catalog Albums chart for one week.

&quot;Smash&quot; made history becoming the first album released on Epitaph Records to obtain gold and platinum status, and has been certified multi-platinum in three countries, including the US, Australia, and Canada. Additionally, it has achieved platinum status in Sweden and Switzerland, and gold status in Austria and Norway. &quot;Smash&quot; had sold over 11 million copies worldwide, with 6.3 million sales in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan and reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2012. In France, it is the best selling album on an independent label, with 650,000 sales and 2× Platinum certification.

On July 30, 1994, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, topped the Modern Rock Tracks, and stayed on the chart for 26 weeks. The song also charted at number 39 on the Pop Songs chart, while it reached number ten on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Self Esteem&quot; reached number four on Modern Rock Tracks and would remain on that chart for 26 weeks, while it hit number seven on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;, the album&#x27;s third and last single, peaked at number six on the Modern Rock Tracks chart on January 14, 1995, where it would maintain some lower position on the chart for 20 weeks. Around the same time &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; was officially chosen as the follow-up to &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, &quot;Bad Habit&quot; was thought to be the third or fourth single from &quot;Smash&quot; when KROQ added it to its playlist and became one of the radio station&#x27;s most requested songs; nonetheless, no music video nor standard single was released to promote &quot;Bad Habit&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Smash&quot; has inspired a number of musicians. During Trivium&#x27;s early days, guitarist Matt Heafy performed a cover version of &quot;Self Esteem&quot; at his middle school talent show at Lake Brantley High School, while the British synthpop group Cuban Boys also covered that song on their only full-length album &quot;Eastwood&quot;. The album&#x27;s other hit, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, was covered by Richard Cheese on his 2000 album, &quot;Lounge Against the Machine&quot; and again released on the 2006 best-of album &quot;The Sunny Side of the Moon&quot;. Brett Gurewitz, the guitarist of Bad Religion and president of Epitaph, had also mentioned that he liked &quot;Smash&quot; and described it as &quot;a very good record&quot;.

Along with Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;Smash&quot; was among the most commercially successful punk rock albums released in 1994, a year when the genre reached arguably its greatest popularity. By the end of the year, &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot; had both sold millions of copies. The commercial success of these two albums attracted major label interest in punk rock, with bands such as Rancid, NOFX and Pennywise, all of whom had been labelmates with the Offspring at the time, being offered lucrative contracts to leave their independent record labels, though this offer was rejected.

&quot;Smash&quot; has been listed on several publications&#x27; best album lists. In November 2011, the album was ranked number two on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994, between Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; and Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Weezer&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; also ranked &quot;Smash&quot; at number 31 in their &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. Although the Offspring is a punk rock band, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed &quot;Smash&quot; at No. 4 on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. The album was included at number 6 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;.

==Artwork==

&quot;Smash,&quot; as well as the singles &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; have a common artwork theme: an ominous (and highly distorted) skeleton on the cover, disc, and back of the CD case. The music videos for &quot;Self Esteem&quot; and &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; also have several scenes with a similar skeleton. This symbol is believed to represent the core motifs of the album: death, greed, suicide, violence, addiction, and abuse. The skeleton is used to represent that the continuation of these acts will inevitably lead to death (or alternatively, the end of the human race). The art direction is credited to Kevin Head and Fred Hidalgo, who also designed the artwork for the Bad Religion album &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot;.

==Touring and promotion==
The Offspring toured for more than two years to promote &quot;Smash&quot;. They began a two-month U.S. tour in May 1994, supporting such bands as SNFU, Battery Club and Pennywise, and then that summer, the band toured North America with Guttermouth and Big Drill Car, and Europe with Desaster Area. In the wake of the success of &quot;Smash&quot;, the Offspring was reportedly offered but turned down opening arena tours with bands like Stone Temple Pilots and Metallica (replacing Alice in Chains on the latter&#x27;s summer 1994 U.S. tour), due to their desire to continue playing in clubs; Holland has been quoted as saying, &quot;It just really didn&#x27;t seem like the right thing to do. I still like the club thing, even if it&#x27;s a big club. I like Stone Temple Pilots—it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re saying we&#x27;re too punk for that.&quot; The Offspring&#x27;s next U.S. tour took place in October–November 1994, and was supported by Rancid, who were promoting their second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. The band wrapped up the year with a European tour in November and a series of theater performances in December.

In January 1995, the Offspring embarked on their first tour of Japan and Australia, where they co-headlined Big Day Out with Ministry, Primal Scream, Hole, and the Cult. They toured the U.S. with Quicksand and No Use for a Name in February–March 1995, and then headlined a European tour, which was followed by another U.S. tour with the Vandals and Lunachicks, and another European tour in June–July. The Offspring took the rest of 1995 off before playing three shows in Southern California in December, and a one-off show in Orange, California with Rancid in April 1996. In August 1996, the band played its final dates of the &quot;Smash&quot; tour in Europe.

The Offspring embarked on a in the summer and fall of 2014 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Smash&quot;. On this tour, they played the &quot;Smash&quot; album in its entirety.

==Reissues==
&quot;Smash&quot; has been reissued at least twice. Remastered issues of &quot;Ignition&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot; were released on June 17, 2008, the same day as the Offspring&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot;. On April 8, 2014, the 20th anniversary of its original release, the Offspring announced that they would be releasing a special edition of &quot;Smash&quot; in mid-August on Epitaph. It was released as a special package that contained the remastered album on both CD and vinyl, restyled artwork, and a large format 24-page booklet containing never-before seen photos. The reissue was also released as a box set; it came with an art print (the first 250 of which are signed and on linen), a live photo print, tour pass replica and 20th anniversary items, including a pin, patch and guitar pick. The band toured in support of the reissue.

<text>Ixnay on the Hombre is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Offspring, released on February 4, 1997, by Columbia Records, as the band&#x27;s first album on the label. After the massive commercial success of their previous album, &quot;Smash&quot; (1994), the band entered the studio in the middle of 1996 to record their fourth album and it was the first Offspring album not to be produced by Thom Wilson, instead being produced by Dave Jerden. The title combines Pig Latin (&quot;Ixnay&quot; is the version of the word &quot;nix&quot;, familiar in 1940s Hollywood movies) and Spanish (&quot;hombre&quot;, &quot;man&quot;) to convey the message &quot;fuck The Man&quot;, as in &quot;fuck authority&quot;.

&quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; was a moderate commercial success upon its release, debuting at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was well received by both critics and fans. It was later certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over one million copies in the United States, and has sold over three million copies worldwide. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;Gone Away&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, and &quot;I Choose&quot;.

==Background and recording==
By the time The Offspring began writing new material for their fourth studio album in 1995–1996, they were the biggest act of Epitaph&#x27;s roster and had originally declined to leave the label before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records. Following the widespread commercial success of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Smash&quot;, frontman Dexter Holland wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz decided to sell &quot;Smash&quot; to a major label in &quot;return for a royalty override on it,&quot; an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as Geffen, Capitol and Sony, in attempt to sign The Offspring. The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they &quot;took less money&quot; with the label and the signing &quot;was not to try and make more money.&quot; Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not &quot;record for someone who thinks [Gurewitz] can force [them] to&quot; and would not &quot;record for a guy who&#x27;s worse than a major label.&quot;
The recording sessions of &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; took place from June to October 1996 at Eldorado Recording Studios with producer Dave Jerden, making it the first time The Offspring had not worked with Thom Wilson, who produced the band&#x27;s previous three albums. On the recording process of the album, guitarist Noodles stated:
Noodles also noted that with Columbia&#x27;s financing, they had more time to work on the album, specially with the guaranteed studio space - &quot;We did &quot;Smash&quot; on no budget at all and were constantly calling our studio to find out when it was empty just so we could sneak in at a discount price.&quot; - and Holland added that they had &quot;the time to get better sounds.&quot;

&quot;Pay the Man&quot; was one of the songs recorded during the &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; sessions but instead ended up being released on &quot;Americana&quot;. &quot;Change the World&quot; is a further development of the unnamed hidden track that appeared at the end of the previous album &quot;Smash&quot; (in which the guitar riff follows the same melody as the lead guitar in &quot;Genocide&quot;). &quot;Change the World&quot; itself contains a hidden track, a brief spoken piece by Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman of &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; was released on February 4, 1997, and is the first Offspring album distributed via Columbia Records. Their former label Epitaph Records released it in Europe because of disagreements between the band and the label&#x27;s founder Brett Gurewitz. The band was able to release its album on Columbia for the US and other international releases but had to complete the album release in Europe through Epitaph. The Offspring would continue releasing albums on Columbia until it was announced in early 2013 that they had fulfilled their contract with the label.

&quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The AllMusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine awards the album 2.5 stars and states: &quot;&quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; sounds like a competent hard rock band trying to hitch themselves to the post-grunge bandwagon.&quot;

==Touring and promotion==
The Offspring toured relentlessly for almost a year to promote &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot;. Prior to its release, they headlined the Big Day Out tour in Australia in January–February 1997, along with Soundgarden and The Prodigy. The &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; tour kickstarted on February 11, 1997, at Foothill in Long Beach, California, with One Hit Wonder, who had just been signed to Holland&#x27;s label Nitro Records. A week later, they played five shows in the East Coast of the United States with The Joykiller, which was followed by a ten-date tour with AFI and Strung Out and a European tour with The Vandals and Lunachicks. The Offspring continued to tour over seven-month period from May to December 1997, which included U.S. tours with AFI/L7, Voodoo Glow Skulls/The Joykiller and Hagfish/One Hit Wonder/Good Riddance, as well as a Canadian tour with Doughboys, three Brazilian shows with Charlie Brown Jr., and four shows in Australia with The Living End. Social Distortion also supported The Offspring on selected dates. The &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; tour ended on December 18, 1997, in Osaka, Japan, with AFI supporting them.

<doc id="172940" wikidata="Q60655" url="?curid=172940" title="Germanic weak verb">
<text>In the Germanic languages, weak verbs are by far the largest group of verbs, and are therefore often regarded as the norm (the regular verbs). They are distinguished from the Germanic strong verbs by the fact that their past tense form is marked by an inflection containing a , , or sound (as in English &quot;I walk~I walked&quot;) rather than by changing the verb&#x27;s root vowel (as in English &quot;I rise~I rose&quot;).

Whereas the strong verbs are the oldest group of verbs in Germanic, originating in Indo-European, the weak verbs arose as an innovation in proto-Germanic. Originally the weak verbs consisted of new verbs coined from pre-existing nouns (for example the noun &quot;name&quot; was turned into the verb &quot;to name&quot;), or coined from strong verbs to express the sense of causing the action denoted by that strong verb (for example the strong verb &quot;to rise&quot; was turned into the weak verb &quot;to raise&quot;).

However, over time, the weak verbs have become the normal form of verbs in all Germanic languages, with most strong verbs being reassigned to the weak class. For example, in Old English the verb &quot;to lock&quot; () was strong (present tense &#x27;I lock&#x27;, past tense &#x27;I locked&#x27;), but has now become weak. This transition is ongoing. For example, the English verb &quot;to cleave&quot; currently exists in both a conservative strong form (past tense &quot;I clove&quot;) and an innovative weak form (past tense &quot;I cleaved&quot;).

==General description==
In Germanic languages, weak verbs form their preterites and past participles by means of a dental suffix, an inflection that contains a or sound or similar. (For comparative purposes, they will be referred to as a dental, but in some of the languages, including most varieties of English, and are alveolar instead.) In all Germanic languages, the preterite and past participle forms of weak verbs are formed from the same stem.

Historically, the pronunciation of the suffix in the vast majority of weak verbs (all four classes) was but, in most sources discussing Proto-Germanic, it is spelled by convention. In the West Germanic languages, the suffix hardened to , but it remained a fricative in the other early Germanic languages (Gothic and often in Old Norse).

In the English language, the dental is a after a voiced consonant (&quot;loved&quot;) or vowel (&quot;laid&quot;), a after a voiceless consonant (&quot;laughed&quot;), and after the dentals/alveolars and themselves, but English uses the suffix spelling regardless of pronunciation, with the exception of a few verbs with irregular spellings.

In Dutch, and are distributed as in English provided there is a following vowel. When there is no following vowel, terminal devoicing leads to the universal . Nevertheless, Dutch still distinguishes between the spellings in and even in final position: see the &#x27;t kofschip rule.

In Afrikaans, which descends from Dutch, the past tense has fallen out of use altogether, and the past participle is marked only with the prefix . Therefore, the suffix has disappeared along with the forms that originally contained it.

In German the dental is always and always spelled because of the third phase of the High German consonant shift (d→t).

In Low German, the dental ending of the preterite tense was originally or , according to the stem of the verb. However the ending has fallen out in pronunciation, starting in the 17th century when the preterite was written with the ending representing the sound , which was already the last remnant of the former &quot;-de&quot; and &quot;-te&quot; endings of Middle Low German. Now, the only Low German verbs that still show a remnant of a dental ending are , which has the preterite , and the verb , which has with old &quot;r&quot;-ending from the Middle Low German dental.

In Icelandic, the dental was originally a voiced dental fricative . It is preserved as such after vowels, voiced fricatives, and but has been hardened to a stop after nasals and . It and has been devoiced to after voiceless consonants and in some other cases (in most Old Norse texts, the alternation is already found in heavy roots, but the light ones preserve ). Furthermore, the voicing contrast between and has been replaced in modern Icelandic by an aspiration contrast, which may not be realized phonetically in all the relevant positions.

The situation of early Norwegian was similar to Icelandic, but intervocalic eventually disappeared. In the verbs in which it remains, the dental is or , depending on conjugation class and dialect. It is spelled accordingly. In Nynorsk, it can be different in the preterite and the past participle.

Swedish has a similar situation to that of Norwegian, but the dental is retained in the spelling, even between vowels. Some informal spellings indicate a lost dental, such as in (&quot;said&quot;) from the standard spelling .

==Classes of verbs==
In Proto-Germanic, there were seven types of weak verbs, five of which were common. However, they are normally grouped into four classes, based on the conjugational system of Gothic.

===Class I Verbs===
Class I verbs actually consist of three classes in Proto-Germanic:

====Class I, subclass (i)====
A small class of verbs had no suffix in the present, and no suffix in the past (other than the -d- or -t- of all weak verbs). This class had only three members:

# &quot;to bring&quot;, past tense . This verb was continued as such in all the descendants, although an alternate stem occasionally appeared in some of the West Germanic languages (e.g., Old English ).
# &quot;to use&quot;, past tense . This verb tended to move into other classes. For example, in Gothic this verb moved into subclass (ii) of Class I (, past ), whereas in Old English it became a Class II strong verb (, past tense ← ).
# &quot;to dwell&quot;, past tense . This verb continued as such in most descendants but became a Class III weak verb in Gothic.

====Class I, subclass (ii)====
A small class of verbs had the suffix -j- in the present and no suffix in the past. This class had only five members in Proto-Germanic:

# &quot;to buy,&quot; past tense 
# &quot;to seek,&quot; past tense (given a regularized subclass (iii) past in Gothic)
# &quot;to think,&quot; past tense 
# &quot;to seem,&quot; past tense 
# &quot;to work,&quot; past tense 

Verbs of this class were said to undergo rückumlaut (&quot;reverse umlaut&quot;) in the past, since the umlaut occurring in the present (triggered by the -j-) is undone or &quot;reversed&quot; in the past (due to the lack of the umlaut-triggering stem -i- of subclass [iii]), leading to a non-umlauted vowel in the past.

These verbs also have consonant and vowel alternations between present and past that are due to regular sound changes but result in strikingly different forms in the historical Germanic languages (e.g., &quot;think&quot;, past tense &quot;thought&quot;). Specifically:
*There is an alternation between -k- or -g- in the present and -h- in the past, caused by the -t- of the past-tense suffix. Prior to the operation of Grimm&#x27;s Law, the stem consonant was -g- or -gʰ-. Before -t-, the consonant was devoiced to -k- by assimilation and then became -h- by Grimm&#x27;s Law. This alternation is sometimes called Primärberührung.
*-n- before -h- disappeared after nasalizing the previous vowel. When the -n- disappeared, the vowel was lengthened by the process of compensatory lengthening.
*-u- was lowered to -o- in the past tense due to a-mutation, since the following vowel was always non-high.

The class remained small in Gothic, but expanded significantly in the other languages:

*In Old Norse, all short-stem verbs (those with a short vowel followed by at most one consonant, or a long vowel followed by no consonant) appeared to move into this class, as indicated by the fact that no umlaut occurs in the past, as would be caused by a suffix -i-. However, this may have been due to a regular sound change that eliminated unstressed, nonfinal short vowels coming after a short stem before the operation of umlaut.
*In Old High German, short-stem verbs ending in -zz (-tz), -pf, -ck (Proto-Germanic root ending in *-t, -p, or -k), and optionally those in -ll, join this class. For example, &quot;to tell&quot; &lt; , past tense . A number of long-stem verbs also join this class, like &quot;to burn,&quot; past tense ; &quot;to turn,&quot; past tense .
*In Old English and the other northern West Germanic languages, a number of verbs ending in -(c)c- and -ll- joined the class, including the following Old English verbs:
:* &quot;to shake&quot; &lt; , past tense &lt; 
:* &quot;to afflict,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to seize&quot; (based on earlier ?), past tense 
:* &quot;to moisten,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to reach&quot; &lt; , past tense &lt; 
:* &quot;to narrate,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to care for&quot; (based on earlier ?), past tense 
:* &quot;to teach,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to stretch,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to cover,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to awake,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to kill&quot; &lt; , past tense &lt; 
:* &quot;to dwell,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to give, sell,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to place,&quot; past tense 
:* &quot;to tell,&quot; past tense 

In Late Old English, further verbs in -can were drawn into this class by analogy, but with umlaut maintained, e.g., &quot;to deceive&quot;, past tense , earlier , or &quot;to warm,&quot; past tense , earlier . At the same time, verbs in -ccan were modified to follow the same pattern, as in the new past tense form alongside earlier .

====Class I, subclass (iii)====
A large class of verbs had the suffix -j- in the present and -i- in the past, for example, Gothic &quot;to set&quot; (Old English ) and sandjan &quot;to send&quot; (Old English ). As shown in the Old English cognates:
*The -j- produced umlaut of the stem vowel in languages other than Gothic.
*The -j- caused West Germanic gemination in the West Germanic languages in short-stem verbs ending in a consonant other than -r.
*The -j- resulted in palatalization of preceding velar consonants in Old English.
*The -j- remained in Gothic and Old Saxon, but disappeared in the other languages: In long-stem verbs in Old Norse, and in all verbs except those in -r in the remaining West Germanic languages. (In Old High German, it deflected *-jan into *-jen before disappearing, leaving the suffix -en. This phenomenon, which resembles the usual umlaut of a in syllables &quot;preceding&quot; j, is nevertheless distinct and must have happened later, as the missing j also caused umlaut.)

This class was split into two subclasses in all the Old Germanic languages, one consisting of short-stem verbs and one of long-stem verbs. The distinction between the two was originally due to Sievers&#x27; Law, and was extended due to changes such as West Germanic gemination, which affected short-stem but not long-stem verbs. The West Germanic languages had a third subclass consisting of short-stem verbs ending in -r (e.g., Old English &quot;to plow,&quot; &quot;to save,&quot; &quot;to stir&quot;), due to West Germanic gemination and subsequent loss of -j- not taking place.

The following is a cross-language paradigm of a short-stem Class I verb &quot;to anger&quot; (Gothic , Old Norse , Old High German , Old Saxon , Old English , Old Frisian ). Note that the Old Saxon and Old Frisian verbs given here are unattested, almost certainly due to the small nature of the respective corpora.

The following is a cross-language paradigm of a long-stem Class I verb &quot;to hear&quot; (Gothic , Old Norse , Old High German , Old Saxon , Old English , Old Frisian )

===Class II Verbs===
Class II verbs were formed with a suffix -ō-. In the northern West Germanic languages, an alternative extended suffix -ōja- sometimes appears in the non-past forms, e.g., the Old English infinitive .

The following is a cross-language paradigm of &quot;to invite&quot; (Gothic , Old Norse , Old High German , Old Saxon , ladian [-ōjan], Old English , Old Frisian ).

===Class III Verbs===
What is known as &quot;Class III&quot; was actually two separate classes in Proto-Germanic:
*A class of verbs with stative semantics (i.e., denoting a state rather than an action), formed with a present suffix that was either *-ai- or *-ja-, and no suffix in the past.
*A class of verbs with factitive semantics (i.e., with the meaning &quot;make X&quot; where X is an adjective or noun, e.g., &quot;renew, enslave&quot;), formed with a suffix that was either *-ai- or *-ā-, and a suffix *-a- in the past.

The histories of this class in the various Germanic languages are quite varied:
*Old High German combined both into a single class and generalized *-ai- (appearing as -ē- through regular sound change) to all forms of the present and past.
*Gothic combined both into a single class, keeping the *-ai-/-ā- alternation of the factitives in the present, generalizing the alternation to the statives as well, and borrowing *-ai- as the past suffix.
*Old Norse for the most part combined both into a single class in the same fashion as Gothic; however, two relic stative verbs ( &quot;to say&quot; and &quot;to be silent&quot;) preserve the stative suffixes in both present and past, and a third verb ( &quot;to have&quot;) is a mixture of the two, with factitive suffixes in the present indicative plural and imperative and stative suffixes in the present indicative singular and past participle (elsewhere, the two types have fallen together).
*The other (i.e., northern) West Germanic languages have only small numbers of Class III verbs—but they consistently follow the stative paradigm, unlike the three languages above.

An example is the stative verb reconstructed as Proto-Germanic &quot;to have&quot;, past indicative third-person singular :
*Old English &lt; , past, third-person singular — derived entirely through regular sound changes.
*Old High German , past, third person singular — derived through analogical spread of suffix -ē-.
*Gothic , past, third-person singular — derived through various analogical changes.
*Old Norse , past, third-person — partly regular, partly analogical.

Only four stative verbs survive as Class III verbs in the northern West Germanic languages (i.e., Old English, Old Saxon, Old Frisian and Old Low Franconian):
* &quot;to say&quot;
* &quot;to live&quot;
* &quot;to hold, have&quot;
* &quot;to think&quot;

However, there are five more verbs that appear as Class III verbs in Old High German, Gothic, and/or Old Norse that also have remnants of the stative conjugation in one or more northern West Germanic languages:
* &quot;to be silent&quot;
* &quot;to be silent&quot;
* &quot;to endure&quot; (normally Class II in Old English, but compare archaic umlauted infinitive ; Class III in Old Norse )
* &quot;to hate&quot;
* &quot;to hate&quot; (normally Class II in Old English, but compare umlauted nominalized present participle &quot;enemy&quot;; Class III in Gothic )

===Class IV Verbs===
Class IV verbs were formed with a suffix -nan, e.g., Gothic &quot;to become full&quot;. The present tense was conjugated as a strong verb, for example, Gothic , etc. The past tense was conjugated with suffix -nō-, e.g., Gothic , etc. This class vanished in other Germanic languages; however, a significant number of cognate verbs appear as Class II verbs in Old Norse and as Class III verbs in Old High German. This class has fientive semantics, that is, &quot;become X,&quot; where X is an adjective or a past participle of a verb.

*Examples of deadjectival Class IV verbs in Gothic are &quot;to become blind&quot; (blinds &quot;blind&quot;), &quot;to become whole&quot; ( &quot;whole&quot;). 
*Examples of deverbal Class IV verbs in Gothic are &quot;to perish&quot; ( &quot;to destroy&quot;), &quot;to dry up, wither away&quot; ( &quot;to wither&quot;), &quot;to be magnified&quot; ( &quot;to magnify&quot;), &quot;to be exalted&quot; ( &quot;to exalt&quot;).

Note that the last two are deverbal even though the underlying root is adjectival because they are formed to other verbs (which are in turn formed from adjectives).

The vast majority of Class IV verbs appear to be deverbal. Class IV verbs derived from weak verbs keep the same stem form as the underlying weak verb. However, class IV verbs derived from strong verbs adopt the ablaut of the past participle, for example:
* &quot;to be torn to pieces&quot; (Class I &quot;to tear to pieces&quot;)
* &quot;to be poured out&quot; (Class II &quot;to pour&quot;)
* &quot;to become unbound&quot; (Class III &quot;to unbind&quot;)
* &quot;to be torn asunder, burst asunder&quot; (Class IV &quot;to tear asunder, burst&quot;)
* &quot;to be exalted&quot; (Class VI &quot;to exalt&quot;)
* &quot;to abound, become larger&quot; (Class VII &quot;to increase, add to&quot;).

==Modern languages==
In the modern languages, the various classes have mostly been leveled into a single productive class. Icelandic, Norwegian and Frisian have retained two productive classes of weak verbs. (In Frisian, in addition to the class with -de, there is a class of je- verbs, where the dental suffix has dropped, i.e., -je &lt; -iad.) Swiss German also has two types of weak verbs, descended from Class I and Classes II and III, respectively, of Old High German weak verbs and marked with -t and -et, respectively, in the past participle.

In the history of English, the following changes happened:

#Most Class III verbs were moved into Class II prior to the historical period of Old English.
#The remaining four Class III verbs moved into Class I or Class II late in Old English.
#Throughout the Middle English period, Class I verbs gradually moved into Class II.

In modern English, only one productive weak paradigm remains, derived from Class II. A number of Class I verbs still persist, for example:

*From Old English subclass (i): bring (brought)
*From Old English subclass (ii) or analogously: buy (bought); catch (caught); seek (sought); sell (sold); teach (taught); tell (told); think (thought); work (wrought) [&quot;obsolescent&quot;]
*From Old English subclass (iii) or analogously: bend (bent); bet (bet); breed (bred); build (built); cast (cast); cost (cost); creep (crept); cut (cut); deal (dealt); dream (dreamt); feed (fed); flee (fled); hear (heard); hit (hit); hurt (hurt); keep (kept); kneel (knelt); knit (knit); lay (laid); lead (led); leap (leapt); leave (left); lend (lent); light (lit); lose (lost); mean (meant); meet (met); put (put); read (read); rend (rent) [&quot;obsolescent&quot;]; send (sent); set (set); shed (shed); shoot (shot); shut (shut); sleep (slept); speed (sped); spend (spent); spill (spilt); split (split); spread (spread); sweep (swept); thrust (thrust); wed (wed); weep (wept); as well as a few others
*From Old English Class III verbs: have (had); say (said)

As the previous list shows, although there is only one productive class of weak verbs, there are plenty of &quot;irregular&quot; weak verbs that do not follow the paradigm of this class. Furthermore, the regular paradigm in English is not unitary, but in fact is divided into subclasses in both the written and spoken language, although in different ways:
*In the written language, before the past-tense suffix -ed, short-stem verbs double the final consonant (e.g., dip [dipped]), while a -y following a consonant becomes -i- (e.g., carry [carried]).
*In the spoken language, the past-tense suffix -ed is variously pronounced , or depending on the preceding consonant.

Both of these characteristics occur in a similar fashion in most or all the modern Germanic languages. In modern German, for example, descendants of the original subclass (ii) of Class I are still irregular (e.g., &quot;to think&quot;, &quot;to burn&quot;), and subclasses of the productive verb paradigm are formed by verbs ending in -eln or -ern and in -ten or -den, among others.

===Modern paradigms===
One of the regular weak verb conjugations is as follows.

====West Germanic====
====North Germanic====
:1. prepare, manufacture

==Weak and strong verbs==
Weak verbs should be contrasted with strong verbs, which form their past tenses by means of &quot;ablaut&quot; (vowel gradation: &quot;sing - sang - sung&quot;). Most verbs in the early stages of the Germanic languages were strong. However, as the ablaut system is no longer productive except in rare cases of analogy. Almost all new verbs in Germanic languages are weak, and the majority of the original strong verbs have become weak by analogy.

===Strong to weak transformations===
As an example of the rather common process of originally strong verbs becoming weak, we may consider the development from the Old English strong verb to modern English &quot;shove&quot;:
* (strong class 2)
* &quot;shove shoved shoved&quot;
Many hundreds of weak verbs in contemporary English go back to Old English strong verbs.

In some cases, a verb has become weak in the preterite but not in the participle and may be thought of as &quot;semi-strong&quot; (not a technical term). Dutch has a number of examples:
* (&quot;to wash&quot;)
* (&quot;to laugh&quot;)

An example in English is:
*&quot;sow sowed sown&quot; (strong class 7 with weak preterite)

Often, the old strong participle may survive as an adjective long after it has been replaced with a weak form in verbal constructions. The English adjective &quot;molten&quot; is an old strong participle of &quot;melt&quot;, which is now a purely weak verb with the participle &quot;melted&quot;. The participle of the German verb (to bake), is gradually being replaced by , but the adjective is always (baked).

===Weak to strong transformations===
The reverse process is very rare and can also be partial, producing &quot;semi-strong&quot; verbs as in &quot;show showed shown&quot; (originally a weak verb with its participle modelled on &quot;sown&quot;)

Weak verbs that develop strong forms are often unstable. A typical example is German (to ask), which is historically weak and is still weak in standard German. However, for a time in the 18th century, the forms by analogy with, for example, (to carry) were also considered acceptable in the standard. They survive today (along with a present tense ) in the Rhinelandic regiolect and underlying dialects. In Dutch, the new strong past of the cognate is standard today, but its past participle is weak (though some dialects do have ).

==Origins==
The weak conjugation of verbs is an innovation of Proto-Germanic (unlike the older strong verbs, the basis of which goes back to Proto-Indo-European). While primary verbs (those inherited from PIE) already had an ablaut-based perfect form that was the basis of the Germanic strong preterite. Secondary verbs (those derived from other forms after the break-up of PIE) had to form a preterite otherwise, which necessitated the creation of the weak conjugation.

===Denominative derivation===
The vast majority of weak verbs are secondary, or derived. The two main types of derived verbs were denominative and deverbative. A denominative verb is one that has been created out of a noun. The denominative in Indo-European and early Germanic was formed by adding an ablauting thematic *-y- suffix to a noun or adjective. This created verbs such as Gothic &#x27;to name&#x27;.

===Causative verbs===
A significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) causative verbs. They are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs. PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented affix &quot;-éy-&quot; to the &quot;o&quot;-grade of a non-derived verb. In Proto-Germanic, causatives are formed by adding a suffix &quot;-j/ij-&quot; (the reflex of PIE &quot;-éy-&quot;) to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE &quot;o&quot;-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with Verner&#x27;s Law voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the &quot;-éy-&quot; suffix):

* (I) &quot;to bite&quot; → &quot;to bridle, yoke, restrain,&quot; i.e., &quot;to make bite down&quot;
* (I) &quot;to rise&quot; → &quot;to raise,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to rise&quot;
* (II) &quot;to bend&quot; → &quot;to bend (transitive)&quot;
* (III) &quot;to burn&quot; → &quot;to burn (transitive)&quot;
* (III) &quot;to perish&quot; → &quot;to destroy,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to perish&quot;
* (V) &quot;to survive&quot; → &quot;to save,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to survive&quot;
* (V) &quot;to lie down&quot; → &quot;to lay,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to lie down&quot;
* (V) &quot;to sit&quot; → &quot;to set, seat,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to sit&quot;
* (VI) &quot;to travel, go&quot; → &quot;to lead, bring,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to go&quot;
* (VI) &quot;to travel, go&quot; → &quot;to carry across,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to travel&quot; (an archaic instance of the &quot;o&quot;-grade ablaut used despite the differing past-tense ablaut)
* (VII) &quot;to weep&quot; → &quot;to cause to weep&quot;
* (I, preterite-present) &quot;(s)he knows&quot; → &quot;to teach,&quot; i.e., &quot;to cause to know&quot;

Essentially, all verbs formed this way were conjugated as Class I weak verbs.

That method of forming causative verbs is no longer productive in the modern Germanic languages, but many relics remain. For example:
*The original strong verb &quot;fall fell fallen&quot; has a related weak verb &quot;fell felled felled&quot;, which means &quot;to cause (a tree) to fall&quot;
*Strong &quot;sit sat sat&quot; and &quot;lie lay lain&quot; are matched with weak &quot;set set set&quot; and &quot;lay laid laid&quot;, meaning &quot;to cause something to sit&quot; or &quot;lie&quot; respectively.

In some cases, phonological or semantic developments make the pairs difficult to recognise. For example:
*&quot;Rear&quot; is the regular phonological development of Proto-Germanic given in the above list, but the connection between &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;rear&quot; is no longer obvious. The word &quot;raise&quot; also ultimately defines from &quot;*raizijaną&quot;, but only via borrowing from Old Norse. The connection is perhaps made more obvious by noting that &quot;to rear a child&quot; is essentially synonymous with &quot;to raise a child&quot;.
*&quot;Drench&quot; was originally the causative of &quot;drink&quot;, but the modern meaning of &quot;drench&quot; (&quot;to cause to get wet&quot;) is no longer similar to &quot;cause to drink&quot;. 
*Similarly, German strong (&quot;to suffer&quot;) has the derived weak verb (&quot;to lead&quot;), which makes sense when one realises that originally meant &quot;walk, go&quot; and came to its present meaning through the idea of &quot;undergoing&quot; suffering.

===Other types===
There are primary verbs that date to Indo-European that took a weak conjugation because they were unable to take a perfect, including verbs that had zero grade of the root in the present and so were unable to show the ablaut distinction necessary for a strong preterite. That was the case with the Gothic verbs &quot;to work, create,&quot; &quot;to buy,&quot; and &quot;to seek.&quot;

Preterite-present verbs are primary verbs in which the PIE present was lost, and the perfect was given a present meaning. They needed a new past tense, which followed the weak pattern.

Most borrowings from other languages into Germanic were weak. However, this was not always the case: for example, &#x27;to write&#x27; from Latin .

===Origin of dental suffix===
The origin of the dental suffix is uncertain. Perhaps the most commonly held theory is that it evolved out of a periphrastic construction with the verb &quot;to do&quot;: Germanic * (&quot;love-did&quot;) &gt; &gt; Old English &gt; &quot;loved&quot; or * (&quot;salve-did&quot;, i.e., &quot;put salve&quot;) &gt; * &gt; Old English &gt; &quot;salved&quot;. That would be analogous to do-support in modern English: &quot;I did love&quot;, &quot;I did salve&quot;.

The common PIE root meaning &#x27;do&#x27; was a root aorist and so did not take a perfect. However, it took a reduplicating present. The imperfect of the root, which filled in the simple past in Germanic, is probably the origin of the dental suffix.

That view is not without objections:
* Germanic has long -ē- in the plural, which cannot directly reflect the Proto-Indo-European situation.
* Reduplication is only in the Gothic plural, not in the singular.

The objections are sometimes answered as follows:
* There might have been a refashioning according to cases like namely, .
* Reduplication only in the plural can easily be explained by haplology in Proto-Germanic ( being reduced to ) for the singular, with a later development of haplology for the plural in non-East Germanic languages.

Another theory is that it came from a past participle ending, a final *&quot;-daz&quot; from PIE *&quot;-tos&quot; (compare Latin ), with personal endings added to it at a later stage. That theory, however, is also disputed because of its inability to explain all the facts.

According to Hill (2010), the endings, which in the singular do not show reduplication in any Germanic language, continue the PIE subjunctive of the root aorist.

==Other meanings==
The term &quot;weak verb&quot; was originally coined by Jacob Grimm, who only applied it to Germanic philology. However, the term is sometimes applied to other language groups to designate phenomena that are not really analogous. For example, Hebrew &quot;irregular&quot; verbs are sometimes called weak verbs because one of their radicals is weak. See weak inflection.

<doc id="172943" wikidata="Q1144624" url="?curid=172943" title="Family Ties">
<text>Family Ties is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC for seven seasons, premiering on September 22, 1982, and concluding on May 14, 1989. The series, created by Gary David Goldberg, reflected the social shift in the United States from the cultural liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s to the conservatism of the 1980s. Because of this, Young Republican Alex P. Keaton (portrayed by Michael J. Fox) develops generational strife with his ex-hippie parents, Steven and Elyse Keaton (portrayed by Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter).

The show premiered on September 22, 1982, and for the first two seasons, aired on Wednesday nights. In the show&#x27;s third season, it started airing on Thursday nights. In 1987, for its sixth season, it was moved to Sunday nights where it stayed until the series&#x27; seventh and final season on May 14, 1989. 

The show won multiple awards, including three consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

==Plot==
Set in Columbus, Ohio, during the Reagan administration, the show depicts Steven and Elyse Keaton (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter) as baby boomers, liberals and former hippies, raising their three children: ambitious, aspiring millionaire entrepreneur Alex (Michael J. Fox); fashion-conscious, gossipy Mallory (Justine Bateman); and tomboy Jennifer (Tina Yothers). Married in 1964, Elyse is an independent architect and Steven, a native of Buffalo, New York, is the station manager of WKS, a local public television station.

Much of the humor of the series focuses on the cultural divide during the 1980s when younger generations rejected the counterculture of the 1960s and embraced the materialism and conservative politics which came to define the 1980s. Alex, the eldest, is a Young Republican who embraces Reaganomics and exhibits conservative attitudes. In contrast to her feminist mother, Mallory is an apolitical and materialistic young woman presented as a vacuous airhead, fodder for jokes and teasing from her brother. Jennifer, an athletic tomboy and the second-youngest child, shares more of the values of her parents and just wants to be a normal kid. Steven and Elyse have a fourth child, Andrew, who is born in early 1985. Alex dotes on his young brother and molds Andy in his conservative image.

Regarding the concept, show creator Goldberg observed, &quot;It really was just an observation of what was going on in my own life with my own friends. We were these old kind of radical people and all of a sudden you&#x27;re in the mainstream ... but now you&#x27;ve got these kids and you&#x27;ve empowered them, and they&#x27;re super intelligent, and they&#x27;re definitely to the right of where you are. They don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s wrong with having money and moving forward.&quot; A recurring theme involved Alex hatching a scheme involving some amount of greedy money-making, which led to a humorous misadventure and ended with Alex being forced to apologize for his choices. According to Goldberg, &quot;We actually had this structure that we&#x27;d inherited from Jim Brooks and Allan [Burns], which was six scenes and a tag ... And then the last scene became Alex apologizes, in every show, we just left it up. Alex apologizes. Some version of it.&quot; Nevertheless, Fox&#x27;s portrayal of a likable Alex proved to be an important part of the show&#x27;s success. Goldberg again stated, &quot;With Alex, I did not think I was creating a sympathetic character. Those were not traits that I aspired to and didn&#x27;t want my kids to aspire to, actually ... But at the end of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, when we went off the air, then &quot;The New York Times&quot; had done a piece and they said, &#x27;Greed with the face of an angel.&#x27; And I think that&#x27;s true ... [Michael J. Fox] would make things work, and the audience would simply not access the darker side of what he&#x27;s actually saying.&quot;

==Cast==
===Main cast===
* Meredith Baxter as Elyse Donnelly Keaton: Steven&#x27;s wife and the mother of Alex, Mallory, Jennifer, and Andy. She is a successful architect and an ex-hippie liberal who lived in California in the 1960s. She is a patient, caring, and loving wife and mother. She met Steven in college where they later married. 
* Michael Gross as Steven Keaton: Elyse&#x27;s husband and father to Alex, Mallory, Jennifer, and Andy. He is a branch manager of the local PBS station (the fictional WKS) and an ex-hippie liberal who lived in California in the 1960s. He can be argumentative at times, but in the end is a diligent and supportive father who cares about his family deeply. He met and married Elyse in college in Berkeley. 
* Michael J. Fox as Alex P. Keaton: the oldest child of Steven and Elyse. He is an intelligent and ambitious Young Republican with two goals in life: to be successful and make money. He goes on to attend Leland University, and has long-term relationships with Ellen Reed and later, Lauren Miller. He often clashes with his parents about their liberal politics, which conflict with his own conservative views. 
* Justine Bateman as Mallory Keaton: the second child and first daughter of Steven and Elyse. She is an unscholarly material girl, but kind-hearted and inoffensive, whose main interests are shopping and boys. She has a longtime relationship with Nick Moore. In the episode &quot;Designated Hitter,&quot; it is revealed that Mallory has a higher I.Q. than scholastic overachiever Alex. 
* Tina Yothers as Jennifer Keaton: third child and second daughter of Elyse and Steven. She is a tomboy whose cares mostly include athletics. She skews more closely to her parents&#x27; liberal views, in contrast to her siblings&#x27; more conservative views. She is shown to be aggressive but sweet. She is shown to be jealous at first of Andy, but later cares for him. 
* Brian Bonsall as Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Keaton (seasons 5–7)
**Garrett and Tyler Merriman as Baby Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Keaton (season 4): the youngest child of Elyse and Steven. He is born during season 3, coinciding with Meredith Baxter&#x27;s real life pregnancy. After he is born, the whole family quickly shows affection and a loving attitude towards him, especially Alex, who attempts to imbue him with conservative values. He quickly ages by about four years between seasons 4 and 5.

===Recurring cast===
* Marc Price as Irwin &quot;Skippy&quot; Handelman
* Scott Valentine as Nick Moore (seasons 4–7)
* Tracy Pollan as Ellen Reed (season 4)
* Courteney Cox as Lauren Miller (seasons 6 &amp; 7)

===Notable guest stars===
* River Phoenix as Eugene Forbes in the episode &quot;My Tutor&quot;
* Jeff Cohen as Marv Jr./Dougie Barker in 2 episodes
* Corey Feldman as Student Walter in the episode &quot;The Disciple&quot;
* Tom Hanks as Ned Donnelly, Elyse&#x27;s younger brother and Alex&#x27;s role model, in 3 episodes
* Martha Plimpton as Jessie Black in the episode &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;
* Wil Wheaton as Timothy Higgins in the episode &quot;&#x27;D&#x27; Is for Date&quot; 
* David Faustino as Keith Baily in the episode &quot;To Snatch a Keith&quot;
* Geena Davis as Karen Nicholson in 2 episodes
* Maura Tierney as Darlene in the episode &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;
* Crispin Glover as Doug in the episode &quot;The Birthday Boy&quot;
* Christina Applegate as Kitten in the episode &quot;Band on the Run&quot;
* Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Susan in the episode &quot;Read It and Weep: Part 2&quot;
* Brownie McGhee as Eddie Dupree in the episode &quot;The Blues Brother&quot;
* Brian McNamara as Greg McCormick in the episode &quot;A, My Name is Alex&quot;

The show had been sold to the network using the pitch &quot;hip parents, square kids.&quot; Originally, Elyse and Steven were intended to be the main characters. However, the audience reacted so positively to Alex during the taping of the fourth episode that he became the focus on the show. Fox had received the role after Matthew Broderick turned it down. Laura Dern was considered for the role of Mallory Keaton. Ed O&#x27;Neill auditioned for Steven Keaton, but he later turned it down as he felt he was not right for the part.

Supporting cast and characters include neighbor Irwin &quot;Skippy&quot; Handelman (Marc Price), who has an eternal crush on Mallory; Nick Moore (Scott Valentine), Mallory&#x27;s Sylvester Stallone-esque artist boyfriend; Lauren Miller (Courteney Cox); and Alex&#x27;s feminist, artist girlfriend Ellen Reed (Tracy Pollan, whom Michael J. Fox later married, in 1988).

==Production==
Main stars Meredith Baxter and Michael Gross are exactly the same age, sharing the same birthday on June 21, 1947. In the series, their characters were intended to be approximately five or six years older, given that their on-screen son, played by Michael J. Fox, was, in fact, only fourteen years younger than Baxter and Gross in real life.

The show had several similarities or parallels to Baxter&#x27;s prior series, &quot;Family&quot;. In addition to similar names for both series, the shows both initially featured three children, the youngest a tomboy, and later added another child to the cast. Baxter played the eldest child on the earlier show, and assumed the role of mother in &quot;Family Ties&quot;.

The theme song &quot;Without Us&quot; (credited in season one as &quot;Us&quot;) was composed by Jeff Barry and Tom Scott in 1982. During the first ten episodes of the first season it was performed by Dennis Tufano and Mindy Sterling. From episode 11 onward the song was performed by original recording artists Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams, as producers were displeased with Tufano&#x27;s and Sterling&#x27;s version. A full-length version of &quot;Without Us&quot; is featured on the 2003 CD release of Mathis and Williams&#x27; duet album &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, released by Columbia Records.

===&quot;At This Moment&quot;===

&quot;At This Moment&quot; was a 1981 single written by songwriter and recording artist Billy Vera and recorded live by Vera and his band, Billy Vera &amp; The Beaters. Five years after its original release, a studio recording of &quot;At This Moment&quot; was featured at the beginning of several episodes of the fourth and early fifth seasons as the love song associated with Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Ellen Reed (Tracy Pollan). Its exposure on &quot;Family Ties&quot; renewed a huge interest in the song. People called and wrote NBC asking for the name of the song and its singer. The tune then began a revived chart run, eventually hitting #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts in January 1987. It also hit the Billboard R&amp;B Chart and the Billboard Hot Country Chart. &quot;At This Moment&quot; quickly sold over a million copies in the United States, becoming one of the last Gold-certified singles in the 45 RPM format. The song crossed over to the R&amp;B and Country formats, reaching #42 Country; as country was moving away from pop influence at the time, &quot;At This Moment&quot; would be the last song to appear on the country charts and reach number one on the pop charts for 13 years.

The first Billy Vera &amp; The Beaters album was recorded live, so when &quot;At This Moment&quot; was used in &quot;Family Ties&quot;, only the live version existed. Vera later explained: &quot;We re-recorded pieces of the song. In other words, they&#x27;d need 12 seconds here, or 20 seconds there in the show. So we went in and recorded just those pieces in the studio without the audience, because the audience would have been annoying, to the TV viewer. The thing that made it work better the second time was that the story of the song, boy-loses-girl, was the story of the episode &quot;Boy Loses Girl.&quot; The first time they used the song, it was when he met the girl.&quot;

&quot;Family Ties&quot; writer Michael Weithorn would later recall: &quot;In 1985, I had written an episode of &quot;Family Ties&quot; to start the fourth season, and we needed a sort of a sad romantic song. I just happened to go into a bar in Los Angeles and saw Billy and the Beaters. That was the perfect song, and the rest was history.&quot; In an interview, Vera talked about his meeting with Weithorn: &quot;One afternoon I got a phone call, and this guy said, &#x27;Hey I produce a show called &quot;Family Ties&quot;, and some of us were at your show the other night, and we heard you do this song that we thought would be perfect for an episode that we have coming up.&#x27; I got my publisher to make a deal for that with them and America responded like crazy.&quot; &quot;NBC called us up, they said, &#x27;My God, we&#x27;ve never had any response like this in the history of the network for a song. The switchboards are lighting up, we&#x27;re getting letters, telegrams, where can we find this song?&#x27; People started calling radio stations, which never happens. I mean, it was a total organic hit.&quot;

On the DVD releases of both &quot;Family Ties&quot;&#x27; fourth and fifth seasons, &quot;At This Moment&quot; is still included and heard in those episodes.

In an interview with Rachael Ray in 2007, Michael J. Fox good-naturedly said, &quot;Tracy and I couldn&#x27;t get on the dance floor anywhere in the world for like ten years without them playing &#x27;What did you think...&quot;

At the 2011 TV Land Awards held in New York City, Billy Vera performed &quot;At This Moment&quot; with the main &quot;Family Ties&quot; cast in attendance that also included Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan, as the show had been nominated for and won Outstanding Fan Favorite.

===Connection to &quot;Day by Day&quot;===
During its final two seasons, &quot;Family Ties&quot; was scheduled on Sunday nights, often followed by &quot;Day by Day&quot;, another series from Ubu Productions. Michael Gross and Brian Bonsall brought their respective roles of Steven and Andy Keaton to the &quot;Day by Day&quot; episode &quot;Trading Places,&quot; which reveals that Steven went to college with Brian Harper (Doug Sheehan). This episode is included on a bonus special-features disc in the &quot;Family Ties: The Complete Series Deluxe Family Album Collection Edition Box Set&quot; DVD.

===Other appearances===
Some characters were featured on &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 60th Birthday&quot;, broadcast on November 13, 1988, on NBC, and featured Justine Bateman, Tina Yothers, and Brian Bonsall as their &quot;Family Ties&quot; characters, trying to help Mickey Mouse when everybody fails to recognize him due to a spell. Michael J. Fox additionally had a cameo in a flashback using archive footage.

==References in other media==
===&quot;Spin City&quot;===
Over a decade after the end of &quot;Family Ties&quot;, Michael J. Fox&#x27;s final episodes on &quot;Spin City&quot; featured numerous allusions to the show. In these episodes, Michael Gross played a therapist for Fox&#x27;s character Michael Patrick Flaherty and the episode contained a reference to an off-screen character named &quot;Mallory&quot;. In the episode, after Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington, D.C., he meets a &quot;conservative junior senator named Alex P. Keaton.&quot; Meredith Baxter also portrayed Mike Flaherty&#x27;s mother, Macy Flaherty, in the two-part episode &quot;Family Affair&quot;.

===&quot;Reunions&quot;===
The main cast of &quot;Family Ties&quot; -- Fox, Gross, Baxter, Bateman, and Yothers, sometimes with a few other recurring cast members -- has reunited publicly on three occasions (along with series creator/producer Gary David Goldberg on two occasions). They first reunited on February 7, 2008 (without supporting players Tracy Pollan, Scott Valentine, Marc Price, Brian Bonsall and Courteney Cox) for an interview on &quot;The Today Show&quot; to help promote Goldberg&#x27;s memoir &quot;Sit, Ubu, Sit&quot;. The cast reunited again (with Pollan and Price, but still without Valentine, Bonsall and Cox) for a second time for the 2011 &quot;TV Land Awards&quot; in March of that year, which included Pollan alongside her husband Fox. That awards show would be the final appearance of Goldberg with the entire group. In October 2015, the main cast reunited for a third time with a second appearance (which included Pollan alongside Fox, but minus Price, Valentine, Bonsall and Cox) on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and the first cast reunion since the 2013 death of Goldberg from cancer.

===&quot;WandaVision&quot;===
The 2021 Marvel Cinematic Universe series for the Disney+ video streaming service, references the series in the fifth episode, &quot;On a Very Special Episode...,&quot; such as a stylized title sequence partially parodying the &quot;Family Ties&quot; opening that depicted the family first as a penciled sketch before finishing as a painted portrait, along with an upbeat theme song praising the family&#x27;s love and closeness. In the episode, Wanda Maximoff and Vision are attempting to navigate raising their new children Tommy and Billy, both of whom are developing superhero abilities of their own.

<doc id="172944" wikidata="Q355236" url="?curid=172944" title="Chroma subsampling">
<text>Chroma subsampling is the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system&#x27;s lower acuity for color differences than for luminance.

It is used in many video and still image encoding schemesboth analog and digitalincluding in JPEG encoding.

==Rationale==
Digital signals are often compressed to reduce file size and save transmission time. Since the human visual system is much more sensitive to variations in brightness than color, a video system can be optimized by devoting more bandwidth to the luma component (usually denoted Y&#x27;), than to the color difference components Cb and Cr. In compressed images, for example, the 4:2:2 Y&#x27;CbCr scheme requires two-thirds the bandwidth of non-subsampled &quot;4:4:4&quot; R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27;. This reduction results in almost no visual difference as perceived by the viewer.

===How subsampling works===
The human vision system (HVS) processes color information (hue and colorfulness) at about a third of the resolution of luminance (lightness/darkness information in an image). Therefore it is possible to sample color information at a lower resolution while maintaining good image quality.

This is achieved by encoding RGB image data into a composite black and white image, with separated color difference data (chroma). For example with formula_1, gamma encoded formula_2 components are weighted and then summed together to create the luma formula_3 component. The color difference components are created by subtracting two of the weighted formula_2 components from the third. A variety of filtering methods can be used to limit the resolution.

====Regarding gamma and transfer functions====
Gamma encoded luma formula_3 should not be confused with linear luminance formula_6. The presence of gamma encoding is denoted with the prime symbol formula_7.

Gamma-correcting electro-optical transfer functions (EOTF) are used due to the nonlinear response of human vision. The use of gamma improves perceived signal-to-noise in analogue systems, and allows for more efficient data encoding in digital systems. This encoding uses more levels for darker colors than for lighter ones, accommodating human vision sensitivity.

==Sampling systems and ratios==
The subsampling scheme is commonly expressed as a three-part ratio &quot;J&quot;:&quot;a&quot;:&quot;b&quot; (e.g. 4:2:2) or four parts, if alpha channel is present (e.g. 4:2:2:4), that describe the number of luminance and chrominance samples in a conceptual region that is &quot;J&quot; pixels wide and 2 pixels high. The parts are (in their respective order):
* &quot;J&quot;: horizontal sampling reference (width of the conceptual region). Usually, 4.

* &quot;a&quot;: number of chrominance samples (Cr, Cb) in the first row of &quot;J&quot; pixels.
* &quot;b&quot;: number of changes of chrominance samples (Cr, Cb) between first and second row of &quot;J&quot; pixels. &quot;b&quot; is usually either zero or equal to &quot;a&quot; (except in rare irregular cases like 4:4:1 and 4:2:1, which do not follow this convention).
* &quot;Alpha&quot;: horizontal factor (relative to first digit). May be omitted if alpha component is not present, and is equal to &quot;J&quot; when present.

This notation is not valid for all combinations and has exceptions, e.g. 4:1:0 (where the height of the region is not 2 pixels, but 4 pixels, so if 8 bits per component are used, the media would be 9 bits per pixel) and 4:2:1.
The mapping examples given are only theoretical and for illustration. Also the diagram does not indicate any chroma filtering, which should be applied to avoid aliasing. To calculate required bandwidth factor relative to 4:4:4 (or 4:4:4:4), one needs to sum all the factors and divide the result by 12 (or 16, if alpha is present).

==Types of sampling and subsampling==

===4:4:4===
Each of the three Y&#x27;CbCr components has the same sample rate, thus there is no chroma subsampling. This scheme is sometimes used in high-end film scanners and cinematic post-production.

&quot;4:4:4&quot; may instead be wrongly referring to R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; color space, which implicitly also does not have any chroma subsampling (except in JPEG R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; can be subsampled). Formats such as HDCAM SR can record 4:4:4 R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; over dual-link HD-SDI.

===4:2:2===
The two chroma components are sampled at half the horizontal sample rate of luma: the horizontal chroma resolution is halved. This reduces the bandwidth of an uncompressed video signal by one-third, which means for 8 bit per component without alpha (24 bit per pixel) only 16 bits are enough, as in NV16.

Many high-end digital video formats and interfaces use this scheme:
* AVC-Intra 100
* Digital Betacam
* Betacam SX
* DVCPRO50 and DVCPRO HD
* Digital-S
* CCIR 601 / Serial digital interface / D-1
* ProRes (HQ, 422, LT, and Proxy)
* XDCAM HD422
* Canon MXF HD422

===4:1:1===
In 4:1:1 chroma subsampling, the horizontal color resolution is quartered, and the bandwidth is halved compared to no chroma subsampling. Initially, 4:1:1 chroma subsampling of the DV format was not considered to be broadcast quality and was only acceptable for low-end and consumer applications. However, DV-based formats (some of which use 4:1:1 chroma subsampling) have been used professionally in electronic news gathering and in playout servers. DV has also been sporadically used in feature films and in digital cinematography.

In the 480i &quot;NTSC&quot; system, if the luma is sampled at 13.5 MHz, then this means that the Cr and Cb signals will each be sampled at 3.375 MHz, which corresponds to a maximum Nyquist bandwidth of 1.6875 MHz, whereas traditional &quot;high-end broadcast analog NTSC encoder&quot; would have a Nyquist bandwidth of 1.5 MHz and 0.5 MHz for the I/Q channels. However, in most equipment, especially cheap TV sets and VHS/Betamax VCRs, the chroma channels have only the 0.5 MHz bandwidth for both Cr and Cb (or equivalently for I/Q). Thus the DV system actually provides a superior color bandwidth compared to the best composite analog specifications for NTSC, despite having only 1/4 of the chroma bandwidth of a &quot;full&quot; digital signal.

Formats that use 4:1:1 chroma subsampling include:
* DVCPRO / D-7 (NTSC and PAL)
* 480i &quot;NTSC&quot; DV and DVCAM

===4:2:0===
In 4:2:0, the horizontal sampling is doubled compared to 4:1:1, but as the Cb and Cr channels are only sampled on each alternate line in this scheme, the vertical resolution is halved. The data rate is thus the same. This fits reasonably well with the PAL color encoding system, since this has only half the vertical chrominance resolution of NTSC. It would also fit extremely well with the SECAM color encoding system, since like that format, 4:2:0 only stores and transmits one color channel per line (the other channel being recovered from the previous line). However, little equipment has actually been produced that outputs a SECAM analogue video signal. In general, SECAM territories either have to use a PAL-capable display or a transcoder to convert the PAL signal to SECAM for display.

Different variants of 4:2:0 chroma configurations are found in:
* All ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T VCEG H.26x video coding standards including H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 implementations (although some profiles of MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC allow higher-quality sampling schemes such as 4:4:4)
* DVD-Video and Blu-ray Disc.
* 576i &quot;PAL&quot; DV and DVCAM
* HDV
* AVCHD and AVC-Intra 50
* Apple Intermediate Codec
* Most common JPEG/JFIF and MJPEG implementations
* VC-1
* WebP
* YJK, a proprietary color space implemented by the Yamaha V9958 graphic chip on MSX2+ computers.

Cb and Cr are each subsampled at a factor of 2 both horizontally and vertically. Most digital video formats corresponding to 576i &quot;PAL&quot; use 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.

==== Sampling positions ====
There are four main variants of 4:2:0 schemes, having different horizontal and vertical sampling siting relative to the 2×2 &quot;square&quot; of the original input size.

* In MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and AVC, &quot;Cb&quot; and &quot;Cr&quot; are taken on midpoint of the left-edge of the 2×2 square. In other words, they have the same horizontal location as the top-left pixel, but is shifted one-half pixel down vertically. Also called &quot;left&quot;.
* In JPEG/JFIF, H.261, and MPEG-1, &quot;Cb&quot; and &quot;Cr&quot; are taken at the center of 2×2 the square. In other words, they are offset one-half pixel to the right and one-half pixel down compared to the top-left pixel. Also called &quot;center&quot;.
* In HEVC for BT.2020 and BT.2100 content (in particular on Blu-rays), &quot;Cb&quot; and &quot;Cr&quot; are sampled at the same location as the group&#x27;s top-left Y pixel (&quot;co-sited&quot;, &quot;co-located&quot;). Also called &quot;top-left&quot;. An analogous co-sited sampling is used in MPEG-2 4:2:2.
* In 4:2:0 PAL-DV (IEC 61834-2), &quot;Cb&quot; is sampled at the same location as the group&#x27;s top-left Y pixel, but &quot;Cr&quot; is sampled one pixel down. It is &quot;also&quot; called &quot;top-left&quot; in ffmpeg.

===== Interlaced and progressive =====
With interlaced material, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling can result in motion artifacts if it is implemented the same way as for progressive material. The luma samples are derived from separate time intervals, while the chroma samples would be derived from both time intervals. It is this difference that can result in motion artifacts. The MPEG-2 standard allows for an alternate interlaced sampling scheme, where 4:2:0 is applied to each field (not both fields at once). This solves the problem of motion artifacts, reduces the vertical chroma resolution by half, and can introduce comb-like artifacts in the image.
Original. This image shows a single field. The moving text has some motion blur applied to it.
4:2:0 progressive sampling applied to moving &quot;interlaced&quot; material. The chroma leads and trails the moving text. This image shows a single field.
4:2:0 interlaced sampling applied to moving &quot;interlaced&quot; material. This image shows a single field.

In the 4:2:0 interlaced scheme, however, vertical resolution of the chroma is roughly halved, since the chroma samples effectively describe an area 2 samples wide by 4 samples tall instead of 2×2. As well, the spatial displacement between both fields can result in the appearance of comb-like chroma artifacts.
Original still image.
4:2:0 progressive sampling applied to a still image. Both fields are shown.
4:2:0 interlaced sampling applied to a still image. Both fields are shown.

If the interlaced material is to be de-interlaced, the comb-like chroma artifacts (from 4:2:0 interlaced sampling) can be removed by blurring the chroma vertically.

===4:1:0===
This ratio is possible, and some codecs support it, but it is not widely used. This ratio uses half of the vertical and one-fourth the horizontal color resolutions, with only one-eighth of the bandwidth of the maximum color resolutions used. Uncompressed video in this format with 8-bit quantization uses 10 bytes for every macropixel (which is 4×2 pixels) or 10 bit for every pixel. It has the equivalent chrominance bandwidth of a PAL-I or PAL-M signal decoded with a delay line decoder, and still very much superior to NTSC.

===3:1:1===
Used by Sony in their HDCAM High Definition recorders (not HDCAM SR). In the horizontal dimension, luma is sampled horizontally at three quarters of the full HD sampling rate 1440 samples per row instead of 1920. Chroma is sampled at 480 samples per row, a third of the luma sampling rate. In the vertical dimension, both luma and chroma are sampled at the full HD sampling rate (1080 samples vertically).

=== Different Cb and Cr rates ===
A number of legacy schemes allow different subsampling factors in Cb and Cr, similar to how a different amount of bandwidth is allocated to the two chroma values in broadcast systems such as CCIR System M. These schemes are not expressible in &quot;J:a:b&quot; notation. Instead, they adopt a &quot;Y:Cb:Cr&quot; notation, with each part describing the amount of resolution for the corresponding component. It is unspecified whether the resolution reduction happens in the horizontal or vertical direction.

* In JPEG, 4:4:2 and 4:2:1 half the vertical resolution of &quot;Cb&quot; compared to 4:4:4 and 4:4:0. 
* In another version of , Cb horizontal resolution is half that of Cr (and a quarter of the horizontal resolution of Y).
* 4:1:0.5 or 4:1:0.25 are variants of 4:1:0 with reduced horizontal resolution on Cb, similar to VHS quality.

==Artifacts==

Chroma subsampling suffers from two main types of artifacts, causing degradation more noticeable than intended where colors change abruptly.

=== Gamma luminance error ===

Gamma-corrected signals like Y&#x27;CbCr have an issue where chroma errors &quot;bleed&quot; into luma. In those signals, a low chroma actually makes a color appear less bright than one with equivalent luma. As a result, when a saturated color blends with an unsaturated or complementary color, a loss of luminance occurs at the border. This can be seen in the example between magenta and green. This issue persists in HDR video where gamma is generalized into a transfer function &quot;EOTF&quot;. A steeper EOTF shows a stronger luminance loss.

Some proposed corrections of this issue are:
* Luma-weighted average (Kornelski, experiment for mozjpeg)
* Iterative &quot;sharp YUV&quot; method, used by WebP and optionally AVIF. Sharp YUV assumes a bilinear upscaling for chroma.
* RGB subsampling in linear space before chroma subsampling (HDRTools)
* Iterative or closed-form luma correction to minimize luminance error (HDRTools)

Rec. 2020 defines a &quot;constant luminance&quot; Yc&#x27;CbcCrc, which is calculated from linear RGB components and then gamma-encoded. This version does not suffer from the luminance loss by design.

=== Gamut clipping ===
Another artifact that can occur with chroma subsampling is that out-of-gamut colors can occur upon chroma reconstruction. Suppose the image consisted of alternating 1-pixel red and black lines and the subsampling omitted the chroma for the black pixels. Chroma from the red pixels will be reconstructed onto the black pixels, causing the new pixels to have positive red and &quot;negative&quot; green and blue values. As displays cannot output negative light (negative light does not exist), these negative values will effectively be clipped, and the resulting luma value will be too high. Other sub-sampling filters (especially the averaging &quot;box&quot;) have a similar issue that is harder to make a simple example out of. Similar artifacts arise in the less artificial example of gradation near a fairly sharp red/black boundary.

It is possible for the decoder to deal with out-of-gamut colors by considering how much chroma a given luma value can hold and distribute it into the 4:4:4 intermediate accordingly, termed &quot;in-range chroma reconstruction&quot; by Glenn Chan. The &quot;proportion&quot; method is in spirit similar to Kornelski&#x27;s luma-weighted average, while the &quot;spill&quot; method resembles error diffusion. Improving chroma reconstruction remains an active field of research.

==Terminology==
The term Y&#x27;UV refers to an analog TV encoding scheme (ITU-R Rec. BT.470) while Y&#x27;CbCr refers to a digital encoding scheme. One difference between the two is that the scale factors on the chroma components (U, V, Cb, and Cr) are different. However, the term YUV is often used erroneously to refer to Y&#x27;CbCr encoding. Hence, expressions like &quot;4:2:2 YUV&quot; always refer to 4:2:2 Y&#x27;CbCr, since there simply is no such thing as 4:x:x in analog encoding (such as YUV). Pixel formats used in Y&#x27;CbCr can be referred to as YUV too, for example yuv420p, yuvj420p and many others.

In a similar vein, the term luminance and the symbol Y are often used erroneously to refer to luma, which is denoted with the symbol Y&#x27;. The &quot;luma&quot; (Y&#x27;) of video engineering deviates from the &quot;luminance&quot; (Y) of color science (as defined by CIE). Luma is formed as the weighted sum of &quot;gamma-corrected&quot; (tristimulus) RGB components. Luminance is formed as a weighed sum of &quot;linear&quot; (tristimulus) RGB components. In practice, the CIE symbol Y is often incorrectly used to denote luma. In 1993, SMPTE adopted Engineering Guideline EG 28, clarifying the two terms. The prime symbol &#x27; is used to indicate gamma correction.

Similarly, the chroma of video engineering differs from the chrominance of color science. The chroma of video engineering is formed from weighted tristimulus components (gamma corrected, OETF), not linear components. In video engineering practice, the terms &quot;chroma&quot;, &quot;chrominance&quot;, and &quot;saturation&quot; are often used interchangeably to refer to chroma, but it is not a good practice, as ITU-T Rec H.273 says.

==History==

Chroma subsampling was developed in the 1950s by Alda Bedford for the development of color television by RCA, which developed into the NTSC standard; luma–chroma separation was developed earlier, in 1938 by Georges Valensi. Through studies, he showed that the human eye has high resolution only for black and white, somewhat less for &quot;mid-range&quot; colors like yellows and greens, and much less for colors on the end of the spectrum, reds and blues. This knowledge allowed RCA to develop a system in which they discarded most of the blue signal after it comes from the camera, keeping most of the green and only some of the red; this is chroma subsampling in the YIQ color space and is roughly analogous to 4:2:1 subsampling, in that it has decreasing resolution for luma, yellow/green, and red/blue.

<text>The Piper PA-28 Cherokee is a family of two-seat or four-seat light aircraft built by Piper Aircraft and designed for flight training, air taxi and personal use. The PA-28 family of aircraft comprises all-metal, unpressurized, single piston-engined airplanes with low mounted wings and tricycle landing gear. They have a single door on the right side, which is entered by stepping on the wing.

The PA-28 is the fourth most produced aircraft in history. The first PA-28 received its type certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration in 1960 and the series remains in production to this day. The Archer was discontinued in 2009, but with investment from new company ownership, the model was put back into production in 2010. As of 2024, five models were in production; the Archer TX and LX, the diesel-powered Archer DX and DLX, and the Pilot 100i.

The PA-28 series competed with the now discontinued, similarly low-winged Grumman American AA-5 series and Beechcraft Musketeer designs and continues to compete with the high-winged Cessna 172.

Piper has created variations within the Cherokee family by installing engines ranging from 140 to 300 hp (105–220 kW), offering turbocharging, retractable landing gear, constant-speed propellers and stretching the fuselage to accommodate six people. The Piper PA-32 (initially known as the &quot;Cherokee Six&quot;) is a larger, six-seat variant of the PA-28. The PA-32R Saratoga variant was in production until 2009.

==Development==

At the time of the Cherokee&#x27;s introduction, Piper&#x27;s primary single-engined, all-metal aircraft was the Piper PA-24 Comanche, a larger, faster aircraft with retractable landing gear and a constant-speed propeller. Karl Bergey, Fred Weick and John Thorp designed the Cherokee as a less expensive alternative to the Comanche, with lower manufacturing and parts costs to compete with the Cessna 172, although some later Cherokees also featured retractable gear and constant-speed propellers.
The Cherokee and Comanche lines continued in parallel production, serving different market segments for over a decade, until Comanche production was ended in 1972, to be replaced by the Piper PA-32R family.

===Original design===
The original Cherokees were the Cherokee (PA-28-150 and PA-28-160), which started production in 1961 (unless otherwise mentioned, the model number always refers to horsepower).

In 1962, Piper added the Cherokee 180 (PA-28-180) powered by a Lycoming O-360 engine. The extra power made it practical to fly with all four seats filled (depending on passenger weight and fuel loading) and the model remains popular on the used-airplane market. In 1968, the cockpit was modified to replace the &quot;push-pull&quot;-style engine throttle controls with quadrant levers. In addition, a third window was added to each side, giving the fuselage the more modern look seen in most recent production.

Piper continued to expand the line rapidly. In 1963, the company introduced the even more powerful Cherokee 235 (PA-28-235), which competed favorably with the Cessna 182 Skylane for load-carrying capability. The Cherokee 235 featured a Lycoming O-540 engine de-rated to and a longer wing which would eventually be used for the Cherokee Six. It included tip tanks of capacity each, bringing the total fuel capacity of the Cherokee 235 to . The aircraft had its fuselage stretched in 1973, giving more leg room in the rear. The stabilator area was also increased. In 1973, the marketing name was changed from &quot;235&quot; to &quot;Charger&quot;. In 1974, it was changed again to &quot;Pathfinder&quot;. Production of the Pathfinder continued until 1977. No 1978 models were built. In 1979, the aircraft was given the Piper tapered wing and the name was changed again, this time to Dakota.

In 1964, the company filled in the bottom end of the line with the Cherokee (PA-28-140), which was designed for training and initially shipped with only two seats. The PA-28-140 engine was slightly modified shortly after its introduction to produce , but kept the -140 name.

In 1967, Piper introduced the PA-28R-180 Cherokee Arrow. This aircraft featured a constant-speed propeller and retractable landing gear and was powered by a Lycoming IO-360-B1E engine. A version powered by a Lycoming IO-360-C1C was offered as an option beginning in 1969 and designated the PA-28R-200; the model was dropped after 1971. At the time the Arrow was introduced, Piper removed the Cherokee 150 and Cherokee 160 from production.

The Arrow II came out in 1972, featuring a fuselage stretch to increase legroom for the rear-seat passengers. In 1977, Piper introduced the Arrow III (PA-28R-201), which featured a semi-tapered wing and longer stabilator, a design feature that had previously been introduced successfully on the PA-28-181 which provided better low-speed handling. It also featured larger fuel tanks, increasing capacity from .

The first turbocharged model, the PA-28R-201T, was also offered in 1977, powered by a six-cylinder Continental TSIO-360-F engine equipped with a Rajay turbocharger. A three-bladed propeller was optional.

In 1979, the Arrow was restyled again as the PA-28RT-201 Arrow IV, featuring a &quot;T&quot; tail.

In 1971, Piper released a Cherokee 140 variant called the Cherokee Cruiser 2+2. Although the plane kept the 140 designation, it was, in fact, a plane and was shipped mainly as a four-seat version. In 1973, the Cherokee 180 was named the Cherokee Challenger and had its fuselage lengthened slightly and its wings widened and the Cherokee 235 was named the Charger with similar airframe modifications. In 1974, Piper changed the marketing names of some of the Cherokee models again, renaming the Cruiser 2+2 (140) simply the Cruiser, the Challenger to the Archer (model PA-28-181), and the Charger (235) to Pathfinder.

Piper reintroduced the Cherokee 150 in 1974, renaming it the Cherokee Warrior (PA-28-151) and giving it the Archer&#x27;s stretched body and a new, semi-tapered wing.

In 1977, Piper stopped producing the Cruiser (140) and Pathfinder (235), but introduced a new plane, the Dakota (PA-28-236), based on the Cherokee 235, Charger, and Pathfinder models, but with the new semi-tapered wing.

The PA-28-201T Turbo Dakota followed the introduction of the PA-28-236 Dakota in 1979. The airframe was essentially the same as a fixed-gear Arrow III and was powered by a turbocharged Continental TSIO-360-FB engine producing . The aircraft did not sell well and production ended in 1980.

In 1977, Piper upgraded the Warrior to PA-28-161, changing its name to Cherokee Warrior II. This aircraft had slightly improved aerodynamic wheel fairings introduced in 1978. Later models of the Warrior II, manufactured after July 1982, incorporated a gross weight increase to , giving a useful load over . This same aircraft, now available with a glass cockpit, was available as the Warrior III and was marketed as a training aircraft.
===PA-32===
In 1965, Piper developed the Piper Cherokee Six, designated the PA-32, by stretching the PA-28 design. It features a lengthened fuselage and seating for one pilot and five passengers.

===Brazilian, Argentinian and Chilean production===

PA-28s were built under license in Brazil as the Embraer EMB-711A and EMB-711C Corisco (PA-28R-200), EMB-711B (PA-28R-201), EMB-711T (PA-28RT-201) and EMB-711ST Corisco Turbo (PA-28RT-201T) and the EMB-712 Tupi (PA-28-181). Argentinian production was carried out by Chincul SACAIFI of San Juan, Argentina. Chincul S. A. built 960 airplanes between 1972 and 1995, including the Cherokee Archer, Dakota, Arrow and Turbo Arrow. The PA-28-236 Dakota was also assembled under license by the Maintenance Wing of the Chilean Air Force (which later became known as ENAER). By September 1982, 20 Dakotas had been assembled in Chile.

===New Piper Aircraft===
The original Piper Aircraft company declared bankruptcy in 1991. In 1995, the New Piper Aircraft company was created. It was renamed Piper Aircraft once again in 2006. The company originally produced one variant, the 180-horsepower (134 kW) Archer LX (PA-28-181), and began testing two diesel versions, with 135 and 155 hp.

As of 2022, five variants of the PA-28 are in production:

* Archer TX and LX with a Lycoming IO-360-A4M engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G1000 avionics suite
* Archer DX and DLX with a Continental CD-155 engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and a Garmin G1000 avionics suite
* Pilot 100i with a Lycoming IO-360-B4A engine, a TAS maximum cruise speed, range and Garmin G3X avionics.

==Design==

===Wing===
Originally, all Cherokees had a constant-chord, rectangular planform wing, popularly called the &quot;Hershey Bar&quot; wing because of its resemblance to the convex, rectangular chocolate bar.

Beginning with the Warrior in 1974, Piper switched to a semi-tapered wing with the NACA 652-415 profile and a wingspan. The constant chord is maintained from the root to mid-wing, at which point a tapered section sweeping backwards on the leading edge continues until the tip. Both Cherokee wing variants have an angled wing root; i.e., the wing chord is greater at the root, with the leading edge swept back as it leaves the fuselage body, rather than the wing meeting the body at a perpendicular angle.

Debate is ongoing about the relative benefits of the two wing shapes. According to the Cherokee&#x27;s lead designer, Fred Weick, the semi-tapered wing was introduced to &quot;improve stall characteristics and increase wingspan,&quot; and side-by-side testing of the two shapes found that with the semitapered wing, &quot;the plane had better climb and flatter flight characteristics&quot; The original 1974 version of the wing had a structural weakness that caused a structural failure during an aerobatic maneuver, but that was fixed for all later wings. According to Terry Lee Rogers (summarizing interviews with Weick), &quot;the outboard wing sections had a different taper than the wing root, which permitted them to retain control even when the inboard sections were stalled.&quot;

However, designer John Thorp, who collaborated with Weick in the late 1950s on an early 180 hp version of the PA-28 (with Hershey-bar wings) and was not involved in the later semi-tapered design, publicly disagreed: &quot;Tapered wings tend to stall outboard, reducing aileron effectiveness and increasing the likelihood of a rolloff into a spin.&quot;

Aviation journalist Peter Garrison is also in the Hershey-bar wing camp, claiming that the semitapered shape has a neutral effect on drag: &quot;to prevent tip stall, designers have resorted to providing the outboard portions of tapered wings with more cambered airfoil sections, drooped or enlarged leading edges, fixed or automatic leading edge slots or slats and most commonly, wing twist or &quot;washout&quot;. The trouble with these fixes is that they all increase the drag, cancelling whatever benefit the tapered wing was supposed to deliver in the first place.&quot;

===Flight controls===

For the Cherokee family, Piper used their traditional flight-control configuration. The horizontal tail is a stabilator with an antiservo tab (sometimes termed an antibalance tab). The antiservo tab moves in the same direction of the stabilator movement, making pitch control &quot;heavier&quot; as the stabilator moves out of the trimmed position. Flaps can extend up to 40° and 25° flaps are normally used for a short- or soft-field takeoff. The ailerons, flaps, stabilator and stabilator trim are all controlled using cables and pulleys.

In the cockpit, all Cherokees use control yokes rather than sticks, together with rudder pedals. The pilot operates the flaps manually using a Johnson bar located between the front seats: for zero degrees, the lever is flat against the floor and is pulled up to select the detent positions of 10, 25, and 40°.

Older Cherokees use an overhead crank for stabilator trim (correctly called an antiservo tab), while later ones use a trim wheel on the floor between the front seats, immediately behind the flap bar.

All Cherokees have a brake lever under the pilot side of the instrument panel. Differential toe brakes on the rudder pedals were an optional add-on for earlier Cherokees and became standard with later models.

Some earlier Cherokees used control knobs for the throttle, mixture, and propeller advance (where applicable), while later Cherokees use a collection of two or three control levers in a throttle quadrant.

Cherokees normally include a rudder trim knob, which actually controls a set of springs acting on the rudder pedals rather than an external trim tab on the rudder—in other words, the surface is trimmed by control tension rather than aerodynamically.

<doc id="172949" wikidata="Q3481903" url="?curid=172949" title="Strong inflection">
<text>A strong inflection is a system of verb conjugation or noun/adjective declension which can be contrasted with an alternative system in the same language, which is then known as a weak inflection. The term &quot;strong&quot; was coined with reference to the Germanic verb, but has since been used of other phenomena in these and other languages, which may or may not be analogous. Note that there is nothing objectively &quot;strong&quot; about a strong form; the term is only meaningful in opposition to &quot;weak&quot; as a means of distinguishing paradigms within a single language. Nor is there any distinguishing feature common to all strong forms, except that they are always counterpoints to &quot;weak&quot; ones.

The Germanic strong verb, occurring in Germanic languages including German and English, is characterised by a vowel shift called ablaut. Examples in English include &quot;give/gave, come/came, fall/fell&quot;. There is nothing comparable in the German strong adjective inflections. For a full discussion of this distinction see weak inflection. </text><links>

<text>Demogroups are teams of demosceners, who make computer based audio-visual works of art known as demos. Demogroups form a subculture collectively known as the demoscene.

Groups frequently consist of students, young computer enthusiasts who spend days coding their demos. They often have a pseudonym (called a &quot;handle&quot; or &quot;nick&quot;), usually chained together with the name of their group (in formats like &quot;Scener of Demo Group&quot; or &quot;Scener/DG&quot;). Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene&#x27;s roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.

Many demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via Bulletin Board Systems or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is IRC. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at demoparties and smaller meetings.

Demogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate wordmarks, logos, catchphrases, and slogans for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for &quot;managing the group&#x27;s human resources&quot;, i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying &quot;trial periods&quot; in which the new member has to prove themself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often tongue-in-cheek), to maintain an &quot;elite&quot; image for the group.

A group is perhaps the most important social unit in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several &quot;one-man groups&quot; when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.

==Demography==
, the countries with the most active demogroups and demoparties are the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark), Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary and France.

Due to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon.

==Demoscener functions==
Demosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder-musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend.

===Coder===
The coder is the demogroup&#x27;s programmer who creates the demo&#x27;s software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and APIs for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as fractals or metaballs.

In the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo&#x27;s flow and arrangement, including the effect&#x27;s synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as &quot;demotools&quot; are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.

In many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with &quot;coder music&quot; which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. &quot;Coder graphics&quot; and &quot;coder palettes&quot; are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.

===Graphic artist===
Graphic artists (or &quot;graphicians&quot; in scene lingo) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation.

Originally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as (3D) modelers.

===Musicians===
Musicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering (and in some cases, performing) the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo.

In the older days, musicians worked with trackers, and the world of tracked music was heavily dominated by demoscene musicians. In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional music sequencers. However, tracked music and other specialized formats still continue to be used in size-restricted intros as well as demos written for more restrictive platforms such as mobile devices and vintage computers.

==Fake groups==
Demosceners often form fake groups, which are essentially secret identities for making humorous or vulgar productions without scathing their original reputation - people in a fake group hide behind a pseudonym (which, considering their demoscene handles, usually becomes a pseudo-pseudonym). This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse naïve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof.

==&quot;One-man&quot; groups==
Though they are not strictly &quot;demogroups&quot; by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working.

One-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because they&#x27;re not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later.

Perhaps the most successful one-man army of the demoscene is Dmitry &quot;AND&quot; Andreev, two-time winner of the Assembly demo party in the 64k intro category.

<doc id="172959" wikidata="Q824340" url="?curid=172959" title="Demoscene">
<text>The demoscene () is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audiovisual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions (graphics, music, videos, games) are shared, voted on and released online at festivals known as demoparties.

The scene started with the home computer revolution of the early 1980s, and the subsequent advent of software cracking. Crackers altered the code of computer games to remove copy protection, claiming credit by adding introduction screens of their own (&quot;cracktros&quot;). They soon started competing for the best visual presentation of these additions. Through the making of intros and stand-alone demos, a new community eventually evolved, independent of the gaming and software sharing scenes.

Demos are informally classified into several categories, mainly of size-restricted intros. The most typical competition categories for intros are the 64k intro and the 4K intro, where the size of the executable file is restricted to 65536 and 4096 bytes, respectively. In other competitions the choice of platform is restricted; only 8-bit computers like the Atari 800 or Commodore 64, or the 16-bit Amiga or Atari ST. Such restrictions provide a challenge for coders, musicians, and graphics artists, to make a device do more than was intended in its original design.

==History==
The earliest computer programs that have some resemblance to demos and demo effects can be found among the so-called display hacks. Display hacks predate the demoscene by several decades, with the earliest examples dating back to the early 1950s.

Demos in the demoscene sense began as software crackers&#x27; &quot;signatures&quot;, that is, crack screens and crack intros attached to software whose copy protection was removed. The first crack screens appeared on the Apple II in the early 1980s, and they were often nothing but plain text screens crediting the cracker or their group. Gradually, these static screens evolved into increasingly impressive-looking introductions containing animated effects and music. Eventually, many cracker groups started to release intro-like programs separately, without being attached to unlicensed software. These programs were initially known by various names, such as &quot;letters&quot; or &quot;messages&quot;, but they later came to be known as &quot;demos&quot;.

In 1980, Atari, Inc. began using a looping demo with visual effects and music to show the features of the Atari 400/800 computers in stores. At the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show, Atari showed a demoscene-style demo for its latest 8-bit computers that alternated between a 3D walking robot and a flying spaceship, each with its own music, and animating larger objects than typically seen on those systems; the two sections were separated by the Atari logo. The program was released to the public. Also in 1985, a large, spinning, checkered ball—casting a translucent shadow—was the signature demo of what the hardware was capable of when Commodore&#x27;s Amiga was announced.

Simple demo-like music collections were put together on the C64 in 1985 by Charles Deenen, inspired by crack intros, using music taken from games and adding some homemade color graphics. In the following year, the movement now known as the demoscene was born. The Dutch groups 1001 Crew and The Judges, both Commodore 64-based, are often mentioned among the earliest demo groups. While competing with each other in 1986, they both produced pure demos with original graphics and music involving more than just casual work, and used extensive hardware trickery. At the same time demos from others, such as Antony Crowther, had started circulating on Compunet in the United Kingdom.

==Culture==
The demoscene is mainly a European phenomenon. It is a competition-oriented subculture, with groups and individual artists competing against each other in technical and artistic excellence. Those who achieve excellence are dubbed &quot;elite&quot;, while those who do not follow the demoscene&#x27;s implicit rules are called &quot;lamers&quot;; such rules emphasize creativity over &quot;ripping&quot; (or else using with permission) the works of others, having good contacts within the scene, and showing effort rather than asking for help. Both this competitiveness and the sense of cooperation among demosceners have led to comparisons with the earlier hacker culture in academic computing. The demoscene is a closed subculture, which seeks and receives little mainstream public interest. , the size of the scene was estimated at some 10,000.

In the early days, competition came in the form of setting records, like the number of &quot;bobs&quot; (blitter objects) on the screen per frame, or the number of DYCP (Different Y Character Position) scrollers on a C64. These days, there are organized competitions, or compos, held at demoparties, although there have been some online competitions. It has also been common for diskmags to have voting-based charts which provide ranking lists for the best coders, graphicians, musicians, demos and other things.

In 2020, Finland added its demoscene to its national UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. It is the first digital subculture to be put on an intangible cultural heritage list.
In 2021, Germany and Poland also added its demoscene to its national UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage, followed by Netherlands in 2023.

===Groups===
Demosceners typically organize in small groups, centered around a coder (programmer), a musician, a graphician (graphics designer) and a swapper (who spreads their own and others&#x27; creations by mail).

Groups always have names, and similarly the individual members pick a handle by which they will be addressed in the large community. While the practice of using handles rather than real names is a borrowing from the cracker/warez culture, where it serves to hide the identity of the cracker from law enforcement, in the demoscene (oriented toward legal activities) it mostly serves as a manner of self-expression. Group members tend to self-identify with the group, often extending their handle with their group&#x27;s name, following the patterns &quot;&quot;Handle&quot; of &quot;Group&quot; or &quot;Handle&quot;/&quot;Group&quot;&quot;.

==Parties==

A demoparty is an event where demosceners and other computer enthusiasts gather to take part in competitions, nicknamed &quot;compos&quot;, where they present demos (short audio-visual presentations of computer art) and other works such as digital art and music. A typical demoparty is a non-stop event spanning a weekend, providing the visitors a lot of time to socialize. The competing works, at least those in the most important competitions, are usually shown at night, using a video projector and loudspeakers. 

The most important competition is usually the &quot;demo compo&quot;. The Assembly is the biggest demoscene party. The Gathering became more of a players&#x27; party, the worlds largest computerparty.

===Concept===
The visitors of a demoparty often bring their own computers to compete and show their works. To this end, most parties provide a large hall with tables, electricity and usually a local area network connected to the Internet. In this respect, many demoparties resemble LAN parties, and many of the largest events also gather gamers and other computer enthusiasts in addition to demosceners. A major difference between a real demoparty and a LAN party is that demosceners typically spend more time socializing (often outside the actual party hall) than in front of their computers.

===List of demoparties===

==64K intro==
A 64K intro is a demo with an executable file size limit of 64 kibibytes, or 65,536 bytes. This is a traditional limit inherited from the maximum size of a COM file. Demos traditionally were limited by RAM size, or later by storage size. By the early 1990s, demo sizes grew, so categories were created for limited sizes that forced developers to not simply stream data from storage.

To reduce the file size, 64K intros often use executable compression and procedural generation, such as sound synthesis, mesh generation, procedural textures, and procedural animation.
fr-08, a 64k PC demo by Farbrausch released at The Party 2000 in Aars has since been claimed to mark a in the popularity of the category. Others include Chaos Theory by Conspiracy (2006), Gaia Machina by Approximate (2012), F — Felix&#x27;s Workshop by Ctrl-Alt-Test (2012) Fermi paradox by Mercury (2016), and Darkness Lay Your Eyes Upon Me by Conspiracy (2016).

==Awards==

Every year, awards in the demoscene celebrate the creativity, technical prowess, and artistic vision of demoscene groups and individuals:

* The Scene.org Awards were an annual award presented by Scene.org from 2003 to 2012.
* The Meteoriks are an annual award that happens every year since 2014. The award ceremony is held at Revision.

==Influence==

Although demos are a rather obscure form of art, even in traditionally active demoscene countries, the scene has influenced areas such as computer games industry and new media art.

Many European game programmers, artists, and musicians have come from the demoscene, often cultivating the learned techniques, practices and philosophies in their work. For example, the Finnish company Remedy Entertainment, known for the Max Payne series of games, was founded by the PC group Future Crew, and most of its employees are former or active Finnish demosceners.
Sometimes demos even provide direct influence even to game developers that have no demoscene affiliation: for instance, Will Wright names demoscene as a major influence on the Maxis game Spore, which is largely based on procedural content generation. Similarly, at QuakeCon in 2011, John Carmack noted that he &quot;thinks highly&quot; of people who do 64k intros, as an example of artificial limitations encouraging creative programming. Jerry Holkins from Penny Arcade claimed to have an &quot;abiding love&quot; for the demoscene, and noted that it is &quot;stuff worth knowing&quot;.

Certain forms of computer art have a strong affiliation with the demoscene. Tracker music, for example, originated in the Amiga game industry but was soon heavily dominated by demoscene musicians; producer Adam Fielding claims to have tracker/demoscene roots. Currently, there is a major tracking scene separate from the actual demoscene. A form of static computer graphics where demosceners have traditionally excelled is pixel art; see &quot;artscene&quot; for more information on the related subculture. Origins of creative coding tools like Shadertoy and Three.js can be directly traced back to the scene.

Over the years, desktop computer hardware capabilities have improved by orders of magnitude, and so for most programmers, tight hardware restrictions are no longer a common issue. Nevertheless, demosceners continue to study and experiment with creating impressive effects on limited hardware. Since handheld consoles and cellular phones have comparable processing power or capabilities to the desktop platforms of old (such as low resolution screens which require pixel art, or very limited storage and memory for music replay), many demosceners have been able to apply their niche skills to develop games for these platforms, and earn a living doing so. One particular example is &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, whose lead designer Jaakko Iisalo was an active and well-known demoscener in the 1990s. Unity Technologies is another notable example; its technical leads on iPhone, Android and Nintendo Switch platforms Renaldas Zioma and Erik Hemming are authors of &quot;Suicide Barbie&quot; demo for the Playstation Portable console, which was released in 2007.

Some attempts have been made to increase the familiarity of demos as an art form. For example, there have been demo shows, demo galleries and demoscene-related books, sometimes even TV programs introducing the subculture and its works.

The museum IT-ceum in Linköping, Sweden, has an exhibition about the demoscene.

===Video game industry===
4players.de reported that &quot;numerous&quot; demo and intro programmers, artists, and musicians were employed in the games industry by 2007. Video game companies with demoscene members on staff included Digital Illusions, Starbreeze, Ascaron, 49Games, Remedy, Techland, Lionhead Studios, Bugbear, Digital Reality, Guerrilla Games, and Akella.

The tracker music which is part of demoscene culture could be found in many video games of the late 1980s to early 2000s, such as &quot;Lemmings&quot;, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, &quot;One Must Fall: 2097&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Unreal&quot; series, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, and &quot;Uplink&quot;.

<doc id="172960" wikidata="Q1431344" url="?curid=172960" title="Galway Airport">
<text>Galway Airport is an airport located at Carnmore, east of Galway City, County Galway, Ireland, managed by &quot;Corrib Airport Limited&quot;. Its last scheduled passenger traffic was on 31 October 2011, when Aer Arann ceased commercial operations at the airport. At 1289 m (4230 ft), the runway is too short to handle most jet airliners and so scheduled services were restricted to turboprop aircraft or small executive jets. At peak, the airport served over 300,000 passengers annually, with 16 destinations. 

The airport briefly re-opened in 2015, but since then remains closed to commercial traffic, being used only by the Galway Flying Club.

In 2021, plans were announced to redevelop the site as a film studio, to launch in 2022 but as of 2023, these have not proceeded, and there have been discussions about future ownership options. The airport has been used as a site for concerts.

==History==

In 1918, a landing ground was built for the Royal Flying Corps at nearby Oranmore. It was later used by Aer Arann, a local flying club and airline, and private operators. However, it remained a grass strip and was virtually unusable in winter. Ernest Steiner, a German businessman, built his own strip opposite his factory at Carnmore. Aer Arann moved in also and commenced operations from there in 1974.

The runway was extended to 1,200 metres and completed on 2 March 1987. Although it could accommodate larger aircraft it remained unsuitable for jet airliners and was entirely served by regional turboprop aircraft such as the French-Italian ATR-42. The first jet arrived at the airport on 30 March from Ohio, United States. It was a 12-seater Gulf-Stream II, and many more small business jets used the airport. A terminal and runway lighting project was completed by June of that year.

In January 1988, Aer Lingus re-introduced the Dublin route; in March Ryanair launched a new route to London Luton and later re-routed it to Stansted. The two airlines went into a business war, Ryanair offering cheap flights direct to London and Aer Lingus to Heathrow, Amsterdam, and Paris on selected days via Dublin. In 1991, due to business restructuring, Ryanair withdrew their London service and Aer Lingus were soon to follow.

In 1994, Aer Arann began the Dublin route supported by the state-funded public service obligation scheme. The route operated three times daily until state funding was withdrawn in 2011 and the airline ceased services on the route. In September 2001, they launched a service to London Luton and the load factor by 2003 was at 73%. The one-millionth passenger passed through the airport in April 2002. The airport was gaining in popularity and in 2003 Aer Arann launched two more routes to Manchester and Edinburgh with two further routes to Birmingham and Lorient launched in 2004.
By 2007, Galway was officially the fastest growing airport in Ireland, fast exceeding international airports with passenger growth at 63% per annum at that time. Sixteen destinations were served directly, Bristol, Cardiff, Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh, Leeds Bradford, London Luton, Lorient, Manchester, Newcastle, Belfast City, Birmingham, Southampton, Bordeaux, Faro and Málaga. That year saw a record of 309,000 passengers use the airport. The two millionth passenger also passed through in that year. 

On 21 February 2007, the Government of Ireland announced that it was providing €6.3 million in capital grant money for Galway Airport. In 2008, this allocation was reduced by 50–60% as a result of national budget cutbacks. Aer Arann added a service to Amsterdam in 2008 which operated via Waterford Airport but was discontinued after a short period. 

After 2008, numbers and routes dropped considerably with only Aer Arann routes to Luton, Lorient (seasonal), Manchester and Edinburgh remaining. In 2010, Manx2 added two services – Belfast International and Cork; these services were withdrawn in 2011. In March 2011, Aer Arann launched twice-daily flights to Southend Airport. An additional &quot;Development Fee&quot; of €10 was charged to all departing passengers aged 12 years and over.

In June 2011, the Irish government announced that funding for Galway Airport would cease by December 2011. The government stated that the decision was taken to focus on the four other regional airports, which would receive state funding for 2012. On 12 October 2011, Aer Arann announced that it was to suspend its services from Galway for the winter season, commencing on 31 October. This meant that there were no scheduled services from Galway. Airport management stated that the airport would remain open. Galway was the second Irish airport after Sligo Airport to have its scheduled services suspended in 2011. In February 2012, workers at the airport staged a sit-in to protest against the risk that their redundancy payments might not materialise after the airport&#x27;s bankers had seized its working capital.

In 2013, the two local authorities, Galway City Council and Galway County Council, took control of the airport. In November 2013, it was announced that the airport&#x27;s aviation licence would cease, effectively closing the facility.

In January 2015, Galway Airport briefly reopened to commercial flights. The airport was being operated under licence from Galway County Council until May 2015 by Carnmore Aviation Ltd., a company owned by the Conneely Group in Ballinasloe. The Group also owns Weston Airport near Dublin, and the staff was shared between the airports. &quot;It is only a small step but great to have commercial aviation back at Galway Airport.&quot; The airport closed for commercial traffic in 2016, and thereafter was only used by a local flying club.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic the Irish Health Authorities used the Airport buildings as one of the venues for their public COVID-19 testing programme.

In 2021, plans were announced to redevelop the site as a studio for film and TV production, to launch in 2022 but as of 2023, these have not proceeded, in part, apparently, due to the limited duration of the planning permission granted. There have been discussions at Galway City and County Councils about future ownership options.

==General aviation==
Galway Flying Club has used the airport for fixed-wing training and leisure flying.

==Statistics==

<doc id="172965" wikidata="Q698745" url="?curid=172965" title="Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam">
<text>is a 1985 Japanese television anime series, the second installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, and a sequel to the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. The show was created and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, with character designs by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, while the series&#x27; mechanical designs are split among Kunio Okawara, Mamoru Nagano, and Kazumi Fujita. The series was originally aired on Nagoya Broadcasting Network and its sister ANN stations between 1985 and 1986.

The plot is set in the futuristic &quot;Universal Century&quot; timeline and takes place eight years after the events of the original series. &quot;Zeta&quot; centers on a new conflict that is formed between two new factions - the Titans, a corrupt task force formed by the Earth Federation, and the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG), a rebel group that seeks to end the Titans. The show is told through the perspective of Kamille Bidan, a teenage member of the AEUG and pilot of the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II, and later the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam. Several main characters from the previous &quot;Gundam&quot; series return in supporting roles, including Amuro Ray and his rival Char Aznable, the latter of which returns as a pilot for the AEUG under the new identity of Quattro Bajeena.

Often regarded as one of the best shows in the franchise, the series is praised for its dark themes, characters, and its improvements over its predecessor. Between 2005 and 2006, the series was reproduced and compiled into a film trilogy, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation. Though still directed by Tomino, it involved many changes in the original storyline. The films were considered to be a success in Japan.

== Plot ==
Set in the year Universal Century (UC) 0087, eight years after the events of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (0079), and four years after the events of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory&quot; (0083 to 0084) the series follows a rebel group called the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) as they try to defeat the Titans, an elite task force of the Earth Federation designed to hunt down Zeon remnants but which ruthlessly kills anyone demanding equal rights for the space citizens in cold blood.

The story of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; is told through the viewpoint of Kamille Bidan, a civilian teenager and amateur mobile suit pilot whose parents are engineers working for the Earth Federation and the Titans. While traveling to the Green Noa colony to meet his parents, Kamille is insulted by and strikes a Titans officer named Jerid Messa. Following an AEUG attack led by Quattro Bajeena on the colony to capture a trio of Gundam Mk-II mobile suits undergoing field tests, Kamille takes the opportunity to steal Messa&#x27;s Mk-II to repel the attack and follows Quattro back to the AEUG mothership &quot;Argama&quot;. The Titans, under the order of Bask Om, take Kamille&#x27;s parents in an attempt to force the return of the stolen Gundam Mk-IIs. Jerid, unaware of the hostage plot, mistakenly kills Kamille&#x27;s mother. Because of this, and many other reasons, Kamille eventually joins the AEUG.

As the war escalates, Kamille encounters people from all sides of the conflict, including brainwashed Titans, artificial Newtypes, and the leaders of Anaheim Electronics, who are secretly funding the AEUG. The AEUG eventually launch a full-scale attack on the Earth Federation&#x27;s assembly at Dakar, leading to an Earth Sphere civil war. Quattro reveals himself to be Char Aznable and presents evidence of the Titans&#x27; tyranny including using G3 nerve gas on a defenseless colony. The Earth Federation court soon rules the Titans&#x27; actions to be illegal and backs the AEUG in hunting down the Titans&#x27; leader Jamitov Hymem.

After losing the support of the Earth Federation, the Titans turn to their original enemy, remnants of the Principality of Zeon now known as the Axis Zeon, to form an alliance to regain control of the Earth Sphere. Axis Zeon&#x27;s leader Haman Karn contacts the AEUG, using the civil war of the Earth Federation at hand to politically ask for the control of Side 3, the former Zeon colony.

Axis involvement and Jamitov&#x27;s assassination by Jupiter Fleet commander Paptimus Scirocco soon lead to a battle over the colony headquarters of the Titans, Gryps, which has been modified to be a colony laser. The war ends when Kamille, piloting the titular mobile suit Z Gundam, kills Scirocco in battle and the AEUG sinks Scirocco&#x27;s flagship and most of the Titans&#x27; fleet. However, as his dying act Scirocco unleashes a mental attack upon Kamille, leaving the latter mentally unstable with signs of memory lapse and/or insanity.

The series concludes with both the AEUG and Earth Federation, after suffering considerable losses over the course of the war, facing the full force of Axis Zeon, leading into &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot;.

==Production==
Director Tomino actually started planning for a Gundam sequel in February 1984. The first memo dated February 20 included themes related to staff work, such as &quot;What is missing?/What do you really want to do?&quot;. From February to May is a period of trial and error, with the &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; proposal set in the future U.C.0111 (Triple One) and the &quot;Mobile Suit His Alpha Gundam&quot; proposal set in the past U.C.0045. is written. In the &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; proposal, there is an idea that goes beyond the Newtype, &quot;Gather Stime,&quot; which allows you to gain mental identity with others. Isn&#x27;t it?&quot;. Around the beginning of June, a story line close to its current form began to come together, and since then, it has been refined repeatedly based on it. On August 20th, the basic background titled &quot;Situation 7 years later...&quot; and a plot memo for one course will be completed. In November 1984, it was officially announced. 

Despite the considerable preparation period for a TV anime, the design decision and commercialization of the main character Z Gundam were delayed due to its complicated design and deformation mechanism. Due to the participation of multiple designers, the actual design work took an unexpectedly long time, and the appearance on the show was delayed until the third cour in the second half. For this reason, the need for a Gundam to play the leading role in the first two courses until the appearance of the Zeta Gundam arose, and the appearance of the Gundam Mk-II was decided. Under the order from Bandai that &quot;Mk-II is a descendant of MSV&quot;, from RX-78 Full Armor Gundam and Heavy Gundam. which is downstream of the flow to and was designed with consideration for &quot;movability&quot;.

Also, with an offer from Bandai saying, &quot;Since the main Zeta Gundam won&#x27;t appear until after episode 20, we&#x27;d like you to put out an MSV as a bridge between them,&quot; it was decided that the MSV, which until then had only been developed as a plastic model, would appear in the main story. In the first place, MSV was originally developed by Bandai because Sunrise was reluctant to make a sequel to Gundam.

In order to train the younger generation, which was one of Director Tomino&#x27;s requests to &quot;break Gundam&#x27;s shell&quot; and one of the challenges, the staff ended up with [Yasuhiko Yoshikazu], the character who was responsible for the world view of the previous work. While the mecha Kunio Okawara participated, it became a system where young people solidified around him.

For the first time in a Sunrise work, a mechanical animation director was appointed, and Yunhisa Uchida was adopted and credited in the program. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, the designer of the previous game, was in charge of character design. Work began in September 1984, and based on the plot and memo sentences delivered by director Yoshiyuki Tomino, the design was given priority to the image. However, there were many misunderstandings in this method, and some were redrawn according to their roles after the design was completed. In later years, Yasuhiko said that in the previous work, he had a relationship that could be called a &quot;comrade&quot; with Tomino, but in this work, it changed completely and he only felt bad, and he was able to meet directly and have a meeting without an appointment. In addition, it was decided that Yasuhiko would only work on the design and not the drawing, and the pillar of the actual drawing was the three-dimensional drawing that contrasted with Yasuhiko, who has a soft pattern with nuances. It was Hiroyuki Kitazume who was influenced by Tomoken Kogawa with a solid pattern.

Yoshiyuki Tomino crammed his frustrations into &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. He created the anime with the idea of telling viewers &quot;Hey, watch my new Gundam, youngsters. Why are you not so lively like them in Z?&quot; Tomino has mixed feelings about &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. Tomino did not like the series and believes he should have ended the story in the first TV series. However, at the same time, he noted that thanks to &quot;Zeta&quot; the franchise became more popular.

===Soundtrack===
A majority of the series background music was written by Japanese composer Shigeaki Saegusa. The melodies of the two opening themes and sole ending theme were written by American pop singer/songwriter Neil Sedaka. The first opening song used is called which was performed by Mami Ayukawa, and used for the first twenty-three episodes. &quot;Zeta - Toki wo Koete&quot; was based upon the song &quot;Better Days are Coming&quot; from Sedaka&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Solitaire&quot;. The second opening song used is entitled and was performed by Hiroko Moriguchi, this second opening song is used in episodes twenty-four to fifty. The song &quot;Mizu no Hoshi e Ai wo Komete&quot; was derived from an unreleased song entitled &quot;For Us to Decide&quot;.

The sole ending song used for the series is called which was sung by Mami Ayukawa. &quot;Hoshizora no Believe&quot; was adapted from the song &quot;Bad and Beautiful&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;. In addition to the opening/ending songs an insert song was also made called . This song is sung by Hiroko Moriguchi and is used in episode twenty.

The opening and ending songs differed for the International release version, as well as Japanese streaming versions, as opposed to the original. The opening song used is called which was composed by Saegusa, while the song used for the endings entitled was also written by Saegusa.

The songs used for the three films that came out of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam were all performed by Gackt, and were compiled and released on his tribute album 0079-0088. The first film &quot;Heirs To The Stars&quot; uses two songs; &quot;Metamorphoze&quot; is used as the opening song while is used for the ending. The second film &quot;Lovers&quot; uses just one new song called &quot;Mind Forest&quot; for the ending song. Mind Forest is also featured on Gackt&#x27;s album called &quot;Crescent&quot;. The final film made &quot;Love is the Pulse of the Stars&quot; uses two new songs. &quot;Love Letter&quot; is used as an insert song followed by the song &quot;Dybbuk&quot; which is used as the ending song.

== International release ==
The show has been placed on rerun on the anime satellite television network, Animax, across Japan and later its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions.

In 2004, after almost 2 years of delays and failed television and merchandising deals, Bandai released a limited edition Zeta Gundam boxset with dubbed English and original Japanese audio tracks. The box-set includes pencil sharpener collectibles and a 48-page booklet and poster. The English dub was done by Ocean Production&#x27;s Blue Water Studio based in Calgary in Canada. Due to Bandai not having rights to the theme songs outside of Asia, the opening and closing sequences were altered.

The English subtitles were criticized as inaccurate and appeared to be based on the script for the English dub, rather than a direct translation of the original Japanese script. Bandai corrected the subtitles to a properly translated version for later DVD releases in 5 cases with 2 discs each. Each disc contained five episodes.

In 2006, Bandai Entertainment acquired the rights to the US release of the &quot;A New Translation&quot; film trilogy, originally slated for release on June 22, 2010, but was later changed to July 6. The series and films have been out of print, following the closure of Bandai Entertainment.

On October 11, 2014, at their 2014 New York Comic Con panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including the &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; TV series and films in North America through distribution from Right Stuf Inc., beginning in Spring 2015.

=== Manga ===
A manga adaptation of the series by Kazuhisa Kondo was released by Kodansha in Comic BomBom from March 1985 to February 1986 issues, and compiled into three volumes. A manga remake was also made entitled . This remake was written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Kitazume and began serialiation in &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; on June 25, 2011.

=== Compilation films ===
In celebration of Gundam&#x27;s 25th anniversary (and also the 20th anniversary of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;), the 50-episode series was compiled into a film trilogy called &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation&quot;. According to Tomino, the films were created to fix some of the problems he identified in the television series and to bring it into a 21st-century context for a new generation now experiencing the increasingly commercialized series, such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;. The first film, &quot;Heirs to the Stars&quot;, opened on May 28, 2005, followed by &quot;Lovers&quot; on October 29, 2005, and &quot;Love is the Pulse of the Stars&quot; on March 6, 2006.

The compilations digitally remastered the television series of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; with new footage. Around 33% of &quot;&quot;Heir to the Stars&quot; was newly animated footage, with 70% for &quot;Lovers&quot; and almost 80% for &quot;Love is the Pulse of the Stars&quot;&quot;. However, several major plot events from the TV series were either edited or removed to allow the films to flow more smoothly, unlike Tomino&#x27;s previous Gundam film compilations. Likewise, the fate of some characters in the television version was entirely changed, notably Kamille&#x27;s — in the original, his final battle renders him into a vegetative state, while he remains physically and mentally fit by the end of the film trilogy. In addition, mobile suits belonging to the Gundam timeline, but designed after the television broadcast of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;, were also placed into the films.

Shigeaki Saegusa&#x27;s musical score from the TV series was reused for the films, with the addition of new songs by Japanese singer-songwriter Gackt. A music video for the first film&#x27;s opening theme &quot;Metamorphoze&quot; featured Gackt singing inside a mobile suit cockpit during battle.

The majority of the original TV voice cast returned to reprise their respective roles. Yō Inoue, who died in 2003 - was posthumously credited, as an archived recording of her voice was used for a cameo appearance of Sayla Mass in the third film. There were some changes to the voice cast - namely Yukana replacing Saeko Shimazu as Four Murasame, Satomi Arai replacing Miyuki Matsuoka as Fa Yuiry and a few others. This change sparked controversy among fans, who suspected that Yukana used her relationship with sound director Sadayoshi Fujino to land her role. The films were a box office success in Japan.

===Games===
In 1985, Bandai released a special board game based on the series. Designed for two to four players, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Take Off MKII&quot; has a paper map and 12 miniatures of various AEUG and Titans mobile suits, plus game rules and mission files. &quot;Kidō Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble&quot; followed in 1986. the first &quot;Gundam&quot; video game for home consoles, Hot Scramble featured first-person and side-scrolling stages. this would be followed by a 3D-fighting game, &quot;Mobile Suit Z Gundam&quot;, for the Sony PlayStation in 1997. Featuring remastered cutscenes from the series, it comes on two discs, allowing players to experience the series from the viewpoints of Kamille and Char. Bandai later added the series&#x27; mobile suits as part of Gundam Vs. Zeta Gundam in 2004.

In addition, Tecmo Koei and Namco Bandai have co-published the &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam&quot; franchise since 2007.

== Reception ==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; is praised by fans of the Universal Century sect of the franchise, with many lauding it for its bleak tone, character development, and its complicated expression of war. Even the series&#x27; director, Yoshiyuki Tomino, has expressed not liking the show.

The review website Mania.com gave the anime an overall &#x27;B+&#x27; rating, regarding it as &quot;one of Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s greatest works.&quot; They stated that the &quot;lack of an A/A+ is that this is recommended for fans who are already familiar with the Universal Century storyline,&quot; recommending that audiences view &quot;the original film trilogy&quot; first before watching &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. The reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com gave certain volumes of the series a full &#x27;A&#x27; rating, describing the last ten episodes as being &quot;the huge payoff episodes&quot; where &quot;you can almost feel the characters being rushed around a bit and moved through the paces. But at the same time, it all comes so fast that it&#x27;s simply enjoyable to watch so much happen and change so quickly.&quot;

Beveridge would later review the Blu-Ray releases of the series for &quot;The Fandom Post&quot;, giving both sets of Blu-Rays an &#x27;A−&#x27; rating. Beveridge writes in the review for the first set, &quot;It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost ten years since I last saw this series as you realize just how much anime you consume. But it also makes you realize which ones truly stand out over the course of time and this one is definitely one of them.&quot; Beveridge found the second half of the series weaker, though still claims that the show &quot;hits most things right&quot;.

While reviewing for the Blu-ray release of the series, Ollie Barder of &quot;Forbes&quot; gave the show a rave review, even titling it as &quot;Possibly The Greatest &#x27;Gundam&#x27; Series Ever Made&quot;. Barder praised the series&#x27; more realistic approach to war and its striking designs for the many different robots, though did find the transforming mechas out of place in &quot;Zeta&#x27;s&quot; more grounded reality. Lauren Orsini of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; also praised the series in a review for the first Blu-ray release, giving the dub for the first set a &#x27;B&#x27;, praising it for its powerful storytelling. Orsini was more critical of the second half of the series, finding the plot too chaotic and calling it Gundam&#x27;s &quot;awkward coming-of-age&quot;. But Orsini still praised the second half for its mecha designs and strong emotional payoffs, ultimately giving the subtitle version of the series a &#x27;B&#x27;.

&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; listed &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; as the best Gundam anime in their 2020 list, and the series was later ranked as the highest-rated Gundam show on &quot;IMDb&quot;. &quot;Bluefin Brand&quot;, one of the biggest distributors of Gunpla model kits and other Japanese branded toys in the west, had &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; the top show to watch in the franchise. &quot;WatchMojo&quot; listed &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; as the third-best anime of the pre-90s, only below the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; show and the 1988 version of &quot;Legend of the Galactic Heroes&quot;.

In the &quot;NHK&#x27;s&quot; 2018 mega &quot;All Gundam Poll&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; was placed as the second-best anime in the Gundam franchise, only behind the original 1979 &quot;Gundam&quot; show. The Zeta Gundam mecha was voted as the second-best mobile suit in the same poll, only behind the RX-93 ν Gundam (also known as the Nu Gundam) from &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;. The second opening song, , was also voted the best Gundam song in the franchise. Hiroko Moriguchi, the original singer of &quot;Mizu no Hoshi&quot;, re-recorded a new version of the song in &quot;Gundam Song Covers&quot;, along with the nine other songs in the top ten of &quot;NHK&#x27;s&quot; poll. A music video of Moriguchi&#x27;s new version of &quot;Mizu no Hoshi&quot; was released in 2019. The &quot;NHK&quot; reported that there was a total of 1,740,280 votes in the poll, with 46% of the votes for &quot;Zeta&quot; coming from voters between the ages 40 to 46.

<text>The Napier Nomad is a British diesel aircraft engine designed and built by Napier &amp; Son in 1949. They combined a piston engine with a turbine to recover energy from the exhaust and thereby improve fuel economy. Two versions were tested, the complex Nomad I which used two propellers, each driven by the mechanically independent stages, and the Nomad II, using the turbo-compound principle, coupled the two parts to drive a single propeller. The Nomad II had the lowest specific fuel consumption figures seen up to that time. Despite this the Nomad project was cancelled in 1955 having spent £5.1 million on development, as most interest had passed to turboprop designs.

== Design and development ==
In 1945 the Air Ministry asked for proposals for a new class engine with good fuel economy. Curtiss-Wright was designing an engine of this sort of power known as the turbo-compound engine, but Sir Harry Ricardo, one of Britain&#x27;s great engine designers, suggested that the most economical combination would be a similar design using a diesel two-stroke in place of the Curtiss petrol engine.

Before World War II Napier had licensed the Junkers Jumo 204 diesel design to set up production in the UK as the Napier Culverin, but the onset of the war made the Sabre all-important and work on the Culverin was stopped. In response to the Air Ministry&#x27;s 1945 requirements Napier dusted off this work, combining two enlarged Culverins into an H-block similar to the Sabre, resulting in a massive 75 litre design. Markets for an engine of this size seemed limited, however, so instead they reverted to the original Sabre-like horizontally opposed 12 cylinder design, and the result was the Nomad.

The objective of the design was to produce a civilian power plant with far superior fuel efficiency to the emerging jet engine. Thermal efficiency is given by formula_1, where &quot;T&quot; is the exhaust temperature in kelvins and &quot;T&quot; is the peak combustion temperature. Jet engines have relatively low-temperature combustion systems which produce a &quot;T&quot; of no more than about 1,000 K, much less than the typical 5,000 K of a reciprocating engine, and so jets have very poor thermal efficiency. The Nomad design focused on replacing the low-temperature combustion chambers of the jet engine with highly efficient Diesel combustion chambers. In practice, it was much too difficult to couple the diesel power output back into the turbine cycle. The maximum practical power of the Nomad was , and it was much heavier than a pure jet of the same power. By this time civilian jets such as the Boeing 707 were nearing completion, and the Nomad was never seriously considered by any aircraft manufacturer.

===Nomad I===

The initial Nomad design (E.125) or Nomad 1 was incredibly complex, almost two engines in one. One was a turbo-supercharged two-stroke diesel, having some resemblance to half of a Napier Sabre&#x27;s H-24. Mounted below this were the rotating parts of a turboprop engine, based on the Naiad design, the output of which drove the front propeller of a contra-rotating pair. To achieve higher boost, the crankshaft drove a centrifugal supercharger, which also provided the scavenging needed for starting the engine from rest. During take-off additional fuel was injected into the rear turbine stage for more power, and turned off once the aircraft was cruising.

The compressor and turbine assemblies of the Nomad were tested during 1948, and the complete unit was run in October 1949. The prototype was installed in the nose of an Avro Lincoln heavy bomber for testing: it first flew in 1950 and appeared at the Farnborough Air Display on 10 September 1951. In total the Nomad I ran for just over 1,000 hours, and proved to be rather temperamental, but when running properly it could produce and thrust. It had a specific fuel consumption (sfc) of .

The prototype Nomad I is on display at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune Airfield in Scotland.

===Nomad II===
Even before the Nomad I was running, its successor, the Nomad II (E.145) Nomad 6, had already been designed. In this version an extra stage was added to the axial compressor/supercharger, eliminating the separate centrifugal part and the intercooler. The turbine (which also received an additional stage) was now only used to drive the compressor, and feed back any excess power to the main shaft using a Beier variable-ratio gear; the separate propeller from the turbine was deleted, just as the whole of the &quot;afterburner&quot; system with its valves etc. So the system was now like a combination of a mechanical supercharger, and a turbocharger without any need for bypass. The result was smaller and considerably simpler: a single engine driving a single propeller. Overall weight reduction was . The wet liners of the cylinders of the Nomad I were changed for dry liners.

While the Nomad II was undergoing testing, a prototype Avro Shackleton was lent to Napier as a testbed. The engine proved bulky, like the Nomad I before it, and in the meantime several dummy engines were used on the Shackleton for various tests.

On an equivalent power basis, the Nomad II had an SFC of at cruise altitude.

A further development, the Nomad Nm.7, of was announced in 1953.

By 1954 interest in the Nomad was waning, and after the only project, the Avro Type 719 Shackleton IV, based on it was cancelled, work on the engine was ended in April 1955, after an expenditure of £5.1 million. The design was also considered for the Canadair Argus, a similar maritime patrol aircraft being designed for the Royal Canadian Air Force. This design turned to the Wright R-3350, the design the Nomad was intending to best.

A Nomad II is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia.

<doc id="172973" wikidata="Q178899" url="?curid=172973" title="Akvavit">
<text>Akvavit or aquavit () is a distilled spirit that is principally produced in Scandinavia, where it has been produced since the 15th century. &quot;Akvavit&quot; is distilled from grain or potatoes and is flavoured with a variety of spices and herbs. It is also popular in Northern Germany.

&quot;Akvavit&quot; gets its distinctive flavour from spices and herbs, and the dominant flavour must (according to the European Union) come from a distillate of caraway and/or dill seed. It typically contains 40% alcohol by volume, or 80 proof (U.S.). The EU has established a minimum of 37.5% ABV for &quot;akvavit&quot; to be named as such.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;aquavit&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;aqua vitae&quot;, &quot;water of life.&quot; Compare the words &quot;whisky&quot; and &quot;whiskey&quot;, from Gaelic &quot;uisce beatha&quot;, which has the same meaning. Likewise, clear fruit brandy is called &quot;eau de vie&quot; (French for &quot;water of life&quot;).

==Drinking culture==
Akvavit is an important part of Nordic drinking culture, where it is often drunk during festive gatherings, such as Christmas dinners and the Midsummer celebration, and as an aperitif. In Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, aquavit is chilled and often drunk in a single gulp from a small shot glass. This is usually attributed to tradition. In Norway, it is not generally chilled, but enjoyed slowly. In Sweden, aquavit is commonly consumed immediately following a song, called a snapsvisa. The most well-known song is &quot;Helan Går&quot;. In Finland and Sweden, aquavit consumed from a shot glass is also commonly associated with crayfish parties, which are traditionally held during late August. In Denmark, aquavit is called snaps or akvavit, and is primarily consumed in December during Christmas lunches or around Easter during Easter lunches. It is consumed year-round, though, mainly for lunches of traditional Danish dishes where beer is also always on the table. In Norway, where most aquavit is matured in oak casks, the drink is served at room temperature in tulip-shaped glasses. Aquavit arguably complements beer well, and its consumption is very often preceded by a swig of beer.

==Production==
Akvavit must be distilled from an agricultural base, most commonly grain or potatoes. Similarly to gin, it is flavoured with botanicals. The dominant flavours must be caraway or dill, or sometimes both. Swedish Akvavit must also contain fennel in order to be labelled as such. Other common botanicals include cardamom, cumin, anise, and coriander.
The Danish distillery Aalborg makes an akvavit distilled with amber, which imparts a pine-like citrusy note. The Aalborg brand is now produced in Norway by Arcus Group.

The recipes and flavours differ between brands, with each brand&#x27;s unique characteristics coming from distillation methods and supporting botanicals in their blends. Un-aged Akvavit is clear, while aged Akvavit typically has a pale straw-to-golden hue, depending on how long it has been aged in oak casks (most common in Norway) or the amount of colourant used. Normally, a darker colour suggests a higher age or the use of young casks, although artificial caramel colouring and infusing fruits or botanicals for colour and flavour are permitted before bottling. Clear akvavit is often called &quot;taffel&quot;, meaning table aquavit. Taffel aquavit is typically aged in old casks that do not colour the finished spirit, or it is not aged at all.

==Origin and traditional variants==

The earliest known reference to &quot;aquavit&quot; is found in a 1531 letter from the Lord of Bergenshus castle, (Norway) Eske Bille, to Olav Engelbrektsson, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Norway. The letter, dated April 13 and accompanying a package, offers the archbishop &quot;some water which is called Aqua Vite and is a help for all sort of illness which a man can have both internally and externally&quot;.

While this claim for the medicinal properties of the drink may be rather inflated, aquavit is popularly believed to ease the digestion of rich foods. In Norway, it is drunk at celebrations, particularly Christmas, Easter, or May 17 (Norwegian Constitution Day). In Denmark, it is traditionally associated with Christmas and Easter lunches. In Sweden, it is a staple of the traditional midsummer celebrations dinner, usually drunk while singing one of many drinking songs. It is usually drunk as snaps during meals, especially during the appetizer course — along with pickled herring, crayfish, lutefisk, or smoked fish. In this regard, it is popularly quipped that aquavit helps the fish swim down to the stomach.
It is also a regular in traditional Norwegian Christmas meals, including roasted rib of pork and rib of lamb (&quot;pinnekjøtt&quot;). The spices and the alcohol are said to help digest the meal, which is very rich in fat.

Among the most important brands are Løiten, Lysholm, Opland, and Simers from Norway; Aalborg and Brøndum from Denmark; and O.P. Anderson from Sweden. While the Danish and Swedish variants are normally very light in colour, most of the Norwegian brands are matured in oak casks for at least six months, and for some brands even as long as 12 years, making them generally darker in colour. While members of all three nations can be found to claim that &quot;their&quot; style of aquavit is the best as a matter of national pride, Swedish &quot;akvavit&quot; is typically the most renowned around the world, specifically so in the culinary scene. Whilst the Norwegian &quot;akevitt&quot; tends to have if not the most distinctive character, then at least the most overpowering flavour and deepest colour due to the aging process.

Peculiar to the Norwegian tradition are &quot;Linje Aquavits&quot; (such as &quot;Løiten Linie&quot; and &quot;Lysholm Linie&quot;). Linje Aquavit is named after the tradition of sending oak barrels of aquavit with ships from Norway to Australia and back again, thereby passing the equator (&quot;linje&quot;) twice before being bottled. The constant movement, high humidity, and fluctuating temperature cause the spirit to extract more flavour and contribute to accelerated maturation.

Norwegian aquavit distillers Anora (formerly Arcus) carried out a test where they tried to emulate the rocking of the casks aboard the &quot;Linje&quot; ships while the oak barrels were subjected to the weather elements, as they would aboard a ship. The finished product was, according to Anora, far from the taste that a proper &quot;linje&quot; aquavit should have.

Therefore, to this day, boats loaded with &quot;Linie Aquavit&quot; set sail from Norway to Australia and back again before they are bottled and sold as part of the Norwegian Christmas traditions, but also enjoyed all year round.

==Outside the Nordic countries==
Aquavit was seldom produced outside of the Nordic countries, but that began to change dramatically starting around 2010, especially in the United States, and particularly in areas that have larger concentrations of people with a Nordic heritage. An exception, however, is Northern Germany, and in particular the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which was part of Denmark until the 19th century (see History of Schleswig-Holstein) and still has a notable Danish minority. Among the most important German brands are Bommerlunder from Flensburg, Kieler Sprotte from Kiel, and Malteserkreuz. Malteserkreuz has been produced in Berlin since 1924 by a subsidiary of Sweden&#x27;s Vin &amp; Sprit AB (now Pernod Ricard), the producer of many Swedish akvavits, and can be considered a German imitation of the Nordic aquavits since it is based on an original Danish recipe. Brands from Schleswig-Holstein, however, often have a long history, comparable to their Nordic counterparts. Bommerlunder, for instance, has been made since 1760. Aquavit is also an important part of the traditional cuisine of Schleswig-Holstein. German aquavit is virtually always distilled from fermented grain and generally has an alcohol content of 38% by volume, marginally less than Scandinavian aquavits.

Psychopomp Microdistillery, in Bristol, England, started producing an aquavit (termed &#x27;Aqvavit&#x27; due to EU regulations) in 2017. In Canada, aquavit is produced by Crosscut Distillery Sudbury; Confluence Distillery; Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery; Island Spirits Distillery; Long Table Distillery; Spirit of York Distillery Co. in Toronto, Ontario; Newfoundland Distillery Co. in Clarke&#x27;s Beach, Newfoundland; Compass Distillers in Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Sternwheeler Craft Distillery in Creston, British Columbia and Sheringham Distillery on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Many distilleries in the United States produce aquavit, especially in parts of the country with high populations of people of Nordic heritage. Examples include Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Washington. The Midwest states in particular do quite well for the category and have produced numerous internationally acclaimed/award-winning brands.

<text>Jimmie Dale Gilmore (born May 6, 1945) is an American country singer-songwriter currently living in Austin, Texas.

==Life and career==
Gilmore is a native of the Texas Panhandle, having been born in Amarillo and raised in Lubbock, Texas. His earliest musical influence was Hank Williams and the honky tonk brand of country music that his father played. In the 1950s, he was exposed to the emerging rock and roll of other Texans such as Roy Orbison and Lubbock native Buddy Holly, as well as to Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley, the latter two being in the line up at a concert he attended on October 15, 1955, at Lubbock&#x27;s Fair Park Coliseum. He was profoundly influenced in the 1960s by The Beatles and Bob Dylan and the folk music and blues revival in that decade.

With Joe Ely and Butch Hancock, Gilmore founded The Flatlanders. The group has been performing on and off since 1972. The band&#x27;s first recording project, from the early 1970s, was barely distributed. It has since been acknowledged, through Rounder&#x27;s 1990 reissue (&quot;More a Legend Than a Band&quot;), as a milestone of progressive, alternative country. The three friends continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances, and in May 2002, released a long-awaited follow-up album, &quot;Now Again,&quot; on New West Records.

After briefly attending Texas Tech University, Gilmore spent much of the 1970s in an ashram in Denver, Colorado, studying metaphysics with teenaged Indian guru Prem Rawat, also known as Maharaji. In the 1980s, he moved to Austin, where his first solo album, &quot;Fair &amp; Square&quot;, was released in 1988.

In 1994, Gilmore teamed up with Willie Nelson to contribute &quot;Crazy&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Gilmore appeared as himself in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot;, a love story about young songwriters in Nashville. He also had a small but memorable acting role in the 1998 movie &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. He portrayed a bowler named Smokey, an aging, emotionally &quot;fragile&quot; pacifist threatened with a pistol by Walter Sobchak, &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski&#x27;s best friend and sidekick (John Goodman). He has also been a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with host Jay Leno, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; on NPR, and the &quot;Fresh Air&quot; radio program with Terry Gross. Gilmore&#x27;s son, Colin Gilmore, is also a singer–songwriter based in Austin.

Gilmore&#x27;s song &quot;Braver Newer World&quot; is featured in the 1995 Noah Baumbach film &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot;. In 2005, Gilmore released &quot;Come on Back&quot;, an album of songs his father loved. Gilmore said of the album, &quot;This new album is a compilation of recordings of some old songs that my dad loved. I love them too, and it is a project very dear to me.&quot; His version of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; from the album &quot;One Endless Night&quot; is on the soundtrack of Jacques Audiard&#x27;s 2009 film, &quot;A Prophet&quot; (Un Prophète).

Gilmore has been nominated for three Grammys, Best Contemporary Folk Album for &quot;Spinning Around The Sun&quot; in 1993, Best Contemporary Folk Album &quot;Braver Newer World&quot; in 1996, and Best Traditional Folk Album &quot;Come On Back&quot; in 2005.

<text>C News is a news server package, written by Geoff Collyer, assisted by Henry Spencer, at the University of Toronto as a replacement for B News. It was presented at the Winter 1987 USENIX conference in Washington, D.C.

Functionally, the operation of C News is very much like that of B News. One major difference was that C News was written with portability in mind. It ran on many variants of Unix and even MS-DOS. The &quot;relaynews&quot; program that handled article filing and feeding was carefully optimized and designed to process articles in batches, while B News processed one article per program invocation. The authors claimed that &quot;relaynews&quot; could process articles 19 times as quickly as B News.

In 1992, Collyer gave C News a new index facility called NOV (or News Overview). This allowed newsreaders to rapidly retrieve header and threading information with relatively little load on the server. Virtually all news servers continue to use this method in the form of the NNTP XOVER command. Development of C News stopped about 1995, and the package was largely superseded by INN.

<text>Henry Spencer (born 1955) is a Canadian computer programmer and space enthusiast. He wrote &quot;regex&quot;, a widely used software library for regular expressions, and co-wrote C News, a Usenet server program. He also wrote &quot;The Ten Commandments for C Programmers&quot;. He is coauthor, with David Lawrence, of the book &quot;Managing Usenet&quot;. While working at the University of Toronto he ran the first active Usenet site outside the U.S., starting in 1981. His records from that period were eventually acquired by Google to provide an archive of Usenet in the 1980s.

The first international Usenet site was run in Ottawa, in 1981; however, it is generally not remembered, as it served merely as a read-only medium. Later in 1981, Spencer acquired a Usenet feed from Duke University, and brought &quot;utzoo&quot; online; the earliest public archives of Usenet date from May 1981 as a result.

The small size of Usenet in its youthful days, and Spencer&#x27;s early involvement, made him a well-recognised participant; this is commemorated in Vernor Vinge&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;. The novel featured an interstellar communications medium remarkably similar to Usenet, down to the author including spurious message headers; one of the characters who appeared solely through postings to this was modeled on Spencer (and, slightly obliquely, named for him).

He is also credited with the claim that &quot;Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.&quot;

==Preserving Usenet==
In mid-December 2001, Google unveiled its improved Usenet archives, which now go more than a decade deeper into the Internet&#x27;s past than did the millions of posts that the company had originally acquired when it bought an existing archive called Deja News.

Between 1981 and 1991, while running the zoology department&#x27;s computer system at the University of Toronto, Spencer copied more than 2 million Usenet messages onto magnetic tapes. The 141 tapes wound up at the University of Western Ontario, where Google&#x27;s Michael Schmidt tracked them down and, with the help of David Wiseman and others, got them transferred onto disks and into Google&#x27;s archives.

==Free software contributions==
Henry Spencer helped Geoff Collyer write C News in 1987.

At around the same time he wrote a non-proprietary replacement for codice_1, the Unix library for handling regular expressions, and made it freely available; his API followed that of Eighth Edition Research Unix.
Spencer&#x27;s library has been used in many software packages, including Tcl, MySQL (prior to MySQL 8.0.4), and PostgreSQL, as well as being adapted for others, including early versions of Perl. Circa 1993, Spencer donated a second version of his RE library to 4.4BSD, following the POSIX standard for regular expressions.

Spencer was technical lead on the FreeS/WAN project, implementing an IPsec cryptographic protocol stack for Linux.

He also wrote &#x27;aaa&#x27; (Amazing Awk Assembler), which is one of the longest and most complex programs ever written in the awk programming language.

He also developed a 4 point font used by entomologists in labeling pinned insect specimens.

==Space==
Spencer is a founding member of the Canadian Space Society, and has served on its board of directors several times since 1984. He did mission analysis (planning of launch and orbits) for the CSS&#x27;s Canadian Solar Sail project (now defunct), and was Software Architect for MOST, a Canadian science microsatellite dedicated to studying variable light from stars and extrasolar planets launched by Eurockot in 2003.
The asteroid 117329 Spencer is named in his honour.

He is a highly regarded space enthusiast, and is a familiar and respected presence on several space forums on Usenet and the Internet. From 1983 to 2007 Spencer posted over 34,000 messages to the sci.space.* newsgroups. His knowledge of space history and technology is such that the &quot;I Corrected Henry Spencer&quot; virtual T-shirt award was created as a reward for anyone who can catch him in an error of fact.

<doc id="172982" wikidata="Q16864723" url="?curid=172982" title="Gaffer tape">
<text>Gaffer tape (also known as gaffer&#x27;s tape, gaff tape or gaffa tape as well as spike tape for narrow, colored gaffer tape) is a heavy cotton cloth pressure-sensitive tape with strong adhesive and tensile properties. It is widely used in theatre, photography, film, radio and television production, and industrial staging work.

While sometimes confused with duct tape, gaffer tape differs in the composition of both the backing, which is made from fabric as opposed to vinyl or other plastics, and the adhesive, which is more resistant to heat and more easily removed without damaging the surface to which it adhered.

== History ==

The precise origin of the name is unknown, one hypothesis being that it is named for the gaffer (chief lighting technician) on a film crew. When cables are taped down on a stage or other surface, either to prevent tripping hazards or conceal them from view of the audience or camera, they are said to be &quot;gaffed&quot; or &quot;gaffered&quot;.

Gaffer tape was invented in 1959 by Ross Lowell, director, cinematographer, and founder of Lowel-Light. Lowell reworked Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Permacel duct tape product by combining the Permacel adhesive with a silver fabric backing to create gaffer tape which could hold a flat metal plate to a window. 

== Properties and uses ==
Gaffer tape is manufactured in many colors, including fluorescent and custom colors, but perhaps the most common variety is matte black. A matte finish keeps the tape from reflecting light, so that it blends in with a typical stage floor. It is sold in a variety of widths, from to , with and being the most common. Gaffer tape is strong, yet can be torn by hand, so no cutting tools are necessary, and it can easily be ripped into narrower strips when desired. The synthetic adhesive typically leaves little or no residue and will generally not damage most surfaces when it is removed. Gaffer tape is usually more expensive than duct tape because it is manufactured in smaller quantities, has more exacting specifications, and is marketed for professional use.

A common application for gaffer tape is securing cables to a stage floor, podium, or other surface, either for safety or concealment. It is also frequently used whenever a quick ad hoc fix is required, from temporarily attaching fixtures or props, to salvaging a broken piece of production equipment. A narrow version of gaffer tape, called &quot;spike tape&quot;, is used in theater productions for floor layout.

In the absence of console tape or artist tape, live sound engineers or light board operators may use a strip of white gaffer tape along the bottom of a mixing board to label the channels or submasters used for a particular show.

In rock climbing gyms, gaffer tape can be used to mark climbs on the wall. It is preferable to duct tape because it is stronger and lasts longer on the wall.

<doc id="172984" wikidata="Q236837" url="?curid=172984" title="Richmond, British Columbia">
<text>Richmond is a city in the coastal Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. Mainly a suburban city, it occupies almost the entirety of Lulu Island (excluding Queensborough), between the two estuarine distributaries of the Fraser River. Encompassing the adjacent Sea Island (where the Vancouver International Airport is located) and several other smaller islands and uninhabited islets to its north and south, the suburb neighbours Vancouver and Burnaby on the Burrard Peninsula to the north, New Westminster and Annacis Island to the east, Delta to the south, and the Strait of Georgia to the west.

The indigenous Coast Salish peoples were the first people to inhabit the area of modern-day Richmond, with the Musqueam Band naming the site near Terra Nova &quot;&quot; or &quot;boiling point&quot;. Today, East Asian Canadians make up a majority of Richmond&#x27;s population, along with the Continental Asian Canadian population numbering almost three-fourths of the city&#x27;s population. As a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, Richmond is composed of eight local neighbourhoods: Sea Island, City Centre, Thompson, West Richmond, Steveston, South Arm, East Richmond and Hamilton. As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of 229,781 people.

During the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Richmond Olympic Oval was a venue for long track speed skating events.

==History==
Coast Salish bands had temporary camps on the island, to fish and collect berries, which were scattered and moved from year to year. Certain Coast Salish summer camps were located at Garry Point, and Woodward&#x27;s Landing, along with the site of the Terra Nova cannery, which had at one time been a Musqueam village.

There is no definitive historical account as to how Richmond was named. There are several possibilities that have been proposed, including:
* The first family to settle in Richmond, that of Hugh McRoberts, had formerly lived in Australia. Their home there was called &quot;Richmond View&quot;, and that is what they named their homestead in Richmond.
* W.D. Ferris drafted the original petition for the incorporation of The Township of Richmond. He was originally from Richmond, Surrey, England.
* Another early settler was Hugh Boyd. He was also the first Reeve of the township. His wife had been born in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England.

The Township of Richmond, British Columbia was incorporated on 10 November 1879. The Township of Richmond was modeled after Ontario&#x27;s political townships – an incorporated municipality, consisting of communities that are united as a single entity with a single municipal administration. Each community was represented on the municipal council through a ward electoral system with five wards until 1946 when the ward electoral system was replaced with the at large electoral system that is currently in place.

On 3 December 1990, Richmond was designated as a City.

The first Town Hall, the Agricultural Hall and the Methodist Church (now Minoru Chapel), were built at the corner of No. 17 (River) Rd and No. 20 (Cambie) Rd near the main settlement on the northwestern tip of Lulu Island at North Arm.

The old fishing village of Steveston on the southwestern tip of Lulu Island is now home to several museums and heritage sites, as well as a working harbour for fishing boats. Currently, London Heritage Farm, the Gulf of Georgia Cannery and the Britannia Shipyard National Historic Site in Steveston highlight these parts of Richmond&#x27;s diverse history.

==Geography==
Richmond is made up of most of the islands in the Fraser River delta, the largest and most populated island being Lulu Island. The city of Richmond includes all but a small portion of Lulu Island (the Queensborough neighbourhood at the far eastern tip is part of the city of New Westminster). The next largest island, Sea Island, is home to the Vancouver International Airport (YVR). In addition to Lulu and Sea Islands, 15 smaller islands make up the city&#x27;s land area, including:
* Mitchell Island, an industrial island accessed via the Knight Street Bridge, a bridge which connects Richmond and Vancouver.
* Richmond Island, a former sand bar that has been turned into a peninsula that can only be reached from Vancouver, but technically is within Richmond&#x27;s city limits. 
* Shady Island, an uninhabited island covered with trees, which can be reached over land by foot at low tide from near Steveston.

The city also includes the fishing village of Steveston, located in the far southwest corner of the city, and Burkeville, which shares Sea Island with the airport. Both Steveston and Burkeville were independent villages until they were annexed by Richmond.

Since all of Richmond occupies islands in a river delta, the city has plenty of rich, alluvial soil for agriculture, and was one of the first areas in British Columbia to be farmed by Europeans in the 19th century. The drawback of Richmond&#x27;s geographical location was that since all the land averages just one metre above sea level, it was prone to flooding, especially during high tide. As a result, all the major islands are now surrounded by a system of dykes, which, although not as massive as those in the Netherlands or the levees of New Orleans, serve to protect the city from anticipated sources of flooding. There is a possibility that, during an earthquake, the dykes could rupture, and the alluvial soil may liquefy, causing extensive damage. Richmond is also at risk of a major flood if the Fraser River has an unusually high spring freshet. Recreational trails run along the tops of many of the dykes, and Richmond also supports about of parkland.

Because of the high groundwater table, very few houses in Richmond have basements and until the late 1980s, very few buildings were above 3 storeys high. Also, because of proximity to the airport, current building codes limit the height of buildings to .

===Climate===
Richmond has an oceanic climate (Cfb). Because it is not as close to the mountains, it actually receives 30% less rain than neighbouring Vancouver. It rarely snows in winter, and the summer temperatures are mild to warm. Richmond is also very cloudy in the cooler months.

== Demographics ==


In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Richmond had a population of 209,937 living in 81,080 of its 85,035 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 198,309.

=== Ethnicity ===
Approximately half of Richmond residents identify as having Chinese ancestry with the BBC calling it &quot;North America&#x27;s most Asian city&quot; in 2012. East Asian Canadians make up a majority of Richmond&#x27;s population, many of whom immigrated in the late 1980s, mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland China on top of the Japanese Canadian community who immigrated to Canada nearly a century earlier. Almost three quarters of city&#x27;s population is of Continental Asian descent, where other Continental Asian Canadians communities residing in Richmond include Indo-Canadians and Filipino Canadians.

Richmond&#x27;s Japanese community has a long history in Steveston dating back to the 1800s. Following Japan&#x27;s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the Anti-Japanese sentiment grew, and this community was devastated as residents of Japanese descent were relocated to internment camps in the BC Interior and Alberta and their property sold at auction.

The first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant outside of the United States was opened in Richmond in June 1967.

===Agriculture===
The Agricultural Land Reserve preserves 4,916 hectares within the city as farmland, an area that makes up most of east Richmond. Of this area, 3,012 hectares are farmed by 247 farms; the rest is either vacant or occupied by non-farm uses. Cranberries and blueberries are the dominant crops grown. Other crops grown include strawberries, corn, and potatoes. In 2001, Richmond had approximately 47% of BC&#x27;s cranberry acreage.

===Shopping malls===
Richmond Centre, Lansdowne Centre, McArthurGlen Vancouver, Parker Place and Aberdeen Centre are some of the most prominent malls in Richmond. There is also Steveston Village.

The Seafair Plaza commercial center is near Steveston, in Seafair, a different neighbourhood and planning area.

The success of these malls has created significant economic growth in Richmond. Richmond Centre has become Canada&#x27;s 12th most profitable mall. Offices, apartment buildings, and transportation hubs have sprung up around the mall. While McArthurGlen Vancouver has been given the Best Outlet Centre 2015 award at MAPIC.

Richmond is also home to many Chinese-oriented shopping malls, most of them along No. 3 Road from Alderbridge Way to Capstan Way. This area is officially termed as the &quot;Golden Village&quot; by Tourism Richmond and includes malls such as Aberdeen Centre, Continental Centre, Union Square, President Plaza, Parker Place, and Yaohan Centre. The strip malls located on Alexandra Road are famous for their restaurants, and the area is more commonly known as &quot;food street&quot;.

===Development===
Richmond city planners are one year into their update of its official plan, passed in fall 2019, for the city centre. The plan is anchored by the Canada Line and includes the development of nine transit-oriented village centres. The population of the area is expected to grow from about 40,000 to 120,000 residents.

According to a senior planner for the city, the goal of the plan is to &quot;turn the middle arm of the Fraser River into a focus instead of an edge.&quot; A Richmond parks manager said that for &quot;too long residents have felt contained by the river, seen it as being to their backs. Now, they want people to face the river and embrace the waterfront.&quot;

==== Lansdowne ====
Lansdowne Centre will be undergoing redevelopment in 2025 to make way for a 50-acre master planned mixed-use community, which is estimated to take 20 years to build out. Within this development plan, there will be mixed housing, large public spaces with a Civic Plaza slated to be placed in the corner of Lansdowne Road and No 3 Road. The property owner, Vanprop Investment Ltd., has plans for Lansdowne to be a pedestrian-friendly area with shops and services lined within its block.

==== The Olympic Oval ====

Aspac Developments Ltd purchased of land adjacent to the Fraser River and the finished $178 million Richmond Olympic Oval. The $1 billion plan includes 16 high-density towers, up to 14 stories in height. The towers will be stepped toward the waterfront and will include trees and green space. Aspac&#x27;s plans are for &quot;probably the highest-end development Richmond has seen to date&quot; said Mayor Brodie. A $2.3 million hard-surfaced path will be constructed along the river to link the project to Aberdeen Centre. Aspac&#x27;s initial plan includes constructing the development in four phases, with the first phase consisting of of residential development, and of ground-level commercial space. Some construction will not begin until after 2010, and will take up to 12 years to complete. The warehouses and commercial parks near the development are also slated for redevelopment.

==== The John M.S. Lecky boathouse ====
The University of British Columbia constructed the John M.S. Lecky boathouse along River Road. It draws crowds from rowing regattas and dragon boat races.

==== Cambie Road pedestrian bridge ====
A possible pedestrian bridge where Cambie Road reaches the river is also being included in a future vision of the area. It would link nature trails on the north and south banks, and make Aberdeen Centre within walking distance for BCIT&#x27;s aerospace campus students.

==== Capstan Way ====

Developer Pinnacle International is planning a 16-building development on a property near Capstan Way and No 3 road. The mixed-use development would include over 2,100 residential units, various commercial uses, and a hotel.

The Canada Line is considered critical to the project. A fifth Richmond station at Capstan Way (No. 3 Road and Capstan Way) was originally planned, but was cancelled in March 2009. This station was considered so critical to the development that the City of Richmond has received $19 million from developers for the station to be built. TransLink, the Canada Line operator, has started designing this station in November 2017. On 2 September 2021, construction started on Capstan station.

Also included will be 100 affordable housing units, a 25-space daycare, and a park. The developers are also proposing live-work dwellings, where shop owners would live above their ground-level operations.

==== Aberdeen Square ====
Fairchild Developments built a six-floor expansion to its Chinese-oriented shopping centre, Aberdeen Centre. The plan includes an office building and a link to the Canada Line&#x27;s Aberdeen station. The new complex was completed and opened up to the public in 2014.

==== Bridgeport Station ====
The River Rock Casino Resort is located near the Canada Line Bridgeport station and has built a 12-story hotel. The casino has added an addition above the newly added six-story car park and SkyTrain Bridgeport Station. TransLink (the Canada Line owner) gave the Great Canadian Casino Corporation land worth $9.5 million, and $4.5 million in cash in return for building the park-and-ride facility. Transit users are charged $3.00 per day to use the facility (up from an initial $2.00 charge).

==== Garden City Lands ====

The parcel known as the Garden City Lands was leased by the federal government for decades and was formerly used as a transmitter site for program requirements of the Canadian Coast Guard. The property is bounded by Westminster Highway, Garden City Road, Alderbridge Way and No. 4 Road and has been within the Provincial Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) since 1973. In 2005, the Federal Government of Canada deemed the land as &quot;surplus&quot; to its needs and sold the site to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation.

The City of Richmond, Canada Lands Company, and the Musqueam Indian Band entered a 2005 agreement with the federal government that included the intent to remove the land from the ALR for the purposes of high-density development. In April 2008, an application to exclude the land from the Agricultural Land Reserve was made to the Agricultural Land Commission. The application was rejected on 10 February 2009.

On 8 March 2010, Richmond City Council announced a deal had been approved whereby the city would purchase the entire parcel of land from the Musqueam Band and Canada Lands Company for $59.2 million.

The Musqueam band has since brought a lawsuit against the City of Richmond, claiming they sold it under duress. The lawsuit remains dormant and it is the understanding of Coun. Harold Steves that the lawsuit will remain dormant unless the city wants to develop the lands into anything that is not related to ALR use.

==Arts and culture==
On Canada Day, Richmond has an annual festival in Steveston called the Steveston Salmon Festival. This event includes a parade, and a huge barbecued salmon sale in front of the Steveston Community Centre. Locally based municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently show up at this event, usually as part of the parade and/or to hand out Canadian flags.

An annual Richmond Maritime Festival has been held at the Britannia Shipyard, National Historic Site every August since 2004. It is a family event that celebrates the region&#x27;s maritime heritage with live entertainment, ships, exhibits and demonstrations.

In 2002, Richmond hosted a tall ships festival, which attracted an estimated 400,000 people to Steveston. The success of this event surpassed many expectations and caused traffic congestion in the usually quiet area. There was insufficient parking in the area, which gave locals the idea of selling &quot;parking space&quot; by using their driveways and front yards. Despite the event&#x27;s popularity, there was a revenue shortfall and the city decided not to host the event again.

Many indoor and outdoor art exhibitions are hosted by Richmond Arts Coalition (RAC) throughout the year. The Richmond Arts Strategy, passed in July 2004 by the City of Richmond, includes a proposal to promote communication between arts organizations and develop the Richmond arts community. In January 2005, a Board, mission, and mandate was established. On 1 November 2005, artists, art organizations, and patrons of the arts formed the Richmond Arts Coalition. The RAC hosts Richmond arts events, connects the public to artists and events, provides artist opportunities, nominate awards, funds performers to specific events, stimulates arts projects, and advocate for arts issues, performances, education, creation, and exhibition activities.

During the summer weekends, an annual Richmond Night Market is held. Toys, clothes, cell phones, and food are available along with live entertainment. It is very popular and is usually crowded.

Richmond also hosted the 2006 Gemini Awards, which were held at River Rock Casino. This marked the first time the ceremony had taken place on the West Coast, as it traditionally takes place in Toronto.

== Parks and recreation ==
There are 140 public parks and 14 public recreation facilities in Richmond, including but not limited to:
An extensive trail system provides 136 kilometres of recreational trails in parks and 87 kilometres of on-road cycling paths. 

==Sports==
Richmond is home to the Richmond Sockeyes Junior B hockey team. It also hosts the BC Thunder of the National Ringette League.

Richmond also has multiple soccer teams, under the name Richmond FC, ranging in ages and skill levels, from U4&#x27;s to U18&#x27;s, and from house divisions to elite programming. As of 1 October 2006, the middle arm of Richmond&#x27;s Fraser River became home to both the UBC Thunderbirds varsity rowing program and St. George&#x27;s School rowing program, with the completion of the new $6 million CAD John M.S. Lecky UBC Boathouse. In addition, this facility will also function to enhance participation in the sports of rowing and dragon boating for the greater community, including youth, adults, and rowing alumni. Richmond also has their own short track speed skating club, the Richmond Rockets and their own rugby union club, the Richmond Rugby Football Club.

===The 2010 Winter Olympics===

For the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the City of Richmond constructed an 8,000-seat speed-skating oval near the No. 2 Road Bridge, just across (the middle arm of) the Fraser River from Vancouver International Airport. The final construction cost (paid for by the city, the provincial government and the federal government) is around $178 million CAD. Since the completion of the Games, the oval has served as a recreational structure for local residents. The Richmond Oval officially opened on 12 December 2008. The city received $141 million CAD from ASPAC Developments for city-owned land next to the Oval. The sale more than covers the unfunded portion of the Oval&#x27;s price tag.

==Government==

Richmond votes regularly for conservative or centrist parties, and is a stronghold for the BC Liberal Party.

===Municipal===
Richmond&#x27;s municipal council is elected using an at-large electoral system.
Like Vancouver, but unlike most cities in British Columbia, Richmond runs on a political system of locally based political parties, or slates. For the most part, however, their organization is weak, and they may collapse or change names from one election to another.

Local government includes a 9-member city council and a 7-member school board. City council consists of a mayor and 8 councillors. The current mayor of Richmond is Malcolm Brodie, who is serving his 6th term as mayor. The last elections were held in October 2018.

In the 2018 city elections, the RCA (Richmond Citizen&#x27;s Association) party, the Richmond First party, and the RITE Richmond party all won 2 seats, the Richmond Community Coalition won one seat, and there is one independent. On the Richmond Board of Education, the Richmond Education Party won three seats, the Richmond First Party won two seats, and there are two independents.

===Provincial===
In the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Richmond was historically a stronghold of the BC United Party until the 2020 provincial election where the BC NDP flipped three of Richmond&#x27;s four electoral districts (Richmond South Centre, Richmond-Queensborough, and Richmond-Steveston). 

In the most recent provincial election in 2024, three electoral districts (Richmond Centre, Richmond-Bridgeport, Richmond-Queensborough) elected members from the BC Conservatives, and Richmond-Steveston elected a member from the BC NDP.

===Federal===
In the House of Commons of Canada, Richmond is divided between two electoral districts: Richmond Centre, which encompasses the city&#x27;s centre and west, and Steveston—Richmond East, which encompasses the south and east. In the 2021 federal election, the Liberal Party won Richmond Centre and Steveston—Richmond East.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Richmond is connected by a system of bridges and tunnels to Vancouver and Delta, and through the New Westminster suburb of Queensborough (on eastern Lulu Island) to the &quot;mainland&quot; portion of New Westminster. Three bridges (one of them twinned) connect Lulu Island to Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport; one bridge connects Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport to Vancouver; two bridges connect Lulu Island to Vancouver; one bridge connects Queensborough (on eastern Lulu Island) to New Westminster; one bridge connects Queensborough to Annacis Island in Delta; one twinned bridge connects Richmond to Annacis Island; and one of the few underwater tunnels in British Columbia connects Richmond to Delta.

The bus runs every 30 minutes, with the exception of one northbound trip (2am3am), during which service is at 60 minutes; service returns to 30 minutes after the northbound trip at 3am.

A dockless bicycle-sharing system, consisting of e-bikes and e-scooters, was launched in the City Centre area in May 2022 by Lime

Vancouver International Airport (YVR), located on Sea Island, which is part of Richmond, to the north of Lulu Island, provides most of the air access to the region. Several float plane companies (including Salt Spring Air, Harbour Air and Seair Seaplanes) operate from the south terminal, providing service to the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island. The airport is the second busiest in Canada and one of the busiest international airports on the West Coast of North America.

Health care in Richmond is overseen by the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, which also covers the City of Vancouver, District of West Vancouver, City of North Vancouver, and District of North Vancouver as well as coastal regions of British Columbia. 

Richmond Hospital, located on the southeast corner of Westminster Highway and Gilbert Road, is undergoing redevelopment. In 2018, the Ministry of Health approved an 8-floor acute care tower redevelopment plan to replace the aging north tower. On 2 July 2020, the provincial government announced the acute care tower concept plan was being updated, with an additional floor (9 total) and announcement of expanded and renewed ER, ICU, Pharmacy, along with renovations to the south tower to include more inpatient psychiatric beds along with a psych ER.

<doc id="172986" wikidata="Q999123" url="?curid=172986" title="Huntington, New York">
<text>Huntington is one of ten towns in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The town&#x27;s population was 204,127 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the 11th most populous city/town in the state.

Founded in 1653, the Town of Huntington is located on the North Shore of Long Island in northwestern Suffolk County, with the Long Island Sound to its north and Nassau County adjacent to the west. It is part of the New York metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1653, three men from Oyster Bay, Richard Holbrook, Robert Williams and Daniel Whitehead, purchased a parcel of land from the Matinecock tribe. This parcel has since come to be known as the &quot;First Purchase&quot; and included land bordered by Cold Spring Harbor on the west, Northport Harbor on the east, what is now known as Old Country Road to the south, and the Long Island Sound to the north. The three men immediately turned the land over to the settlers who had already been living there.

The origin of the name is unknown but the consensus among historians is it was named for the birthplace of Oliver Cromwell who was Lord Protector of England at the time of the town&#x27;s establishment. 
From that initial settlement, Huntington grew over subsequent years to include all of the land presently comprising the modern Towns of Huntington and Babylon. The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.

Because Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam. It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.

Following the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War, British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.

The arrival of the Long Island Rail Road in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting. Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.

The end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington as western Suffolk County began suburbanizing. Farms and resorts gave way to homes, and Huntington transformed into a major commuter town for nearby New York City.

In 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that Huntington had violated the Fair Housing Act by preventing apartment construction anywhere except in black neighborhoods. A developer of an affordable housing project sought to build it in a white neighborhood, but the town restricted the developer to black neighborhoods. The Supreme Court ordered the town to build an affordable housing project in a white neighborhood. Construction on that project began in 2023.

In 2019, Huntington banned the creation of new basement apartments. In 2023, a council member proposed legalizing basement apartments to alleviate the housing crisis in Huntington and other communities surrounding New York City. At a July 2023 hearing, in which local residents railed against &quot;migrants, pedophiles, or criminals&quot; moving into Huntington, council members backtracked on their support for the zoning change.

==Geography==
Huntington is bounded by Long Island Sound to the north, Nassau County to the west, Babylon to the south, and Smithtown to the east. It also shares a small border with Islip to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (31.44%) is water.

==Demographics==


As of the census of 2000, there were 195,289 people, 65,917 households, and 52,338 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 67,708 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town in 2000 was 88.31% White, 4.22% Black or African American, 0.13% Native American, 3.50% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 2.27% from other races, and 1.55% from two or more races.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.00% of the population.

There were 65,917 households, out of which 37.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.4% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.6% were non-families. 16.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.91 and the average family size was 3.26.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 25.5% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.4 males.

According to a 2023 estimate, the median income for a household in the town was $164,196, and the median income for a family was $190,280. About 4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.5% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Government and politics==

The town government consists of a town council with four members, all of whom are elected at large. The town supervisor is elected by the entire town. Other elected positions are the Town Clerk, Highway Superintendent, and Receiver of Taxes. A referendum to move to a ward district system on December 22, 2009, failed 81% to 18%.

Until 2017, Huntington was generally controlled by the Democratic Party, having the same Democratic town supervisor, Frank Petrone, for 20 years prior to 2017. The town board followed suit during these years, generally being controlled by the Democratic Party. In 2017, the Republican Party took control of the town supervisor position with the election of Chad Lupinacci. The Republicans have held this position since. In the 2021 general election, the people of Huntington elected Edmund Smyth to the supervisor position. Two Republicans were also elected to the town board: Dr. Dave Bennardo and Salvatore Ferro. In the 2023 general election, Brooke Lupinacci and Theresa Mari were elected, creating a 5–0 super majority for the Republican Party on the town board. The town clerk position is held by Andrew Raia, and the highway superintendent is Andre Sorentino, both Republicans. The lone Democrat in the Huntington town government is Jillian Guthman, who has served as the receiver of taxes since 2017, when she was appointed to the position by the board, and shortly after re-elected to serve a full term in 2018.
==Economy==
Sbarro&#x27;s headquarters were located in Melville in the Town of Huntington until 2015.

Around 2002, Swiss International Air Lines&#x27;s North American headquarters moved from Melville to Uniondale, Town of Hempstead. The facility, the former Swissair North American headquarter site, was completed in 1995. Swissair intended to own, instead of lease, its headquarters site. It enlisted architect Richard Meier to design the Melville facility.

In 1997, Aer Lingus announced that it was moving its North American headquarters from Manhattan to Melville; James Lyndon, a spokesperson for the airline, said that the company moved to Long Island in an effort to reduce costs, as leasing costs are lower on Long Island than in Manhattan. The move would transfer 75 employees, including administrative personnel, marketing personnel, sales personnel, and telephone reservation agents. The airline planned to move on June 15, 1997. The airline had also considered sites in Boston and in Westchester, New York.

<text>The solar mass () is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, equal to approximately (2 nonillion kilograms in US short scale). It is approximately equal to the mass of the Sun. It is often used to indicate the masses of other stars, as well as stellar clusters, nebulae, galaxies and black holes. More precisely, the mass of the Sun is
The solar mass is about times the mass of Earth (), or times the mass of Jupiter ().

== History of measurement ==
The value of the gravitational constant was first derived from measurements that were made by Henry Cavendish in 1798 with a torsion balance. The value he obtained differs by only 1% from the modern value, but was not as precise. The diurnal parallax of the Sun was accurately measured during the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, yielding a value of (9 arcseconds, compared to the present value of ). From the value of the diurnal parallax, one can determine the distance to the Sun from the geometry of Earth.

The first known estimate of the solar mass was by Isaac Newton. In his work &quot;Principia&quot; (1687), he estimated that the ratio of the mass of Earth to the Sun was about . Later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax, which he had used to estimate the distance to the Sun. He corrected his estimated ratio to in the third edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;. The current value for the solar parallax is smaller still, yielding an estimated mass ratio of .

As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of Solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using Kepler&#x27;s third law.

== Calculation ==
The mass of the Sun cannot be measured directly, and is instead calculated from other measurable factors, using the equation for the orbital period of a small body orbiting a central mass. Based on the length of the year, the distance from Earth to the Sun (an astronomical unit or AU), and the gravitational constant (), the mass of the Sun is given by solving Kepler&#x27;s third law:
formula_1

The value of &quot;G&quot; is difficult to measure and is only known with limited accuracy (&quot;see&quot; Cavendish experiment). The value of &quot;G&quot; times the mass of an object, called the standard gravitational parameter, is known for the Sun and several planets to a much higher accuracy than &quot;G&quot; alone. As a result, the solar mass is used as the standard mass in the astronomical system of units.

== Variation ==
The Sun is losing mass because of fusion reactions occurring within its core, leading to the emission of electromagnetic energy, neutrinos and by the ejection of matter with the solar wind. It is expelling about /year. The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the red giant stage, climbing to /year when it reaches the tip of the red-giant branch. This will rise to /year on the asymptotic giant branch, before peaking at a rate of 10−5 to 10−4 /year as the Sun generates a planetary nebula. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate white dwarf, it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.

The mass of the Sun has been decreasing since the time it formed. This occurs through two processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the Sun&#x27;s core, hydrogen is converted into helium through nuclear fusion, in particular the p–p chain, and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons. Most of this energy eventually radiates away from the Sun. Second, high-energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the Sun are ejected directly into outer space as the solar wind and coronal mass ejections.

The original mass of the Sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass-loss rates than at present, and it may have lost anywhere from 1–7% of its natal mass over the course of its main-sequence lifetime. 

== Related units ==
One solar mass, , can be converted to related units:
* (Lunar mass)
* (Earth mass)
* (Jupiter mass)

It is also frequently useful in general relativity to express mass in units of length or time.
* (half the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun)

The solar mass parameter (&quot;G&quot;·), as listed by the IAU Division I Working Group, has the following estimates:
* (TCG-compatible)
* (TDB-compatible)

<doc id="172990" wikidata="Q2577553" url="?curid=172990" title="Use–mention distinction">
<text>In analytic philosophy, a fundamental distinction is made between the use of a term and the mere mention of it. Many philosophical works have been &quot;vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention&quot;. The distinction can sometimes be pedantic, especially in simple cases where it is obvious.

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated with the word &quot;cheese&quot;:
# Cheese is derived from milk.
# &quot;Cheese&quot; is derived from the Old English word .

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called &quot;cheese&quot;: it the word &quot;cheese&quot; to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word &quot;cheese&quot; as a signifier: it the word without using it to refer to anything other than itself.

== Overview ==

In written language, &quot;mentioned&quot; words or phrases often appear between single or double quotation marks or in italics. In philosophy, single quotation marks are typically used, while in other fields (such as linguistics) italics are more common. Some style authorities, such as Strunk and White, emphasize that mentioned words or phrases should be visually distinct. On the other hand, &quot;used&quot; words or phrases do not carry typographic markings.

The phenomenon of a term having different references in various contexts was referred to as &quot;suppositio&quot; (substitution) by medieval logicians. A substitution describes how a term is substituted in a sentence based on its referent. For nouns, a term can be used in different ways:
* With a &quot;concrete and real referent&quot;: &quot;That is my &quot;pig&quot;.&quot; (personal supposition) 
* With a &quot;concrete but unreal referent&quot;: &quot;Santa Claus&#x27;s &quot;pig&quot; is very big.&quot; (personal supposition)
* With a &quot;generic referent&quot;: &quot;Any &quot;pig&quot; breathes air.&quot; (simple supposition)
* Metaphorically: &quot;Your grandfather is a &quot;pig&quot;.&quot; (improper supposition)
* As a &quot;pure term&quot;: &quot;&quot;Pig&quot; has only three letters.&quot; (material supposition)

The use–mention distinction is particularly significant in analytic philosophy. Confusing use with mention can lead to misleading or incorrect statements, such as category errors.

Self-referential statements also engage the use–mention distinction and are often central to logical paradoxes, such as Quine&#x27;s paradox. In mathematics, this concept appears in Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, where the diagonal lemma plays a crucial role.

== Commentary ==
Stanisław Leśniewski extensively employed this distinction, noting the fallacies that can result from confusing it in Russell and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

Donald Davidson argued that quotation cannot always be treated as mere mention, giving examples where quotations carry both use and mention functions.

Douglas Hofstadter explains the distinction between use and mention as follows:

Issues arise when a mention itself is mentioned. Notating this with italics or repeated quotation marks can lead to ambiguity.

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction &quot;may seem rather pedantic&quot;.

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher John Searle, Jacques Derrida mentioned the distinction as &quot;rather laborious and problematical&quot;.

<text>Airsoft, also known as survival game () in Japan where it was popular, is a team-based shooting game in which participants eliminate opposing players out of play by shooting them with spherical plastic projectiles shot from airsoft guns.

Although similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not leave visible markings on their target and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellet impacts can leave small bruises or welts on exposed skin (and so protective gear is still recommended), the game relies heavily on an honor system in which players who have been hit are expected to call themselves out of play in keeping with honesty and sportsmanship.

The airsoft guns used are mostly magazine-fed, with some having manual/battery motor-powered spring-piston pump power plants similar to Nerf Blasters, or pneumatically powered by replaceable compressed gas (e.g. propane (&quot;green gas&quot;), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or ) canisters. Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and most cosmetically resemble real firearms. This makes them popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. There are also professional gun safety and weapon manipulation training conducted with airsoft in some fields, such as law enforcement training, due to better safety and lower cost. The United States Coast Guard, for instance, officially adopted airsoft for training in 2018.

Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition, but often ranges from action shooting to short organized live action role-playing (LARP) scenarios, close quarters battle skirmishes, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. It is played in indoor courses or outdoor fields. Combat situations on the field may involve the use of genuine military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals acting as supervisors and marshals.

Before gameplay, an airsoft gun&#x27;s muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually measured in feet per second (FPS) or joules, a measurement for kinetic energy. Some countries have a set velocity or muzzle energy restriction; guns shooting over the legal muzzle velocity can be confiscated. Some playing fields further restrict minimum engagement distances, requiring players to yell &quot;Bang Bang!&quot; or another phrase instead of actually shooting other players at close distances. This is done to prevent any potential injuries from high-energy pellets shot at short ranges.

In certain countries use of laser sights of any kind is illegal, including gun scopes with integrated lasers.

== History ==
Airsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, when photographer Ichiro Nagata, an avid shooting enthusiast himself, thought about making model guns that shoot real projectiles that could not kill. These &quot;guns&quot; were trademarked as soft air guns, tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Japan&#x27;s strict weapons control laws. The name &quot;soft air&quot; referred to the compressed Freon-silicone oil mixture (later replaced by a propane-silicone oil mixture known as &quot;Green Gas&quot;) that was used as a propellant gas, which was significantly weaker than the canistered  used in proper airguns (pellet guns and BB guns). Originally designed for target shooting, the plastic balls used in these &quot;soft air guns&quot; can be shot at humans without causing injury due to the low muzzle energy. After Tokyo Marui introduced its revolutionary electric motor-gear box design, which allows sustainable rapid-fire using rechargeable batteries, soft air guns became popular for casual wargames, which the Japanese call . Asahi Firearms was a model company from Japan who operated in the 1980s and 90s and was one of the early pioneers of the airsoft hobby.

Airsoft guns spread to the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and early 1990s via a company called LS. They were sold in separate pieces and had to be assembled out of box before they were capable of shooting. These then became available to the rest of Europe and North America and rapidly gained popularity worldwide. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft has been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages. Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in East Asia. Many law enforcement agencies and military units within the United States now start using airsoft for force-on-force tactical training drills.

== Equipment ==

The guns used in airsoft are typically classified as imitation firearms. They have a mechanism for shooting projectiles 6 mm or 8 mm in diameter.

Airsoft guns are classified according to their operating principle, which can be spring-loaded, electric (battery-powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or &quot;AEGs&quot;), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as &quot;GBBs&quot;). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart grenade launchers which fire a projectile spray of pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed gas propellant (i.e. green gas, propane, compressed air, or CO2). There is also a type of airsoft gun that is powered by a single (HPA) high-pressure air tank and a battery pack to power the internal FCU &quot;Fire Control Unit&quot; computer board. These guns are often known for their high and adjustable RPS or &quot;Rounds Per Second&quot; and durability. These HPA replicas are most often referred to as &quot;PolarStars&quot;, although this refers to a popular brand of HPA engines and accessories.

A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its &quot;real steel&quot; counterpart due to the use of aluminum alloy and plastic materials, though some have added weights in them for a more realistic feel. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts, while newer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and Mainland China, have both internal and external parts that are metallic. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism.

Gas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard-capacity magazine; however, some are high-capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the 30-round capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines have spring followers like in BB guns. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun) type replicas.

It is common for owners to &quot;tech&quot; (modify) their guns. The majority of gearboxes are made to Tokyo Marui specifications and have aftermarket upgrade parts available commercially. Some gearboxes are proprietary in design. It is also possible to perform DIY modifications.

=== Hop-up ===

The &quot;hop-up&quot; system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and pistols, is used to increase effective ranges by putting backspin on the pellets. The Magnus effect causes the pellets to experience more lift as they are shot, counteracting against gravity. A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it moves past. Adjusting the hop-up makes the nub more or less protrude into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced. Ideally, the hop-up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far or dropping too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the muzzle velocity (a gun firing with the hop fully unwound can drop to as low as ). Ease and location of adjustment vary by gun design; some equipment provides a control that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial disassembly. For example, a common location for Hop-Up adjustment is where the ejection port would be on a real firearm, which allows the machine to be covered while still allowing quick access to adjust the Hop-Up.

=== Customization ===
Some players customize their airsoft guns, either to improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, fore-grips, and flashlights, red dot sights being the most commonly used. Red dot sights are used to help aim, fore-grips are used to get a better grip on the airsoft gun, and flashlights (whether mounted or held in another hand) are used to illuminate dark areas and/or to blind opponents.

Even though in certain countries lasers are illegal, they are popular attachments in the U.S. and Europe. Laser sights are more for their appearance than any practical effect, largely because they must be weak enough not to carry a risk of damaging another player&#x27;s eyesight, which rules out using any laser powerful enough to produce a visible dot on the target in sunlight (although lasers can be useful for night games).

Also available are &quot;mock suppressors/silencers&quot;. These resemble the actual firearm accessory that dampens sound. Since Airsoft does not use combustibles for propulsion these usually serve no function. Although there are models that function to &quot;light up&quot; a glow-in-the-dark BB using UV light similar to a tracer round.

== Projectile ==

Most airsoft guns fire round plastic pellets, usually white, but Tracers are common as well. The pellets mostly range from 0.12 to 0.48 g. However, the most popular weights for AEGs (automatic electric guns) and GBB* (Gas Blow-Back guns) are 0.20 g to 0.32 g (whose muzzle velocity ranges from approximately to ). While heavier rounds (0.36–0.40 g) are typically used in long-range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind.

The pellets, which are called BBs, are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round (65 kg) package of tournament grade BBs. Biodegradable BBs are a fraction more expensive than non-bio counterparts, but many fields require them. BBs are typically 5.95mm ±0.01 mm in diameter.

=== Ballistics ===
Due to the low muzzle energy (less than even for high-power models) and poor sectional density, the pain an airsoft pellet causes on skin impact is about the same as getting pinched. As a reference value, a standard 0.20 gram 6 mm pellet, which is the most common size and weight, traveling at has of kinetic energy. Calculating the Joules and energy generated by airsoft guns is important because of phenomena like &quot;joule creep&quot; where the FPS remains the same while the energy of the airsoft BB leaving the airsoft gun barrel increases.

Different regions vary in the velocity airsoft guns are allowed to shoot at. In the United States, velocity differs from the type of gameplay field. Close Quarter Battle arenas typically regulate velocity on airsoft guns at around . For outdoor fields, velocity is usually regulated by the type of gun. With a standard pellet, fully automatic Airsoft Electric Guns (AEGs) are often set at less than , semi-automatic DMR-style AEGs at , and bolt-action (manually cocked spring-piston) sniper rifles at .

The maximum effective range of field-legal airsoft guns is all around with a highly upgraded sniper rifle replica. Most airsoft guns used for field play will have an effective range of around , depending on the intended gameplay role. Most Airsoft guns are capable of shooting from , although it is also possible to purchase upgraded internals that will enable the gun to shoot up to or higher. In California, a common limit for CQB is . In Ireland, Italy and Japan the muzzle energy limit for airsoft guns is 1 joule no matter what the type of gameplay. In the UK, the law allows weapons locked to semi-automatic and bolt-action rifles to fire up to 2.5 joules (at muzzle velocity up to ). Any weapon &quot;which is capable of discharging two or more missiles successively without repeated pressure on the trigger&quot; is limited, by law, at 1.3 joules (velocity up to ). Northern Ireland has a maximum velocity of with 0.20 g pellets, without regard to the type of equipment. In Sweden, the legal limitations of airsoft guns caps the energy limit at 10 joules for manual guns, and 3 joules for semi- and fully automatic guns.

The ballistics of spring- or electrically powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy. The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around , beyond which added barrel length will not improve accuracy. In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy. Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;). This rule will apply even for barrels longer than , if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel. However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring-powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter due to the weakened muzzle pop.

In gas-powered guns, added barrel length (to an appropriate extent) can result in increased velocity and accuracy to a degree. Tighter-bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have bore barrels, but best performance is usually seen with &quot;tightbore&quot; barrels, which are in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned and lubricated regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a high-quality 6.01-6.02 mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good-quality 6.03 mm or 6.05 mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between tightbore sizes is debatable and usually outweighed by bore consistency. Although, with the newfound popularity with HPA guns, the debate has been opened that barrels with a larger diameter (up to ) could provide a more accurate shot. Due to the higher volume of air surrounding the pellet it negates the chance of the pellet coming into contact with the barrel, throwing the pellet&#x27;s trajectory off, similar to a musket, in how the bullet slams about before leaving the barrel.

== Safety ==

Airsoft guns are not to be confused with BB guns, which are airguns that shoot metallic spherical pellets, unlike the plastic pellets shot by airsoft guns.

Many manufacturers and retailers suggest treating an airsoft gun like a real gun at all times. This will help alleviate safety issues resulting in an accidental/negligent discharge, or prevent a public panic due to a carelessly displayed airsoft gun being mistaken for a real firearm. Most manufacturers include an orange tip on the muzzle of the airsoft gun for signaling and safety purposes, and most retailers urge consumers not to remove the orange tip as it is used to help distinguish them from a real firearm. The orange tip serves many purposes, one of them being for law enforcement to help discern airsoft guns from real firearms and thus prevent unnecessary excessive forces.

The minimum safe level of gear required to participate in most games includes a pair of ANSI Z87.1 eye protection, preferably a fully sealed APEL-rated ballistic eyewear. Traditional prescription glasses and sunglasses, or goggles not rated sufficiently for impact-resistance, may shatter and/or be perforated upon being struck when used for airsoft or paintball, causing injury to the eye. Masks, face shields and other types of full-face coverings such as balaclavas are recommended at most airsoft fields.

=== Community safety precautions ===

Rules such as a maximum muzzle velocity and engagement distance guidelines are used by different groups. Some organizations have created common safety rules and guidelines. Most minimum engagement distances are 10 feet.

When not actively playing, some fields require &quot;barrel bags&quot;, also known as barrel socks, barrel condoms, barrel blockers, or barrel sleeves, to be placed over the muzzle of the gun. The magazine is usually removed as well, and the gun fired to clear the chamber. Most fields also require players to leave their guns set to the safety position when they are not shooting, a practice common when using real firearms. In certain countries, such as the Philippines, additional special rules have been adopted.

== Legal restrictions ==

Airsoft is legal in most parts of the world. Some countries have specific restrictions, such as maximum muzzle velocity and &quot;unrealistic&quot; coloring to distinguish them from actual firearms. They are legal throughout the United States, but restrictions do exist in cities like Chicago and Detroit. The states of New Mexico, New York and New Jersey, however, do not allow airsoft guns to be used or handled publicly because of the resemblance to real firearms. They may be used on private property with the consent of the owner. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection FAQ page states that Airsoft guns are considered look-alike firearms which require the special blaze orange marking.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, Airsoft guns are classified as Realistic Imitation Firearms but not restricted as much as in the United Kingdom. Under the Criminal Justice Act of 2006, Airsoft guns are legal in the Republic. One can buy, sell and import Airsoft guns without notifying relevant law enforcement authorities. They do not need to be painted in fluorescent colors, they do not need to have an orange tip, but they cannot launch the projectile with a kinetic energy exceeding 1 joule. However, carrying an imitation firearm in public is prohibited, and a gun carry case is required, as for real firearms. Airsoft shops are spread over the country, and buyers must be aged 18 or over to purchase an airsoft gun. There is no age limit on Airsoft, as long as a minor has an adult&#x27;s permission.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, most Airsoft guns are classified as realistic imitation firearms or RIFs. The sale, manufacture, or importation (but not gifting) of these is illegal under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. A defence is allowed for selling for specific purposes including airsoft skirmishing.

The minimum age for buying any imitation firearm in the UK is 18. It is an offense to possess an imitation firearm in a public place without a reasonable excuse, for example traveling to, or from, or being at an airsoft skirmish site.

Most UK airsoft sites and retailers participate in the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailer Association (UKARA) registration scheme. A player who has participated in at least 3 skirmishes over a period of at least 56 days at the same skirmish site can be registered by that site. Retailers have access to the database to verify that the purchaser can provide them with a defence. The Boarder Agency also has access to check legality of imports.

As an alternative to RIFs, IFs (Imitation Firearms, including &#x27;two tones&#x27;) are available in the UK. These are RIFs which have been painted a bright color (excluding white/silver/gold) over at least 51% of the item. No specific defence is required for selling an IF, although the minimum age for purchasing remains 18.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, there are laws pertaining to airsoft importing. All airsoft guns that are bought in Canada are legal, but when importing it, the gun has to have between 366FPS and 500FPS to pass inspection at customs, otherwise the gun will be shipped back or destroyed.

=== United States ===
Airsoft guns in the United States are sold with a federally mandated orange tip which must be 1/4 inch or longer covering the muzzle of the replica. Manufacturers and importers may cite Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which stipulates that &quot;no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm&quot; without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to &quot;traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof.&quot; This exempts airsoft guns from these requirements, placing them in the same category as BB-guns, pellet, air, and paintball, none of which are conventionally sold or used with an orange tip, and many of which bear as much resemblance to real firearms as airsoft guns do.

== Military and police training ==

Airsoft technology is used in military training and law enforcement training. Due to airsoft&#x27;s realism, relatively safe projectiles, and economical ammunition, it is well-suited to war games and force-on-force scenarios to train and improve troop&#x27;s tactical proficiency via associative learning and stress inoculation. Multiple airsoft inventions were developed originally for military and law enforcement use.

Marking rounds were invented by Kerry T. Bowden to allow trainees to see where each projectile landed. Much like paintball and simunitions, these marking pellets would break upon impact, marking the target with luminescent liquid. Unlike traditional plastic pellets, marking rounds are heavier to ensure breakage of the shell on impact. The weight can be adjusted by adding heavier liquid. Marking rounds are critical for trainees because they allow the shooter to see exactly where they hit the target. This allows them to extrapolate their mistakes and improve their aim.

Reusable grenades were improved by Scott Frank to emulate the fragmentation of a real grenade in war games and scenarios. The grenade can be loaded with paint or pellets. It uses a quick release of highly pressurized gas to break the shell and quickly disperse pellets or paint in all directions. Frank&#x27;s grenade, although not the first, aimed to be as realistic and predictable as an actual grenade. He developed a more accurate timing mechanism and secondary safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. Both marking rounds and reusable grenades gave airsoft the edge it needed to enter into military and law enforcement training grounds.

The airsoft guns used for training differ from civilian models. Guns manufactured for professional training are made to replicate the weight, feel and the sound of its real steel counterpart. In general, professional training airsoft guns are GBB models and enhanced with a weighted blowback mechanism to increase the force of the kick. Some are AEGs and are built with a blowback mechanism. They are also outfitted with muzzle protectors that amplify the sound to a decibel level comparable to that of a real firearm. The average FPS for professional training airsoft guns is higher than civilian models. Economically, airsoft is cheaper than simulation training. Benjamin Kratz, Fort Jackson&#x27;s battalion executive officer, said that one blank M16 round can cost as much as 32 airsoft rounds. Airsoft can also be used in military simulations such as in malls or prisons to add to the immersion. There are different event producers like MiR Tactical holding these events.

<doc id="173004" wikidata="Q219730" url="?curid=173004" title="Network News Transfer Protocol">
<text>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles (&quot;netnews&quot;) between news servers, and for reading/posting articles by the end user client applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego, and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley, wrote , the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.

Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems. Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.

As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for exchanging newsgroup articles.

A newsreader, also known as a news client, is a software application that reads articles on Usenet, either directly from the news server&#x27;s disks or via the NNTP.

The well-known TCP port 119 is reserved for NNTP. Well-known TCP port 433 (NNSP) may be used when doing a bulk transfer of articles from one server to another. When clients connect to a news server with Transport Layer Security (TLS), TCP port 563 is often used. This is sometimes referred to as NNTPS. Alternatively, a plain-text connection over port 119 may be changed to use TLS via the codice_1 command.

In October 2006, the IETF released , which updates NNTP and codifies many of the additions made over the years since RFC 977. At the same time, the IETF also released , which specifies the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) via NNTP over STARTTLS.

==Network News Reader Protocol==
During an abortive attempt to update the NNTP standard in the early 1990s, a specialized form of NNTP intended specifically for use by clients, NNRP, was proposed. This protocol was never completed or fully implemented, but the name persisted in InterNetNews&#x27;s (INN) &quot;nnrpd&quot; program. As a result, the subset of standard NNTP commands useful to clients is sometimes still referred to as &quot;NNRP&quot;.

<doc id="173009" wikidata="Q169898" url="?curid=173009" title="Scuderia Ferrari">
<text>Scuderia Ferrari (; ), currently racing under Scuderia Ferrari HP, is the racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer Ferrari and the racing team that competes in Formula One racing. The team is also known by the nickname &quot;The Prancing Horse&quot; ( or simply ), in reference to their logo. It is the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having competed in every world championship since .

The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo. By 1947, Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, 24 Hours of Spa, Targa Florio, and Mille Miglia. Its customers have also secured victories at events including Petit Le Mans, Nürburgring 24 Hours, Bathurst 12 Hour, and Carrera Panamericana. The team is known for its passionate support base, known as the &quot;tifosi&quot;. The Italian Grand Prix at Monza is regarded as the team&#x27;s home race.

As a constructor in Formula One, Ferrari has a record 16 Constructors&#x27; Championships. Their most recent Constructors&#x27; Championship was won in . The team also holds the record for the most Drivers&#x27; Championships with 15, won by nine different drivers including Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher, and Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen&#x27;s title in is the most recent for the team. The 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix marked Ferrari&#x27;s 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One.

Schumacher is the team&#x27;s most successful driver. Joining the team in and driving for them until his first retirement in , he won five consecutive drivers&#x27; titles and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively between and , and the team won consecutive constructors&#x27; titles between and 2004, marking the era as the most successful period in the team&#x27;s history. The team&#x27;s drivers for the season are Charles Leclerc and seven-time Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton.

==History==

Scuderia Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929 to enter amateur drivers in various races. Ferrari himself had raced in Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali and Alfa Romeo cars before that date. The idea came about on the night of 16 November at a dinner in Bologna, where Ferrari solicited financial help from textile heirs Augusto and Alfredo Caniato and wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini. He then gathered a team which at its peak included over forty drivers, most of whom raced in various Alfa Romeo 8C cars; Ferrari himself continued racing, with moderate success, until the birth of his first son Dino in 1932. The prancing horse blazon first appeared at the 1932 Spa 24 Hours in Belgium on a two-car team of Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second.

In 1933, Alfa Romeo experienced economic difficulties and withdrew its team from racing. From then, the Scuderia Ferrari became the acting racing team of Alfa Romeo when the factory released to the Scuderia the up to date Monoposto Tipo B racers. In 1935, Enzo Ferrari and Luigi Bazzi built the Alfa Romeo Bimotore, the first car to wear a Ferrari badge on the radiator cowl. Ferrari managed numerous established drivers (notably Tazio Nuvolari, Giuseppe Campari, Achille Varzi, and Louis Chiron) and several talented rookies (Mario Tadini, Guy Moll, Carlo Maria Pintacuda, and Antonio Brivio) from his headquarters in Viale Trento e Trieste, Modena, Italy, until 1938, at which point Alfa Romeo made him the manager of the factory racing division, Alfa Corse. Alfa Romeo had bought the shares of the Scuderia Ferrari in 1937 and transferred, from 1 January 1938, the official racing activity to Alfa Corse whose new buildings were being erected next to the Alfa factory at Portello, Milan. The Viale Trento e Trieste facilities remained active to assist the racing customers.
Enzo Ferrari disagreed with this policy change and was dismissed by Alfa in 1939. In October 1939, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa when the racing activity stopped and founded Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which also manufactured machine tools. The agreement with Alfa included the condition that he would not use the Ferrari name on cars for four years. In the winter of 1939–1940, Ferrari started work on a racecar of his own, the Tipo 815 (eight cylinders, 1.5 L displacement). The 815s, designed by Alberto Massimino, were thus the first true Ferrari cars. After Alberto Ascari and the Marchese Lotario Rangoni Machiavelli di Modena drove them in the 1940 Mille Miglia, World War II put a temporary end to racing and the 815s saw no more competition. Ferrari continued to manufacture machine tools (specifically oleodynamic grinding machines). In 1943, he moved his headquarters to Maranello, where it was bombed in November 1944 and February 1945.

Rules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been discussed before the war; it took several years afterwards for the series to become active. Meanwhile, Ferrari rebuilt his works in Maranello and constructed the 12-cylinder, 1.5 L Tipo 125, which competed at several non-championship Grands Prix. The car made its debut at the 1948 Italian Grand Prix with Raymond Sommer and achieved its first win at the minor Circuito di Garda with Giuseppe Farina. After the four-year condition expired, the road car company was called Ferrari S.p.A., while the name SEFAC (Società Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse) was used for the racing department.

===Headquarters===
The team was based in Modena from its pre-war founding until 1943, when Enzo Ferrari moved the team to a new factory in Maranello in 1943, and both Scuderia Ferrari and Ferrari&#x27;s road car factory remain at Maranello to this day. The team owns and operates a test track on the same site, the Fiorano Circuit built in 1972, which is used for testing road and race cars.

===Identity===
The team is named after its founder Enzo Ferrari. &quot;Scuderia&quot; is Italian for a stable reserved for racing horses, and is also commonly applied to Italian motor racing teams. The prancing horse was the symbol used on Italian World War I ace Francesco Baracca&#x27;s fighter plane. It became the logo of Ferrari after the fallen ace&#x27;s parents, close acquaintances of Enzo Ferrari, suggested that Ferrari use the symbol as the logo of the &quot;Scuderia&quot;, telling him it would &quot;bring him good luck&quot;.

==Formula One==

Since its debut in 1950, Ferrari has become a byword for Formula One. For many, Ferrari and Formula One racing have become inseparable, being the only team to have competed in every season since the world championship began.

===Engine supply===
Ferrari produces engines for its own Formula One cars and has supplied engines to other teams. Ferrari has previously supplied engines to Minardi (1991), Scuderia Italia (1992–1993), Sauber (1997–2005 with engines badged as Petronas, and 2010–2025), Prost (2001, badged Acer), Red Bull Racing (2006), Spyker (2007), Scuderia Toro Rosso (2007–2013, 2016), Force India (2008), and Marussia (2014–2015). When regulations changed in 2014, Cosworth decided not to make the new V6 turbo engines. Marussia, Cosworth&#x27;s only team at the time, signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, beginning in 2014. For the 2024 season, Ferrari supplies the Haas F1 Team and Sauber Motorsport.

===Relationship with governing body===
Ferrari did not enter the first-ever race of the championship, the 1950 British Grand Prix, due to a dispute with the organisers over &quot;start money&quot;. In the 1960s, Ferrari withdrew from several races in strike actions. In 1987, Ferrari considered abandoning Formula One for the American IndyCar series. This threat was used as a bargaining tool with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile  (FIA), and Enzo Ferrari offered to cancel the IndyCar Project and commit to Formula One on the condition that the technical regulations were not changed to exclude V12 engines. The FIA agreed to this, and the IndyCar project was shelved, although a car, the Ferrari 637, had already been constructed. In 2009, it had emerged that Ferrari had an FIA-sanctioned veto on the technical regulations.

===Team orders controversies===
Team orders have proven controversial at several points in Ferrari&#x27;s history. At the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix, the two Ferraris were leading with Gilles Villeneuve ahead of Didier Pironi. The team showed the slow sign to its drivers, and, as per a pre-race agreement, the driver leading at that point was expected to take the win of the Grand Prix. Villeneuve slowed and expected that Pironi would follow; the latter did not and instead passed Villeneuve. Villeneuve was angered by what he saw as a betrayal by his teammate and, at one point, had even refused to go onto the podium. This feud is often considered to have been a contributory factor to his fatal accident in qualifying at the next race, the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.

At the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, after having started from pole position and leading the first 70 laps, Rubens Barrichello was instructed to let Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher pass him, a move that proved to be unpopular among many Formula One fans and the FIA, the sport&#x27;s governing body. Following this incident and others in which team orders were used, such as McLaren&#x27;s use of them at the 1997 European Grand Prix and at the 1998 Australian Grand Prix, and Jordan Grand Prix&#x27;s at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, team orders in Formula One were officially banned ahead of the season.

On lap 49 of the 2010 German Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso went past Felipe Massa for the race lead, after Ferrari had informed Massa that Alonso was &quot;faster than him&quot;. This communication has widely been interpreted as a team order from Ferrari. Alonso won the race, with Massa finishing second and Sebastian Vettel taking the final place on the podium. Ferrari were fined the maximum penalty available to the stewards, $100,000, for breach of regulations and for &quot;bringing the sport into disrepute&quot; as per &quot;Article 151c&#x27; of the International Sporting Code&quot;. Ferrari said they would not contest the fine. The team were referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council, where they upheld the stewards&#x27; view but did not take any further action. The ban on team orders was subsequently lifted for the season.

===Racing colours===
In keeping with their Italian roots, the Ferrari works team has always kept a red colour in the tradition of rosso corsa, the national racing colour of Italy, except for last two races in the season (the 1964 United States Grand Prix and 1964 Mexican Grand Prix) when Enzo Ferrari let his cars be entered by the NART team in American national racing colours (white with blue lengthwise &quot;&quot;Cunningham racing stripes&quot;) to protest against Italian racing authorities. However, Ferrari cars entered by non-Italian privateer teams wore their respective national racing colours until the 1961 Belgian Grand Prix when Belgian driver Olivier Gendebien privately entered a Ferrari car painted in the Belgian racing yellow colour, scoring 4th behind three other Ferrari cars painted in red as they were entered by the Scuderia Ferrari works team itself, and driven by US drivers Phil Hill and Richie Ginther as well as German Wolfgang von Trips.

Ferrari won the 1964 World championship with John Surtees by competing the last two races (the United States Grand Prix and Mexican Grand Prix) in Ferrari 158 cars painted white with blue lengthwise &quot;Cunningham racing stripes&quot;&quot; -the national colours of the teams licensed in the United States- as these were entered not by the Italian works team themselves but by the American NART team. This was done as a protest against the agreement between Ferrari and the Italian Racing Authorities regarding their planned mid-engined Ferrari race car. Since Ferrari cars entered in and seasons by the NART team and at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix by the British privateer team Reg Parnell kept wearing the red colour, the 1964 Mexican Grand Prix was the last time Ferrari cars wore other than the traditional red colour in Formula One.

===Formula One team sponsorship===
The Ferrari Formula One team was resistant to the commercial sponsorship for many years and it was not until that the cars began to feature the logo of the Fiat group (which had been the owners of the Ferrari company since ). Until the 1980s, the only other companies whose logos appeared on Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars were technical partners, such as Magneti Marelli, Brembo, and Agip. At the end of the season, Philip Morris International through its brand Marlboro withdrew its sponsorship agreement with McLaren after 22 years (since the season) to become the title sponsor of Ferrari, resulting to the change of the official team&#x27;s name to &quot;Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro&quot; from the beginning of the season until the 2011 European Grand Prix. Marlboro had already been Ferrari&#x27;s minor sponsor since the season and increased to the team&#x27;s major sponsorship in the season.
Alongside Jordan Grand Prix, the team was required to run non-tobacco liveries in United States Grand Prix in the 2000s due to United States Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement requirements, as Phillip Morris was sponsoring Team Penske at the time; a clause in the settlement allowed each tobacco company to sponsor only one sporting entity. In September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of the arrangement until 2011 at a time when advertising of tobacco sponsorship had become illegal in the European Union, and other major teams had withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies (e.g. McLaren had ended its eight-year relationship with West). In reporting the deal, &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine judged it to be a black day for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1 billion from the agreement. The last time Ferrari ran explicit tobacco sponsorship on the car was at the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix, with barcodes and other subliminal markers used afterwards.
On 8 July 2011, it was announced that the Marlboro section of its official team name had been removed from the 2011 British Grand Prix onwards, following complaints from sponsorship regulators. As a consequence, the official team&#x27;s name was reverted to Scuderia Ferrari. At the 2018 Japanese Grand Prix, Ferrari added Philip Morris International&#x27;s new Mission Winnow project logos to the car and team clothing. Although Mission Winnow is described as a non-tobacco brand &quot;dedicated to science, technology and innovation&quot;, commentators such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; Richard Williams have noted that the logos incorporate elements whose shapes mimic the iconic Marlboro cigarette packet design. In 2019, Mission Winnow became the team&#x27;s title sponsor, and the team originally entered the season as Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow. Mission Winnow was dropped from team name before the season opener, while the car&#x27;s Mission Winnow logos were replaced by a special 90th anniversary logo, after Australian authorities had launched an investigation into whether the initiative introduced by Philip Morris contravened laws banning tobacco advertising. Mission Winnow was restored for the second race of the season, and was used until the Monaco Grand Prix. The Mission Winnow logos were again replaced by the 90th anniversary logos for the Canadian until the Russian Grand Prix. The Mission Winnow branding returned at the Japanese Grand Prix. At the end of the season, the Mission Winnow sponsorship was dropped to promote new technologies.

On 10 September 2009, Ferrari announced that it would be sponsored by Santander from 2010 on a five-year contract. The contract was subsequently extended to end in late 2017. After a four-year break, Santander and Ferrari renewed their partnership on 21 December 2021 with a multi-year contract. As part of the deal with Acer, Acer was allowed to sell Ferrari-badged laptops. On the other hand, semiconductor chip maker AMD, announced in early 2009 that it had decided to drop its sponsorship of the team and was waiting for its contract to expire after its former vice-president/sales executive (who was an avid fan of motorsports) had left the company. AMD returned to sponsor the team in 2018. On 3 July 2014, Ferrari announced a two-year sponsorship agreement with the United States–based Haas Automation tool company, which transferred into a powertrain deal in 2016 when the Haas F1 Team entered the sport.

On 14 April 2018, AMD announced a multi-year sponsorship with Scuderia Ferrari on the occasion of the Chinese Grand Prix held on the Shanghai Circuit. The AMD logo was visible on the nose of the Ferrari SF71H. In December 2021, the team extended its 10-year partnership with Kaspersky Lab, which also became its esports team partner. This deal was terminated following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The official suppliers of Ferrari for the 2021 season included Pirelli, Puma, Radiobook, Experis-Veritaaq, SKF, Magneti Marelli, NGK, Brembo, Riedel Communications, VistaJet, and Iveco. Other suppliers included Alfa Romeo, Palantir Technologies, Bell Sports, and Sabelt. The companies sponsoring Ferrari for the 2021 season included Shell, Ray-Ban, United Parcel Service, Estrella Galicia, Weichai Group, Richard Mille, Mahle GmbH, Amazon Web Services, and Officine Meccaniche Rezzatesi.

On 24 April 2024, the team announced a multi-year title partnership with HP Inc., renaming the team (including E-sports and F1 Academy) as Scuderia Ferrari HP from the 2024 Miami Grand Prix onwards.

===Sportscar racing===
From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, Ferrari competed in sports car racing with great success, winning the overall World Sportscar Championship (WSC) twelve times. Ferrari cars (including non-works entries) won the Mille Miglia eight times, the Targa Florio seven times, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans nine times. In this span of time, Ferrari was almost the only constructor able to support the participation in both the two most important categories of international car motor racing at the time, i.e. the Formula One and endurance racing championships. The fact that it did so, achieving remarkable success with few resources and coming from an impoverished post-World War II Italy, it is seen as a testament to the prowess, passion, and dedication to the men of the Scuderia and its founder. Ferrari scored international successes in sports car racing while still at the startup phase, taking wins in 1948 at the Mille Miglia and at the Targa Florio with the Ferrari 166 S and in 1949 at the Mille Miglia, at the12 Hours of Paris, at the 24 Hours of Spa, at the Targa Florio, and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans all in the same season. This remarkable streak of victories was achieved with the 2-litre Ferrari 166 MM against larger engined sports cars and already known marques. The 166MM in its famous barchetta form represented also a milestone in car design history and was soon copied abroad, ending up revisited in the lines of the Shelby Cobra of the early 1960s. Ferrari cars, being able to win at the first try at Le Mans and to triumph in all the major races of the time, become soon a product of excellence and famous, rich people started to desire and buy them.

The streak of prestigious victories continued the following seasons with wins at the Carrera Panamericana in 1951, at the 1950 and 1951 Mille Miglia, and almost at the same time Ferrari started to win in Formula One at several international events. In 1953, with the creation of the WSC, Ferrari, along with other manufacturers like Aston Martin, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, and Jaguar began to enter multiple factory-backed cars in races, such as the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, the Mille Miglia in Italy, the 24 Hours of Spa in Belgium, the Nürburgring 1000 km in Germany, and the Sicilian Targa Florio. Ferrari launched a large range of sports racers over the next three years. This included the traditional compact Colombo V12-powered Ferrari 250 MM; the larger V12 Lampredi-powered 340 MM, 375 MM, 375 Plus, and 410 S; and Jano-powered 290 MM, 315 S, and 335 S; the four-cylinder 500, 625, 750, and 860 Monzas; and the six-cylinder 376 S and 735 LM. With this potent line-up, Ferrari was able to claim six of the first seven WSC titles (1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1958).

In the first half of the 1960s, Ferrari continued to enjoy considerable success, including six overall wins in a row at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (from 1960 to 1965). With the introduction of the Sports Prototypes class, the team developed the Ferrari P series of cars. Up to the 1964 season, they faced little competition from major manufacturers, as only Porsche stayed in the series albeit with smaller engined cars that were able to be competitive only in selected races where engine power was less relevant and overall lightness was a premium, such as at the Targa Florio or at the Nurburgring. At the end of 1963, a conflict between Ferrari and Ford over the potential acquisition of the Italian manufacturer by the American giant carmaker gave way to the famous &quot;Ford vs. Ferrari war&quot;, a sort of modern David vs. Goliath battle that changed international motorsport forever. Ford decided to enter endurance racing pouring unprecedented amounts of money in the development of a racing department in England with the objective to beat Ferrari in this category of races. The Ford GT40 was born and developed in the years following that initiative. After a few years, Ford entered also the Formula One championship. No European manufacturer was able to compete with this level of investment at the time, and Ford engines dominated Formula One racing for over a decade. Moreover, the advent of the American carmaker brought along munificent sponsorships from American tobacco and oil companies, in addition to a bigger level of media coverage to the sport. Ferrari was able to prevail in the 1964 and 1965 seasons both in the championship and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans but had to concede Ford the victory in the 1966 championship and Le Mans race, when the 7-litre GT40 had a dominant season.

In 1967, the last year in which Ford and Ferrari battled for the championship, saw Ferrari taking the championship but losing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. This race was very controversial as the race timing disappeared entirely for multiple hours during the night before reappearing with altered results. This and other controversial aspects of the race were recounted by the late Mauro Forghieri, famously quoting a dialogue with Mr Finance, then in charge of organising the Le Mans race. A change of rules denying the participation to prototype cars for the 1968 season forced Ferrari out from the championship and resulted in the end of the Ford vs Ferrari battle in endurance racing. The 1970s was the last decade Ferrari entered as a works effort in sports car racing. After an uninspired performance in the season, Enzo Ferrari stopped all development of sports cars in prototype and grand touring (GT) racing at the end of the year to concentrate on Formula One. This choice paid off and Ferrari was able to contend the Formula One title already from the season and then went on to win several titles in the following years. After Ferrari withdrawal from the WSC, the series soon saw a decline in the level of competition and reduced almost to a one-contender show until the 1987 season, when several manufacturers entered the championship again. Since the 1985 season, the championship was declassed to a team one and there was not a largely participated world manufacturer title for sportscars until the inception of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). Ferrari cars were raced in a range of classes, such as GT racing by other entrants, but not by the factory Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1990s, Ferrari returned to sports prototypes as a constructor with the Ferrari 333 SP with success, although Scuderia Ferrari itself never raced this car.

From 2006, Ferrari returned to GT car racing with a factory effort Ferrari Competizioni GT, in partnership with racing teams, such as AF Corse, Kessel Racing, and Risi Competizione, among others. With factory support, these teams achieved great success in major international GT2 and GTE Pro/GTLM competitions. Starting from this same year, AF Corse won the GT2 manufacturers&#x27; title along with the team&#x27;s title each year it was contested in the FIA GT Championship. It also took two drivers&#x27; titles in 2006 and 2008 in the same series. Following the demise of the GT Championship and the creation of a new world championship series for endurance racing by the FIA, Ferrari/AF Corse continued to enjoy much success in GT racing. Of the ten GT manufacturers&#x27; championships contested from the introduction of the WEC championship in 2012, Ferrari won seven editions (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2022). Almost the same happened with the GT drivers&#x27; title, which had been awarded since the 2013 season, with Ferrari/AF Corse winning five out of nine editions (2013, 2014, 2017, 2021, and 2022). To this tally, AF Corse added four out of six LMGTE PRO team trophies. Several other trophies were won also in the LMGTE PRO/AM class in the WEC. Other victories were also achieved in international and national championships both in GT2/LmGTE and GT3 classes all over the world. Among the victories in prestigious racing events are the two GT2 class wins scored at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 and 2009 by Risi Competizione and the four GTE Pro class wins scored by AF Corse at the same event: in 2012 and 2014 with the Ferrari 458 GT2 driven by Gianmaria Bruni, Giancarlo Fisichella, and Toni Vilander; in 2019 with the Ferrari 488 GTE Ferrari 488 GTE driven by Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado, and Daniel Serra; and in 2021 with the same car driven by Pier Guidi, Calado, and Côme Ledogar. A Ferrari 488 GT3 scored the overall win at the 2017 12 Hours of Bathurst and the 2021 24 Hours of Spa.

In 2023, after a 50-year hiatus, Ferrari returned to the top class of endurance racing with its new Ferrari 499P, a Le Mans Hypercar prototype. Subsequently, they were able to compete for the world title and in prestigious events, such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the 12 Hours of Sebring. The 499P was managed by AF Corse and this caused a restructuring of the GT activities of the successful Italian team. At the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ferrari achieved its first Le Mans victory since 1965 with the No. 51 499P driven by Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado, and Antonio Giovinazzi. In the same year, a Ferrari 296 GT3 run by Frikadelli Racing won the 24 Hours of Nürburgring. At the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ferrari achieved its eleventh victory, recording consecutive victories at Le Mans for the first time since 1965 with the No. 50 499P driven by Antonio Fuoco, Miguel Molina and Nicklas Nielsen. While the Ferrari No. 51 499P driven by Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado, and Antonio Giovinazzi, winner of the previous edition, came in third place.

<text>Major-General John Stark (August 28, 1728 – May 8, 1822) was an American military officer who served during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. He became known as the &quot;Hero of Bennington&quot; for his exemplary service at the Battle of Bennington in 1777.

==Early life==
John Stark was born in Londonderry, New Hampshire (at a site that is now in Derry) in 1728. His father, Archibald Stark (1693–1758) was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to parents who were from Wiltshire, England; Stark&#x27;s father met his future wife when he moved to Londonderry in Ireland. When Stark was eight years old, his family moved to Derryfield (now Manchester, New Hampshire), where he lived for the rest of his life. Stark married Elizabeth &quot;Molly&quot; Page, with whom he had 11 children including his eldest son Caleb Stark.

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though neighbor David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks. Stark grabbed the stick from the first warrior&#x27;s hands and proceeded to attack him, taking the rest of the warriors by surprise. The chief was so impressed by this heroic act that Stark was adopted into the tribe, where he spent the winter.

The following spring a government agent sent from the Province of Massachusetts Bay to work on the exchange of prisoners paid his ransom of $103 Spanish dollars and $60 for Amos Eastman. Stark and Eastman then returned to New Hampshire safely.

==French and Indian War==

Stark served as a second lieutenant under Major Robert Rogers during the French and Indian War. His brother William Stark served beside him. As a member of the daring Rogers&#x27; Rangers, Stark gained valuable combat experience and a detailed knowledge of the northern frontier of the American colonies. While serving with the rangers in 1757, Stark went on a scouting mission toward Fort Carillon in which the rangers were ambushed.

General Jeffery Amherst, in 1759 ordered Rogers&#x27; Rangers to journey from Lake George to the Abenaki village of St. Francis, deep in Quebec. The Rangers went north and attacked the Indian town. Stark, Rogers&#x27; second-in-command of all ranger companies, refused to accompany the attacking force out of respect for his Indian foster-parents residing there. He returned to New Hampshire to his wife, whom he had married the previous year.

At the end of the war, Stark retired as a captain and returned to Derryfield, New Hampshire. His time with the Rangers taught him tactics that he would put to good use during the revolution.

==American Revolution==
===Bunker Hill===
The Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, signaled the start of the American Revolutionary War, and Stark returned to military service. On April 23, 1775, Stark accepted a Colonelcy in the New Hampshire Militia and was given command of the 1st New Hampshire Regiment and James Reed of the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment, also outside of Boston. As soon as Stark could muster his men, he ferried and marched them south to Boston to support the blockaded rebels there. He made his headquarters in the confiscated Isaac Royall House in Medford, Massachusetts.

On June 16, the rebels, fearing a preemptive British attack on their positions in Cambridge and Roxbury, decided to take and hold Breed&#x27;s Hill, a high point on the Charlestown peninsula near Boston. On the night of the 16th, American troops moved into position on the heights and began digging entrenchments.

As dawn approached, lookouts on HMS &quot;Lively&quot;, a 20-gun sloop of war, noticed the activity and the sloop opened fire on the rebels and the works in progress. This in turn drew the attention of the British admiral, who demanded to know what the &quot;Lively&quot; was shooting at. Subsequent to that, the entire British squadron opened fire. As dawn broke on June 17 the British could clearly see hastily constructed fortifications on Breed&#x27;s Hill; British General Thomas Gage knew that he would have to drive the rebels out before fortifications were complete. He ordered Major General William Howe to prepare to land his troops. Thus began the Battle of Bunker Hill. American Colonel William Prescott held the hill throughout the intense initial bombardment with only a few hundred American militia. Prescott knew that he was sorely outgunned and outnumbered, so he sent a desperate request for reinforcements.

Stark and Reed with the New Hampshire minutemen arrived at the scene soon after Prescott&#x27;s request. The &quot;Lively&quot; had begun a rain of accurate artillery fire directed at Charlestown Neck, the narrow strip of land connecting Charlestown to the rebel positions. On the Charlestown side, several companies from other regiments were milling around in disarray, afraid to march into range of the artillery fire. Stark ordered the men to stand aside and calmly marched his men to Prescott&#x27;s positions without taking any casualties.

When the New Hampshire militia arrived, the grateful Colonel Prescott allowed Stark to deploy his men where he saw fit. Stark surveyed the ground and immediately saw that the British would probably try to flank the rebels by landing on the beach of the Mystic River, below and to the left of Bunker Hill. Stark led his men to the low ground between Mystic Beach and the hill and ordered them to &quot;fortify&quot; a two-rail fence by stuffing straw and grass between the rails. Stark also noticed an additional gap in the defense line and ordered Lieutenant Nathaniel Hutchins from his brother William&#x27;s company and others to follow him down a bank to the edge of the Mystic River. They piled rocks across the beach to form a crude defense line. After this fortification was hastily constructed, Stark deployed his men three-deep behind the wall. A large contingent of British with the Royal Welch Fusiliers in the lead advanced towards the fortifications. The Minutemen crouched and waited until the advancing British were almost on top of them, and then stood up and fired as one. They unleashed a fierce and unexpected volley directly into the faces of the fusiliers, killing 90 in the blink of an eye and breaking their advance. The fusiliers retreated in panic. A charge of British infantry was next, climbing over their dead comrades to test Stark&#x27;s line. This charge too was decimated by a withering fusillade by the Minutemen. A third charge was repulsed in a similar fashion, again with heavy losses to the British. The British officers wisely withdrew their men from that landing point and decided to land elsewhere, with the support of artillery.

Later in the battle, as the rebels were forced from the hill, Stark directed the New Hampshire regiment&#x27;s fire to provide cover for Colonel Prescott&#x27;s retreating troops. The day&#x27;s New Hampshire dead were later buried in the Salem Street Burying Ground, Medford, Massachusetts.

While the British did eventually take the hill that day, their losses were formidable, especially among the officers. After the arrival of General George Washington two weeks after the battle, the siege reached a stalemate until March the next year, when cannon seized at the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga were positioned on Dorchester Heights in a deft night manoeuvre. This placement threatened the British fleet in Boston Harbor and forced General Howe to withdraw all his forces from the Boston garrison and sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Among the notable men who served under Stark was Captain Henry Dearborn, who later became Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson. Dearborn arrived with 60 militia men from New Hampshire.

===Trenton and Princeton===

As Washington prepared to go to New York in anticipation of a British attack there, he knew that he desperately needed experienced men like John Stark to command regiments in the Continental Army. George Washington immediately offered Stark a command in the Continental Army. Stark and his New Hampshire regiment agreed to attach themselves to the Continental Army. The men of the New Hampshire Line were sent as reinforcements to the Continental Army during the Invasion of Canada in the spring of 1776. After the retreat of the Continental Army from Canada, Stark and his men traveled to New Jersey to join Washington&#x27;s main army. They were with Washington in the battles of Princeton and Trenton in late 1776 and early 1777.

After Trenton, Washington asked Stark to return to New Hampshire to recruit more men for the Continental Army. Stark agreed, but upon returning home, learned that while he had been fighting in New Jersey, a fellow New Hampshire Colonel named Enoch Poor had been promoted to Brigadier General in the Continental Army. In Stark&#x27;s opinion, Poor had refused to march his militia regiment to Bunker Hill to join the battle, instead choosing to keep his regiment at home. Stark, an experienced woodsman and fighting commander, had been passed over for someone with no combat experience and apparently no will to fight. On March 23, 1777, Stark resigned his commission in disgust, although he pledged his future aid to New Hampshire if it should be needed.

===Bennington and beyond===
Four months later, his home state offered Stark a commission as brigadier general of the New Hampshire Militia. He accepted on the strict condition that he would not be answerable to Continental Army authority. Soon after receiving his commission, Stark assembled 1,492 militiamen in civilian clothes with personal firearms. He traveled to Manchester, Vermont. At this place, he was ordered by Major General Benjamin Lincoln (of the Continental Army) to reinforce Philip Schuyler&#x27;s Continental army on the Hudson River. Stark refused to obey Lincoln, who was another general whom he believed was unfairly promoted over his head. Lincoln was diplomatic enough to allow him to operate independently against the rear of General John Burgoyne&#x27;s British army.

Burgoyne sent an expedition under Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum to capture American supplies at Bennington, Vermont. Baum commanded 374 Brunswick infantry and dismounted dragoons, 300 Indians, loyalists, and Canadians, and two 3-pound cannons manned by 30 Hessians. Stark heard about the raid and marched his force to Bennington. Meanwhile, Baum received intelligence that Bennington was held by 1,800 men. On August 14, Baum asked Burgoyne for reinforcements but assured his army commander that his opponents would not give him much trouble. The Brunswick officer then fortified his position and waited for Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann&#x27;s 642 soldiers and two 6-pound cannons to reach him. Colonel Seth Warner also set out with his 350 men to reinforce Stark.

After waiting out a day of rain, at 3:00 PM on the 16th Stark sent 200 militia to the right, 300 men to the left, 200 troops against a position held by Tories, and 100 men on a feint against Baum&#x27;s main redoubt. In the face of these attacks, the Indians, loyalists, and Canadians fled, leaving Baum stranded in his main position. As his envelopment took effect, Stark led his remaining 1,200 troops against Baum, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll beat them before night or Molly Stark&#x27;s a widow.&quot; After an ammunition wagon exploded, Baum&#x27;s men tried to hack their way out of the trap with their dragoon sabers. Baum was fatally hit and his men gave up around 5:00 PM. With Stark&#x27;s men somewhat scattered by their victory, Breymann&#x27;s column appeared on the scene. At this moment Colonel Seth Warner&#x27;s 350 Green Mountain Boys arrived to confront Breymann&#x27;s men. Between Stark and Warner, the Germans were stopped and then forced to withdraw. The New Hampshire and Vermont soldiers severely mauled Breymann&#x27;s command but the German officer managed to get away with about two-thirds of his force. Historian Mark M. Boatner wrote,

As a commander of New England militia Stark had one rare and priceless quality: he knew the &quot;limitations&quot; of his men. They were innocent of military training, undisciplined, and unenthusiastic about getting shot. With these men he killed over 200 of Europe&#x27;s vaunted regulars with a loss of 14 Americans killed.

Another version has Stark rallying his troops with the cry, &quot;There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!&quot;

Stark&#x27;s action contributed to the surrender of Burgoyne&#x27;s northern army after the Battles of Saratoga by raising American morale, by keeping the British from getting supplies, and by subtracting several hundred men from the enemy order of battle. Stark reported 14 killed and 42 wounded. Of Baum&#x27;s 374 professional soldiers, only nine men escaped. For this feat Stark won his coveted promotion to brigadier general in the Continental Army on October 4, 1777.

Saratoga is seen as the turning point in the Revolutionary War, as it was the first major defeat of a British general and it convinced the French that the Americans were worthy of military aid. After the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm Gen. Stark&#x27;s brigade moved into a position at Stark&#x27;s Knob cutting off Burgoyne&#x27;s retreat to Lake George and Lake Champlain.

John Stark sat as a judge in the court martial that in September 1780 found British Major John André guilty of spying and in helping in the conspiracy of Benedict Arnold to surrender West Point to the British.

He was the commander of the Northern Department three times between 1778 and 1781 along with commanding a brigade at the Battle of Springfield in June 1780.

==Later years==
After serving with distinction throughout the rest of the war, Stark retired to his farm in Derryfield, renamed Manchester in 1810, where he died on May 8, 1822, at the age of 93.

It has been said that of all the Revolutionary War generals, Stark was the only true Cincinnatus because he truly retired from public life at the end of the war. In 1809, a group of Bennington veterans gathered to commemorate the battle. General Stark, then aged 81, was not well enough to travel, but he sent a letter to his comrades, which closed &quot;Live free or die: Death is not the worst of evils.&quot; The motto &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; became the New Hampshire state motto in 1945. Stark and the Battle of Bennington were later commemorated with the tall Bennington Battle Monument and a statue of Stark in Bennington, Vermont.

==Historic sites==
There is a New Hampshire historical marker (number 48) near John Stark&#x27;s birthplace on the east side of New Hampshire Route 28 (Rockingham Road) in Derry, New Hampshire, just south of the intersection of Lawrence Road. There is a second stone marker at the actual homestead location.

Stark&#x27;s childhood home is located at 2000 Elm Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The home was built in 1736 by John&#x27;s father Archibald. The building is now owned by the Molly Stark Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is open by appointment only. Manchester&#x27;s Stark Park, also a listed property, is home to his grave and is named in his honor. There is a bronze statue of General Stark in front of the New Hampshire Statehouse in Concord; it was dedicated in 1890. A statue of General Stark is also located in front of the West Annex of the City of Manchester&#x27;s City Hall. New Castle&#x27;s Fort Stark was renamed for the General in 1900. It was one of seven forts built in the area to protect the nearby city of Portsmouth. The historic site is placed on a peninsula known as Jerry&#x27;s point (or Jaffrey&#x27;s Point) on the southeast side of the island.
In 1894 the state of New Hampshire donated a statue of General Stark for the National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol.

<text>This article focuses on poetry from the United Kingdom written in the English language. The article does not cover poetry from other countries where the English language is spoken, including the Republic of Ireland after December 1922.

The earliest surviving English poetry, written in Anglo-Saxon, the direct predecessor of modern English, may have been composed as early as the 7th century.

==The earliest English poetry==

The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation; Bede attributes this to Cædmon (fl. 658–680), who was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at Whitby. This is generally taken as marking the beginning of Anglo-Saxon poetry.

Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically; for example, estimates for the date of the great epic &quot;Beowulf&quot; range from A.D. 608 right through to A.D. 1000, and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus. It is possible to identify certain key moments, however. &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot; was written before circa A.D. 700, when excerpts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross. Some poems on historical events, such as &quot;The Battle of Brunanburh&quot; (937) and &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot; (991), appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question, and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence.

By and large, however, Anglo-Saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives, rather than its date of composition. The most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries, known as the Cædmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript.

While the poetry that has survived is limited in volume, it is wide in breadth. &quot;Beowulf&quot; is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others such as Waldere and the Finnesburg Fragment show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase; elegies such as &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and &quot;The Ruin&quot; (often taken to be a description of the ruins of Bath); and numerous proverbs, riddles, and charms.

With one notable exception (Rhyming Poem), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliterative verse for its structure and any rhyme included is merely ornamental.

==The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages==
With the Norman conquest of England, beginning in 1111 the Anglo-Saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language. The new aristocracy spoke predominantly Norman, and this became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. As the invaders integrated, their language and literature mingled with that of the natives: the Oïl dialect of the upper classes became Anglo-Norman, and Anglo-Saxon underwent a gradual transition into Middle English.

While Anglo-Norman or Latin was preferred for high culture, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the 13th century, Layamon wrote his &quot;Brut&quot;, based on Wace&#x27;s 12th century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name; Layamon&#x27;s language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence remaining. Geoffrey Chaucer is one of the greatest poets of England. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of romances and lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in Parliament and courts of law.

It was with the 14th century that major works of English literature began once again to appear; these include the so-called Pearl Poet&#x27;s &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Cleanness&quot;, and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;; Langland&#x27;s political and religious allegory &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;; Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;; and the works of Chaucer, the most highly regarded English poet of the Middle Ages, who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of Virgil and Dante.

The reputation of Chaucer&#x27;s successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him, though Lydgate and Skelton are widely studied. A group of Scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by Chaucer. The rise of Scottish poetry began with the writing of &quot;The Kingis Quair&quot; by James I of Scotland. The main poets of this Scottish group were Robert Henryson, William Dunbar and Gavin Douglas. Henryson and Douglas introduced a note of almost savage satire, which may have owed something to the Gaelic bards, while Douglas&#x27; &quot;Eneados&quot;, a translation into Middle Scots of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, was the first complete translation of any major work of classical antiquity into an English or Anglic language.

==The Renaissance in England==
The Renaissance period and the renaissance literature were slow in coming to England, with the generally accepted start date being around 1509. It is also generally accepted that the English Renaissance extended until the Restoration in 1660. However, a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date. A number of medieval poets had, as already noted, shown an interest in the ideas of Aristotle and the writings of European Renaissance precursors such as Dante.

The introduction of movable-block printing by Caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers. Caxton also printed the works of Chaucer and Gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its European counterparts. In addition, the writings of English humanists like Thomas More and Thomas Elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an English audience.

Three other factors in the establishment of the English Renaissance were the Reformation, Counter Reformation, and the opening of the era of English naval power and overseas exploration and expansion. The establishment of the Church of England in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the Catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life. At the same time, long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.

===Early Renaissance poetry===
With a small number of exceptions, the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable. The Douglas &quot;Aeneid&quot; was completed in 1513 and John Skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late Medieval and Renaissance styles. The new king, Henry VIII, was something of a poet himself.

Thomas Wyatt (1503–42), one of the earliest English Renaissance poets, was responsible for many innovations in English poetry, and alongside Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1516/1517–47) introduced the sonnet from Italy into England in the early 16th century. Wyatt&#x27;s professed object was to experiment with the English tongue, to civilise it, to raise its powers to those of its neighbours. Much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the Italian poet Petrarch, but he also wrote sonnets of his own. Wyatt took subject matter from Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets, but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure. Petrarchan sonnets start with an octave (eight lines), rhyming ABBA ABBA. A (volta) occurs (a dramatic turn in the sense), and the next lines are a sestet with various rhyme schemes. Petrarch&#x27;s poems never ended in a rhyming couplet. Wyatt employs the Petrarchan octave, but his most common sestet rhyme scheme is CDDC EE. This marks the beginnings of English sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet.

===The Elizabethans===
Elizabethan literature refers to bodies of work produced during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603). In poetry is characterized by a number of frequently overlapping developments. The introduction and adaptation of themes, models and verse forms from other European traditions and classical literature, the Elizabethan song tradition, the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments.

====Elizabethan Song====
A wide range of Elizabethan poets wrote songs, including Nicholas Grimald, Thomas Nashe and Robert Southwell. There are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period. Perhaps the greatest of all the songwriters was Thomas Campion. Campion is also notable because of his experiments with metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses. These quantitative metres were based on classical models and should be viewed as part of the wider Renaissance revival of Greek and Roman artistic methods.

The songs were generally printed either in miscellanies or anthologies such as Richard Tottel&#x27;s 1557 &quot;Songs and Sonnets&quot; or in songbooks that included printed music to enable performance. These performances formed an integral part of both public and private entertainment. By the end of the 16th century, a new generation of composers, including John Dowland, William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Thomas Weelkes and Thomas Morley were helping to bring the art of Elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level.

Elizabethan poems and plays were often written in iambic meters, based on a metrical foot of two syllables, one unstressed and one stressed. However, much metrical experimentation took place during the period, and many of the songs, in particular, departed widely from the iambic norm.

====Courtly poetry====

With the consolidation of Elizabeth&#x27;s power, a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged. This encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at, and often set in, an idealised version of the courtly world.

Among the best known examples of this are Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen, and Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;. This courtly trend can also be seen in Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Shepheardes Calender&quot;. This poem marks the introduction into an English context of the classical pastoral, a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants. The explorations of love found in the sonnets of William Shakespeare and the poetry of Walter Raleigh and others also implies a courtly audience.

====Classicism====
Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Thomas Campion&#x27;s metrical experiments, and Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Shepheardes Calender&quot; and plays like Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; are all examples of the influence of classicism on Elizabethan poetry. It remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology; Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and the Christopher Marlowe/George Chapman &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; are examples of this kind of work.

Translations of classical poetry also became more widespread, with the versions of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Arthur Golding (1565–67) and George Sandys (1626), and Chapman&#x27;s translations of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (1611) and &quot;Odyssey&quot; (c.1615), among the outstanding examples.

===Jacobean and Caroline poetry: 1603–1660===
English Renaissance poetry after the Elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains; the Metaphysical poets, the Cavalier poets and the school of Spenser. However, the boundaries between these three groups are not always clear and an individual poet could write in more than one manner.

Shakespeare also popularized the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch&#x27;s model. A collection of 154 sonnets by Shakespeare, dealing with themes such as the passage of time, love, beauty, and mortality, were first published in a 1609 quarto.

John Milton (1608–74) is considered one of the greatest English poets, and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his most renowned epic poems were written in the Restoration period, including &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667). Among the important poems Milton wrote during this period are &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, 1631; &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;, 1634; &quot;Comus&quot; (a masque), 1638; and &quot;Lycidas&quot; (1638).

====The Metaphysical poets====
The early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty, complicated style. The most famous of the Metaphysicals is probably John Donne. Others include George Herbert, Thomas Traherne, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, and Richard Crashaw. John Milton in his &quot;Comus&quot; falls into this group. The Metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the Victorian era. Donne&#x27;s reputation was finally fully restored by the approbation of T. S. Eliot in the early 20th century.

Influenced by continental Baroque, and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism, Donne&#x27;s metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or &quot;unpoetic&quot; figures, such as a compass or a mosquito, to reach surprise effects. For example, in &quot;Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot;, one of Donne&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Sonnets&quot;, the points of a compass represent two lovers, the woman who is home, waiting, being the centre, the farther point being her lover sailing away from her. But the larger the distance, the more the hands of the compass lean to each other: separation makes love grow fonder. The paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science, one that is no longer the centre of the universe.

====The Cavalier poets====

Another important group of poets at this time were the Cavalier poets. The Cavalier poets wrote in a lighter, more elegant and artificial style than the Metaphysical poets. They were an important group of writers, who came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–51). (King Charles reigned from 1625 and was executed 1649). Leading members of the group include Ben Jonson, Richard Lovelace, Robert Herrick, Edmund Waller, Thomas Carew, Sir John Suckling, and John Denham. The Cavalier poets can be seen as the forerunners of the major poets of the Augustan era, who admired them greatly. They &quot;were not a formal group, but all were influenced&quot; by Ben Jonson. Most of the Cavalier poets were courtiers, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet. Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions, and are influence by Latin authors Horace, Cicero, and Ovid.

==The Restoration and 18th century==
John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667), a story of fallen pride, was the first major poem to appear in England after the Restoration. The court of Charles II had, in its years in France, learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the Republic. Even if Charles had wanted to reassert the divine right of kingship, the Protestantism and taste for power of the intervening years would have rendered it impossible.

One of the greatest English poets, John Milton (1608–1674), wrote during this period of religious and political instability. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his major epic poems were written in the Restoration period. Some of Milton&#x27;s important poems were written before the Restoration (see above). His later major works include &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, 1671, and &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, 1671. Milton&#x27;s works reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated &quot;Areopagitica&quot; (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history&#x27;s most influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press. William Hayley&#x27;s 1796 biography called him the &quot;greatest English author&quot;, and he remains generally regarded &quot;as one of the preeminent writers in the English language&quot;.

===Satire===
The world of fashion and scepticism that emerged encouraged the art of satire. All the major poets of the period, Samuel Butler, John Dryden, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson, and the Irish poet Jonathan Swift, wrote satirical verse. Their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government. However, writers such as Pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government. Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; is a satirical slaying of two of his literary adversaries (Lewis Theobald, and Colley Cibber in a later version), expressing the view that British society was falling apart morally, culturally, and intellectually.

===18th-century classicism===
The 18th century is sometimes called the Augustan age, and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time. Not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the Roman ideal, they also translated and imitated Greek and Latin verse resulting in measured rationalised elegant verse. Dryden translated all the known works of Virgil, and Pope produced versions of the two Homeric epics. Horace and Juvenal were also widely translated and imitated, Horace most famously by John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester and Juvenal by Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot;.

===Women poets in the 18th century===

A number of women poets of note emerged during the period of the Restoration, including Aphra Behn, Margaret Cavendish, Mary Chudleigh, Anne Finch, Anne Killigrew, and Katherine Philips. Nevertheless, print publication by women poets was still relatively scarce when compared to that of men, though manuscript evidence indicates that many more women poets were practising than was previously thought. Disapproval of feminine &quot;forwardness&quot;, however, kept many out of print in the early part of the period, and even as the century progressed women authors still felt the need to justify their incursions into the public sphere by claiming economic necessity or the pressure of friends. Women writers were increasingly active in all genres throughout the 18th century, and by the 1790s women&#x27;s poetry was flourishing. Notable poets later in the period include Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Joanna Baillie, Susanna Blamire, Felicia Hemans, Mary Leapor, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson. In the past decades there has been substantial scholarly and critical work done on women poets of the long 18th century: first, to reclaim them and make them available in contemporary editions in print or online, and second, to assess them and position them within a literary tradition.

===The late 18th century===
Towards the end of the 18th century, poetry began to move away from the strict Augustan ideals and a new emphasis on the sentiment and feelings of the poet was established. This trend can perhaps be most clearly seen in the handling of nature, with a move away from poems about formal gardens and landscapes by urban poets and towards poems about nature as lived in. The leading exponents of this new trend include Thomas Gray, George Crabbe, Christopher Smart and Robert Burns as well as the Irish poet Oliver Goldsmith. These poets can be seen as paving the way for the Romantic movement.

==The Romantic movement==

The last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence, with revolutions in the United States, France, Ireland and elsewhere. In Great Britain, movement for social change and a more inclusive sharing of power was also growing. This was the backdrop against which the Romantic movement in English poetry emerged.

The main poets of this movement were William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Keats. The birth of English Romanticism is often dated to the publication in 1798 of Wordsworth and Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;. However, Blake had been publishing since the early 1780s. Much of the focus on Blake only came about during the last century when Northrop Frye discussed his work in his book &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot;. Shelley is most famous for such classic anthology verse works as &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, and long visionary poems which include &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. Shelley&#x27;s groundbreaking poem &quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot; calls for nonviolence in protest and political action. It is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley&#x27;s verse, and would often quote the poem to vast audiences.

In poetry, the Romantic movement emphasised the creative expression of the individual and the need to find and formulate new forms of expression. The Romantics, with the partial exception of Byron, rejected the poetic ideals of the 18th century, and each of them returned to Milton for inspiration, though each drew something different from Milton. They also put a good deal of stress on their own originality. 
 To the Romantics, the moment of creation was the most important in poetic expression and could not be repeated once it passed. Because of this new emphasis, poems that were not complete were nonetheless included in a poet&#x27;s body of work (such as Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; and &quot;Christabel&quot;). This argument has, however, been challenged in Zachary Leader&#x27;s study &quot;Revision and Romantic Authorship&quot; (1996).

Additionally, the Romantic movement marked a shift in the use of language. Attempting to express the &quot;language of the common man&quot;, Wordsworth and his fellow Romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience, countering the mimetic, tightly constrained Neo-Classic poems (although it&#x27;s important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his/her own creative expression). In Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Poetry&quot;, he contends that poets are the &quot;creators of language&quot; and that the poet&#x27;s job is to refresh language for their society.

The Romantics were not the only poets of note at this time. In the work of John Clare the late Augustan voice is blended with a peasant&#x27;s first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the English language. Another contemporary poet who does not fit into the Romantic group was Walter Savage Landor. Landor was a classicist whose poetry forms a link between the Augustans and Robert Browning, who much admired it.

==Victorian poetry==
The Victorian era was a period of great political, social and economic change. The Empire recovered from the loss of the American colonies and entered a period of rapid expansion. This expansion, combined with increasing industrialisation and mechanisation, led to a prolonged period of economic growth. The Reform Act 1832 was the beginning of a process that would eventually lead to universal suffrage.

The major Victorian poets were John Clare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Matthew Arnold, Christina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, and Gerard Manley Hopkins, though Hopkins was not published until 1918.

John Clare came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation of its disruption. His biographer Jonathan Bate states that Clare was &quot;the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self&quot;.

Tennyson was, to some degree, the Spenser of the new age and his &quot;Idylls of the Kings&quot; can be read as a Victorian version of &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot;, that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire.

The Brownings spent much of their time out of England and explored European models and matter in much of their poetry. Robert Browning&#x27;s great innovation was the dramatic monologue, which he used to its full extent in his long novel in verse, &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot;. Elizabeth Barrett Browning is perhaps best remembered for &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot; but her long poem &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot; is one of the classics of 19th century feminist literature.

Matthew Arnold was much influenced by Wordsworth, though his poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; is often considered a precursor of the modernist revolution. Hopkins wrote in relative obscurity and his work was not published until after his death. His unusual style (involving what he called &quot;sprung rhythm&quot; and heavy reliance on rhyme and alliteration) had a considerable influence on many of the poets of the 1940s.

===Pre-Raphaelites===

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was a mid-19th century arts movement dedicated to the reform of what they considered the sloppy Mannerist painting of the day. Although primarily concerned with the visual arts, a member of the inner circle, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a poet of some ability, whilst his sister Christina Rossetti is generally considered a greater poet, whose contribution to Victorian Poetry is of a standard equal to that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Rossettis&#x27; poetry shares many of the concerns of the Pre-Raphaelite movement: an interest in Medieval models, an almost obsessive attention to visual detail and an occasional tendency to lapse into whimsy.

Dante Rossetti worked with, and had some influence on, the leading arts and crafts painter and poet William Morris. Morris shared the Pre-Raphaelite interest in the poetry of the European Middle Ages, to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work.

===1890s: &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot;===
Towards the end of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French symbolism and Victorian poetry entered a decadent &quot;fin de siècle&quot; phase. Two groups of poets emerged, the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; poets who adhered to the tenets of Aestheticism, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Symons and the Rhymers&#x27; Club group that included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson and William Butler Yeats.

===Comic verse=== 
Comic verse abounded in the Victorian era. Magazines such as &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;Fun magazine&quot; teemed with humorous invention and were aimed at a well-educated readership. The most famous collection of Victorian comic verse is the Bab Ballads.

==The 20th century==

===The first three decades===
The Victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new. These were Yeats and Thomas Hardy. Yeats, although not a modernist, was to learn a lot from the new poetic movements that sprang up around him and adapted his writing to the new circumstances. Hardy was, in terms of technique at least, a more traditional figure and was to be a reference point for various anti-modernist reactions, especially from the 1950s onwards.

A. E. Housman (1859 – 1936) was poet who was born in the Victorian era and who first published in the 1890s, but who only really became known in the 20th century.
Housman is best known for his cycle of poems &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1896). This collection was turned down by several publishers so that Housman published it himself, and the work only became popular when &quot;the advent of war, first in the Boer War and then in World War I, gave the book widespread appeal due to its nostalgic depiction of brave English soldiers&quot;. The poems&#x27; wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and the fact that several early 20th-century composers set it to music helped its popularity. Housman published a further highly successful collection &quot;Last Poems&quot; in 1922 while a third volume, &quot;More Poems&quot;, was published posthumously in 1936.

====The Georgian poets and World War I====

The Georgian poets were the first major grouping of the post-Victorian era. Their work appeared in a series of five anthologies called &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; which were published by Harold Monro and edited by Edward Marsh. The poets featured included Edmund Blunden, Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, D. H. Lawrence, Walter de la Mare and Siegfried Sassoon. Their poetry represented something of a reaction to the decadence of the 1890s and tended towards the sentimental.

Brooke and Sassoon were to go on to win reputations as war poets and Lawrence quickly distanced himself from the group and was associated with the modernist movement. Graves distanced himself from the group as well and wrote poetry in accordance with a belief in a prehistoric muse he described as The White Goddess. Other notable poets who wrote about the war include Isaac Rosenberg, Edward Thomas, Wilfred Owen, May Cannan and, from the home front, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling is the author of the famous inspirational poem &quot;If—&quot;, which is an evocation of Victorian stoicism, as a traditional British virtue. Although many of these poets wrote socially-aware criticism of the war, most remained technically conservative and traditionalist.

====Modernism====

Imagism is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the English language. This was an early, 20th-century, Anglo-American, modernist, poetry movement that favoured precision of imagery and clear, sharp language, that marked the beginning of a revolution in the way poetry was written. English poets involved with this group included Ezra Pound, D. H. Lawrence, Richard Aldington, T. E. Hulme, F. S. Flint, Ford Madox Ford, Allen Upward and John Cournos.

A leading figure in British modernism, influenced by imagism was American born T. S. Eliot, who moved to Britain in 1914, where he published in 1922 &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and became a citizen in 1927. Other English modernists include the London-Welsh poet and painter David Jones, whose first book, &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, was one of the very few experimental poems to come out of World War I, the Scot Hugh MacDiarmid, Mina Loy and Basil Bunting.

===The Thirties===
The poets who began to emerge in the 1930s had two things in common; they had all been born too late to have any real experience of the pre-World War I world and they grew up in a period of social, economic and political turmoil. Perhaps as a consequence of these facts, themes of community, social (in)justice and war seem to dominate the poetry of the decade.

The poetic space of the decade was dominated by four poets; W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis and Louis MacNeice, although the last of these belongs at least as much to the history of Irish poetry. These poets were all, in their early days at least, politically active on the Left. Although they admired Eliot, they also represented a move away from the technical innovations of their modernist predecessors. A number of other, less enduring, poets also worked in the same vein. One of these was Michael Roberts, whose &quot;New Country&quot; anthology both introduced the group to a wider audience and gave them their name.

The 1930s also saw the emergence of a home-grown English surrealist poetry whose main exponents were David Gascoyne, Hugh Sykes Davies, George Barker, and Philip O&#x27;Connor. These poets turned to French models rather than either the &quot;New Country&quot; poets or English-language modernism, and their works were a proof of the importance of later English experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the English &quot;avant-garde&quot; tradition.

John Betjeman and Stevie Smith, who were two other significant poets of this period, who stood outside all schools and groups. Betjeman was a quietly ironic poet of Middle England, with a command of a wide range of verse techniques. Smith was an entirely unclassifiable one-off voice.

===The Forties===
The 1940s opened with the United Kingdom at war and a new generation of war poets emerged in response. These included Keith Douglas, Alun Lewis, Henry Reed and F. T. Prince. As with the poets of the First World War, the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry. Technically, many of these war poets owed something to the 1930s poets, but their work grew out of the particular circumstances in which they found themselves living and fighting.

The main movement in post-war 1940s contemporary poetry was the New Romantic group that included Dylan Thomas, George Barker, W. S. Graham, Kathleen Raine, Henry Treece and J. F. Hendry. These writers saw themselves as in revolt against the classicism of the &quot;New Country&quot; poets. They turned to such models as Gerard Manley Hopkins, Arthur Rimbaud and Hart Crane and the word play of James Joyce. Thomas, in particular, helped Anglo-Welsh poetry to emerge as a recognisable force.

Other significant poets to emerge in the 1940s include Lawrence Durrell, Bernard Spencer, Roy Fuller, Norman Nicholson, Vernon Watkins, R. S. Thomas and Norman MacCaig. These last four poets represent a trend towards regionalism and poets writing about their native areas; Watkins and Thomas in Wales, Nicholson in Cumberland and MacCaig in Scotland.

===The Fifties===
The 1950s were dominated by three groups of poets, The Movement, The Group, and poets clarified by the term Extremist Art, which was first used by the poet A. Alvarez to describe the work of the American poet Sylvia Plath.

The Movement poets as a group came to public notice in Robert Conquest&#x27;s 1955 anthology &quot;New Lines&quot;. The core of the group consisted of Philip Larkin, Elizabeth Jennings, D. J. Enright, Kingsley Amis, Thom Gunn and Donald Davie. They were identified with a hostility to modernism and internationalism, and looked to Hardy as a model. However, both Davie and Gunn later moved away from this position.

As befits their name, the Group were much more formally a group of poets, meeting for weekly discussions under the chairmanship of Philip Hobsbaum and Edward Lucie-Smith. Other Group poets included Martin Bell, Peter Porter, Peter Redgrove, George MacBeth and David Wevill. Hobsbaum spent some time teaching in Belfast, where he was a formative influence on the emerging Northern Ireland poets including Seamus Heaney.

Other poets associated with Extremist Art included Plath&#x27;s one-time husband Ted Hughes, Francis Berry and Jon Silkin. These poets are sometimes compared with the Expressionist German school.

A number of young poets working in what might be termed a modernist vein also started publishing during this decade. These included Charles Tomlinson, Gael Turnbull, Roy Fisher and Bob Cobbing. These poets can now be seen as forerunners of some of the major developments during the following two decades.

===The 1960s and 1970s===
In the early part of the 1960s, the centre of gravity of mainstream poetry moved to Northern Ireland, with the emergence of Seamus Heaney, Tom Paulin, Paul Muldoon and others. In England, the most cohesive groupings can, in retrospect, be seen to cluster around what might loosely be called the modernist tradition and draw on American as well as indigenous models.

The British Poetry Revival was a late 1960s and early 1970s wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces performance, sound and concrete poetry as well as the legacy of Pound, Jones, MacDiarmid, Loy and Bunting, the Objectivist poets, the Beats and the Black Mountain poets, among others. Leading poets associated with this movement include J. H. Prynne, Eric Mottram, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley and Lee Harwood.

The Mersey Beat poets were Adrian Henri, Brian Patten and Roger McGough. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Although not actually a Mersey Beat poet, Adrian Mitchell is often associated with the group in critical discussion. Contemporary poet Steve Turner has also been compared with them.

==1980s and after==
Geoffrey Hill, who died in 2016, has been considered to be among the most distinguished poets of his generation.&quot;. Hill was first published in the 1950s. The last three decades of the 20th century saw a number of short-lived poetic groupings, including the Martians, along with a general trend towards what has been termed &#x27;Poeclectics&#x27;, namely an intensification within individual poets&#x27; oeuvres of &quot;all kinds of style, subject, voice, register and form&quot;. There continued, crucially, an increased interest in women&#x27;s writing, and in poetry from England&#x27;s minorities (especially the West Indian community). Another important aspect of the 1980s and 1990s was the birth of key seminal poet-led organisations such as Torriano and Blue Nose Poets/&quot;writers inc.&quot; which, together, played a major role in establishing and disseminating the norms and etiquettes of grass-roots poetry workshops and readings one finds throughout the UK poetry scene today. Performance poetry including poetry slam continued to expand too, and are still active. Some poets who emerged in this period include Carol Ann Duffy, Andrew Motion, Craig Raine, Wendy Cope, James Fenton, Blake Morrison, Liz Lochhead, George Szirtes, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Benjamin Zephaniah. Mark Ford is an example of a poet influenced by the New York School.

Bloodaxe Books&#x27; &quot;The New Poetry&quot;, published in 1993, included Simon Armitage, Kathleen Jamie, Glyn Maxwell, Selima Hill, Maggie Hannan, Michael Hofmann and Peter Reading. The New Generation movement of the 1990s and early 2000s, included Don Paterson, Julia Copus, John Stammers, Jacob Polley, David Morley and Alice Oswald. A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the British Poetry Revival movement of the 1960s and 1970s, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley. Major independent and experimental poetry pamphlet publishers include Barque, founded 1995, Flarestack, Knives, Forks and Spoons Press, established in 2010, Penned in the Margins, Heaventree (founded in 2002 but no longer publishing) and Perdika Press (founded 2006). Throughout this period, publishing initiatives such as Salt Publishing and Shearsman Books promoted poetic diversity, while independent poetry presses such as Cinnamon press and Enitharmon Press have made available original work from (among others) Dannie Abse, whose first collection was published in 1948, Martyn Crucefix, Jane Duran, first collection 1995, U. A. Fanthorpe, whose career began in the 1980s, Mario Petrucci, first collection 1996, and Kathleen Raine, first published in 1943.

<text>Chris Donald (born 25 April 1960) is the founder of, and one of the principal contributors to, the British comic magazine &quot;Viz&quot;.

==Biography==
Donald was born in Newcastle, England. He attended West Jesmond Primary School, and then Heaton Comprehensive School, where he failed his A-levels. The forerunner of &quot;Viz&quot; was a series of small comic booklets, titled &quot;The Fat Crusader&quot;, drawn on the back of Esso Blue invoice pads and secretly circulated around classrooms at Heaton School – first amongst pupils, and later penetrating the staff room – between 1976 and 1978. In October 1978, having failed to achieve sufficient qualifications to continue his education, Donald began work as a clerical officer at the DHSS central office in Longbenton, Newcastle.

Donald, together with his brother Simon and a schoolfriend Jim Brownlow, set up &quot;Viz&quot; in December 1979 from a bedroom in Jesmond, Newcastle. He was editor (or head of the &quot;editorial cabinet&quot;) for many years but retired from day-to-day duties in 1999, and now only contributes occasional cartoons. He has since written a personal history of &quot;Viz&quot; magazine entitled &quot;Rude Kids&quot;.

In an interview on Channel 4 News, Donald paid tribute to Spike Milligan on his death and cited him and Monty Python as the two major influences on &quot;Viz&quot;.

During the latter years of his tenure as the editor of &quot;Viz&quot;, Donald opened a restaurant at a former railway station at Ilderton in Northumberland. It opened in 1994 and closed in 1997.

Between 2002 and 2008, Donald worked as a shop assistant, and later shop manager, at Barter Books in Alnwick, Northumberland. At around this time he was also Fixtures Secretary of the Belford &amp; District Pool League, as well as editor of the annual Powburn Agricultural Show programme.

In 2016 he became a top soul DJ on BBC Radio Newcastle and BBC Radio Tees, presenting a weekly show, &quot;Chris Donald’s Soul Club&quot;. In 2020, the show was taken off air during the pandemic. Since late 2020 he has presented &quot;Chris Donald’s Imaginary Soul Club&quot; on Nova Radio North East.

<doc id="173026" wikidata="Q3011501" url="?curid=173026" title="DVD Copy Control Association">
<text>The DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) is an organization primarily responsible for the copy protection of DVDs. The Content Scramble System (CSS) was devised for this purpose to make copyright infringement difficult, but also presents obstacles to some legitimate uses of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial Regional Playback Control (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.

As of 2001, members included film distributors such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.

They filed the much publicized case versus Jon Johansen who they alleged wrote DeCSS. The case was dropped in January 2004. CSS decrypting software (such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, and DVD Shrink) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes Macrovision, CSS, region codes, and user operation prohibitions. They also filed the suit &quot;DVD CCA v. Bunner&quot; against people who distributed DeCSS, seeking injunctions to stop further distribution based on trade secret claims. The injunction was eventually denied because CSS was no longer a secret by the time litigation occurred.

==Features restricted by manufacturers==
All DVD CCA-licensed DVD player/burner manufacturers implement DVD CCA-mandated &quot;robustness&quot; and &quot;compliance&quot; rules on their products in an effort to restrict ripping. Some even go beyond that and implement additional features to restrict ripping.

<doc id="173027" wikidata="Q1241608" url="?curid=173027" title="DeLorean Motor Company">
<text>The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) was an American automobile manufacturer formed by automobile industry executive John DeLorean in 1975. It produced just one model, from early 1981 to late 1982—the stainless steel DeLorean sports car featuring gull-wing doors. Its history was brief and turbulent, ending in receivership and bankruptcy in 1982. In October 1982, John DeLorean was videotaped in a sting operation agreeing to bankroll drug trafficking, but was acquitted at the subsequent trial on the basis of entrapment.

The DeLorean was featured in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film trilogy (1985, 1989, and 1990) as the car made into a time machine by eccentric scientist Doc Brown, although the company had closed before the first film was made.

In 1995, Liverpool-born mechanic Stephen Wynne founded the DeLorean Motor Company (Texas), an entirely new company not related to the original, located in Humble, Texas, and shortly thereafter acquired the remaining parts inventory, and registered his own stylized version of the &quot;DMC&quot; logo trademark of DeLorean Motor Company (Texas).

==History==
===Beginning===
John DeLorean founded the DeLorean Motor Company in Detroit, Michigan, on October 24, 1975. He was already well known in the automobile industry as a capable engineer, business innovator, and youngest person to become a General Motors executive. Investment capital came primarily in the form of business loans from Bank of America and from the formation of partnerships and private investment from select parties, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson and entertainers Roy Clark and Sammy Davis Jr. Capital was also raised through a dealer investment program in which dealerships offering DeLorean&#x27;s cars for sale were made shareholders in the company.

DeLorean also sought lucrative incentives from governments and economic organizations to pay for manufacturing facilities by looking to build his first factory in an area of particularly high unemployment. The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Desmond O&#x27;Malley, TD, decided not to support the project. A deal in Puerto Rico was about to be agreed when DeLorean took up an offer from the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland. Besides some early seed capital from Hollywood stars, the DeLorean Motor Company relied on the British Government for about $120 million of its $200 million startup costs according to &quot;The Times&quot;. The British Government was keen to create jobs in Northern Ireland to reduce sectarian violence. DeLorean was under the impression that the British Government, as part of this offer, would provide his company with Export Credit financing. This would provide a loan of 80% of the wholesale cost of the vehicles (US$20,000) upon completion and delivery for shipping.

===Manufacturing facility===
In October 1978, construction of the six-building, manufacturing plant began in Northern Ireland. It was designed and managed by Gerald Mooney, of Brodie &amp; Hawthorn Architects of Belfast, and constructed in 16 months by Farrans, McLaughlin &amp; Harvey. A test/proving track was also constructed next to the factory. Officially known as DMCL (DeLorean Motor Cars, Ltd.), the facility was located in The Cutts in Dunmurry, a suburb on the south-western edge of Belfast.

Unit production was scheduled to begin in 1979, but engineering delays and budget overruns caused the assembly lines to start only in early 1981. Workers at the factory were generally inexperienced; many never had jobs before joining DMC. This may have contributed to the reported quality issues attributed to the early production vehicles and the subsequent establishment of Quality Assurance Centers (QAC) located at various delivery locations. QACs were set up in California, New Jersey and Michigan where some of the quality issues were to be addressed and resolved before delivery to dealerships. Some of the issues related to the fitting of body panels, higher-output alternators, and gullwing door adjustments.

The combined efforts of quality assurance improvements at the factory and the post-production quality assurance done at the QACs were generally successful, although workmanship complaints still occasionally arose; the 1981 DeLoreans were delivered with a 12-month, warranty. By 1982, improvements in components and the more experienced workforce meant that production quality was vastly improved. Disputes between dealerships and customers arose later because many dealerships refused to do warranty work because they were not reimbursed.

===Downturn and bankruptcy===
The lack of demand, cost overruns, and unfavorable exchange rates began to take their toll on DMC&#x27;s cash flow in late 1981. The company had estimated its break-even point to be between 10,000 and 12,000 units, but sales were only around 6,000. In response to the income shortfall, a restructuring plan was devised where a new &quot;DeLorean Motors Holding Company&quot; would be formed, which in turn would have become corporate parent to DMC and each of its subsidiaries: DeLorean Motor Cars Limited (manufacturer), DeLorean Motor Cars of America (distributor in the U.S.) and DeLorean Research Partnership (a research and development company). In January 1982, due to United States Securities and Exchange Commission questions about the company&#x27;s viability, the company was forced to cancel the stock issue for the holding company that DeLorean had hoped would raise about $27 million.

John DeLorean lobbied the British Government for aid, but was refused unless he was able to find a matching amount from other investors. What followed is a matter of debate between the British Government, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), DeLorean, his investors, and the US court system. At some point in 1982, John DeLorean became the target of an FBI sting operation designed to arrest drug traffickers. He was arrested in October 1982 and charged with conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the US. The key element of evidence for the prosecution was a videotape showing DeLorean discussing the drugs deal with undercover FBI agents Benedict (Ben) Tisa and West, although DeLorean&#x27;s attorney Howard Weitzman successfully demonstrated to the court that he was coerced into participation in the deal by the agents who initially approached him as legitimate investors. He was acquitted of all charges, but his reputation was forever tarnished. After his trial and subsequent acquittal, DeLorean quipped, &quot;Would you buy a used car from me?&quot;

In the end, sufficient funds could not be raised to keep the company alive. DMC went bankrupt in 1982, taking with it 2,500 jobs and over $100 million in investments. The British Government attempted to revive some usable remnants of the manufacturing facility without success, and the Dunmurry factory was closed. DeLorean himself retired in New Jersey, and the dream with which he had mesmerized Britain&#x27;s Labour government, of industry rising out of the ashes of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, was shattered. He claimed that the DMCL was deliberately closed for political reasons, and at the time of closing was a solidly viable company with millions of dollars in the bank and two years of dealer orders on the books.

Approximately 9,000 cars were made between January 1981 and December 1982, although actual production figures are unclear and estimates differ. Some of the cars manufactured in 1982, but not shipped to the states (as the US arm of DMC had no money to &#x27;buy&#x27; the cars from the factory in Northern Ireland), with 15XXX and 16XXX Vehicle Identification Numbers are actually 1982 models that were given later VINs, dated 1983, by Consolidated International (now known as Big Lots), a company that had a buyback program with DMC and had bought out the remaining unsold cars and also the inventory of unused parts left in the factory after the bankruptcy.

Folk tales in Ireland attribute the failure of DeLorean to the fact that the company had destroyed a sacred fairy fort to build its factory.

The DeLorean assembly plant was eventually occupied by the French automotive supplier Montupet, which began to manufacture cast aluminum cylinder heads for automobile engines at the Dunmurry facility in 1989. As of Monputet&#x27;s acquisition in 2015, the factory employed more than 600 people. The facility is currently operated as Montupet UK, a subsidiary of Linamar Corporation. A community of DeLorean cultists reunite on a regular basis on the site&#x27;s defunct test tracks (which they renovated for low-speed use), bringing along their replica DeLorean models to create a fleet that reached 62 DeLorean vehicles in June 2024.

==Vehicles==

===Production vehicles===

====DeLorean====


The DeLorean (known internally during development within DMC as the &quot;DMC-12&quot;) was the only car produced by DMC. Reception was mixed. Although the early vehicles had impressive waiting lists of prospective buyers, the MSRP of $25,000 (equivalent to approximately $70,000 in 2019) was prohibitive for most of the market—especially for what many considered an under-powered and impractical plaything. &quot;It&#x27;s not a barn burner,&quot; observed &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, &quot;(with) a 0–60 mph time of 10.5 seconds. Frankly, that&#x27;s not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category.&quot; The stainless steel body panels were attractive and impervious to corrosion, but the sheen surface tended to show fingerprints and meant the car could not be easily painted; every DeLorean looked identical. Some dealerships painted their cars to make them distinctive. DMC tested translucent paint for different color options while allowing the stainless steel grain to show through, but no cars were sold with factory painted body panels. The only factory option initially available was automatic transmission. A grey interior was offered later in 1981 as an alternative to the standard black. Accessories such as pinstriping and luggage racks provided further individuality.

A DeLorean was prominently featured in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and its two sequels, in which it was converted into a time machine. The DeLorean time machine entered popular culture and played a major role in the continued popularity of the model.

===Concepts===

====DMC-24====
The DMC-24 was a proposal for a 4-seater sedan retaining the general shape and gull-wing doors of the DeLorean. Several designs were drafted. One design, a 2-door, had the doors and cabin of the DeLorean stretched to allow rear entry and rear seating. Another design had a separate set of rear doors. The 4-door design was produced as a rolling mock-up by ItalDesign, based on the Lancia Medusa concept car. The bill for the ItalDesign version was unpaid by DMC, and ItalDesign modified it to become the Lamborghini Marco Polo concept car.

====DMC-44====
The DMC-44 was a proposal for a lightweight 4×4 off-road vehicle using the drivetrain and other components from the Polski Fiat 126p. The design is similar to the French Lohr Fardier paratrooper utility vehicle and DeLorean brought one to their headquarters for study. A tubular steel frame prototype was produced, and the company produced a promotional video to attract investors to the project. There would have been two versions; one a dedicated off-roader, the other road legal.

====DMC-80====
The DMC-80 was a proposal for a bus which was mooted in the fall of 1981, with a variety of 6-cylinder engines and transmissions. The company produced a promotional brochure for public transit corporations. The bus would have been an Americanized German low-floor bus produced in the United States.

<doc id="173028" wikidata="Q3046134" url="?curid=173028" title="Geoff Gallop">
<text>Geoffrey Ian Gallop (born 27 September 1951) is an Australian academic and former politician who served as the 27th premier of Western Australia from 2001 to 2006. He is currently a professor and director of the Graduate School of Government at the University of Sydney and former chairman of the Australian Republican Movement.

Born in Geraldton, Western Australia, Gallop studied at the University of Western Australia, and later progressed to St John&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford after winning a Rhodes Scholarship. Having joined the Labor Party in 1971, he served as a councillor for the City of Fremantle between 1983 and 1986, and was elected to the seat of Victoria Park in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election. Having held several portfolios in the preceding Lawrence Ministry (including Minister for Education), Gallop replaced Jim McGinty as Leader of the Opposition in 1996 following McGinty&#x27;s resignation.

At the 1996 election, Labor was defeated by the incumbent Liberal Party led by Richard Court despite a rise in Labor&#x27;s share of the vote, but he remained as the party&#x27;s leader, and at the 2001 election Labor was elected to government, with Gallop becoming premier. Having successfully contested the 2005 election, Gallop resigned as Premier, Labor leader and from parliament in early 2006 to aid his recovery from depression, and was replaced by Alan Carpenter.

==Early life, education and pioneer family==
Gallop was born and educated in Geraldton. He then entered The University of Western Australia (UWA) in 1969 to study economics. He joined the Labor Party in 1971, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1972. In 1974 he studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics
at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford where he met and became close friends with Tony Blair.
Blair is the godfather of Gallop&#x27;s son Tom,
and Gallop was a groomsman at Blair&#x27;s 1980 wedding.
He is also a long-time friend of former federal Labor Leader Kim Beazley. Gallop subsequently received a doctorate of philosophy (DPhil) from Oxford in 1983.

Before entering state politics, Gallop worked as a tutor and lecturer at both Murdoch University and The University of Western Australia, and was a City Councillor at Fremantle from 1983 to 1986.

Gallop&#x27;s family was among the first pioneer settlers to the new Swan River Colony now known as Perth in Western Australia. His great-great-grandfather, James Gallop arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1829 the year of the colony&#x27;s founding. At the age of 18 James, along with two brothers – 20-year-old Richard and 15-year-old Edward – left a Thakeham, West Sussex workhouse. The Gallop brothers left the small village of Thakeham in West Sussex along with several other families from Thakeham and the nearby villages of Sullington and Storrington. Several of these migrants later inter-married: James&#x27; son also named James married Emma Woods daughter of George Woods who also came out from Thakeham with his brother John and nephew Jesse Woods. Edward Gallop later drowned but James and Richard became pioneering market gardeners and vignerons. Two homes, Gallop House and Dalkeith House, are heritage-listed legacies of the family&#x27;s prominence. The brothers were part of a clearing-out of the parishes in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. As Greenfield wrote &quot;The 1820s were very difficult years for agricultural workers and great poverty prevailed, owing partly to the demobilization of soldiers following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and partly to the high cost of bread due to the Corn Laws. Sullington seems to have been particularly hard hit. ... Emigration was encouraged throughout West Sussex to relieve the parishes of the burden of excessive poor relief.&quot; The Gallop brothers were among those who chose Australia instead of America: &quot;West Australia was still very much in the pioneering stage. Letters from emigrants to their friends and relations in this neighbourhood give the impression that those who sailed to America, provided they were not afraid to work, had an easier life than those who took the greater risk and went to Australia&quot;.

==Politics==
Gallop was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Victoria Park in 1986.
From 1990 to 1993, during the Lawrence Labor Government, Gallop held portfolios including Education, Parliamentary and Electoral Reform, Fuel and Energy, Micro-Economic Reform, and Minister assisting the Treasurer. The Lawrence government was defeated at the 1993 state elections, and Gallop was elected Deputy Leader of the State Parliamentary Labor Party.

===Opposition Leader (1996–2001)===
In Opposition, his Shadow Ministerial responsibilities included Treasury, Resources and Energy, Parliamentary and Electoral Reform, Public Sector Management, Accountability, Sport and Recreation, Aboriginal Affairs, Health, Federal Affairs, Treasury and the South West.

In October 1996, Jim McGinty resigned as Leader of the Opposition and named Gallop his successor, a role he assumed without a caucus vote.
Soon afterwards, he led Labor into an election held in December. He was heavily defeated by the Liberal Party government of Richard Court, taking only 35.8 percent of the primary vote—its lowest total since 1901.

===In government (2001–2006)===
At the February 2001 state election, Gallop led the Labor Party to victory, taking 13 seats from the Liberals on a seven-percent swing—the largest swing against a sitting government in the state since 1911.

Gallop became Premier and Minister for Public Sector Management, Federal Affairs, Science, Citizenship and Multicultural Interests.
Gallop went on to win a second term at the 26 February 2005 state election.

As premier, Dr Gallop oversaw a range of political and social reforms (electoral reform, gay and lesbian equality and a state Administrative Tribunal), changed the State&#x27;s industrial and labour laws, brought a spirit of reconciliation to the resolution of native Title and developed partnership models for the State&#x27;s indigenous communities, changed the law to require all 16- and 17-year-olds to be in education or training, was the first Premier to commit his government to a major desalination plant, stopped the logging of all of the State&#x27;s Old Growth Forests, creating a record number of new national parks, restructured the State&#x27;s electricity and racing industries, and started construction of the Perth to Mandurah Railway and the associated City Rail Tunnel.

As Minister for Science he established the Science Council, committed significant funding to Research and Development in the State, and established the Premier&#x27;s Research Fellowship Program to attract leading researchers from overseas and interstate.

===Resignation===
On 16 January 2006 Gallop announced he was resigning as premier and retiring from politics to aid his recovery from depression.
He addressed a news conference stating that &quot;in the interests of my health and my family I have decided to rethink my career&quot;.
Deputy Premier and Treasurer Eric Ripper took over from Gallop as Acting Premier, pending a leadership vote at the State Labor Caucus.
Alan Carpenter was elected unopposed
and was sworn in on 25 January 2006.

==Post-government activities==
Gallop became a professor and director of Sydney University&#x27;s Graduate School of Government in 2006.

From 2007 to 2009 he was a community member of the NSW Health Department&#x27;s great Metropolitan Clinical Task force.

From 2007 to 2011 he was deputy chair of the Council of Australian Government (COAG) Reform Council and in 2008 he was appointed to the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission which reported to the Commonwealth Government in June 2009.

In 2010, he joined the advisory board of the Hawke Research Institute at the University of South Australia and from 2011 has been the chair of the New Democracy Foundation&#x27;s Research Committee. He also sits on the Dean&#x27;s Advisory Group at the University of Sydney Medical School.

In 2011 he was appointed by Australia&#x27;s Foreign Minister to chair the Australia Awards Board and in the same year was appointed a member of the Commonwealth&#x27;s International Education Advisory Council.

Since 2010 he has been writing a weekly column for Fairfax Media&#x27;s online paper WA Today and from 2006 to 2007 was a columnist for the Australian newspaper&#x27;s Higher Education Supplement.

In 2010, Gallop accepted the role as chairman of the research committee of The newDemocracy Foundation, a research group, focused on better models of government. Gallop is a patron of the Jhana Grove Meditation Centre and the Buddhist Society of Western Australia, where he received help for depression.

Gallop was elected chairman of the Australian Republic Movement in November 2012, replacing Maj.-Gen. Michael Keating.

In 2019 Gallop was reportedly appointed to the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

==Political views==
Gallop is a strong supporter of the movement for an Australian republic, and took a leading role in the push for a directly elected president during the 1998 Constitutional Convention in Canberra.
He is pro-choice on the issue of abortion.
Professor Gallop has published three books – one on the English radical Thomas Spence &quot;Pig&#x27;s Meat – Selected Writings of Thomas Spence&quot;, edited with an introductory essay (Spokesman Books Nottingham, 1982), one on Western Australian politics and society &quot;A State of Reform: Essays for a Better Future&quot; (Helm Wood Publishers, Wembley, 1998) and &quot;Politics, Society, Self: Occasional Writing&quot; (UWA Press, Crawley, 2012)

Gallop is an advocate for drug policy reform.

<text>Joannes or John (; died 425) was Western Roman emperor from 423 to 425.

On the death of the Western emperor Honorius, Theodosius II, the last remaining ruler of the Theodosian dynasty, did not immediately announce a successor. In the &quot;interregnum&quot;, the patrician Castinus elevated Joannes as emperor. Theodosius refused to accept the decision, and deposed Joannes in a civil war.

== History ==
Joannes was a &quot;primicerius notariorum&quot; or senior civil servant at the time of his elevation. Procopius praised him as &quot;both gentle and well-endowed with sagacity and thoroughly capable of valorous deeds.&quot;

From the beginning, his control over the empire was insecure. His praetorian prefect was slain in Gaul by an uprising of the soldiery at Arles, and Bonifacius, &quot;comes&quot; of the Diocese of Africa, held back the grain fleet destined to Rome.

&quot;The events of Johannes&#x27; reign are as shadowy as its origins,&quot; writes John Matthews, who then provides a list of the ruler&#x27;s known actions in a single paragraph. Joannes was proclaimed at Rome and praetorian games were provided at the expense of a member of the Anicia gens. Johannes then moved his base of operations to Ravenna, knowing full well that the Eastern Empire would strike from that direction. There is a mention of an expedition against Africa, but its fate, presumed unsuccessful, is unrecorded. In Gaul, he appears to have caused offense by submitting clerics to secular courts.

Joannes had hoped that he could come to an agreement with the Eastern Emperor, but when Theodosius II elevated the young Valentinian III to &quot;caesar&quot; (undoubtedly influenced by Valentinian&#x27;s mother Galla Placidia), he knew he could only expect war. Late in 424, he gave to one of his younger and most promising followers, Aëtius, an important mission. Aëtius, governor of the Palace at the time, was sent to the Huns, with whom he had lived as a hostage earlier, to seek military help.

While Aëtius was away, the army of the Eastern Empire left Thessalonica for Italy, and soon camped in Aquileia. Although the primary sources state that Ravenna fell to their assault – John of Antioch states that a shepherd led the army of Aspar safely through the marshes that protected the city. Aspar&#x27;s father, Ardaburius, who had been captured by Joannes&#x27; soldiers, may have convinced the garrison of Ravenna to betray the city. The fallen emperor was brought to Aquileia where first his hand was cut off, then he was paraded on a donkey in the Hippodrome to the insults of the populace. After further insults and injuries, Joannes was finally decapitated in mid 425. His death is sometimes dated to May or June, probably on the basis two laws in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; issued by Theodosius II on 5 May 425.

Three days after Joannes&#x27;s death, Aëtius returned at the head of a substantial Hunnic army. After some skirmishing, Placidia, regent to her son, and Aëtius came to an agreement that established the political landscape of the Western Roman Empire for the next thirty years. The Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of &quot;magister militum&quot; (commander-in-chief of the Roman army). The historian Adrian Goldsworthy writes that &quot;it took a hard-fought campaign by strong elements of the East Roman army and navy, in addition to a fair dose of betrayal,&quot; to defeat Joannes.

<text>John Zachary DeLorean ( ; January 6, 1925 – March 19, 2005) was an American engineer, inventor, and executive in the U.S. automobile industry. He is widely known as founder of the DeLorean Motor Company, as well as for his work at General Motors.

DeLorean managed the development of several vehicles throughout his career, including the Pontiac GTO, Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Cosworth Vega, and DMC DeLorean, which was featured in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He was the youngest division chief in General Motors history, then left to start the DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) in 1973. Production delays meant that DMC&#x27;s first car did not reach the consumer market until 1981, when a depressed buying market was compounded by lukewarm reviews from critics and the public. After a year, the DeLorean had failed to recover its $175 million investment costs, unsold cars accumulated, and the company was in financial trouble.

In October 1982, DeLorean was charged with cocaine trafficking after FBI informant James Hoffman solicited him as financier in a scheme to sell of cocaine worth approximately $24 million. DMC was insolvent at the time and $17 million in debt. Hoffman had approached DeLorean, a man whom he barely knew with no prior criminal record, and DeLorean was able to successfully defend himself at trial under the procedural defense of police entrapment. The trial ended in a not guilty verdict in August 1984, by which time DMC had filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations.

==Early life==
DeLorean was born in Detroit, Michigan, the eldest of four sons of Zachary and Kathryn () DeLorean. His father, a mill worker, was Romanian, born Zaharia Delorean () in the village of Sugág, Alsó-Fehér County, Austria-Hungary (currently Șugag, Alba County, Romania) and emigrated to the United States when he was 20. He spent time in Montana and Gary, Indiana, before moving to Michigan. By the time John was born, Zachary had found employment as a union organizer at the Ford Motor Company factory in nearby Highland Park. His poor English skills and lack of education prevented him from higher-paid work. When not required at Ford, he occasionally worked as a carpenter.

DeLorean&#x27;s mother was a Hungarian citizen of Hungarian origin. She was employed at the Carboloy Products Division of General Electric throughout much of DeLorean&#x27;s early life. She took work wherever she could to supplement the family&#x27;s income. She generally tolerated Zachary&#x27;s intermittent episodes of erratic behavior; but during several of his more violent periods, she took her sons to live with her sister in Los Angeles, California, where they stayed for a year or so at a time. DeLorean&#x27;s parents divorced in 1942. John subsequently saw little of his father, who moved into a boarding house and became a solitary and estranged drug addict.

==Education==
After attending Detroit&#x27;s public schools, DeLorean was accepted into Cass Technical High School, a school for Detroit honor students, where he signed up for the electrical curriculum. He found it exhilarating and excelled at his studies. His academic record and musical talents earned him a scholarship at Lawrence Institute of Technology in Highland Park (today Lawrence Technological University in Southfield). The small college was the alma mater of some of the automobile industry&#x27;s best engineers. 

World War II interrupted his studies. He was drafted for military service and served three years in the U.S. Army. He received an honorable discharge in 1946 and returned to Detroit to find his mother and siblings in economic difficulty. He worked as a draftsman for the Public Lighting Commission for a year and a half to improve his family&#x27;s financial status then returned to Lawrence to finish his degree. While back in college, he worked part-time at Chrysler and at a local body shop. He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering.

Instead of immediately entering the engineering workforce, DeLorean sold life insurance. He developed an analytical system aimed at engineers and sold &quot;about $850,000 worth of policies in ten months&quot;. However, he found the work boring and moved on to work for the Factory Equipment Corporation. DeLorean stated in his autobiography that he sold life insurance to improve his communication skills. Both endeavors were successful financially, but these areas held little interest for him. A foreman at Chrysler&#x27;s engineering garage recommended he apply for work at Chrysler. Chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility, the Chrysler Institute of Engineering, which allowed DeLorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering.

He briefly attended the Detroit College of Law but did not graduate. In 1952, he graduated from the Chrysler Institute with a master&#x27;s degree in Automotive Engineering and joined Chrysler&#x27;s engineering team. He attended night classes at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business to earn credits for his MBA degree, which he completed in 1957.

==Career==
===Packard Motor Company===
DeLorean was at Chrysler for less than a year. In 1953, he was offered a salary of $14,000 () at Packard Motor Company under the supervision of engineer Forest McFarland. DeLorean quickly gained his new employer&#x27;s attention with an improvement to the Ultramatic automatic transmission, giving it an improved torque converter and dual-drive ranges; it was relaunched as the Twin-Ultramatic.

When DeLorean joined Packard, it was experiencing financial difficulties because of the changing postwar automotive market. While Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler had begun producing affordable mainstream products designed to cater to the rising postwar middle class, Packard had retained its prewar notions of high-end, precisely engineered luxury cars. This had a positive effect on DeLorean&#x27;s attention to engineering detail, and after three years at Packard he became McFarland&#x27;s successor as head of research and development.

While still profitable, Packard suffered alongside other independents as it struggled to compete when Ford and General Motors engaged in a price war. James Nance, Packard&#x27;s president, decided to merge the company with Studebaker Corporation in 1954. DeLorean was considering keeping his job and moving to Studebaker headquarters in South Bend, Indiana, when he received a call from Oliver K. Kelley, vice president of engineering at General Motors, whom DeLorean greatly admired. Kelley offered DeLorean his choice of a job in any of GM&#x27;s five divisions.

===General Motors===
====Pontiac====
In 1956, DeLorean accepted a salary offer of $16,000 () with a bonus program, choosing to work at GM&#x27;s Pontiac division as an assistant to chief engineer Pete Estes and general manager Semon &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen. Knudsen was the son of the former president of GM, William Knudsen, who had been called away from his post to head the war mobilization production effort at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Knudsen was an MIT engineering graduate and at 42 was the youngest man to head a GM division. DeLorean and Knudsen quickly became close friends; DeLorean later cited him as a major influence and mentor. DeLorean produced dozens of patented innovations for the company and in 1961 was promoted to division chief engineer.

DeLorean became widely known at Pontiac for the Pontiac GTO, a muscle car named after the Ferrari 250 GTO. The Pontiac brand reached third place in annual industry sales in the United States. To highlight the brand&#x27;s performance emphasis, the GTO debuted as a Tempest/LeMans option package with a larger and more powerful engine in 1964. This marked the beginning of Pontiac&#x27;s renaissance as GM&#x27;s performance division instead of its previous position with no clear brand identity. The car and its popularity continued to grow in the following years. DeLorean received almost total credit for its success—its conception, engineering, and marketing—and was rewarded with a 1965 promotion to head of the Pontiac division.

At 40, DeLorean had broken the record for youngest division head at GM and was determined to continue his string of successes. Adapting to the frustrations he perceived in the executive offices was a difficult transition for him. He believed there was an undue amount of conflict between GM&#x27;s division heads. Several of Pontiac&#x27;s advertising campaign themes met with internal resistance, such as the &quot;Tiger&quot; campaign used to promote the GTO and other Pontiac models in 1965 and 1966. In addition, there was Ed Cole&#x27;s decision to ban multiple carburetors, a method of enhancing engine performance used by Pontiac that had begun with two 4-barrel carburetors (&quot;2x4 bbl&quot;) and Tri-Power (three 2-barrel carburetors (&quot;3x2 bbl&quot;)) in 1957.

In response to the &quot;pony car&quot; market dominated by the Ford Mustang, DeLorean asked GM executives for permission to market a smaller version of the Pontiac Banshee show car for 1966. However, his idea was rejected because of GM&#x27;s concern that it would divert sales from the Corvette, their flagship performance car. Their focus was on the new Chevrolet Camaro design. Pontiac developed its version, and the Firebird was introduced for the 1967 model year.

Shortly after the Firebird&#x27;s introduction, DeLorean turned his attention to the development of an all-new Grand Prix, the division&#x27;s personal luxury car based on the full-sized Pontiac line. Sales were lagging by this time, but the 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized Pontiac A-body (Tempest, LeMans, GTO). DeLorean knew the Pontiac division could not finance the new car alone, so he went to his former boss, Chevrolet division head Pete Estes, and asked him to share the cost of development with Pontiac, having a one-year exclusivity before Chevrolet released the 1970 Monte Carlo. The deal was done. The 1969 Pontiac Grand Prix featured sharp bodylines and a hood. The interior included a wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, bucket seats and a center console. The new model offered a sportier, high performance, somewhat smaller, and lower-priced alternative to other personal luxury cars on the market, such as the Ford Thunderbird, GM’s Buick Riviera, Cadillac Eldorado, and Oldsmobile Toronado, and Ford’s newly debuted Lincoln Continental Mark III. The 1969 Grand Prix production ended up at over 112,000 units, far higher than 1968’s 32,000 full-sized Grand Prix.

During his time at Pontiac, DeLorean had begun to enjoy the freedom and celebrity that came with his position, and he spent a good deal of his time traveling to locations around the world to support promotional events. His frequent public appearances helped to solidify his image as a &quot;rebel&quot; corporate businessman, with his trendy dress style and casual banter.

Even as General Motors experienced revenue declines, Pontiac remained highly profitable under DeLorean, and despite his growing reputation as a corporate maverick, on February 15, 1969, he was promoted to head Chevrolet, General Motors&#x27; top-selling marque.

====Chevrolet====
By this time, DeLorean earned an annual salary of $200,000 (), with yearly bonuses of up to $400,000 (). He was ubiquitous in popular culture. At a time when business executives were typically conservative, low-key individuals in three-piece suits, DeLorean wore long sideburns and unbuttoned shirts. He invited Ford president Lee Iacocca to serve as best man at his second wedding.

DeLorean was a limited partner in a pair of American professional sports franchises. The first was the San Diego Chargers, as part of a syndicate led by Gene Klein and Sam Schulman that bought a controlling interest for $10 million in August 1966. The other was the New York Yankees of which he was one of fifteen investors led by George Steinbrenner and Michael Burke who completed the purchase from CBS for $10 million on January 3, 1973.

DeLorean continued his jet-setting lifestyle and was often seen hanging out in business and entertainment celebrity circles. He became friends with James T. Aubrey, president of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and was introduced to celebrities such as financier Kirk Kerkorian, Chris-Craft chairman Herb Siegel, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson.

The executive offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean&#x27;s nonconformity. When he was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a manager in that position to sort things out. The new model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova. He used the extra time to streamline Chevrolet&#x27;s production overhead and reduce assembly costs. By 1971, Chevrolet was experiencing record sales in excess of 3 million vehicles, and his division alone was nearly matching that of the entire Ford Motor Company.

The Vega was assigned to Chevrolet by corporate management, specifically by Cole, just weeks before DeLorean&#x27;s 1969 arrival as the Chevrolet division&#x27;s general manager. In a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; interview in August 1970, DeLorean said, &quot;Vega will be the highest quality product ever built by Chevrolet.&quot; By DeLorean&#x27;s orders, dozens of extra inspectors were assigned to the Vega assembly line, and the first 2,000 cars were road-tested. He stated, &quot;the first cars, from a manufacturing standpoint, were well built.&quot; But in 1972, General Motors Assembly Division took over the Chevrolet Lordstown assembly plant and the adjoining Fisher Body plant. Their main goal was to cut costs, and more than 800 workers were laid off, many of whom were the additional inspectors. This led to assembly-line vandalism, with workers intentionally slowing the line, leaving off parts and installing others improperly. Incomplete and often non-functioning cars soon filled the factory lot, which then had to be reprocessed and repaired by a team assigned to this task by DeLorean. A one-month strike followed, and dealers did not receive enough cars for the demand in 1972. DeLorean regrouped for the 1973 model year with Vega sales of 395,792. The one-millionth Vega was built in May 1973.

In 1972, DeLorean was appointed to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press, &quot;I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn&#x27;t permit me to do as much as I wanted.&quot; However, it had been rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean took over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford II. 

DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, as well as objecting to the idea of using rebates to sell cars: &quot;There&#x27;s no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today. A car should make people&#x27;s eyes light up when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they&#x27;re not interested in.&quot;After DeLorean left General Motors, Patrick Wright, author and former &quot;Business Week&quot; reporter, approached him with the idea of writing a book based on his experiences there. DeLorean agreed to dictate his recollections for Wright, who wrote the book. The final product, published in 1979, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors&quot;, sold approximately 1.6 million copies, but disagreements over the content led to a conflict between the collaborators, with Wright eventually publishing the book on his own.

===DeLorean Motor Company===

DeLorean left General Motors in 1973 to form his own company, the DeLorean Motor Company. A two-seat sports car prototype was shown in the mid-1970s called the DeLorean Safety Vehicle (DSV), with its bodyshell designed by Italdesign&#x27;s Giorgetto Giugiaro. The car entered into production as the DMC DeLorean. The car&#x27;s body distinctively used stainless steel and featured gull-wing doors. It was powered by the &quot;Douvrin&quot; V6 engine developed by Peugeot, Renault, and Volvo (known as the PRV).

The manufacturing plant to build the new car was built in Dunmurry, a suburb of Belfast in Northern Ireland, with substantial financial incentives from the Northern Ireland Development Agency of around £100 million. Renault was contracted to build the factory, which employed over 2,000 workers at its peak production. The engine was made by Renault, while Lotus designed the chassis and bodywork details. The Dunmurry factory eventually turned out around 9,000 cars. In 1980, an American Express catalog featured an ad for a DeLorean plated in 24-karat gold. According to the ad, only 100 were going to be manufactured and sold for $85,000. In total, only four were actually purchased.

Production delays meant the DeLorean did not reach the consumer market until January 1981 (nearly a decade after the company was founded), and in the interim, the new car market had slumped considerably during the 1980 US economic recession. This was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public, who generally felt the uniqueness of the DeLorean&#x27;s styling did not compensate for the higher price and lower horsepower relative to other GT-influenced sports cars on the market. While interest in the DeLorean quickly dwindled, competing models with lower price tags and more powerful engines (such as the Chevrolet Corvette) sold in record numbers during 1980–81 in spite of the ongoing recession. By February 1982, more than half of the roughly 7,000 DeLoreans produced remained unsold, DMC was $175 million in debt, and the Dunmurry factory was placed in receivership.

In January 1982, the British government discovered that DeLorean had built just 8,500 cars and that the equivalent of 23 million pounds, almost half the funds received in 1974, had been transferred to a Panamanian account under the name of General Product Development Services, the company intended to subsidize Lotus. But the money never made it to Lotus, which had collaborated in the development of the car; Lotus head Colin Chapman died at the start of the investigation into the missing money. 

After going into receivership in February 1982, DMC produced another 2,000 cars until John DeLorean&#x27;s arrest in late October, at which point liquidation proceedings were undertaken, and the factory was seized by the British government.

==Arrest and trial==
On October 19, 1982, DeLorean was charged by the US government with trafficking cocaine following a videotaped sting operation in which he was recorded by undercover federal agents agreeing to bankroll a cocaine smuggling operation. The FBI set him up with more than of cocaine (worth about $6.5 million) in a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from New York, with the FBI stating DeLorean was the &quot;financier&quot; to help the financially declining company in a scheme to sell , with an estimated value of $24 million. 

The government was tipped off to DeLorean by confidential informant James Timothy Hoffman, a former neighbor, who reported to his FBI superiors that DeLorean had approached him to ask about setting up a cocaine deal; in truth, Hoffman had called DeLorean and suggested the deal (which DeLorean then accepted) as part of Hoffman&#x27;s efforts to receive a reduced sentence for a 1981 federal cocaine trafficking charge on which he was awaiting trial. Hoffman (whose name was redacted on the original indictment) also stated that he was aware of DeLorean&#x27;s financial troubles before he contacted him, and had heard him admit that he needed $17 million &quot;in a hurry&quot; to prevent DMC&#x27;s imminent insolvency.

Taken together, these two elements allowed DeLorean to successfully defend himself at trial with the procedural defense of police entrapment. DeLorean&#x27;s lawyers successfully argued that the FBI and DEA had unfairly targeted and illegally entrapped DeLorean when they allowed Hoffman (an active FBI informant who only knew DeLorean casually) to solicit DeLorean into a criminal conspiracy simply because he was known to be financially vulnerable. 

Another factor was DeLorean&#x27;s lack of criminal history, whereas Hoffman was a career criminal who stood to directly benefit if he was able to convince DeLorean to incriminate himself on tape. The DeLorean defense team called one witness, Carol Winkler, DeLorean&#x27;s secretary. Her call log proved that Hoffman made the initial call. DeLorean was found not guilty on August 16, 1984, but by then DMC had already collapsed into bankruptcy and DeLorean&#x27;s reputation as a businessman was irrevocably tarnished. When asked after his acquittal if he planned to resume his career in the auto industry, DeLorean bitterly quipped, &quot;Would you buy a used car from me?&quot;

On September 21, 1985, DeLorean was indicted on charges he defrauded investors and committed tax evasion by diverting millions of dollars raised for the company to himself. He was acquitted of all charges.

==Later enterprises==
On November 1, 1994, DeLorean filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office for a raised monorail transport. The transport was never built. DeLorean had planned to resurrect his car company and gave interviews describing a new vehicle called the DMC2. According to his family, he spent a lot of time in his last years working on this new venture. In an effort to gather funds, he designed and sold high-end watches via the Internet under the name DeLorean Time.

The DeLorean Motor Company name was subsequently purchased by a Texas-based firm that provides parts and professional restoration to DeLorean owners. Although John DeLorean was not involved in the business, its vice president James Espey spoke with him on the phone once a month. According to Espey, in their final conversation, DeLorean expressed his dismay at the direction of General Motors, saying &quot;They have too many bean counters and not enough engineers.&quot;

==Personal life==
DeLorean was married four times. He married Elizabeth Higgins on September 3, 1954; they divorced in 1969. He married Kelly Harmon on May 31, 1969, the sister of actor Mark Harmon and daughter of Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon and actress Elyse Knox; they divorced in 1972. DeLorean adopted a son whom he named Zachary Tavio, 14 months old at the time of his marriage to model Cristina Ferrare, who co-adopted Zachary. They had daughter Kathryn Ann, born November 15, 1977; they divorced in 1985. During his marriage to Ferrare, he and his family primarily resided in a 15-room, eighth- and ninth-floor duplex at 834 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan; this apartment was sold to businessman Reginald Lewis in 1992. He later lived with a partner, Sally Baldwin, on his Bedminster, New Jersey, estate; they moved to Morristown, New Jersey, in 2000. In 2002, the two married; they had a daughter, Sheila Baldwin DeLorean on February 19, 2002.

DeLorean appeared in a magazine advertisement for Cutty Sark whisky the year before his arrest and the collapse of his company. It was captioned: &quot;One out of every 100 new businesses succeeds. Here&#x27;s to those who take the odds.&quot; The film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was released in 1985, featuring a DMC DeLorean. DeLorean wrote to writer and producer Bob Gale to thank him for immortalizing the car.

In 1999, DeLorean declared personal bankruptcy after fighting some 40 legal cases following the collapse of DeLorean Motor Company. He was forced to sell his estate in Bedminster in 2000. Donald Trump bought it and converted it to Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. It was reported that following the entrapment controversy, DeLorean and Ferrare became born-again Christians and that this religious experience was to be covered in his autobiography.

==Death==
DeLorean died at Overlook Hospital in Summit, New Jersey, from a stroke, on March 19, 2005, at age 80. His ashes are interred at the White Chapel Cemetery, in Troy, Michigan. His tombstone shows a depiction of his DeLorean sports car with the gull-wing doors open.

<doc id="173034" wikidata="Q848917" url="?curid=173034" title="Lough Corrib">
<text>Lough Corrib ( ; ) is a lake in the west of Ireland. The River Corrib or Galway River connects the lake to the sea at Galway. It is the largest lake within the Republic of Ireland and the second largest on the island of Ireland (after Lough Neagh). It covers 176 km² and lies mostly in County Galway with a small area of its northeast corner in County Mayo.

The first canal on the island of Ireland was cut in the 12th century. Known as the Friar&#x27;s Cut, it allowed boats to pass from Lough Corrib to the sea at Galway.

Lough Corrib was designated a Ramsar site on 16 June 1996. It has also been designated a Special Area of Conservation.

== Name ==
 is a corruption of |. According to placename lore, this refers to or —another name for the figure —who is believed to have been a god of the sea. In Irish, the lough is also called (&quot;the Corrib&quot;).

== Marine archaeology and charts ==
Surveys have been undertaken since 2007 by a local surveyor/cartographer to create up-to-date charts of Lough Corrib. These have uncovered a number of objects of historical significance, which have been investigated by the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the National Monuments Service. These include Bronze Age and Iron Age vessels (dugout canoes), the &quot;Annaghkeen Boat&quot; being 40 ft in length and intricately carved, the &quot;Carrowmoreknock Boat&quot;, a well preserved 10th century vessel carrying three Viking battle axes, and the wreck of a Victorian pleasure yacht. The lake is hence of international importance as a marine archaeological site. All historic wrecks in the lough are protected, and a licence to dive them is required from the National Monuments Service.

== Wildlife ==
The wildlife in Lough Corrib includes birds and hawks, otters, mink, stoat, frogs, and bats. Lough Corrib can be divided into two parts: a smaller shallower basin to the south and a larger deeper basin to the north. These two parts are connected by a narrow channel. In the southern and eastern parts of the lake, the lake bed is dominated by limestone bedrock covered by deposits of precipitated marl. The surrounding land is mostly pastoral farmland to the south and east and bog to the west and north. In addition to the lake basis, some areas of scientific interest adjoining the lake, e.g. woodland, callows grassland and raised bog, have been incorporated into the Special Area of Conservation.

== Threats to ecology ==

In early 2007, large numbers of the protozoan parasite &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; were detected in water from the lake, leading to contamination of the public water supply in Galway city and an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. Another unwelcome visitor is the invasive species &quot;Lagarosiphon major&quot; (also known as &#x27;curly-leaved waterweed&#x27; or &#x27;South African pondweed&#x27;) which is destroying fish habitat and the zebra mussel.

=== Cryptosporidium outbreak ===
On 21 March 2007, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; was confirmed to be present in the drinking water of Galway City, Moycullen, Oughterard and Headford, which had been instructed six days earlier to boil their water before drinking. The water taken from Lough Corrib was likely contaminated by migration of animal and human faeces. Controversy emerged when it was revealed that funds previously earmarked to improve Galway&#x27;s water system had not been spent. Dick Roche, the Minister of the Environment, later announced allocation of additional funds to tackle the issue. Measures included upgrading existing water treatment and filtration systems, as well as the projected importing of water from nearby Luimnagh, Tuam, County Galway. This plant at Luimnagh has facilities for &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; eradication and filtration.

The Community Care Organisation, Cope, delivered bottled water to their elderly clients from 30 March 2007. A lobby group was formed in April 2007 to highlight the issue.

== Islands ==

While Lough Corrib is reputed to have 365 islands, a recent figure from the creator of the charts of the lake is 1,327. These islands include Inchagoil Island, midway between Cong and Oughterard. It is one of the largest of the wooded islands along Lough Corrib. The island has views of the Maumturk range, Joyce Country and the mountains of Connemara. There are some beaches and woods with walks around the island. There is evidence of an early monastic settlement, and two churches - Saint Patrick&#x27;s and the 12th century church known as the &quot;saints&quot; church. St. Brendan of Clonfert is also said to have spent some time on an island in this lake after returning from his travels in Britain. There are several paths around the island, an old cemetery and remains of four or five cottages which housed the few inhabitants.

Another lake island is Caislean-na-Circe, between Maam and Doon. This section of Lough Corrib is free from islands except for the rock on which the ancient Hen&#x27;s Castle of the O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s and the O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s stands. The castle was home of the pirate Queen Gráinne O&#x27;Malley, who lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth I of England. In 1225, the Lord Justice caused Odo O&#x27;Flatherty to give up Kirk Castle to Odo O&#x27;Connor, King of Connaught; for assurance of his fidelity. Cruises on the lough depart from Cong, Ashford Castle, Galway City, and Oughterard.

==Influence on writers==
Paul Féval&#x27;s novel &quot;La Quittance de minuit&quot; (1846) is set in County Galway, near Lough Corrib.

William Wilde, father of Oscar Wilde, wrote a book about the lake, &quot;Lough Corrib, its Shores and Islands&quot; (1867). He built a summerhouse on the banks of the lake, called Moytura House.

&quot;The Irish Times&quot; states that &quot;the unspoilt countryside around Lough Corrib provided the inspiration&quot; for &quot;The Hounds of the Morrigan&quot;, a children&#x27;s novel by Pat O&#x27;Shea.
