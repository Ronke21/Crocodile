<text>The Peruvian Horse is a breed of light saddle horse known for its smooth ride. It is distinguished by a natural, four-beat, lateral gait called the &quot;paso llano.&quot; This breed is protected by the Peruvian government through Decree number 25919 of Peru enacted on November 28, 1992, and has been declared a Cultural Heritage of the Nation by the National Institute of Culture (INC). Due to the isolation suffered for about 400 years and the selection made by their breeders, this breed is very particular in their body proportions and an ambling gait or &quot;paso llano&quot; that is characteristic. It is typical of the northern Peruvian regions of the country from which it originated. Trujillo city is considered the cradle of typical Peruvian Horses.

==History==

Smooth-gaited horses, generally known as Palfreys, existed in the Middle Ages, and the Jennet in particular was noted for its ambling gaits. Peruvians trace their ancestry to these ambling Jennets; as well as to the Barb, which contributed strength and stamina; and to the Andalusian which added style, conformation and action.

Horses arrived in South America during the Spanish Conquest, beginning with the arrival of Pizarro in 1531. Foundation bloodstock came from Spain, Jamaica, Panama and other areas of Central America. Importations increased after 1542, when the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castilla. This later became the Viceroyalty of Peru, an important center of Spain&#x27;s New World viceroyalties in the eighteenth century.
Once in Peru, they were used primarily for transportation and breeding stock. In the north of Peru, the vast size of sugar and cotton plantations meant that overseers needed to travel long distances, often taking days to cross the plantation. In the south of Peru, the arid deserts that separated settlements required sturdy, strong horses. In both cases, smooth-gaited horses with good endurance were required. On the other hand, Peru did not develop a livestock-based economy, and thus did not need to breed for the speed or agility characteristic of stock horses.

Over time, Peruvian breeders kept the bloodlines clean and selectively bred primarily for gait, conformation, and temperament. They wanted strong, hardy animals that were comfortable to ride and easy to control. Over four centuries, their dedication to breeding only the best gaited bloodstock resulted in the modern Peruvian Horse.

A decline in the use of Peruvians was seen in the southern part of Peru in the early 1900s, following the building of major highways that allowed motor travel to replace the use of the horse. Many of the major breeders in the area gave their best horses away to peasants living in the nearby &quot;quebradas&quot; (valleys). It was in one of these quebradas that breeder Gustavo de la Borda found the horse that was to become the most important modern sire in the breed, Sol de Oro (Viejo).

The Peruvian Horse continued to flourish in the northern regions because it was still needed for transportation on the haciendas. This changed with the harsh Agrarian Reforms instituted by the government of Juan Velasco Alvarado in the late 1960s that had a devastating effect on the Peruvian Horse within Peru. Major breeding operations were broken up and breeding stock was lost. Because interest in the Peruvian Horse was growing in the United States and Central America at the same time, many of the finest Peruvians were exported, leading to a period where it appeared the Peruvian Horse would fade in its homeland.

Don Pedro Venturo Zapata was a major breeder of the Peruvians in his &quot;Hacienda Higuereta y Anexos - Negociacion Vinicola Pedro Venturo S.A.&quot; from 1925 to 1952.

The last quarter of the 20th century saw a resurgence in the Peruvian Horse&#x27;s fortune in Peru. The annual National Show in Lima is a major event in Peruvian cultural life. The Peruvian has been declared a &quot;Patrimonio Cultural&quot; (Cultural Heritage) of Peru in an attempt to shore up the breed within the country. There are now laws in place that restrict the export of national champion horses.

Peruvian Horses are noted internationally for their good temperament and comfortable ride. As of 2003, there are approximately 25,000 horses worldwide, used for pleasure riding, trail, horse shows, parades, and endurance riding.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
The horse is medium-sized, usually standing between tall, with an elegant yet powerful build. The Peruvian horse has a deep chest, heavy neck and body with substance without any trace of being hound gutted in the flank area. A low set, quiet tail, clamped tightly between the buttocks is a vital quality. Stallions have a broader chest and larger neck than mares, and are known for their quality temperament. The coat color can be varied; and is seen in chestnut, black, bay, brown, buckskin, palomino, gray, roan or dun. Solid colors, grays and dark skin are considered the most desirable. The mane and forelock are lustrous, fine and abundant. White markings are acceptable on the legs and face.

===Gait===

Instead of a trot, the Peruvian performs an ambling four beat gait between the walk and the trot. There are two official gaits, called the &quot;Paso Llano&quot; or &quot;even step&quot;, and the &quot;sobreandando&quot; which is a bit closer in timing to the pace. Both gaits can be performed at a variety of speeds. The fast sobreandando is often the speed of a canter. Both acceptable gaits are lateral, having four beats and is performed in a lateral sequence — left hind, left fore, right hind, right fore. The Peruvian Horse can also canter, will trot and pace at liberty, and do a natural relaxed walk.

The Peruvian performs two variations of the four-beat gait. The first, the &quot;paso llano&quot;, is , meaning that there are four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm. This is the preferred gait. The second gait, the &quot;sobreandando&quot;, is often faster. Instead of four equal beats, the lateral beats are closer together in a 1–2, 3-4 rhythm, with the pause between the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other side is longer.
This characteristic gait was utilized for the purpose of covering long distances over a short period of time without tiring the horse or rider. The gait is natural and does not require extensive training. Purebred Peruvian foals can be seen gaiting alongside their dams within a few hours of their birth.

The gait supplies essentially none of the vertical bounce that is characteristic of the trot, and hence posting (moving up and down with each of the horse&#x27;s footfalls) is unnecessary. It is also very stable, as the execution of the gait means there are always two, and sometimes three, feet on the ground. Because the rider feels no strain or jolt, gaited horses such as the Peruvian are often popular with riders who have back trouble.

====Termino====
A unique trait of the Peruvian gait is &quot;termino&quot; — an outward swinging leg action, originating from the shoulder, in which the front lower legs roll to the outside during the stride forward, similar to a swimmer&#x27;s arms. Individual horses may have more or less &quot;termino&quot;. High lift or wide termino is not necessarily a sign of a well gaited horse; in fact it may be detrimental to a good gait.

===Brío===
Brío refers to a horse&#x27;s vigor, energy, exuberance, courage and liveliness; it automatically implies that these qualities are willingly placed in the service of the rider. Horses with true brio are willing workers. Their attention does not wander but is focused on the handler or rider, and thus they are quick to react and fast to learn. Horses with brio attract attention, and combined with the stamina of the breed have reserves they can tap to travel long distances for many hours.

Breeders and judges look for Brío, often translated as &quot;spirit,&quot; but this does not capture the complexity of the term. &quot;Brío&quot; describes a somewhat contradictory temperament, which combines arrogance, spirit, and the sense of always being on parade, with a willingness to please the rider. Brío is an intangible quality of controlled energy that creates a metamorphosis in ordinary-looking horses and is an important trait of Peruvians.
==Peruvian Horse shows==
In the United States, competitions are organized by the North American Peruvian Horse Association and by their clubs. in Peru, the two best-known and most important events are The National Horse Competition Caballo de Paso Peruano held in Pachacamac and at the Internacional de la Primavera during the months of September and October in Trujillo city and during the international Marinera Festival in January. Peru&#x27;s National Institute of Culture has declared that the horses are part of Peru&#x27;s national cultural heritage.

==Name==
Because of the shared word Paso, a close relationship between the Peruvian and the Paso Fino breed is incorrectly assumed. &quot;Paso&quot; simply means &quot;step,&quot; in Spanish, and does not imply a common breed or origin. Although the two breeds share ancestors in the Old World, and have some similarities, they were developed independently for different purposes. The two breeds are different and easily distinguishable. The Peruvian is somewhat larger, deeper in the body and wider. The Paso Fino is not bred for &quot;termino&quot; in its stride.

The Peruvian has been called the &quot;national horse&quot; of Peru. On the other hand, the Paso Fino was developed from horses throughout northern Latin America and the Caribbean, with major centers of development in Colombia and Puerto Rico. The Peruvian is also increasingly referred to in North America as the &quot;Peruvian Horse&quot; to distinguish its breed apart from other breeds.

<doc id="170766" wikidata="Q55636" url="?curid=170766" title="Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla">
<text>Don Miguel Gregorio Antonio Ignacio Hidalgo y Costilla Gallaga Mandarte y Villaseñor (8 May 1753 – 30 July 1811), commonly known as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla or simply Miguel Hidalgo (), was a Catholic priest, leader of the Mexican War of Independence, and is recognized as the Father of the Nation.

A professor at the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in Valladolid, Hidalgo was influenced by Enlightenment ideas, which contributed to his ouster in 1792. He served in a church in Colima and then in Dolores. After his arrival, he was shocked by the rich soil he had found. He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes, but in New Spain (modern Mexico) growing these crops was discouraged or prohibited by colonial authorities to prevent competition with imports from Spain. On 16 September 1810 he gave the Cry of Dolores, a speech calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Ferdinand VII, held captive during the Peninsular War, by revolting against the European-born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy José de Iturrigaray.

Hidalgo marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians who attacked Spanish Peninsular and Criollo elites. Hidalgo&#x27;s insurgent army accumulated initial victories on its way to Mexico City, but his troops ultimately lacked training and were poorly armed. These troops ran into an army of well-trained and armed Spanish troops in the Battle of Calderón Bridge and were defeated. After the battle, Hidalgo and his remaining troops fled north, but Hidalgo was betrayed, captured and executed.

== Early years ==

Hidalgo was the second-born child of Cristóbal Hidalgo y Costilla Espinoza de los Monteros and Ana María Gallaga Mandarte Villaseñor, both criollos. On his maternal side, he was of Basque ancestry. His most recent identifiable Spanish ancestor was his maternal great-grandfather, who was from Durango, Biscay. On his paternal side, he descended from criollo families native to Tejupilco, which were well-respected within the criollo community. Hidalgo&#x27;s father was an hacienda manager in Valladolid, Michoacán, where Hidalgo spent the majority of his life. Eight days after his birth, Hidalgo was baptized into the Catholic faith in the parish church of Cuitzeo de los Naranjos. Hidalgo&#x27;s parents had three other sons; José Joaquín, Manuel Mariano, and José María, before their mother died when Hildalgo was nine years old. A step brother named Mariano was born later.

In 1759, Charles III ascended the Spanish throne; he soon sent out a visitor-general with the power to investigate and reform all parts of colonial government. During this period, Cristóbal was determined that Miguel and his younger brother Joaquín should both enter the priesthood and hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Being of significant means he paid for all of his sons to receive the best education the region had to offer. After receiving private instruction, likely from the priest of the neighboring parish, Hidalgo was ready for further education.

== Education, ordination, and early career ==
At the age of fifteen Hidalgo was sent to Valladolid (now Morelia), Michoacán, to study at the Colegio de San Francisco Javier with the Jesuits, along with his brothers. When the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767, he entered the Colegio de San Nicolás, where he studied for the priesthood.

He completed his preparatory education in 1770. After this, he went to the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico in Mexico City for further study, earning his degree in philosophy and theology in 1773. His education for the priesthood was traditional, with subjects in Latin, rhetoric and logic. Like many priests in Mexico, he studied indigenous languages, such as Nahuatl, Otomi, and Purépecha. He also studied Italian and French, which were not commonly studied in Mexico at this time. He earned the nickname &quot;El Zorro&quot; (&quot;The Fox&quot;) for his reputation for cleverness at school. Hidalgo&#x27;s study of French allowed him to read and study works of the Enlightenment current in Europe but, at the same time, forbidden by the Catholic church in Mexico.
Hidalgo was ordained as a priest in 1778 when he was 25 years old. From 1779 to 1792, he dedicated himself to teaching at the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo in Valladolid (now Morelia); it was &quot;one of the most important educational centers of the viceroyalty.&quot; He was a professor of Latin grammar and arts, as well as a theology professor. Beginning in 1787, he was named treasurer, vice-rector and secretary, becoming dean of the school in 1790 when he was 39. As rector, Hidalgo continued studying the liberal ideas that were coming from France and other parts of Europe. Authorities ousted him in 1792 for revising traditional teaching methods there, but also for &quot;irregular handling of some funds.&quot; The Church sent him to work at the parishes of Colima and San Felipe Torres Mochas until he became the parish priest in Dolores, Guanajuato, succeeding his brother José Joaquín a few weeks after his death on 19 September 1802.

Although Hidalgo had a traditional education for the priesthood, as an educator at the Colegio de San Nicolás he had innovated in teaching methods and curriculum. In his personal life, he did not advocate or live the way expected of 18th-century Mexican priests. Instead, his studies of Enlightenment-era ideas caused him to challenge traditional political and religious views. He questioned the absolute authority of the Spanish king and challenged numerous ideas presented by the Church, including the power of the popes, the virgin birth, and clerical celibacy. As a secular cleric, he was not bound by a vow of poverty, so he, like many other secular priests, pursued business activities, including owning three haciendas; but contrary to his vow of chastity, he formed liaisons with women. One was with Manuela Ramos Pichardo, with whom he had two children, as well as a child with Bibiana Lucero. He later lived with a woman named María Manuela Herrera, fathering two daughters out of wedlock with her, and later fathered three other children with a woman named Josefa Quintana.

These actions resulted in his appearance before the Court of the Inquisition, although the court did not find him guilty. Hidalgo was an egalitarian. As parish priest in both San Felipe and Dolores, he opened his house to natives and mestizos as well as criollos.

== Background to the War of Independence ==
=== The conspiracy of Querétaro ===
Meanwhile, in the city of Querétaro, a conspiracy was brewing, organized by the mayor Miguel Domínguez and his wife Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez; members of the military, such as Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama and Mariano Abasolo, also participated. Allende was in charge of convincing Hidalgo to join his movement, since the priest of Dolores had very influential friends from all over the Bajío and even New Spain, such as Juan Antonio Riaño, mayor of Guanajuato, and Manuel Abad y Queipo, Bishop of Michoacán.

=== Napoleonic Wars ===
In 1807, France and Spain signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau to invade Portugal, an ally of the United Kingdom. The French troops that were supposed to go through Spain to Portugal remained in Spain and the Spanish people were upset by the presence of the French troops as a result of the numerous excesses that the French committed against the Spanish people, such as occupation of the territory, numerous looting, pillaging, murder of civilians, and the kidnappings of King Charles IV and Prince Ferdinand VII. Also, Napoleon forced both to abdicate and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Spain. This triggered a revolt by Spanish troops first and, subsequently, an uprising in Madrid, This was followed by further revolts across Spain. In August 1808, a British army landed in Portugal. Britain and France then went to war against each other in Portugal and Spain. The war and instability in Spain affected Mexico and other parts of New Spain.

== Parish priest in Dolores ==

In 1803, aged 50, Hidalgo arrived in Dolores accompanied by his family that included a younger brother, a cousin, two half sisters, as well as María and their two children. He obtained this parish in spite of his hearing before the Inquisition, which did not stop his secular practices.

After Hidalgo settled in Dolores, he turned over most of the clerical duties to one of his vicars, Francisco Iglesias, and devoted himself almost exclusively to commerce, intellectual pursuits and humanitarian activities. He spent much of his time studying literature, scientific works, grape cultivation, and the raising of silkworms. He used the knowledge that he gained to promote economic activities for the poor and rural people in his area. He established factories to make bricks and pottery and trained indigenous people in the making of leather. He promoted beekeeping. He was interested in promoting activities of commercial value to use the natural resources of the area to help the poor. His goal was to make the indigenous and mestizos more self-reliant. However, these activities violated mercantilist policies designed to protect agriculture and industry in Spain, and Hidalgo was ordered to stop them. These policies as well as exploitation of mixed race castas fostered animosity in Hidalgo towards the Peninsular-born Spaniards in Mexico.

In addition to restricting economic activities in New Spain, Spanish mercantile practices caused misery for native peoples. A drought in 1807–1808 caused a famine in the Dolores area, and rather than releasing stored grain to market, Spanish merchants blocked its release, speculating on price increases. Hidalgo lobbied against these practices but was not successful.

== Cry of Dolores ==
Hidalgo kickstarted Mexico&#x27;s battle for independence on September 16th, 1810. Hidalgo like many in the movement grew increasingly violent as resentment grew. Hidalgo quickly rose to prominence as a leader being a respected member of the community with his educated background. While Hidalgo did lead the rebellion independence was not the primary interest for him rather to support the well-being of parishioners. Hidalgo was able to temporarily unite multiple social groups under his rule against the Spanish monarchy.
As the rebellion grew the more Hidalgo threatened the Spanish Monarchy making Hidalgo act more cautiously. Fearing arrest, Hidalgo ordered his brother Mauricio, as well as Ignacio Allende and Mariano Abasolo, to go with a number of other armed men to make the sheriff release prison inmates in Dolores on the night of 15 September 1810, setting eighty free. On the morning of 16 September 1810, Hidalgo celebrated Mass, which was attended by about 300 people, including hacienda owners, local politicians, and Spaniards. There he gave what is now known as the &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot; (Cry of Dolores), calling the people of his parish to leave their homes and join with him in a rebellion against the current government, in the name of their King, Ferdinand VII.

Hidalgo&#x27;s &quot;Grito&quot; did not condemn the notion of monarchy or criticize the current social order in detail, but his opposition to the events in Spain and the current viceregal government was clearly expressed in his reference to bad government. The &quot;Grito&quot; also emphasized loyalty to the Catholic religion, a sentiment with which both Creoles and Peninsulares could sympathize.

== Hidalgo&#x27;s army – from Celaya to Monte de las Cruces ==

Hidalgo was met with an outpouring of support. Intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people followed Hidalgo with enthusiasm. His movement was joined by mestizos and the indigenous in such numbers that the original motives of the Querétaro group were obscured. Ignacio Allende, Hidalgo&#x27;s main co-conspirator in Querétaro, remained more loyal to the Querétaro group&#x27;s original, criollo centered objectives. However, Hidalgo&#x27;s actions and the people&#x27;s response meant he would lead and not Allende. Allende had acquired military training when New Spain established a colonial militia whereas Hidalgo had none. The insurgents who followed Hidalgo also had no military training, experience or equipment. Many of these people were poor who were angry after many years of hunger and oppression. Consequently, Hidalgo was the leader of undisciplined rebels.

Hidalgo&#x27;s leadership gave the insurgent movement a supernatural aspect. Many villagers that joined the insurgent army came to believe that Fernando VII himself commanded their loyalty to Hidalgo and the monarch was in New Spain personally directing the rebellion against the Viceroyalty. Historian Eric Van Young believes that such ideas gave the movement supernatural and religious legitimacy that went as far as messianic expectation.
Hidalgo and Allende left Dolores with about 800 men, half of whom were on horseback. They marched through the Bajío area, through Atotonilco, San Miguel el Grande (present-day San Miguel de Allende), Chamucuero, Celaya, Salamanca, Irapuato and Silao, to Guanajuato. From Guanajuato, Hidalgo directed his troops to Valladolid, Michoacán. They remained here for a while and eventually marched towards Mexico City. From Valladolid, they marched through the State of Mexico, through the cities of Maravatio, Ixtlahuaca, Toluca coming as close to Mexico City as the Monte de las Cruces, between the Valley of Toluca and the Valley of Mexico.

Through numbers, Hidalgo&#x27;s army had some early victories. Hidalgo first went through the economically important and densely populated province of Guanajuato. One of the first stops was at the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe in Atotonilco, where Hidalgo affixed an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe to a lance to adopt it as his banner. He inscribed the following slogans to his troops&#x27; flags: &quot;Long live religion! Long live our most Holy Mother of Guadalupe! Long live America and death to bad government!&quot; For the insurgents as a whole, the Virgin represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility, invoked more to identify allies rather than create ideological alliances or a sense of nationalism.
The extent and the intensity of the movement took colonial authorities by surprise. San Miguel and Celaya were captured with little resistance. On 21 September 1810, Hidalgo was proclaimed general and supreme commander after arriving to Celaya. At this point, Hidalgo&#x27;s army numbered about 5,000. However, because of the lack of discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting, ransacking towns and executing prisoners. This caused friction between Allende and Hidalgo as early as the capture of San Miguel in late September 1810. When rioting ran through the city, Allende tried to break up violence by striking insurgents with the flat of his sword, which brought him a rebuke from Hidalgo.

On 28 September 1810, Hidalgo arrived at the city of Guanajuato with rebels who were mostly armed with sticks, stones, and machetes. The town&#x27;s peninsular and criollo populations took refuge in the fortified Alhóndiga de Granaditas commanded by Juan Antonio de Riaño. The insurgents overwhelmed the defenses after two days and killed an estimated 400 – 600 people. Allende strongly protested these events and while Hidalgo agreed that they were heinous, he also stated that he understood the historical patterns that shaped such responses. The attacks prompted criollos and peninsulares to ally against the insurgents and caused Hidalgo to lose support from liberal criollos.
From Guanajuato, Hidalgo set off for Valladolid on 10 October 1810 with 15,000 men. When he arrived at Acámbaro, he was promoted to generalissimo and given the title of His Most Serene Highness, with power to legislate. With his new rank he had a blue uniform with a clerical collar and red lapels embroidered with silver and gold. His uniform also included a black baldric also embroidered with gold. There was also a large image of the Virgin of Guadalupe in gold on his chest.

Hidalgo and his forces took Valladolid with little opposition on 17 October 1810. There, Hidalgo issued proclamations against the peninsulares, whom he accused of arrogance and despotism, as well as enslaving those in the Americas for almost 300 years. Hidalgo argued that the objective of the war was &quot;to send the &quot;gachupines&quot; back to the motherland&quot;, accusing their greed and tyranny as leading to the temporal and spiritual degradation of Mexicans. Hidalgo forced the Bishop-elect of Michoacan, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on 24 September 1810. Later, the Inquisition issued an excommunication edict on 13 October 1810 condemning Hidalgo as a seditionary, apostate, and heretic.

The insurgents stayed in the city preparing to march to the capital of New Spain, Mexico City. The canon of the cathedral met Hidalgo and made him promise that the atrocities of San Miguel, Celaya and Guanajuato would not be repeated in Valladolid. Wholesale destruction of the city was not repeated. However, Hidalgo was furious when he found the cathedral locked to him, which led him to jail Spaniards, replace city officials with his own and looting the city treasury before marching off toward Mexico City. On 19 October, Hidalgo left Valladolid for Mexico City after taking 400,000 pesos from the cathedral to pay expenses.

Hidalgo and his troops left the state of Michoacán and marched through the towns of Maravatio, Ixtlahuaca, and Toluca before stopping in the forested mountain area of Monte de las Cruces. Here, insurgent forces engaged Torcuato Trujillo&#x27;s royalist forces. Hidalgo&#x27;s troops led the royalist troops to retreat, but the insurgents suffered heavy casualties, as they had when they engaged royalist soldiers in Guanajuato.

== Retreat from Mexico City ==
After the Battle of Monte de las Cruces on 30 October 1810, Hidalgo had some 100,000 insurgents and was in a strategic position to attack Mexico City. Numerically, his forces outnumbered royalist forces. The royalist government in Mexico City, under the leadership of Viceroy Francisco Venegas, prepared psychological and military defenses. An intensive propaganda campaign had advertised insurgent violence in the Bajío region and stressed the insurgents&#x27; threat against social stability. Hidalgo&#x27;s insurgency also faced opposition from sedentary natives and castes of the Valley of Mexico.

Hidalgo&#x27;s forces came as close as what is now the Cuajimalpa borough of Mexico City. Allende wanted to press forward and attack the capital, but Hidalgo disagreed. Hidalgo&#x27;s reasoning for this decision is unclear and has been debated by historians. One explanation is that Hidalgo&#x27;s forces were undisciplined and had suffered heavy losses whenever they encountered trained troops. As the capital was guarded by some of the most trained soldiers in New Spain, Hidalgo decided to turn away from Mexico City and move to the north through Toluca and Ixtlahuaca with a destination of Guadalajara.
After turning back, many insurgents deserted. By the time he got to Aculco, just north of Toluca, his army had shrunk to 40,000 men. New Spain General Felix Calleja attacked Hidalgo&#x27;s forces, defeating them on 7 November 1810. Allende decided to take the troops under his command to Guanajuato, instead of Guadalajara. Hidalgo arrived in Guadalajara on 26 November with more than 7,000 poorly armed troops. He initially occupied the city with lower-class support because Hidalgo promised to end slavery, tribute payment and taxes on alcohol and tobacco.

Hidalgo established an alternative government in Guadalajara with himself at the head and appointed two ministers. On 6 December 1810, Hidalgo issued a decree abolishing slavery, threatening those who did not comply with death. He abolished tribute payments that indigenous peoples had to pay to criollo and peninsular lords. He ordered the publication of a newspaper called &quot;Despertador Americano&quot; (&quot;American Wake Up Call&quot;). He named Pascacio Ortiz de Letona as representative of the insurgent government and sent him to the United States to seek support, but Ortiz de Letona was apprehended by the Spanish army and executed.

During this time, insurgent violence mounted in Guadalajara. Citizens loyal to the viceregal government were seized and executed. While indiscriminate looting was avoided, insurgents targeted properties of criollos and Spaniards, regardless of political affiliation. In the meantime, the royalist army had retaken Guanajuato, forcing Allende to flee to Guadalajara. After he arrived at the city, Allende again objected to Hidalgo concerning the insurgent violence. However, Hidalgo knew the royalist army was on its way to Guadalajara and wanted to stay on good terms with his own army.

After Guanajuato had been retaken by royalist forces, Bishop Manuel Abad y Queipo excommunicated Hidalgo and those following or helping him on 24 December 1810. Abad y Queipo had formerly been a friend of Hidalgo, but he was adamantly opposed to Hidalgo&#x27;s tactics and the resultant disruptions, alleged &quot;sacrileges&quot; and purported ill-treatment of priests. The Inquisition pronounced an edict against Hidalgo, charging him with denying that God punishes sins in this world, doubting the authenticity of the Bible, denouncing the popes and Church government, allowing Jews not to convert to Christianity, denying the perpetual virginity of Mary, preaching that there was no hell, and adopting Lutheran doctrine with regard to the Eucharist. Hidalgo responded that he had never departed from Church doctrine in the slightest degree.

Royalist forces marched to Guadalajara, arriving in January 1811 with nearly 6,000 men. Allende and Abasolo wanted to concentrate their forces in the city and plan an escape route should they be defeated, but Hidalgo rejected this, deciding to make a stand at the Calderón Bridge (&quot;Puente de Calderón&quot;) just outside the city. Hidalgo had between 80,000 and 100,000 men and 95 cannons, but the better trained royalists decisively defeated the insurgent army, forcing Hidalgo to flee towards Aguascalientes. At Hacienda de Pabellón, on 25 January 1811, near the city of Aguascalientes, Allende and other insurgent leaders took military command away from Hidalgo, blaming him for their defeats. Hidalgo remained as head politically but with military command going to Allende.

The insurgent Army moved north towards Zacatecas and Saltillo with the goal of making connections in the United States for support. Hidalgo reached Saltillo, where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by General José de la Cruz in the name of Venegas in return for Hidalgo&#x27;s surrender. A short time later, they were betrayed and captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baján (&quot;Norias de Baján&quot;) on 21 March 1811 and taken to Chihuahua.

== Execution ==
Hidalgo was turned over to Durango, where Bishop Francisco Gabriel de Olivares had him officially defrocked and excommunicated on 27 July 1811. He was subsequently declared guilty of treason by a military court. He was tortured through the flaying of his hands, symbolically removing the chrism placed upon them at his priestly ordination and executed. There are many theories about how he was killed, the most popular that he was killed by firing squad in the morning of 30 July. Before his execution, he thanked his jailers, two soldiers, Ortega and Melchor, for their humane treatment. At his execution, Hidalgo stated &quot;Though I may die, I shall be remembered forever; you all will soon be forgotten.&quot; His body and the bodies of Allende, Aldama and José Mariano Jiménez were decapitated, and the heads were put on display in the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. The heads remained there for ten years until the end of the Mexican War of Independence to demoralize insurgents. Hidalgo&#x27;s headless body was first displayed outside the prison and then buried in the Church of St Francis in Chihuahua. The remains were transferred to Mexico City in 1824.

Hidalgo&#x27;s death resulted in a political vacuum on the insurgent side until 1812. The royalist military commander, General Félix Calleja, continued to pursue rebel troops. Insurgent fighting evolved into guerrilla warfare, and eventually the next major insurgent leader, José María Morelos Pérez y Pavón, who had led rebel movements with Hidalgo, became head of the insurgents, until Morelos himself was captured and executed in 1815.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla had the unique distinction of being a father in three senses of the word: a priestly father in the Roman Catholic Church, a biological father who produced illegitimate children in violation of his clerical vows, and the father of his country.&quot; He has been hailed as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; even though it was Agustín de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who became the first head of state of Mexico in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between 16 September, the day of Hidalgo&#x27;s Grito de Dolores, and 27 September, when Iturbide&#x27;s forces captured Mexico City, ending the war.

Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, and 16 September 1810 became officially recognized as the day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be &quot;precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.&quot;

Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo&#x27;s image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas McGinty University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo&#x27;s birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15–16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. He is also the namesake of Hidalgo County, Texas, in the United States.

The remains of Hidalgo lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City. Next to it is a lamp lit to represent the sacrifice of those who gave their lives for Mexican Independence.

His birthday is a civic holiday in Mexico.

<text>Urban secession is a city&#x27;s secession from its surrounding region to form a new political unit.

This new unit is usually a subdivision of the same country as its surroundings. Many cities around the world form a separate local government unit. The most common reason is that the population of the city is too large for the city to be subsumed into a larger local government unit.

However, in a few cases, full sovereignty may be attained, in which case the unit is usually called a city-state. It is an extreme form of urban autonomy, which can be expressed in less formal terms or by ordinary legislation such as a city charter.

== History ==

Urban autonomy has a long history back to the prehistoric urbanization and the original Mediterranean city-states of classical times, e.g. Ancient Athens, Ancient Rome. In medieval times such measures as the Magdeburg rights established special status for cities and their residents in commercial relations. In general it receded as European cities were incorporated into nation-states especially in the 17th century to 20th century, eventually losing many special rights.

== Theory of urban secession ==
Modern theorists of local civic economies, including Robert J. Oakerson and Jane Jacobs, argue that cities reflect a clash of values, especially of tolerances versus preferences, with views of the city varying from a pure community to that of a pure marketplace. Suburbanites have a strong tendency to view the city as a marketplace since they do not participate in its street life voluntarily, nor do they consider the city to be a safe and comfortable place to live in. By contrast, those who choose downtown living tend to see it as more of a community, but must pay careful attention to their tolerances (for smog, noise pollution, crime, taxation, etc.). Ethics and thus politics of these interest groups vastly differ.

Secession (the setup of entirely new legislative and executive entities) is advocated by certain urban theorists, notably Jane Jacobs, as the only way to deal politically with these vast differences in culture between modern cities and even their nearest suburbs and essential watersheds. She stated that &quot;cities that wish to thrive in the next century must separate politically from their surrounding regions.&quot; She rejected the lesser &quot;Charter&quot; and less formal solutions, arguing the full structure of real regional government were necessary, and applied to the urban area alone. In particular she rejected the idea that suburban regions should have any say over the rules in the city: &quot;they have left it, and aren&#x27;t part of it.&quot; Jacobs herself lived in an urban neighborhood (The Annex, Toronto) which would have been paved over in the 1970s by a highway project to serve the suburbs, the Spadina Expressway, had the proponents of urban secession not stopped it. Jacobs likewise took part in blocking the development of the Lower Manhattan Expressway in the 1960s, opposing Robert Moses. These freeways are examples of the clash of urban community versus suburban market interests.

Advocates of highway development and suburban participation in urban government theorize that cities which protect themselves from the suburbs, forcing them to become self-sufficient small towns, cutting off the freeways, forcing commuters into subways, etc., are committing suicide by forcing business out into the suburbs. Advocates respond that cities depend more on their quality of life to attract migrants and professionals, and that remote work makes it possible for workers in the city to live anywhere, coming into town less frequently, without the rush.

==Examples==
===City-states and semi-autonomous cities===
Fully autonomous cities, or city-states, are the objective of urban secession. A modern instance of a city-state is the Republic of Singapore, which was expelled from Malaysia for a variety of political and social reasons. Currently, Singapore is the sole city which has total independence, an indigenous currency, and a substantial military. The other two existing and &quot;de jure&quot; city-states are Monaco and Vatican City, which operate as, nominally, politically independent urban areas. 

Certain cities like Hong Kong and Macau have a degree of autonomy, but not full political independence. Specifically, the status of a special administrative regions (SAR) has been conferred upon Hong Kong and Macau in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The reason for their relative autonomy stems from their existence for more than a century as European colonies, and a resultant difficulty of full reintegration.

===Asia===
In China, both Beijing and Tianjin are independent of the surrounding province of Hebei, of which they were formerly a part. Similarly, Shanghai is now independent from Jiangsu and Chongqing from Sichuan. 

In Japan, Tokyo, as well as being a city, forms a prefecture, falling into a special category of &quot;metropolitan prefecture&quot; having some of the attributes of a city and some of a prefecture. Within Tokyo, there are smaller units, &quot;wards&quot;, &quot;cities&quot;, &quot;towns&quot;, etc., but some of the responsibilities normally assigned to cities and towns in other Japanese prefectures are handled by the Tokyo metropolitan government instead.

In both South Korea and North Korea, special cities are independent from their surrounding provinces and city-states under direct governance from the central government. Examples are Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon and Ulsan in South Korea and Pyongyang and Rason in North Korea. In South Korea, the main criterion for granting secession from the province is a population reaching one million.

Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, administers six cities, formerly part of the Republic of China&#x27;s Taiwan Province, as special municipalities: Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, New Taipei and Taoyuan. (The People&#x27;s Republic of China, which claims Taiwan, continues to recognise these municipalities as an integral part of PRC&#x27;s purported Taiwan Province; the People&#x27;s Republic of China regards Taiwan as its 23rd province, with Taipei as its capital.)

In Indonesia, the capital Jakarta was once part of West Java until it gained special autonomy status and broke away from its former province in 1961. The mayor position was replaced by governor, making it special autonomous province and operates independently from its surrounding provinces

Malaysian capitals Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya as well as Labuan island was once part of Selangor and Sabah respectively. In 1974 Kuala Lumpur was declared as first Federal Territory in Malaysia in order to prevent clash between Selangor state government and federal government, the state capital of Selangor was later moved to nearby Shah Alam. Later in 1984 Labuan was chosen by the federal government for the development Offshore financial centre and declared as second Federal Territory after Kuala Lumpur. Putrajaya declared as third Federal Territory later in 2001 after federal government finished developing the city as new federal capital while Kuala Lumpur stays as royal capital.

In Thailand, the capital Bangkok operates independently of any province and is considered a special administrative area. It is a primate city in terms of its large population, having nearly 8% of Thailand&#x27;s total population.

===Europe===
The Brussels capital region, a densely built-up area consisting of 19 communes including the capital city Brussels, became one of Belgium&#x27;s three regions after the country was turned into a federation in 1970. (In Belgium there are special circumstances due to the country&#x27;s language communities.)

In Bulgaria the capital Sofia is an oblast of its own - Sofia-grad, while the surrounding area is divided between the Pernik Oblast and the Sofia Oblast.

Madrid has its own autonomous region, including a regional parliament even though Spain is a unitary state.

Paris and the Lyon Metropolis are their own departments in France.

The capital city of Bucharest is also a county within Romania.

Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the biggest cities in Russia, have a &quot;federal city&quot; status. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the city of Sevastopol is also administered as a federal city, though Ukraine and most of the UN member countries continue to regard Sevastopol as a city with special status within Ukraine.

In the United Kingdom, London secessionism has gathered momentum following the Brexit referendum, when the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, but Greater London, which is its own region (unlike other urban areas in the UK), voted to remain in the EU.

====German-speaking countries====
In Germany there are two cities — Berlin and Hamburg — that are Bundesländer in themselves (thus, they are city-states within a federal system). The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen is also a city-state, comprising two cities: Bremen and Bremerhaven. At the district level, many large and medium-sized cities form their own &quot;district-free cities&quot; (German: &quot;Kreisfreie Städte&quot;).

The city of Vienna is a federal state within the Republic of Austria. As in Germany, many large and medium-sized cities in Austria are separate from the regular districts, instead forming their own &quot;statutory cities&quot; (German: &quot;Statutarstädte&quot;).

One of the cantons of Switzerland, Basel-Stadt, is a city-state.

===North America===
There are no city-states in North America. The District of Columbia in the United States and Distrito Federal in Mexico are federal government districts and not ordinary municipalities. As such, they are subject to the direct authority, respectively, of the U.S. and Mexican federal governments. The residents of Washington, D.C. did not elect their own mayor and city council until 1972, when the United States Congress extended home rule to the city. However, the actions of the mayor and city council must still be approved, at least retroactively, by the Congress, and no legislation passed by the Government of the District of Columbia can take effect until and unless the U.S. Congress approves it.

====Canada====

Urban secession is one of many possible solutions pondered by some Canadian cities as they contemplate their problems. It is one that is considered politically useful because of the strong secessionist movement in Quebec, as well as the weaker secessionist movements in Newfoundland (formerly independent), Alberta and British Columbia.

In Quebec, with a secessionist movement and linguistic dichotomy, the division of a newly independent Quebec has been a strong undercurrent, with some having a &quot;Province of Montreal&quot; remaining in Canada, sometimes containing only the West Island and the &quot;West Shore of Montreal&quot;.

For many decades, the urban communities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver have been configured separately from their respective provinces, for purposes of apportioning Members of Parliament after the national censuses conducted every five years. 

====United States====

Various proposals have been made for New York City to secede from New York State. On a lower level, some states permit or have permitted a city to secede from its county and become a county-equivalent jurisdiction in its own right. Whether the new county-equivalent jurisdiction is considered to be a consolidated city-county like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania or San Francisco, California or an independent city like St. Louis, Missouri is a matter for each such state to decide. In November 2018, the Georgia General Assembly allowed voters in a wealthy enclave of Stockbridge, Georgia to decide if they wanted to secede, which they then declined to do. In Ohio, hundreds of cities and villages have withdrawn from their surrounding townships by forming paper townships.

===Oceania===
The 2007 Royal Commission on Auckland Governance was set up by the New Zealand Government to investigate possible changes to the administration of Auckland. The city was in 2009 named as the country&#x27;s only supercity with the merging of several former councils, and in 2010 the Auckland Region became a unitary authority governed by the Auckland Council. Suggestion has since been made that the region could become an independent city state.

<text>Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. It was recorded with their producer, Nigel Godrich, in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. Departing from their earlier sound, Radiohead incorporated influences from electronic music, krautrock, jazz and 20th-century classical music, with a wider range of instruments and effects. The singer, Thom Yorke, wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random. 

In a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they released short animations and became one of the first major acts to use the internet for promotion. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and &quot;Kid A&quot; was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos. 

&quot;Kid A&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became Radiohead&#x27;s first number-one album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified platinum in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. Its new sound divided listeners, and some dismissed it as pretentious or derivative. However, at the end of the decade, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; ranked it the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Kid A&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. 

Radiohead released a second album of material from the sessions, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, in 2001. In 2021, they released &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, an anniversary reissue compiling &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and previously unreleased material. 

== Background ==
Following the critical and commercial success of their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, the members of Radiohead suffered burnout. The songwriter, Thom Yorke, became ill, describing himself as &quot;a complete fucking mess ... completely unhinged&quot;. He was troubled by new acts he felt were imitating Radiohead and became hostile to the music media. He told &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn&#x27;t handle that.&quot;

Yorke suffered from writer&#x27;s block and could not finish writing songs on guitar. He became disillusioned with the &quot;mythology&quot; of rock music, feeling the genre had &quot;run its course&quot;. He began to listen almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists signed to the record label Warp, such as Aphex Twin and Autechre, and said: &quot;It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I&#x27;d ever felt about guitar music.&quot; He liked the idea of his voice being used as an instrument rather than having a leading role, and wanted to focus on sounds and textures instead of traditional songwriting. Yorke considered changing the band&#x27;s name, saying he did not &quot;want to be answerable to what we&#x27;d done before&quot;.

Yorke bought a house in Cornwall and spent his time walking the cliffs and drawing, restricting his musical activity to playing the grand piano he had recently bought. &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; was the first song he wrote. His lack of knowledge of electronic instruments inspired him, as &quot;everything&#x27;s a novelty ... I didn&#x27;t understand how the fuck they worked. I had no idea what ADSR meant.&quot; The guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien had hoped Radiohead&#x27;s fourth album would comprise short, melodic guitar songs, but Yorke said: &quot;There was no chance of the album sounding like that. I&#x27;d completely had it with melody. I just wanted rhythm. All melodies to me were pure embarrassment.&quot; The bassist, Colin Greenwood, said other guitar bands were trying to do similar things, and so Radiohead had to change and move on.

== Recording ==
 After the success of &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Radiohead bought a barn in Oxfordshire and converted it into a recording studio. Yorke planned to use it as the German band Can had used their studio in Cologne, recording everything they played and then editing it. As the studio would not be complete until late 1999, Radiohead began work in Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris, in January 1999.

Radiohead worked with the &quot;OK Computer&quot; producer Nigel Godrich and had no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control, was still facing writer&#x27;s block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Yorke&#x27;s lack of lyrics created problems, as these had provided points of reference and inspiration for his bandmates in the past.

The group struggled with Yorke&#x27;s new direction. According to Godrich, Yorke did not communicate much, and according to Yorke, Godrich &quot;didn&#x27;t understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else&quot;. The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, feared &quot;awful art-rock nonsense just for its own sake&quot;. His brother, Colin, did not enjoy Yorke&#x27;s Warp influences, finding them &quot;really cold&quot;. The other band members were unsure of how to contribute, and considered leaving. O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;It&#x27;s scary – everyone feels insecure. I&#x27;m a guitarist and suddenly it&#x27;s like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.&quot;

Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin, and used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings. They found it difficult to use electronic instruments collaboratively. According to Yorke, &quot;We had to develop ways of going off into corners and build things on whatever sequencer, synthesiser or piece of machinery we would bring to the equation and then integrate that into the way we would normally work.&quot; O&#x27;Brien began using sustain units on his guitar, which allow notes to be sustained infinitely, combined with looping and delay effects to create synthesiser-like sounds.

In March, Radiohead moved to Medley Studios in Copenhagen for two weeks, which were unproductive. The sessions produced about 50 reels of tape, each containing 15 minutes of music, with nothing finished. In April, Radiohead resumed recording in a mansion in Batsford Park, Gloucestershire. The lack of deadline and the number of incomplete ideas made it hard to focus, and the group held tense meetings. They agreed to disband if they could not agree on an album worth releasing. In July, O&#x27;Brien began keeping an online diary of Radiohead&#x27;s progress. 

Radiohead moved to their new studio in Oxfordshire in September. In November, Radiohead held a live webcast from their studio, featuring a performance of new music and a DJ set. By 2000, six songs were complete. In January, at Godrich&#x27;s suggestion, Radiohead split into two groups: one would generate a sound or sequence without acoustic instruments such as guitars or drums, and the other would develop it. Though the experiment produced no finished songs, it helped convince O&#x27;Brien of the potential of electronic instruments.

On 19 April 2000, Yorke wrote on Radiohead&#x27;s website that they had finished recording. Having completed over 20 songs, Radiohead considered releasing a double album, but felt the material was too dense, and decided that a series of EPs would be a &quot;copout&quot;. Instead, they saved half the songs for their next album, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because &quot;they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places.&quot; He observed that deciding the track list was not just a matter of choosing the best songs, as &quot;you can put all the best songs in the world on a record and they&#x27;ll ruin each other&quot;. He cited the later Beatles albums as examples of effective sequencing: &quot;How in the hell can you have three different versions of &#x27;Revolution&#x27; on the same record and get away with it? I thought about that sort of thing.&quot; Agreeing on the track list created arguments, and O&#x27;Brien said the band came close to breaking up: &quot;That felt like it could go either way, it could break ... But we came in the next day and it was resolved.&quot; The album was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London.

=== Tracks ===
Radiohead worked on the first track, &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot;, in a conventional band arrangement in Copenhagen and Paris, but without results. In Gloucestershire, Yorke and Godrich transferred the song to a Prophet-5 synthesiser, and Yorke&#x27;s vocals were processed in Pro Tools using a scrubbing tool. O&#x27;Brien and the drummer, Philip Selway, said the track helped them accept that not every song needed every band member to play on it. O&#x27;Brien recalled: &quot;To be genuinely sort of delighted that you&#x27;d been working for six months on this record and something great has come out of it, and you haven&#x27;t contributed to it, is a really liberating feeling.&quot; Jonny Greenwood described it as a turning point for the album: &quot;We knew it had to be the first song, and everything just followed after it.&quot;

Yorke wrote an early version of &quot;The National Anthem&quot; when the band was still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it as a B-side for &quot;OK Computer&quot;, but decided to keep it for their next album. For &quot;Kid A&quot;, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sounds sampled from radio stations, and Yorke&#x27;s vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the &quot;organised chaos&quot; of &quot;Town Hall Concert&quot; by the jazz musician Charles Mingus, instructing the musicians to sound like a &quot;traffic jam&quot;.

The strings on &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; were performed by the Orchestra of St John&#x27;s and recorded in Dorchester Abbey, a 12th-century church about five miles from Radiohead&#x27;s Oxfordshire studio. Radiohead chose the orchestra as they had performed pieces by Penderecki and Messiaen. Jonny Greenwood, the only Radiohead member trained in music theory, composed the string arrangement by multitracking his ondes Martenot. According to Godrich, when the orchestra members saw Greenwood&#x27;s score &quot;they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn&#x27;t do what he&#x27;d written, because it was impossible – or impossible for them, anyway&quot;. The orchestra leader, John Lubbock, encouraged them to experiment and work with Greenwood&#x27;s ideas. The concerts director, Alison Atkinson, said the session was more experimental than the orchestra&#x27;s usual bookings.

&quot;Idioteque&quot; was built from a drum machine pattern Greenwood created with a modular synthesiser. It incorporates a sample from the electronic composition &quot;Mild und Leise&quot; by Paul Lansky, taken from &quot;Electronic Music Winners&quot;, a 1976 album of experimental music. Greenwood gave 50 minutes of improvisation to Yorke, who took a short section of it and used it to write the song. Yorke said it was &quot;an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you&#x27;re at the club and the PA&#x27;s so loud, you know it&#x27;s doing damage&quot;.

&quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was written before Radiohead&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Creep&quot; (1992), and Radiohead recorded a version on piano during the &quot;OK Computer&quot; sessions. For &quot;Kid A&quot;, Yorke recorded it on a pedal organ, influenced by the songwriter Tom Waits. Radiohead added harp samples and double bass, attempting to emulate the soundtracks of 1950s Disney films. Radiohead also worked on several songs they did not complete until future albums, including &quot;Nude&quot;, &quot;Burn the Witch&quot; and &quot;True Love Waits&quot;.

== Music ==
=== Style and influences ===
&quot;Kid A&quot; has been described as a work of electronica, experimental rock, post-rock, alternative rock, post-prog, ambient, electronic rock, art rock, and art pop. Though guitar is less prominent than on previous Radiohead albums, guitars were used on most tracks. &quot;Treefingers&quot;, an ambient instrumental, was created by digitally processing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s guitar loops. Many of Yorke&#x27;s vocals were manipulated with effects; for example, his vocals on the title track were simply spoken, then vocoded with the ondes Martenot to create the melody.

&quot;Kid A&quot; incorporates influences from electronic artists on Warp Records, such as the 1990s IDM artists Autechre and Aphex Twin; 1970s Krautrock bands such as Can; the jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis; and abstract hip hop from the Mo&#x27;Wax label, including Blackalicious and DJ Krush. Yorke cited &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980) by Talking Heads as a &quot;massive reference point&quot;. Björk was another major influence, particularly her 1997 album &quot;Homogenic&quot;, as was the Beta Band. Radiohead attended an Underworld concert which helped renew their enthusiasm in a difficult moment.

The string orchestration for &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; was influenced by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Jonny Greenwood&#x27;s use of the ondes Martenot was inspired by Olivier Messiaen, who popularised the instrument and was one of Greenwood&#x27;s teenage heroes. Greenwood described his interest in mixing old and new music technology, and during the recording sessions Yorke read Ian MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, which chronicles the Beatles&#x27; recordings with George Martin during the 1960s. Radiohead also sought to combine electronic manipulations with jam sessions in the studio, saying their model was the German band Can.

=== Lyrics ===
Yorke&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Kid A&quot; are less personal than on earlier albums, and instead incorporate abstract and surreal themes. He cut up phrases and assembled them at random, combining cliches and banal observations; for example, &quot;Morning Bell&quot; features repeated contrasting lines such as &quot;Where&#x27;d you park the car?&quot; and &quot;Cut the kids in half&quot;. Yorke denied that he was &quot;trying to get anything across&quot; with the lyrics, and described them as &quot;like shattered bits of mirror ... like pieces of something broken&quot;. 

Yorke cited David Byrne&#x27;s approach to lyrics on &quot;Remain in Light&quot; as an influence: &quot;When they made that record, they had no real songs, just wrote it all as they went along. Byrne turned up with pages and pages, and just picked stuff up and threw bits in all the time. And that&#x27;s exactly how I approached &quot;Kid A&quot;.&quot; Radiohead used Yorke&#x27;s lyrics &quot;like pieces in a collage ... [creating] an artwork out of a lot of different little things&quot;. The lyrics are not included in the liner notes, as Radiohead felt they could not be considered independently of the music, and Yorke did not want listeners to focus on them.

Yorke wrote &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; about the depression he experienced on the &quot;OK Computer&quot; tour, feeling he could not speak. The refrain of &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; was inspired by R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: &quot;I&#x27;m not here, this isn&#x27;t happening&quot;. The refrain of &quot;Optimistic&quot; (&quot;try the best you can / the best you can is good enough&quot;) was an assurance by Yorke&#x27;s partner, Rachel Owen, when Yorke was frustrated with the band&#x27;s progress. The title &quot;Kid A&quot; came from a filename on one of Yorke&#x27;s sequencers. Yorke said he liked its &quot;non-meaning&quot;, saying: &quot;If you call [an album] something specific, it drives the record in a certain way.&quot;

== Artwork ==

The &quot;Kid A&quot; artwork and packaging was created by Yorke with Stanley Donwood, who has worked with Radiohead since their 1994 EP &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;. Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop. While working on the artwork, Yorke and Donwood became &quot;obsessed&quot; with the Worldwatch Institute website, which was full of &quot;scary statistics about ice caps melting, and weather patterns changing&quot;; this inspired them to use an image of a mountain range as the cover art. Donwood said he saw the mountains as &quot;some sort of cataclysmic power&quot;.

Donwood was inspired by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War depicting a square metre of snow full of the &quot;detritus of war&quot;, such as military equipment and cigarette stains. He said: &quot;I was upset by it in a way war had never upset me before. It felt like it was happening in my street.&quot; The red swimming pool on the album spine and disc was inspired by the 1988 graphic novel &quot;Brought to Light&quot; by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, in which the number of people killed by state terrorism is measured in swimming pools filled with blood. Donwood said this image &quot;haunted&quot; him during the recording of the album, calling it &quot;a symbol of looming danger and shattered expectations&quot;. Yorke and Donwood cited a Paris exhibition of paintings by David Hockney as another influence.

Yorke and Donwood made many versions of the album cover, with different pictures and different titles in different typefaces. Unable to pick one, they taped them to cupboards of the studio kitchen and went to bed. According to Donwood, the choice the next day &quot;was obvious&quot;. In October 2021, Yorke and Donwood curated an exhibition of &quot;Kid A&quot; artwork at Christie&#x27;s headquarters in London.

== Promotion ==

Radiohead minimised their involvement in promotion for &quot;Kid A&quot;, conducting few interviews or photoshoots. Though &quot;Optimistic&quot; and promotional copies of other tracks received radio play, Radiohead released no singles from the album. Yorke said this was to avoid the stress of publicity, which he had struggled with on &quot;OK Computer&quot;, rather than for artistic reasons. He later said he regretted the decision, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics. 

Radiohead were careful to present &quot;Kid A&quot; as a cohesive work rather than a series of separate tracks. Rather than give EMI executives their own copies, they had them listen to the album in its entirety on a bus from Hollywood to Malibu. Rob Gordon, the vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, the American subsidiary of Radiohead&#x27;s label EMI, praised the album but said promoting it would be a &quot;business challenge&quot;. 

No advance copies of &quot;Kid A&quot; were circulated, but it was played under controlled conditions for critics and fans. On September 5, 2000, it was played for the public for the first time at the IMAX theatre in Lincoln Square, Manhattan. Promotional copies of &quot;Kid A&quot; came with stickers prohibiting broadcast before September 19. At midnight, it was played in its entirety by the London radio station Xfm. MTV2, KROQ, and WXRK also played the album.

Rather than agree to a standard magazine photoshoot for &quot;Q&quot;, Radiohead supplied digitally altered portraits, with their skin smoothed, their irises recoloured, and Yorke&#x27;s drooping eyelid removed. The &quot;Q&quot; editor Andrew Harrison described the images as &quot;aggressively weird to the point of taking the piss ... All five of Radiohead had been given the aspect of gawking aliens.&quot; Yorke said: &quot;I&#x27;d like to see them try to put these pictures on a poster.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; projected the images onto the Houses of Parliament, placed them on posters and billboards in the London Underground and on the Old Street Roundabout, and had them printed on key rings, mugs and mouse mats, to &quot;turn Radiohead back into a product&quot;.

=== Videos ===
Instead of releasing traditional music videos for &quot;Kid A&quot;, Radiohead commissioned dozens of 10-second videos featuring Donwood artwork they called &quot;blips&quot;, which were aired on music channels and distributed online. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described them as &quot;context-free animated nightmares that radiated mystery&quot;, with &quot;arch hints of surveillance&quot;. Five of the videos were serviced as exclusives to MTV, and &quot;helped play into the arty mystique that endeared Radiohead to its core audience&quot;, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. Much of the promotional material featured pointy-toothed bear characters created by Donwood. The bears originated in stories Donwood made for his young children about teddy bears who came to life and ate the &quot;grown-ups&quot; who had abandoned them.

=== Internet ===
Though Radiohead had experimented with internet promotion for &quot;OK Computer&quot; in 1997, by 2000 online music promotion was not widespread, with record labels still reliant on MTV and radio. Donwood wrote that EMI was not interested in the Radiohead website, and left him and the band to update it with &quot;discursive and random content&quot;.

To promote &quot;Kid A&quot;, Capitol created the &quot;iBlip&quot;, a Java applet that could be embedded in fan sites. It allowed users to stream the album, and included artwork, photos and links to order &quot;Kid A&quot; on Amazon. It was used by more than 1000 sites, and the album was streamed more than 400,000 times. Capitol also streamed &quot;Kid A&quot; through Amazon, MTV.com and heavy.com, and ran a campaign with the peer-to-peer filesharing service Aimster, allowing users to swap iBlips and Radiohead-branded Aimster skins.

Three weeks before release, &quot;Kid A&quot; was leaked online and shared on the peer-to-peer service Napster. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, the Capitol president, Ray Lott, likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible. If I worried about what Napster would do, I wouldn&#x27;t sell as many albums.&quot; Yorke said Napster &quot;encourages enthusiasm for music in a way that the music industry has long forgotten to do&quot;. 

The commercial success of &quot;Kid A&quot; suggested that leaks might not be as damaging as many had assumed. The music journalist Brent DiCrescenzo argued that the Napster leak profoundly affected the way &quot;Kid A&quot; was received, surprising listeners who would patiently download new tracks to find they comprised &quot;four minutes of ambient noise&quot;.

=== Tour ===
Radiohead rearranged the &quot;Kid A&quot; songs to perform them live. O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t do &quot;Kid A&quot; live and be true to the record. You would have to do it like an art installation ... When we played live, we put the human element back into it.&quot; Selway said they &quot;found some new life&quot; in the songs when they came to perform them. Yorke said: &quot;Even with electronics, there is an element of spontaneous performance in using them ... It was the tension between what&#x27;s human and what&#x27;s coming from the machines. That was stuff we were getting into, as we learned how to play the songs from &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; live.&quot;

In mid-2000, months before &quot;Kid A&quot; was released, Radiohead toured the Mediterranean, performing &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; songs for the first time. Fans shared concert bootlegs online. Colin Greenwood said: &quot;We played in Barcelona and the next day the entire performance was up on Napster. Three weeks later when we got to play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful.&quot; Later that year, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos, playing mostly new songs. The tour included a homecoming show in South Park, Oxford, with supporting performances by Humphrey Lyttelton (who performed on &quot;Amnesiac&quot;), Beck and Sigur Rós. According to the journalist Alex Ross, the show may have been the largest public gathering in Oxford history.

Radiohead also performed three concerts in North American theatres, their first in nearly three years. The small venues sold out rapidly, attracting celebrities, and fans camped overnight. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the &quot;Kid A&quot; tour as &quot;a revelation&quot; that &quot;exposed rock and roll humanity&quot; in the songs. In October, Radiohead performed on the American TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The performance shocked viewers expecting rock songs, with Jonny Greenwood playing electronic instruments, the house brass band improvising over &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, and Yorke dancing erratically to &quot;Idioteque&quot;. In November 2001, Radiohead released &quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot;, comprising performances from the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tours.

== Sales ==
&quot;Kid A&quot; reached number one on Amazon&#x27;s sales chart, with more than 10,000 pre-orders. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 55,000 copies in its first day – the biggest first-day sales of the year and more than every other album in the top ten combined. &quot;Kid A&quot; also debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, selling more than 207,000 copies in its first week. It was Radiohead&#x27;s first US top-20 album, and the first US number one in three years for any British act. &quot;Kid A&quot; also debuted at number one in Canada, where it sold more than 44,000 copies in its first week, and in France, Ireland and New Zealand. European sales slowed on 2 October 2000, the day of release, when EMI recalled 150,000 faulty CDs. By June 2001, &quot;Kid A&quot; had sold 310,000 copies in the UK, less than a third of &quot;OK Computer&quot; sales. It is certified platinum in the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the US.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Kid A&quot; was widely anticipated. &quot;Spin&quot; described it as the most anticipated rock record since the 1993 Nirvana album &quot;In Utero&quot;. According to Andrew Harrison, the editor of &quot;Q&quot;, journalists expected it to provide more of the &quot;rousing, cathartic, lots-of-guitar, Saturday-night-at-Glastonbury big future rock moments&quot; of &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Months before its release, Pat Blashill of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote: &quot;If there&#x27;s one band that promises to return rock to us, it&#x27;s Radiohead.&quot;

After &quot;Kid A&quot; had been played for critics, many bemoaned the lack of guitar, the obscured vocals and the unconventional song structures. Some called it &quot;a commercial suicide note&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of the &quot;muted electronic hums, pulses and tones&quot;, predicting that it would confuse listeners. In &quot;Mojo&quot;, Jim Irvin wrote that &quot;upon first listen, &quot;Kid A&quot; is just awful ... Too often it sounds like the fragments that they began the writing process with – a loop, a riff, a mumbled line of text, have been set in concrete and had other, lesser ideas piled on top.&quot; The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Adam Sweeting wrote that &quot;even listeners raised on krautrock or Ornette Coleman will find &quot;Kid A&quot; a mystifying experience&quot;, and that it pandered to &quot;the worst cliches&quot; about Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;relentless miserabilism&quot;. Several critics found the free jazz of &quot;The National Anthem&quot; discordant and unpleasant.

Several critics felt &quot;Kid A&quot; was pretentious or deliberately obscure. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as &quot;deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about &quot;Kid A&quot; is the very real challenge to your attention span.&quot; In the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, the novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was &quot;morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original&quot;. The &quot;Melody Maker&quot; critic Mark Beaumont called it &quot;tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ... About 60 songs were started that no one had a bloody clue how to finish.&quot; Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;self-consciously awkward and bloody-minded, the noise made by a band trying so hard to make a &#x27;difficult&#x27; album that they felt it beneath them to write any songs&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published a piece mocking &quot;Kid A&quot; as humourless, derivative and lacking in songs: &quot;Because it was decided that Radiohead were Important and Significant last time around, no one can accept the album as the crackpot art project it so obviously is.&quot; 

Some critics felt &quot;Kid A&quot; was unoriginal. In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Howard Hampton dismissed Radiohead as a &quot;rock composite&quot; and wrote that &quot;Kid A&quot; &quot;recycles Pink Floyd&#x27;s dark-side-of-the-moon solipsism to Me-Decade perfection&quot;. Beaumont said Radiohead were &quot;simply ploughing furrows dug by DJ Shadow and Brian Eno before them&quot;. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; felt the ambient elements were inferior to Eno&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Music For Airports&quot; and its &quot;scary&quot; elements inferior to Scott Walker&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Tilt&quot;. &quot;Select&quot; wrote: &quot;What do they want for sounding like the Aphex Twin circa 1993, a medal?&quot; In an &quot;NME&quot; editorial, James Oldham wrote that the electronic influences were &quot;mired in compromise&quot;, with Radiohead still operating as a rock band, and concluded: &quot;Time will judge it. But right now, &quot;Kid A&quot; has the ring of a lengthy, over-analysed mistake.&quot; The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Rob Sheffield wrote that the &quot;mastery of Warp-style electronic effects&quot; had appeared &quot;clumsy and dated&quot;. Rob Mitchell, the co-founder of Warp, felt &quot;Kid A&quot; represented &quot;an honest interpretation of [Warp] influences&quot; and was not &quot;gratuitously&quot; electronic. He predicted it might one day be seen in the same way as David Bowie&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Low&quot;, which alienated some Bowie fans but was later acclaimed.

AllMusic gave &quot;Kid A&quot; a favourable review, but wrote that it &quot;never is as visionary or stunning as &quot;OK Computer&quot;, nor does it really repay the intensive time it demands in order for it to sink in&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; was also positive, but described some songs as &quot;meandering&quot; and &quot;anticlimactic&quot;, and concluded: &quot;For all its feats of brinkmanship, the patently magnificent construct called &quot;Kid A&quot; betrays a band playing one-handed just to prove they can, scared to commit itself emotionally.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke called &quot;Kid A&quot; &quot;a work of deliberately inky, often irritating obsession ... But this &quot;is&quot; pop, a music of ornery, glistening guile and honest ache, and it will feel good under your skin once you let it get there.&quot;

&quot;Spin&quot; said &quot;Kid A&quot; was &quot;not the act of career suicide or feat of self-indulgence it will be castigated as&quot;, and predicted that fans would recognise it as Radiohead&#x27;s best and &quot;bravest&quot; album. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;an ocean of unparalleled musical depth&quot; and &quot;the first truly groundbreaking album of the 21st century&quot;. The critic Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;Kid A&quot; was &quot;an imaginative, imitative variation on a pop staple: sadness made pretty&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;oblique oblique oblique ... Also incredibly beautiful.&quot; Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Kid A&quot; a perfect score, calling it &quot;cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike&quot;. He concluded that Radiohead &quot;must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who&quot;. One of the first &quot;Kid A&quot; reviews published online, it helped popularise &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and became notorious for its &quot;obtuse&quot; writing.

Yorke said Radiohead had not attempted to alienate or confound, but that their musical interests had changed. Jonny Greenwood argued that the tracks were short and melodic, and suggested that &quot;people basically want their hands held through 12 &#x27;Mull Of Kintyre&#x27;s&quot;. Yorke recalled that Radiohead had been &quot;white as a sheet&quot; before early performances on the &quot;Kid A&quot; tour, thinking they had been &quot;absolutely trashed&quot;. At the same time, the reaction motivated them: &quot;There was a sense of a fight to convince people, which was actually really exciting.&quot; He said Radiohead felt &quot;incredibly vindicated and happy&quot; after &quot;Kid A&quot; reached number one in the US.

At Metacritic, which aggregates ratings from critics, &quot;Kid A&quot; has a score of 80 based on 24 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. It was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums by publications including the &quot;Wire&quot;, &quot;Record Collector&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. At the 2001 Grammy Awards, &quot;Kid A&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year and won for Best Alternative Album.

== Legacy ==
In the years following its release, &quot;Kid A&quot; attracted acclaim. In 2005, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it had &quot;challenged and confounded&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s audience, and subsequently &quot;transformed into an intellectual symbol of sorts ... Owning it became &#x27;getting it&#x27;; getting it became &#x27;anointing it&#x27;.&quot; In 2015, Sheffield likened Radiohead&#x27;s change in style to Bob Dylan&#x27;s controversial move to rock music, writing that critics now hesitated to say they had disliked it at the time. He described &quot;Kid A&quot; as the &quot;defining moment in the Radiohead legend&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; argued that &quot;Kid A&quot; was the first album since Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; to have moved &quot;rock and electronic music forward in such a mature fashion&quot;. In an article for &quot;Kid A&#x27;s&quot; 20th anniversary, the &quot;Quietus&quot; suggested that the negative reviews had been motivated by rockism, the tendency to venerate rock music over other genres.

In a 2011 &quot;Guardian&quot; article about his negative &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review, Beaumont wrote that though his opinion had not changed, &quot;&quot;Kid A&quot; status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then very much in the minority ... People whose opinions I trust claim it to be their favourite album ever.&quot; In 2014, Brice Ezell of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that &quot;Kid A&quot; is &quot;more fun to think and write about than it is to actually listen to&quot; and a &quot;far less compelling representation of the band&#x27;s talents than &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;&quot;. In 2016, Dorian Lynskey wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;At times, &quot;Kid A&quot; is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they&#x27;d merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty &quot;Amnesiac&quot; ... Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can only guess at what he was worrying about.&quot;

&quot;Grantland&quot; credited &quot;Kid A&quot; for pioneering the use of internet to stream and promote music, writing: &quot;For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, &quot;Kid A&quot; was the first album experienced primarily via the internet – it&#x27;s where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece ... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and move on to the next big record by the official release date. In that way, &quot;Kid A&quot; invented modern music culture as we know it.&quot; In his 2005 book &quot;Killing Yourself to Live&quot;, the critic Chuck Klosterman interpreted &quot;Kid A&quot; as a prediction of the September 11 attacks. Speaking at Radiohead&#x27;s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019, David Byrne of Talking Heads, one of Radiohead&#x27;s formative influences, said: &quot;What was really weird and very encouraging was that [&quot;Kid A&quot;] was popular. It was a hit! It proved to me that the artistic risk paid off and music fans sometimes are not stupid.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that the success of the &quot;challenging&quot; &quot;Kid A&quot; established Radiohead as &quot;heavy hitters in the business for the long run&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Kid A&quot; number 20 on its updated &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, describing it as &quot;a new, uniquely fearless kind of rock record for a new, increasingly fearful century ... [It] remains one of the more stunning sonic makeovers in music history.&quot; In previous versions of the list, &quot;Kid A&quot; ranked at number 67 (2012) and number 428 (2003). In 2005, &quot;Stylus&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Kid A&quot; the best album of the previous five years, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; calling it &quot;the perfect record for its time: ominous, surreal, and impossibly millennial&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Kid A &quot;one of the 100 best albums, calling it &quot;the opposite of easy listening, and the weirdest album to ever sell a million copies, but ... also a testament to just how complicated pop music can be&quot;. At the end of the decade, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; ranked &quot;Kid A&quot; the greatest album of the 2000s. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it second best, calling it &quot;a jittery premonition of the troubled, disconnected, overloaded decade to come. The sound of today, in other words, a decade early.&quot; In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; readers voted &quot;Kid A&quot; the greatest album of the previous 25 years. In 2025, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the second-greatest album of the century so far, writing that it &quot;foresaw a darker 21st century, one marked by fear, loneliness, dislocation, and technological advancements that only divide us further ... And 25 years later, there&#x27;s near-universal sentiment that &quot;Kid A&quot; is not only a towering achievement by the greatest band of its time, but also a warning call that went completely unheeded.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; the 24th-best song of the 2000s, describing it as &quot;oddness at its most hummable&quot;. &quot;Idioteque&quot; was named one of the best songs of the decade by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it #33 on its 2018 list of the &quot;greatest songs of the century so far&quot;.


=== Later releases ===
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. After a period of being out of print on vinyl, &quot;Kid A&quot; was reissued as a double LP on 19 August 2008 as part of the &quot;From the Capitol Vaults&quot; series, along with other Radiohead albums. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including &quot;Kid A.&quot; On 25 August 2009, EMI reissued &quot;Kid A&quot; in a two-CD &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and a &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; containing an additional DVD. Both versions feature live tracks, taken mostly from television performances. Radiohead had no input into the reissues and the music was not remastered. 

The EMI reissues were discontinued after Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue transferred to XL Recordings in 2016. In May 2016, XL reissued &quot;Kid A&quot; on vinyl, along with the rest of Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue. An early demo of &quot;The National Anthem&quot; was included in the special edition of the 2017 &quot;OK Computer&quot; reissue &quot;OKNOTOK 1997 2017&quot;. In February 2020, Radiohead released an extended version of &quot;Treefingers&quot;, previously released on the soundtrack for the 2000 film &quot;Memento&quot;, to digital platforms.

On November 5, 2021, Radiohead released &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, an anniversary reissue compiling &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. It includes a third album, &quot;Kid Amnesiae&quot;, comprising previously unreleased material from the sessions. Radiohead promoted the reissue with singles for the previously unreleased tracks &quot;If You Say the Word&quot; and &quot;Follow Me Around&quot;. &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot;, an interactive experience with music and artwork from the albums, was released on November 18 for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.

<doc id="170771" wikidata="Q223650" url="?curid=170771" title="Amnesiac (album)">
<text>Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 30 May 2001 by EMI. It was recorded with the producer Nigel Godrich in the same sessions as Radiohead&#x27;s previous album &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000). Radiohead split the work in two as they felt it was too dense for a double album. As with &quot;Kid A, Amnesiac&quot; incorporates influences from electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock. The final track, &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, is a collaboration with the jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band.

After having released no singles for &quot;Kid A&quot;, Radiohead promoted &quot;Amnesiac&quot; with the singles &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot;, accompanied by music videos. Videos were also made for &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;, as well as &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, which was released as a promotional single. In June 2001, Radiohead began the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tour, incorporating their first North American tour in three years.

&quot;Amnesiac&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By October 2008, it had sold over 900,000 copies worldwide. It is certified platinum in the UK, the US and Canada, and gold in Japan. It received positive reviews, though some critics felt it was too experimental or less cohesive than &quot;Kid A&quot;, or saw it as a collection of &quot;Kid A&quot; outtakes. 

&quot;Amnesiac&quot; was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums by numerous publications. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize and several Grammy Awards, winning for Best Recording Package for the special edition. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; was named one of the best tracks of the decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Amnesiac&quot; number 320 in their 2012 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, an anniversary reissue compiling &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021.

==Recording==

Radiohead and their producer, Nigel Godrich, recorded &quot;Amnesiac&quot; during the same sessions as their previous album, &quot;Kid A&quot;, released in October 2000. The sessions took place from January 1999 to mid-2000 in Guillaume Studios in Paris, Medley Studios in Copenhagen, and Radiohead&#x27;s newly built studio in Oxfordshire. The drummer, Philip Selway, said the sessions had &quot;two frames of mind ... a tension between our old approach of all being in a room playing together and the other extreme of manufacturing music in the studio. I think &quot;Amnesiac&quot; comes out stronger in the band-arrangement way.&quot;

The sessions drew influence from electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock, using synthesisers, ondes Martenot, drum machines, strings and brass. The strings, arranged by the guitarist Jonny Greenwood, were performed by the Orchestra of St John&#x27;s and recorded in Dorchester Abbey, a 12th-century church close to Radiohead&#x27;s studio.

Radiohead considered releasing the work as a double album, but felt it was too dense. The singer, Thom Yorke, said Radiohead split it into two albums because &quot;they cancel each other out as overall finished things&quot; and came from &quot;two different places&quot;. He felt &quot;Amnesiac&quot; offered a &quot;different take&quot; on &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;a form of explanation&quot;. The band members stressed that they saw &quot;Amnesiac&quot; not as a collection of &quot;Kid A&quot; B-sides or outtakes but an album in its own right. Yorke said the title was inspired by a Gnostic belief that the trauma of birth erases memories of past lives, an idea he found fascinating.

=== Tracks ===
&quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; began as an attempt to record another song, &quot;True Love Waits&quot;. It features keyboard loops recorded during the &quot;OK Computer&quot; sessions; Radiohead disabled the erase heads on the tape recorders so that the tape repeatedly recorded over itself, creating a &quot;ghostly&quot; tape loop, and manipulated the results in Pro Tools. Deciding that the arrangement did not fit &quot;True Love Waits&quot;, Radiohead used it to create a new track. Yorke added a spoken vocal and used the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune to process it into melody. According to Yorke, Auto-Tune &quot;desperately tries to search for the music in your speech, and produces notes at random. If you&#x27;ve assigned it a key, you&#x27;ve got music.&quot; The &quot;True Love Waits&quot; version of &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; was eventually released on the 2021 compilation &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;. 

Radiohead also used Auto-Tune on &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot; to process Yorke&#x27;s vocals and create a &quot;nasal, depersonalised&quot; sound. For &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot;, Radiohead attempted to capture the &quot;soft, warm, proto-doowop sound&quot; of the 1940s harmony group the Ink Spots. They muffled microphones with egg boxes and used the ondes Martenot&#x27;s resonating &quot;palme diffuseur&quot; loudspeaker to treat the vocals. Unlike many tracks from the sessions, the band recorded it live. The guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;We rehearsed it a bit, not too much, then just went in and did it. It&#x27;s just us doing our thing as a band.&quot;

According to a diary kept by O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Knives Out&quot; took over a year to complete, as Radiohead had been tempted to over-embellish it. It was influenced by the guitar work of Johnny Marr of the Smiths. Yorke said &quot;Knives Out&quot; did not depart from Radiohead&#x27;s earlier style, and &quot;survived because it was too good to miss&quot;. &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; was edited down from an eleven-minute jam, inspired by the krautrock band Can, who would record extensively and then edit their recordings.

&quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; was the result of an attempt to record another song, &quot;I Will&quot;, on synthesiser. Dismissing this recording as &quot;dodgy Kraftwerk&quot;, Radiohead reversed it and created a new song. Yorke said: &quot;I was in another room, heard the vocal melody coming backwards, and thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s miles better than the right way round&#x27;, then spent the rest of the night trying to learn the melody.&quot; Radiohead recorded &quot;I Will&quot; in a new arrangement for their next album, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; (2003).

For the final track, &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, Jonny Greenwood wrote to the jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton, explaining that Radiohead were &quot;a bit stuck&quot;. Lyttelton agreed to perform on the song with his band after his daughter showed him Radiohead&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;. According to Lyttelton, Radiohead &quot;didn&#x27;t want it to sound like a slick studio production but a slightly exploratory thing of people playing as if they didn&#x27;t have it all planned out in advance&quot;. The recording session lasted seven hours, and left Lyttelton exhausted. &quot;I detected some sort of eye-rolling at the start of the session, as if to say we were miles apart,&quot; he said. &quot;They went through quite a few nervous breakdowns during the course of it all, just through trying to explain to us all what they wanted.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Amnesiac&quot; was described upon release as experimental rock, electronica and alternative rock, with elements of jazz; Simon Reynolds described the overall album as &quot;sound[ing] very post-rock&quot;, in a similar fashion to &quot;Kid A&quot;. Colin Greenwood said it contained &quot;traditional Radiohead-type songs&quot; alongside more experimental work, and noted that in both albums, &quot;the guitar becomes one more texture, difficult to separate from other textures&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; contrasted it with &quot;the surgical glint&quot; of &quot;Kid A&quot;, with &quot;swampy and foggy&quot; arrangements and &quot;uneasy&quot; chords and rhythms.

The first track, &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot;, is an electronic song with synthesisers and metallic percussion. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, a swung ballad with piano and strings, was inspired by the Charles Mingus song &quot;Freedom&quot;. Its lyrics were inspired by an exhibition of ancient Egyptian underworld art Yorke attended while the band was recording in Copenhagen and ideas of cyclical time discussed by Stephen Hawking and Buddhism. &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is an abrasive electronic track.

Yorke said &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; was &quot;about someone who is elected into power by people and who then blatantly betrays them – just like Blair did&quot;. The song builds slowly on piano, before reaching a climax in the final minute. According to O&#x27;Brien, &quot;In the Radiohead of old, on &quot;OK Computer&quot;, that break would have lasted four minutes. We would have carried on &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27;-style.&quot;

&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; combines a &quot;venomous&quot; guitar riff with a &quot;trance-like metallic beat&quot;. Colin Greenwood&#x27;s bassline was inspired by the Chic bassist Bernard Edwards. The lyrics were influenced by advice given to Yorke by his partner, Rachel Owen: &quot;Be proud of what you&#x27;ve done. Don&#x27;t look back and just carry on like nothing&#x27;s happened. Just let the bad stuff go.&quot; &quot;Knives Out&quot;, described as the album&#x27;s most conventional song, features &quot;drifting&quot; guitar lines, &quot;driving&quot; percussion, a &quot;wandering&quot; bassline, &quot;haunting&quot; vocals and &quot;eerie&quot; lyrics.

&quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; is an alternative version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot; from &quot;Kid A&quot;; &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described it as a blend of &quot;cosiness and nausea&quot;. O&#x27;Brien said that Radiohead often record and abandon different versions of songs, but that this version was &quot;strong enough to bear hearing again&quot;. Yorke wrote that it was included &quot;because it came from such a different place ... Because we only found it again by accident after having forgotten about it. Because it sounds like a recurring dream.&quot; He said the lyrics for &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; were &quot;gibberish&quot;, but were inspired by the notion that &quot;people are basically just pixels on a screen, unknowingly serving this higher power which is manipulative and destructive&quot;.

&quot;Hunting Bears&quot; is a short instrumental on electric guitar and synthesiser. &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot; features the Humphrey Lyttelton Band playing in the style of a New Orleans jazz funeral. According to Lyttelton, the song starts with &quot;ad-libbed, bluesy, minor-key meandering, then it gradually gets so that we&#x27;re sort of playing real wild, primitive, New Orleans blues stuff&quot;. The lyrics were inspired by a news story Yorke read of a celebrity&#x27;s wife so harassed by paparazzi that she papered her windows with their photographs.

==Artwork and packaging==
The &quot;Amnesiac&quot; artwork was created by Yorke and the longtime Radiohead collaborator Stanley Donwood. For inspiration, Donwood explored London taking notes, likening the city to the labyrinth of Greek mythology. He scanned blank pages of old books and superimposed onto them photos of fireworks and Tokyo tower blocks, copies of Piranesi&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary&quot; &quot;Prisons&quot; drawings, and lyrics and phrases printed by Yorke on a broken typewriter.

The cover depicts a book cover with a weeping minotaur. The minotaur, a motif of the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; artwork, represents the &quot;maze&quot; Yorke felt he had become lost in during his depression after &quot;OK Computer;&quot; Donwood described it as a &quot;tragic figure&quot;. Figures included in the album booklet include faceless terrorists, self-serving politicians and corporate executives. Yorke said they represented &quot;the abstracted, semi-comical, stupidly dark, false voices that battled us as we tried to work&quot;.

For the special edition, Donwood designed a package with a hardback CD case in the style of a mislaid library book. He imagined that &quot;someone made these pages in a book and it went into drawer in a desk and was forgotten about in the attic ... And visually and musically the album is about finding the book and opening the pages.&quot; The special edition won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package at the 44th Grammy Awards.

== Release ==
Radiohead announced &quot;Amnesiac&quot; on their website in January 2001, three months after the release of &quot;Kid A&quot;. It was released in Japan on 30 May by EMI, in the UK on 4 June by Parlophone and in the US on 5 June by Capitol, both subsidiaries of EMI. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it debuted at number two, with sales of 231,000, surpassing the 207,000 first-week sales of &quot;Kid A&quot;. It is certified gold in Japan for shipments of 100,000 copies. By October 2008, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; had sold more than 900,000 copies worldwide. In July 2013, it was certified platinum in the UK for sales of more than 300,000.

== Promotion ==
Radiohead released no singles from &quot;Kid A&quot;, as Yorke wanted to avoid the stress of publicity he had struggled with on &quot;OK Computer&quot;. He regretted the choice, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics, and said &quot;Amnesiac&quot; would have more promotion. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; was released as a single in May, followed by &quot;Knives Out&quot; in July, backed by music videos. Two videos were created for &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, which was released as a radio-only single in June.

Radiohead reworked &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; for a computer-animated video directed by Johnny Hardstaff. The video premiered on November 29, 2001, at an animation festival at the Centre For Contemporary Arts, Glasgow. It features imagery of killer whales swimming under UV light, a machine taking shape and conjoined babies spinning in a centrifuge. The video received little airplay from MTV, who felt it was &quot;of a sensitive nature&quot; and would only broadcast it with a warning. Hardstaff said: &quot;The irony is that you can&#x27;t move on MTV for bland R&amp;B and the empty boasts of &#x27;artists&#x27; effectively fixated with their own flaccid showbiz cocks, but any piece of film with an ounce of real emotion isn&#x27;t going to get seen.&quot;

=== Tour ===

Radiohead first performed &quot;Amnesiac&quot; songs on the &quot;Kid A&quot; tour, which began in June 2000. For live performance, they rearranged the electronic tracks using rock instrumentation. For example, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; was rearranged as a piano ballad. Yorke said: &quot;Even with electronics, there is an element of spontaneous performance in using them ... It was the tension between what&#x27;s human and what&#x27;s coming from the machines. That was stuff we were getting into, as we learned how to play the songs from &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; live.&quot; 

On 10 June 2001, Radiohead recorded a concert for a special hour-long episode of the BBC show &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, including a performance of &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot; with the Humphrey Lyttelton Band. The &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tour began on 18 June 2001, with Radiohead&#x27;s first North American tour in three years. It comprised performances in west coast amphitheatres in June, followed by performances in the east and midwest in August. The openers were the Beta Band and Kid Koala. Capitol avoided traditional promotion for the tour and instead disseminated information to Radiohead&#x27;s large online fanbase. Tickets sold out within minutes. &quot;The Observer&quot; described this as &quot;the most sweeping conquest of America by a British group&quot; since Beatlemania, succeeding where bands such as Oasis had failed.

Radiohead hoped to tour the US using a custom-built tent as they had for the &quot;Kid A&quot; tour in Europe, but met opposition from Clear Channel Entertainment and Ticketmaster, which Yorke said had a monopoly on American live music. Radiohead considered abandoning touring in the US, but felt this would have been a defeat. They instead chose unusual venues, such as Grant Park in Chicago and the bank of the Hudson River in New York. The German DJ Christoph de Babalon supported them in Europe. Recordings from the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tours were released on &quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot; in November 2001.

==Reception==
After Radiohead&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Kid A&quot;, had divided listeners, many hoped &quot;Amnesiac&quot; would return to their earlier rock sound. The &quot;Guardian&quot; titled its review &quot;Relax: it&#x27;s nothing like &quot;Kid A&quot;&quot;. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; saw &quot;Amnesiac&quot; as a further distancing from Radiohead&#x27;s earlier style, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; found that it was nothing like their 1995 album &quot;The Bends&quot;. &quot;Stylus&quot; wrote that although &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was &quot;&quot;slightly&quot; more straightforward&quot; than &quot;Kid A&quot;, it &quot;solidified the postmillennial model of Radiohead: less songs and more atmosphere, more eclectic and electronic, more paranoid, more threatening, more sublime&quot;. Yorke felt &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was no more accessible than &quot;Kid A&quot; and would have elicited the same reactions had it been released first. In 2020, the &quot;Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;the impenetrable &quot;Amnesiac&quot; debunked industry rumours that Radiohead were primed for a bankable comeback&quot;.

On the review aggregate site Metacritic, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; has a rating of 75 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, compared to &quot;Kid A&quot;, was &quot;a richer, more engaging record, its austerity and troubled vision enriched by a rousing of the human spirit&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis, who had disliked &quot;Kid A&quot;, felt that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; returned Radiohead to &quot;their role as the world&#x27;s most intriguing and innovative major rock band ... [It] strikes a cunning and rewarding balance between experimentation and quality control. It&#x27;s hardly easy to digest but nor is it impossible to swallow.&quot; He criticised the electronic tracks &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; as self-indulgent, but praised the album&#x27;s &quot;haunting musical shifts and unconventional melodies&quot;. The &quot;Guardian&quot; named it &quot;CD of the week&quot;. &quot;Stylus&quot; wrote that it was &quot;an excellent disc&quot;, but was not as &quot;exploratory or interesting&quot; as &quot;Kid A&quot;.

Some dismissed &quot;Amnesiac&quot; as a collection of &quot;Kid A&quot; outtakes. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; founder, Ryan Schreiber, wrote that its &quot;questionable sequencing ... does little to hush the argument that the record is merely a thinly veiled B-sides compilation&quot;. Another &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer, Scott Plagenhoef, felt the sequencing worked by creating tension, heightening the power of the more experimental tracks. However, he felt the more conventional marketing created a sense of &quot;ordinariness&quot; compared to &quot;Kid A&quot; and the impression that Radiohead had bowed to pressure from their record label.

Some critics felt &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was less cohesive than &quot;Kid A&quot;. The AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it &quot;often plays as a hodgepodge&quot;, and that both albums &quot;clearly derive from the same source and have the same flaws ... The division only makes the two records seem unfocused, even if the best of both records is quite stunning.&quot; Another AllMusic critic, Sam Samuelson, said &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was a &quot;thrown-together&quot; release that might have been better packaged with the live album &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; as a &quot;complete &quot;Kid A&quot; sessions package&quot;. Schreiber, however, felt the &quot;highlights were undeniably worth the wait, and easily overcome its occasional patchiness&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Reviewing the 2009 reissue of &quot;Amnesiac&quot; for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Plagenhoef wrote: &quot;More than &quot;Kid A&quot; – and maybe more than any other LP of its time – &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is the kickoff of a messy, rewarding era ... disconnected, self-aware, tense, eclectic, head-turning – an overload of good ideas inhibited by rules, restrictions, and conventional wisdom.&quot; Writing about &quot;Amnesiac&quot; for its 20th anniversary in 2021, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that it might be Radiohead&#x27;s best work: &quot;Listening to it 20 years after its release, the album&#x27;s grumpy wisdom — its dignity in the face of dread — feels more moving than ever.&quot; In 2024, &quot;Consequence&quot; wrote that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was less universal than &quot;OK Computer&quot; and less focused and cohesive than &quot;Kid A&quot;, but was a &quot;rosetta stone for understanding Radiohead as a whole&quot;, with its combination of ballads, rock, electronica and strings.

===Accolades===
&quot;Amnesiac&quot; was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Music Prize, losing to PJ Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot;, for which Yorke provided guest vocals. It was the fourth consecutive Radiohead album nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and the special edition won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package at the 44th Grammy Awards.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Kludge&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Press&quot; named &quot;Amnesiac&quot; one of the best albums of 2001. In 2005, &quot;Stylus&quot; named it the best album of the preceding five years. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Amnesiac&quot; the 34th-best album of the 2000s and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the 25th. It is included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and number 320 in the 2012 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; was ranked among the best tracks of the decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

==Reissues==
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. After a period of being out of print on vinyl, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was reissued as a double LP on 19 August 2008 as part of the &quot;From the Capitol Vaults&quot; series, along with other Radiohead albums. 

On 25 August, EMI reissued &quot;Amnesiac&quot; in a two-CD &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and a &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; containing an additional DVD. The first CD contains the original studio album; the second CD collects B-sides from &quot;Amnesiac&quot; singles and live performances; the DVD contains music videos and a live television performance. Radiohead had no input into the reissues and the music was not remastered. The EMI reissues were discontinued after Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue was transferred to XL Recordings in 2016. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl, including &quot;Amnesiac&quot;.

An early demo of &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, performed by Yorke on acoustic guitar, was released on the 2019 compilation &quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot;. On November 5, 2021, Radiohead released &quot;Kid A Mnesia&quot;, an anniversary reissue compiling &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. It includes a third album, &quot;Kid Amnesiae&quot;, comprising previously unreleased material from the sessions. Radiohead promoted the reissue with two digital singles, the previously unreleased tracks &quot;If You Say the Word&quot; and &quot;Follow Me Around&quot;. &quot;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&quot;, an interactive experience with music and artwork from the albums, was released on 18 November for PlayStation 5, macOS and Windows.

<text>The Bends is the second studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 13 March 1995 by Parlophone. It was produced by John Leckie, with extra production by Radiohead, Nigel Godrich and Jim Warren. &quot;The Bends&quot; combines guitar songs and ballads, with more restrained arrangements and cryptic lyrics than Radiohead&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993).

Work began at RAK Studios, London, in February 1994. Tensions were high, with pressure from Parlophone to match sales of Radiohead&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, and progress was slow. After an international tour in May and June, Radiohead resumed work at Abbey Road in London and the Manor in Oxfordshire. &quot;The Bends&quot; was the first Radiohead album recorded with Godrich and the artist Stanley Donwood, who have worked on every Radiohead album since.

Several singles were released, backed by music videos: &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, the double A-side &quot;High and Dry / Planet Telex&quot;, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, &quot;Just&quot;, and Radiohead&#x27;s first top-five entry on the UK singles chart, &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;. &quot;The Bends&quot; was also released as a single in Ireland. A live video, &quot;Live at the Astoria&quot;, was released on VHS. Radiohead toured extensively for &quot;The Bends&quot;, including US tours supporting R.E.M. and Alanis Morissette.

&quot;The Bends&quot; reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, but failed to build on the success of &quot;Creep&quot; outside the UK, reaching number 88 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It received greater acclaim than &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, including a nomination for Best British Album at the Brit Awards 1996, and elevated Radiohead from one-hit-wonders to one of the most recognised British bands. It is frequently named one of the greatest albums of all time, cited in lists including Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; and all three editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s lists of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;The Bends&quot; is credited for influencing a generation of post-Britpop acts, such as Coldplay, Muse and Travis. It is certified platinum in the US and quadruple platinum in the UK.

==Background==
Radiohead released their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, in 1993. By the time they began their first US tour early that year, their debut single, &quot;Creep&quot;, had become a hit. The band felt pressured by the success and mounting expectations. Following the tours, the singer, Thom Yorke, became ill and Radiohead cancelled an appearance at the 1993 Reading Festival. He told &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;Physically I&#x27;m completely fucked and mentally I&#x27;ve had enough.&quot;

According to some reports, Radiohead&#x27;s record company, EMI, gave them six months to &quot;get sorted&quot; or be dropped. EMI&#x27;s A&amp;R head, Keith Wozencroft, denied this, saying: &quot;Experimental rock music was getting played and had commercial potential. People voice different paranoias, but for the label [Radiohead] were developing brilliantly from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.&quot;

After Radiohead finished recording &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, Yorke played the co-producer Paul Q. Kolderie a demo tape of new material with the working title &quot;The Benz&quot;. Kolderie was shocked to find the songs were &quot;&quot;all&quot; better than anything on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;&quot;. The guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien later said: &quot;After all that touring on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; ... the songs that Thom was writing were so much better. Over a period of a year and a half, suddenly, &quot;bang&quot;.&quot; Kolderie credited Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; tours for &quot;turning them into a tight band&quot;.

To produce their next album, Radiohead selected John Leckie, who had produced records by acts they admired, such as Magazine. The drummer, Philip Selway, said Radiohead were reassured by how relaxed and open-minded Leckie was on their first meeting. According to O&#x27;Brien, the success of &quot;Creep&quot; meant that Radiohead were not in debt to EMI and so had more freedom on their next album. EMI asked Radiohead to deliver a followup to &quot;Creep&quot; for the American market; however, according to Leckie, Radiohead had disowned &quot;Creep&quot; and did not &quot;think in terms of making hit singles&quot;.

Recording was postponed so Leckie could work on the album &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, by another Oxford band, Ride. Radiohead used the extra time to rehearse in a disused barn on an Oxfordshire fruit farm in January 1994. Yorke said: &quot;We had all of these songs and we really liked them, but we knew them almost too well ... so we had to sort of learn to like them again before we could record them, which is odd.&quot;

==Recording==

EMI gave Radiohead nine weeks to record the album, planning to release it in October 1994. Work began at RAK Studios in London in February 1994. Yorke would arrive at the studio early and work alone at the piano; according to Leckie, &quot;New songs were pouring out of him.&quot; The band praised Leckie for demystifying the studio environment. The guitarist Jonny Greenwood said: &quot;He didn&#x27;t treat us like he had some kind of witchcraft that only he understands. There&#x27;s no mystery to it, which is so refreshing.&quot;

Whereas &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was mostly written by Yorke, &quot;The Bends&quot; saw greater collaboration. Previously, all three guitarists had often played identical parts, creating a &quot;dense, fuzzy wall&quot; of sound. Their &quot;Bends&quot; roles were more divided, with Yorke generally playing rhythm, Greenwood lead and Ed O&#x27;Brien providing effects. O&#x27;Brien described the Boss DD-5, a delay pedal, as important to the album&#x27;s sound. The band also created more restrained arrangements; in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s words, &quot;We were very aware of something on &quot;The Bends&quot; that we weren&#x27;t aware of on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;... If it sounded really great with Thom playing acoustic with Phil and [Colin], what was the point in trying to add something more?&quot;

&quot;Planet Telex&quot; began with a drum loop taken from another song, the B-side &quot;Killer Cars&quot;, and was written and recorded in a single evening at RAK. &quot;(Nice Dream)&quot; began as a simple four-chord song by Yorke, and was expanded with extra parts by O&#x27;Brien and Greenwood. Much of &quot;Just&quot; was written by Greenwood, who, according to Yorke, &quot;was trying to get as many chords as he could into a song&quot;. Not satisfied with the versions of &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; recorded at RAK, Radiohead used a live recording from the London Astoria, with Yorke&#x27;s vocals replaced and the audience removed.

Radiohead made several efforts to record &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;. O&#x27;Brien likened one version to the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;November Rain&quot;, saying it was &quot;pompous and bombastic ... just the worst&quot;. Eventually, Leckie recorded Yorke playing &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; alone, which the rest of the band used to build the final song. &quot;High and Dry&quot; was recorded the previous year at Courtyard Studios, Oxfordshire, by Radiohead&#x27;s live sound engineer, Jim Warren. Yorke later said it was a &quot;very bad&quot; song that EMI had pressured him into releasing.

&quot;The Bends&quot;, &quot;(Nice Dream)&quot; and &quot;Just&quot; were identified as potential singles and became the focus of the early sessions, which created tension. Leckie recalled: &quot;We had to give those absolute attention, make them amazing, instant smash hits, number one in America. Everyone was pulling their hair out saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s not good enough!&#x27; We were trying too hard.&quot; Yorke in particular struggled with the pressure, and Radiohead&#x27;s co-manager Chris Hufford considered quitting, citing Yorke&#x27;s &quot;mistrust of everybody&quot;. Jonny Greenwood spent days testing new guitar equipment, searching for a distinctive sound, before reverting to his Telecaster. The bassist, Colin Greenwood, described the period as &quot;eight weeks of hell and torture&quot;. According to Yorke, &quot;We had days of painful self-analysis, a total fucking meltdown for two fucking months.&quot; O&#x27;Brien said each member examined their options for leaving their contracts.

With the October deadline abandoned, recording paused in May and June while Radiohead toured Europe, Japan and Australasia. Work resumed for two weeks in July at the Manor studio in Oxfordshire, where Radiohead completed songs including &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Sulk&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;. This was followed by tours of the UK, Thailand and Mexico. In Mexico, the band members had a major argument. Yorke said: &quot;Years of tension and not saying anything to each other, and basically all the things that had built up since we&#x27;d met each other, all came out in one day. We were spitting and fighting and crying and saying all the things that you don&#x27;t want to talk about. It completely changed and we went back and did the album and it all made sense.&quot; The tour gave Radiohead a new sense of purpose and their relationships improved. Hufford encouraged them to make the album they wanted instead of worrying about &quot;product and units&quot;.

Recording ended in November 1994 at Abbey Road Studios in London. Selway said the album was recorded in about four months total. While Leckie mixed &quot;The Bends&quot; at Abbey Road, EMI grew concerned that he was taking too long. Without his knowledge, they sent tracks to Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, who had produced &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, to mix instead. Leckie disliked their mixes, finding them &quot;brash&quot;, but later said: &quot;I went through a bit of trauma at the time, but maybe they chose the best thing.&quot; Only three of Leckie&#x27;s mixes were used on the album.

&quot;The Bends&quot; was Radiohead&#x27;s first collaboration with Nigel Godrich, who engineered the RAK sessions. When Leckie left the studio to attend a social engagement, Godrich and the band stayed to record B-sides. One song, &quot;Black Star&quot;, was included on the album. Godrich produced all of Radiohead&#x27;s later albums.

==Music==

&quot;The Bends&quot; has been described as alternative rock and indie rock. Like &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, it features guitar-oriented rock songs, but its songs are &quot;more spacey and odd&quot;, according to &quot;The Gazette&quot;&#x27;s Bill Reed. The music is more eclectic than &quot;Pablo Honey;&quot; Colin Greenwood said Radiohead wanted to distinguish themselves from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and that &quot;The Bends&quot; better represented their style. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it contrasts warmth and tension, riffs and texture, and rock and post-rock. Several critics identified it as a Britpop album, though Radiohead disliked Britpop, seeing it as a &quot;backwards-looking&quot; pastiche.

The critic Simon Reynolds wrote that &quot;The Bends&quot; brought an &quot;English art rock element&quot; to the fore of Radiohead&#x27;s sound. According to Kolderie, &quot;&quot;The Bends&quot; was neither an English album nor an American album. It&#x27;s an album made in the void of touring and travelling. It really had that feeling of, &#x27;We don&#x27;t live anywhere and we don&#x27;t belong anywhere.&#x27;&quot; Reed described the album as &quot;intriguingly disturbed&quot; and &quot;bipolar&quot;. He likened &quot;The Bends&quot; to the late music of the Beatles, described &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; as hard rock, and noted more subdued sounds on &quot;Bullet Proof ... I Wish I Was&quot; and &quot;High and Dry&quot;, showcasing Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;more plaintive and meditative side&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;The Bends&quot; as a &quot;mix of sonic guitar anthems and striking ballads&quot;, with lyrics evoking a &quot;haunted landscape&quot; of sickness, consumerism, jealousy and longing. Several songs evoke a &quot;sense of a disintegrated or disconnected subject&quot;. The journalist Mac Randall described the lyrics as &quot;a veritable compendium of disease, disgust and depression&quot; that nonetheless become uplifting in the context of the &quot;inviting&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; arrangements. Jonny Greenwood said &quot;The Bends&quot; was about &quot;illness and doctors... revulsion about our own bodies&quot;. Yorke said it was &quot;an incredibly personal album, which is why I spent most of my time denying that it was personal at all&quot;. The album title, a term for decompression sickness, references Radiohead&#x27;s rapid rise to fame with &quot;Creep&quot;. Yorke said, &quot;We just came up too fast.&quot;

In &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, Yorke laments the effects of consumerism on modern relationships. It was inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf and a performance by Jeff Buckley, who inspired Yorke to use falsetto. Sasha Frere-Jones compared its melody to the &quot;second theme of a Schubert string quartet&quot;. In &quot;Just&quot;, Jonny Greenwood plays octatonic scales that extend over four octaves, influenced by the 1978 Magazine song &quot;Shot by Both Sides&quot;. With the use of a DigiTech Whammy pedal, Greenwood pitch-shifts the solo into a high, piercing frequency. Greenwood also uses the Whammy for the opening riff of &quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, creating a &quot;glitchy, lo-fi&quot; sound. According to Randall, &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; transitions from a &quot;jangly&quot; opening hook to a &quot;McCartney-esque verse melody&quot; and &quot;pulverising guitar explosions&quot; in the bridge.

&quot;Sulk&quot; was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. It originally ended with the lyric &quot;just shoot your gun&quot;. Yorke omitted it after the suicide of the Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in 1994, as he did not want listeners to believe it was an allusion to Cobain. &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot; was inspired by R.E.M. and the 1991 novel &quot;The Famished Road&quot; by Ben Okri; the lyrics detail an escape from an oppressive reality. The journalist Rob Sheffield described &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, &quot;Planet Telex&quot; and &quot;High and Dry&quot; as a &quot;big-band dystopian epic&quot;.

== Artwork ==
&quot;The Bends&quot; was the first Radiohead album with artwork by Stanley Donwood, who has worked with Yorke to create all of Radiohead&#x27;s artwork since. Donwood met Yorke while they were students at the University of Exeter, and previously created artwork for the &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; EP. For &quot;The Bends&quot;, Yorke and Donwood hired a cassette camera and filmed objects including road signs, packaging and street lights. They entered a hospital to film an iron lung, but, according to Donwood, found that iron lungs &quot;are not very interesting to look at&quot;. Instead, they filmed a CPR mannequin, which Donwood described as having &quot;a facial expression like that of an android discovering for the first time the sensations of ecstasy and agony, simultaneously&quot;. To create the cover image, the pair displayed the footage on a television set and photographed the screen.

== Release ==
In September 1994, EMI released the &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; EP, comprising &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; plus &quot;Bends&quot; outtakes. &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; was also released as a single. The A&amp;R VP Perry Watts-Russel said EMI did not pursue radio play as &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; was intended for fans rather than as the lead single for &quot;The Bends&quot;.

&quot;The Bends&quot; was released at the height of Britpop, when the British music charts were dominated by bands such as Oasis and Blur, and initially made little impact. It was released in Japan on 8 March 1995 by EMI, and in the UK on 13 March by Parlophone Records. It spent 16 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, reaching number four. On the same day as the UK release, Radiohead&#x27;s performance at the London Astoria in May 1994 was released on VHS as &quot;Live at the Astoria&quot;, including several &quot;Bends&quot; tracks. 

In the US, &quot;The Bends&quot; was released on 4 April by EMI&#x27;s North American subsidiary, Capitol Records. According to the journalist Tim Footman, Capitol almost refused to release it, feeling it lacked hit singles. It debuted at the bottom of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the week of 13 May and reached number 147 in the week of 24 June. It re-entered the chart in the week of 17 February 1996, and reached number 88 on 20 April, almost exactly a year after its release. On 4 April, &quot;The Bends&quot; was certified gold in the US for sales of half a million copies. Though it remains Radiohead&#x27;s lowest-charting album in the US, it was certified platinum in January 1999 for sales of one million copies.

Interest from influential musicians such as the R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe, combined with several distinctive music videos, helped sustain Radiohead&#x27;s popularity outside the UK. &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; was used in the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot; and is credited for introducing Radiohead to a larger American audience. According to the MTV host Matt Pinfield, record companies would ask why MTV kept promoting &quot;The Bends&quot; when it was selling less than their albums; his reply was: &quot;Because it&#x27;s great!&quot; Yorke thanked Pinfield by giving him a gold record of &quot;The Bends.&quot;

&quot;The Bends&quot; slowly found fans through word of mouth. Selway credited the videos for helping &quot;The Bends&quot; &quot;gradually seep into people&#x27;s consciousness&quot;. Colin Greenwood wrote later: &quot;I spoke to so many music writers who&#x27;d received &quot;The Bends&quot; as a promo, left it to gather dust on top of their PC tower, and hadn&#x27;t bothered to play it until word of mouth nudged them.&quot; By the end of 1996, &quot;The Bends&quot; had sold around two million copies worldwide. In the UK, it was certified platinum in February 1996 for sales of over 300,000, and was certified quadruple platinum in July 2013.

=== Singles ===
According to Hufford, American audiences were disappointed by the lack of a &quot;Creep&quot;-style song on &quot;The Bends&quot;. In response, Capitol chose &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; as the first US single, to further distance Radiohead from &quot;Creep&quot;. It failed to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but reached number 20 on the UK singles chart. &quot;Just&quot;, released in the UK on August 21, reached number 19. It was not released as a single in the US, but its music video, directed by Jamie Thraves, received attention there. The next US single, the double A-side &quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Planet Telex&quot;, reached number 78. &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;, released in January 1996, reached number five on the UK singles chart, surpassing &quot;Creep&quot; and demonstrating that Radiohead were not one-hit wonders. &quot;The Bends&quot; was released as a single in Ireland and reached number 26 on the Irish Singles Chart in August 1996.

=== Tours ===
Radiohead toured extensively for &quot;The Bends&quot;, with performances in North America, Europe and Japan. They first toured in support of Soul Asylum, then R.E.M., one of their formative influences and one of the world&#x27;s biggest rock bands at the time. Yorke said about the tour with R.E.M: &quot;Everything that we&#x27;ve come to expect was completely turned on its head. Like the idea that you get to a certain level and you lose it. Everything was amicable and there was no bitchiness or pettiness about it.&quot; The US tour included a performance at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, alongside Oasis, Alanis Morissette, No Doubt and Porno for Pyros. The Capitol employee Clark Staub described the performance as a &quot;key stepping stone&quot; for Radiohead in the US.

Before a performance in Denver, Colorado, Radiohead&#x27;s tour van was stolen and with it their musical equipment. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a stripped-down set with rented instruments and several shows were cancelled. Greenwood was reunited with his stolen Fender Telecaster Plus in 2015 after a fan recognised it as one they had purchased in Denver in the 1990s. In November 1995, Yorke became sick and collapsed on stage at a show in Munich. &quot;NME&quot; covered the incident in a story titled &quot;Thommy&#x27;s Temper Tantrum&quot;. Yorke said it was the most hurtful thing anyone had written about him, and refused to give interviews to &quot;NME&quot; for five years.

In March 1996, Radiohead toured the US again and performed on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. In mid-1996, they played at European festivals including Pinkpop in Holland, Tourhout Werchter in Belgium and T in the Park in Scotland. That August, Radiohead toured as the opening act for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of songs from their next album, &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Morissette said later: &quot;It was really grounding for me to be with such bona-fide-to-the-bone artists. It felt really validating because the industry was very wild and patriarchal, so to be on the road with such true savants was a gift for me.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Bends&quot; brought Radiohead significant critical attention. The &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Caroline Sullivan wrote that Radiohead had &quot;transformed themselves from nondescript guitar-beaters to potential arena-fillers ... The grandeur may eventually pall, as it has with U2, but it&#x27;s been years since big bumptious rock sounded this emotional.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; described &quot;The Bends&quot; as a &quot;powerful, bruised, majestically desperate record of frighteningly good songs&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot;″s Mark Sutherland wrote that &quot;Radiohead clearly resolved to make an album so stunning it would make people forget their own name, never mind [&#x27;Creep&#x27;]&quot;, describing it as &quot;the consummate, all-encompassing, continent-straddling &#x27;90s rock record&quot;. Dave Morrison of &quot;Select&quot; wrote that it &quot;captures and clarifies a much wider trawl of moods than &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;&quot; and praised Radiohead as &quot;one of the UK&#x27;s big league, big-rock assets&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;The Bends&quot; among the top ten albums of the year.

Critical reception in the United States was mixed. Chuck Eddy of &quot;Spin&quot; deemed much of the album &quot;nodded-out nonsense mumble, not enough concrete emotion&quot;, while Kevin McKeough from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; panned Yorke&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;self-absorbed&quot; and the music as overblown and pretentious. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that the guitar parts and expressions of angst were skilful and natural, but lacked depth: &quot;The words achieve precisely the same pitch of aesthetic necessity as the music, which is none at all.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sandy Morris praised Yorke as &quot;almost as enticingly enigmatic as Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; Billy Corgan, though of a more delicate constitution&quot;.

In 1997, Jonny Greenwood said &quot;The Bends&quot; had been a &quot;turning point&quot; for Radiohead: &quot;It started appearing in people&#x27;s [best of] polls for the end of the year. That&#x27;s when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band.&quot; The success gave Radiohead the confidence to self-produce their next album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), with Godrich.

==Legacy==
In 2015, Selway said &quot;The Bends&quot; originated the &quot;Radiohead aesthetic&quot;, aided by Donwood&#x27;s artwork. The journalist Rob Sheffield recalled that it &quot;shocked the world&quot;, elevating Radiohead from &quot;pasty British boys to a very 70s kind of UK art-rock godhead&quot;. It attracted interest from high-profile musicians and film stars.

Two years after its release, the &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Caroline Sullivan wrote that &quot;The Bends&quot; had taken Radiohead from &quot;indie one hit-wonder&quot; into the &quot;premier league of respected British rock bands&quot;. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Jordan Runtagh wrote in 2012 that &quot;The Bends&quot; was &quot;a musically dense and emotionally complex masterwork that erased their one-hit-wonder status forever&quot;. The writer Nick Hornby wrote in 2000 that, with &quot;The Bends&quot;, Radiohead &quot;found their voice ... No other contemporary band has managed to mix such a cocktail of rage, sarcasm, self-pity, exquisite tunefulness and braininess.&quot;

In &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Scott Plagenhoef wrote that &quot;The Bends&quot; presented a &quot;more approachable and loveable version&quot; of Radiohead and remained many fans&#x27; favourite album. He argued that it presented a transition from Britpop to &quot;the more feminine, emotionally engaging music that would emerge in the UK a few years later&quot;, led by &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

=== Influence ===
&quot;The Bends&quot; influenced a generation of British and Irish acts, including Coldplay, Keane, James Blunt, Muse, Athlete, Elbow, Snow Patrol, Kodaline, Turin Brakes and Travis. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; credited songs as such as &quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; for anticipating the &quot;airbrushed&quot; post-Britpop of Coldplay and Travis. Acts including Garbage, R.E.M. and k.d. lang began to cite Radiohead as a favourite band. The Cure contacted Radiohead to inquire about the &quot;Bends&quot; production in the hope of replicating it.

In 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; named &quot;The Bends&quot; one of &quot;the 50 albums that changed music&quot;, saying it had popularised an &quot;angst-laden falsetto ... a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis&quot;, which &quot;eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound&quot;. Yorke held contempt for the style of rock &quot;The Bends&quot; popularised, feeling other acts had copied him. He said in 2006: &quot;I was really, really upset about it, and I tried my absolute best not to be, but yeah, it was kind of like— that sort of thing of missing the point completely.&quot; Godrich felt Yorke was oversensitive and told him he did not invent &quot;guys singing in falsetto with an acoustic guitar&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In 2000, in a vote of more than 200,000 music fans and journalists, &quot;The Bends&quot; was named the second-greatest album of all time behind &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) by the Beatles. &quot;Q&quot; readers voted it the second-best album in 1998 and 2006, behind &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Colin Larkin named it the second-best album of all time in the 2000 edition of &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 110 on its original 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at 111 in its 2012 list, and at 276 in its 2020 list. In 2006, it reached number 10 in a worldwide poll of the great albums organised by &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; named it the 11th-greatest album of the 1990s. In 2020, the &quot;Independent&quot; named it the best album of 1995, writing: &quot;Downbeat, melancholic, yet wonderfully melodic and uplifting ... &quot;The Bends&quot; stood apart from Britpop and everything else in the storied year of 1995.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;The Bends&quot; the third-greatest Britpop album, writing that its &quot;epic portrayal of drift and disenchantment secures its reluctant spot in Britpop&#x27;s pantheon&quot;.

=== Reissues ===
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including &quot;The Bends&quot;. On 31 August 2009, EMI reissued &quot;The Bends&quot; and other Radiohead albums in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; compiling B-sides and live performances. Radiohead had no input into the reissue and the music was not remastered.

In February 2013, Parlophone was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). In April 2016, as a result of an agreement with the trade group Impala, WMG transferred Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue to XL Recordings. The EMI reissues, released without Radiohead&#x27;s consent, were removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl, including &quot;The Bends&quot;.

<doc id="170773" wikidata="Q221241" url="?curid=170773" title="Pablo Honey">
<text>Pablo Honey is the debut studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 22 February 1993 in the UK by Parlophone and on 20 April 1993 in the US by Capitol Records. It was produced by Sean Slade, Paul Q. Kolderie and Radiohead&#x27;s co-manager Chris Hufford.

Radiohead formed in 1985 at Abingdon School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and signed a recording contract with EMI in 1991. Their debut EP, &quot;Drill&quot; (1992), achieved little success. For their debut album, Radiohead&#x27;s management targeted the American market and chose American producers. &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was recorded in three weeks at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire in 1992. The recording was hampered by Radiohead&#x27;s lack of studio experience.

The singles &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; initially made little impact. However, &quot;Creep&quot; gradually gained international radio play, reaching number seven on the UK singles chart after it was reissued in 1993. Radiohead embarked on an aggressive promotional tour in the US supporting Belly and PJ Harvey, followed by a European tour supporting James. In May 1995, a live video, &quot;Live at the Astoria&quot; (1995), was released on VHS.

&quot;Pablo Honey&quot; reached number 22 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold in the UK in 1994 and double platinum in 2013. In the US, it was certified platinum in 1995. &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; received generally favourable reviews, but some found it underdeveloped or derivative. Though it is less acclaimed than Radiohead&#x27;s later work, some retrospective reviews have been positive and it has appeared in lists of the greatest albums. The members of Radiohead have criticised it, citing weaker songwriting and their studio inexperience. &quot;Creep&quot; remains Radiohead&#x27;s most successful single.

==Background==

The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. In 1985, they formed , the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school&#x27;s music room. They recorded demo tapes, including a cassette unofficially titled &quot;Manic Hedgehog&quot;, which featured versions of the future &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; tracks &quot;You&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Thinking About You&quot;.

One demo attracted the attention of a local producer, Chris Hufford. He and his business partner, Bryce Edge, became the band&#x27;s managers after attending a concert at the Jericho Tavern, Oxford. In late 1991, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name at EMI&#x27;s request. Their name was taken from the Talking Heads song &quot;Radio Head&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;True Stories&quot;.

Radiohead released their debut EP, &quot;Drill&quot;, in 1992. It was produced by Hufford in his studio, Courtyard Studios, in Oxfordshire. It reached number 101 on the UK singles chart; the &quot;Guardian&quot; later described it as an &quot;inauspicious start&quot; that drew little attention. Hufford said producing the EP himself was a mistake, as it created a conflict of interest and generated friction in the studio.

Hufford and Edge resolved to find different producers for Radiohead&#x27;s next recording. Independent labels dominated the indie charts in the UK, but EMI was a major label. Hufford and Edge therefore planned to have Radiohead use American producers and tour aggressively in America, then return to build a following in the UK. They considered hiring Steve Albini, but he had not yet worked with major acts and EMI felt it was too risky.

Around this time, the American producers Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, who had worked with bands including the Pixies and Dinosaur Jr, were in the UK looking for work. The EMI A&amp;R director, Nick Gatfield, gave them a selection of acts to consider. They agreed to produce Radiohead after he played them &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;. Kolderie was particularly impressed by Thom Yorke&#x27;s vocals. Upon meeting the band, Kolderie was struck by their youth, but also their unity and closeness. He described &quot;a seriousness of purpose and a seriousness of trying to create music that was a little different&quot;. He was initially more impressed by Hufford and Edge than by Radiohead, calling them &quot;crafty mothers ... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met two guys who had more of a plan.&quot;

== Recording ==

Radiohead recorded &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; at Chipping Norton Studios in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. They first attempted to record two songs that EMI was considering for Radiohead&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;Lurgee&quot;. They made little progress; Kolderie described Radiohead as &quot;desperately inexperienced&quot;, and neither they nor the producers liked the choice of songs. Kolderie said &quot;Inside My Head&quot; was &quot;not very melodic&quot; and lacked the power of Radiohead&#x27;s other songs. Hufford described the results as &quot;overblown bombastic rock&quot;.

During rehearsals, Radiohead unexpectedly played another song, &quot;Creep&quot;. They considered it a &quot;throwaway&quot; track, but it impressed the producers. At Kolderie&#x27;s suggestion, they recorded a take, after which everyone in the studio burst into applause. EMI were persuaded to make &quot;Creep&quot; Radiohead&#x27;s debut single. According to Kolderie, &quot;everyone [at EMI] who heard Creep just started going insane&quot; and he and Slade were hired to produce the album. Radiohead took elements of &quot;Creep&quot; from the 1972 song &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot;. After Rondor Music took legal action, the songwriters, Albert Hammond and Mike Hazelwood, were given shared royalties and songwriting credits.

&quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was recorded in three weeks. Kolderie described it as a struggle, and said: &quot;It was their first record and they wanted to be the Beatles, and the mix had to have no reverb, and they had all the ideas they&#x27;d ever come up with in 20 years of listening to records.&quot; Kolderie noted the band&#x27;s studio inexperience and difficulty in finishing tracks, but said he enjoyed the work due to the small group and joking atmosphere.

For the introduction to &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, Kolderie had everyone in the studio, including the cook, create sounds on guitar. &quot;The idea was to live up to the title: anyone can play guitar,&quot; he said. The guitarist Jonny Greenwood used a paintbrush for his part. Radiohead did not like the version of &quot;Lurgee&quot; they recorded with Kolderie and Slade, and used an earlier version, recorded with Hufford at Courtyard, for the album. Kolderie said &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was &quot;not cheap&quot;, and estimated that it had cost more than £100,000 to record.

The album title comes from a prank call sketch by the American comedy act the Jerky Boys in which the caller poses as the victim&#x27;s mother and says: &quot;Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida.&quot; Yorke said it was appropriate as the band were &quot;mothers&#x27; boys&quot;. A sample of the sketch appears during the guitar solo on &quot;How Do You?&quot;

== Music and lyrics ==
In &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, critics found elements of grunge, alternative rock, stadium rock, progressive rock, college rock, post-grunge, and jangle pop. The album drew comparisons to Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr., Sugar, U2, the Smiths, the Cure, the Who and the Jam.

The Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien later described &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as a &quot;hedonistic&quot; album that &quot;you might put on in an open-top car on a Saturday night going to a party&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as a blend of the anthemic rock of U2 with &quot;atmospheric&quot; instrumental passages. The &quot;Salon&quot; journalist Annie Zaleski said it featured &quot;distortion-blurred guitar lines that twisted like a kite in the wind&quot;. Gary Walker, writing for &quot;Guitar.com&quot;, described it as &quot;nakedly naive and unguarded&quot; compared to Radiohead&#x27;s more complex later work. He wrote that it captured the &quot;embryonic dynamic&quot; between the three guitarists and described Greenwood&#x27;s guitar work as an &quot;exhilarating melange of tremolo-picked soundscapes, chunky octaves, screaming high-register runs and killswitch antics&quot;. The opening track, &quot;You&quot;, moves between major and minor chords and alternating time signatures. &quot;Blow Out&quot; combines elements of bossa nova and krautrock; it starts with &quot;tense, jazzy&quot; drumming and raked chords and concludes with a shoegaze section.

Zaleski said the &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; lyrics express anger at the status quo, the feeling of being an outsider, and worry for the future. &quot;Creep&quot; features a quiet verse and a loud chorus, with &quot;blasts&quot; of guitar noise from Jonny Greenwood. Yorke described it as a &quot;self-destruct song&quot;. The lyrics were inspired by a woman that Yorke followed around who unexpectedly attended a Radiohead performance. The lyrics of &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; are about oppression, and the frustration from failing to explain it. Yorke wrote the line &quot;Grow my hair, I wanna be Jim Morrison&quot;, from &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, in response to people in the music business who &quot;think they have to act like fucking prats in order to live up to the legend&quot;. According to Zaleski, &quot;Ripcord&quot; is about the &quot;experience of hurtling into the unknown&quot;. &quot;Lurgee&quot; ends with a &quot;meandering&quot; solo.

== Release ==
&quot;Creep&quot; was released as the lead &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; single on 21 September 1992. It initially received little airplay and sold around 6,000 copies, reaching number 78 on the UK singles chart. The 1993 singles &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;, plus the non-album single &quot;Pop Is Dead&quot;, were unsuccessful. While &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and &quot;Pop Is Dead&quot; charted on the UK singles chart, &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; gained no traction. Radiohead rerecorded &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; for the US single as they were not happy with the album version. O&#x27;Brien said the new version was &quot;more atmospheric&quot;, likening it to Joy Division.

&quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was released in February 1993 and received little press. It reached number 25 in 1993&#x27;s UK Albums Chart. However, &quot;Creep&quot; became a hit in Israel, where it was played frequently by the radio DJ Yoav Kutner. In March, Radiohead were invited to Tel Aviv for their first overseas show. Around the same time, &quot;Creep&quot; rose to number two on the US Modern Rock chart, and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was selling well on import. &quot;Creep&quot; reached number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and reached number seven on the UK singles chart when EMI rereleased it in September 1993. In the UK, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was certified silver in February 1994, gold in April 1994, platinum in June 1997, and double platinum in July 2013. In the US, it was certified gold in September 1993 and platinum in September 1995.
== Tour ==
In late 1992, Radiohead toured the UK with Kingmaker and the Frank and Walters. That September, they performed at the UK EMI conference. They impressed the EMI promoter Carol Baxter, who said: &quot;This funny little band came on and they obviously had something. This was a hideous record company do but Thom gave it everything.&quot; That Christmas, &quot;NME&quot; published a review of a Radiohead performance that dismissed them as &quot;a pitiful, lily-livered excuse for a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group&quot;.

In June 1993, Radiohead began their first North American tour. In July, they gave a performance of &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; live on &quot;MTV Beach House&quot; in which Yorke screamed the improvised lyrics &quot;fat, ugly, dead!&quot;, before breaking down on camera and jumping into a pool. Yorke was holding a live microphone and narrowly avoided electrocuting himself.

Radiohead cancelled an appearance at the 1993 Reading Festival after Yorke became ill; he told &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Physically I&#x27;m completely fucked and mentally I&#x27;ve had enough.&quot; According to some reports, EMI gave Radiohead six months to &quot;get sorted&quot; or be dropped. EMI&#x27;s A&amp;R head, Keith Wozencroft, denied this, saying: &quot;Experimental rock music was getting played and had commercial potential. People voice different paranoias, but for the label [Radiohead] were developing brilliantly from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.&quot; 

In September 1993, after &quot;Creep&quot; was reissued, Radiohead performed it on the British music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and as the first musical guests on the American talk show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. EMI&#x27;s American arm, Capitol, wanted to continue promoting &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and build on the momentum. Radiohead declined an offer to tour the US in support of Duran Duran, as their managers felt they could earn more credibility by supporting Belly. They also opened for PJ Harvey in New York City and Los Angeles. On 13 May 1995, a live video, &quot;Live at the Astoria&quot; (1995), was released on VHS, with performances of &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; songs such as &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;.

Radiohead struggled with the tour. Yorke disliked dealing with American music journalists and tired of the songs. The band members appeared in promotional material they later regretted, such as fashion shoots for Iceberg jeans and the magazine &quot;Interview&quot;. According to Radiohead&#x27;s agent, the promotional work triggered &quot;a lot of soul-searching about why they were in a group at all&quot;. Jonny Greenwood said they &quot;spent a year being jukeboxes ... We felt in a creative stasis because we couldn&#x27;t release anything new.&quot; The American tour was followed by a European tour supporting James and Tears for Fears. Kolderie credited the &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; tours for turning Radiohead &quot;into a tight band&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Pablo Honey&quot; failed to make a critical impact upon its initial release. &quot;NME&quot;″s John Harris referred to Radiohead as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s brightest hopes&quot;. Harris said the track &quot;How Do You?&quot; &quot;breaks the [album&#x27;s] momentum... horribly&quot;, but described &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as &quot;satisfying&quot; despite its flaws. &quot;NME&quot; later named it the 35th-best album of the year. &quot;Q&quot; wrote that &quot;British teenagerhood has never been grumpier&quot; and described &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as a good album with moments that rivalled Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr. and Sugar.

In the United States, &quot;Creep&quot; drew parallels with Nirvana, with some describing Radiohead as the &quot;British Nirvana&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; said the lyrics had &quot;enough bite to make it on their own&quot; despite the U2 comparisons. In a mixed review, Mario Mundoz of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t really deliver anything you haven&#x27;t heard before&quot; but &quot;does offer clever lyrics and good hooks&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; did not recommend the album, but named &quot;Creep&quot; a &quot;choice cut&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album&#x27;s charm originates from its guitar work, song structures, melodies, and choruses that invoke a &quot;pop appeal&quot;.

==Legacy==

Although &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; did not receive the acclaim of Radiohead&#x27;s later albums, it has received praise in retrospective coverage. In 2018, the musician and journalist Phil Witmer wrote that &quot;&quot;Pablo Honey&quot; is endearing because we now know the band that made it would become something extraordinary not even five years later&quot;. He chose &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Blow Out&quot; as the most sophisticated tracks, pointing towards Radiohead&#x27;s later work. The &quot;Premier Guitar&quot; writer Shawn Hammond also highlighted &quot;Blow Out&quot; as a &quot;glimpse of future brilliance&quot;.

According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, the songwriting does not always match Radiohead&#x27;s sound, but when it does, it achieves &quot;a rare power that is both visceral and intelligent&quot;. Kenny EG Perry of &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;the sound of one of the best bands of this or any other generation playing the music that taught them all their good early lessons&quot;. &quot;Clash&quot; said that it &quot;points towards everything that [Radiohead] would go on to be&quot;.

In a 2008 review, Al Spicer of BBC Music described &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;exploration of suburban, adolescent self-awareness&quot; and &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most impressive debuts&quot;. In 2009, &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Mehan Jahasuriya criticised &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; as &quot;a hodgepodge of half-baked grunge, jangle-pop and stadium-ready alternative rock ... nearly indistinguishable from other early &#x27;90s college rock throwaways, save for a few hints of greatness&quot;. Reviewing the 2009 reissue for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Scott Plagenhoef praised &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Stop Whispering&quot; and &quot;Prove Yourself&quot;, but described &quot;How Do You?&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Ripcord&quot; and &quot;Vegetable&quot; as &quot;run of the mill at best&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Creep&quot;, Radiohead grew to resent it. In 1993, Yorke said: &quot;It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not our song any more ... It feels like we&#x27;re doing a cover.&quot; The success almost led to Radiohead&#x27;s break-up. Their frustration with &quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; influenced their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995). The album title, a term for decompression sickness, references Radiohead&#x27;s rapid rise to fame; Yorke said &quot;we just came up too fast&quot;. While touring for their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Yorke became hostile when &quot;Creep&quot; was mentioned in interviews and refused requests to play it. In the following years, the band stopped performing it entirely, but later started performing it infrequently. Though Radiohead achieved greater commercial and critical success with later albums, &quot;Creep&quot; remains their most successful single. Based on their work on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, the American band Hole hired Slade and Kolderie to produce their 1994 album &quot;Live Through This&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that, with &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, &quot;Radiohead didn&#x27;t so much ride the coattails of grunge to mass success as stumble over them, and they&#x27;ve been apologising for it ever since.&quot; In 1996, the bassist, Colin Greenwood, said, &quot;I&#x27;d give [&quot;Pablo Honey&quot;] a seven out of 10 – not bad for an album recorded in just two and a half weeks.&quot; In 1997, O&#x27;Brien said it was derivative of Dinosaur Jr. and the Pixies. He described it as &quot;a collection of our greatest hits as an unsigned band&quot;. Jonny Greenwood said in 1998 that it &quot;lacked freedom&quot;, and was hindered by the band&#x27;s fear and inexperience. O&#x27;Brien said in 2020 that &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was &quot;pretty shit [...] but we worked hard and became good. That&#x27;s one of the things I&#x27;ve held onto: you don&#x27;t have to have all the answers straight away.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
In 1998, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; was voted the 100th best album of all time in a poll held by Virgin and 61st in a poll by &quot;Q&quot;. The journalist Colin Larkin placed it 301st in the third edition of &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). As part of its 2007 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Lost Tracks&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; included &quot;Lurgee&quot; and &quot;Blow Out&quot; in a list of 20 essential lesser-known Radiohead songs. In 2006, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; named &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; one of the 20 greatest albums of 1993. In 2008, &quot;Blender&quot; ranked it 82nd in its list of &quot;100 Albums You Must Own&quot;.

== Reissues ==
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. In 2009, EMI reissued &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; with the &quot;Drill&quot; EP tracks, B-sides and alternative takes. Radiohead had no input into the reissues and the music was not remastered.

In February 2013, Parlophone was bought by Warner Music Group (WMG). In April 2016, as a result of an agreement with the trade group Impala, WMG transferred Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue to XL Recordings. The EMI reissues, released without Radiohead&#x27;s consent, were removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl, including &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.

<text>Hugh John Mungo Grant (born 9 September 1960) is an English actor. He established himself early in his career as a charming and vulnerable romantic leading man, and has since transitioned into a character actor. He has received several accolades including a British Academy Film Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards. He received an Honorary César in 2006. , his films had grossed a total of nearly US$3 billion worldwide. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine listed Grant as one of Britain&#x27;s 50 greatest actors of all time.

Grant made his feature film acting debut in &quot;Privileged&quot; (1982), followed by the romantic drama &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987) for which he gained acclaim as well as the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He then acted in a string of successful period dramas such as &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995) and &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995). Grant emerged as a star with Richard Curtis&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), for which he won the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. He starred in further romantic comedies such as &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001) and its 2004 and 2025 sequels, &quot;About a Boy&quot; (2002), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) and &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot; (2007).

Grant began to take against-type parts earning nominations for two BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actor for his roles as St. Clair Bayfield in &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; (2016) and a haughty actor in &quot;Paddington 2&quot; (2017). He has also acted in the science fiction film &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2012), several Guy Ritchie action films including &quot;The Gentlemen&quot; (2019), the musical fantasy &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023), and the horror film &quot;Heretic&quot; (2024), which earned him another BAFTA nomination. He earned two nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor for his roles as Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC miniseries &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot; (2018) and a man accused of murder in the HBO miniseries &quot;The Undoing&quot; (2020).

Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media. He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal.

==Early life and education ==
Grant was born on September 9, 1960 in Hammersmith Hospital, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (1934–2001) and Captain James Murray Grant (born 1929). His grandfather, Colonel James Murray Grant, DSO, was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II. Genealogist Anthony Adolph has described Grant&#x27;s family history as &quot;a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders, and aristocracy.&quot; His ancestors include Sir Walter Raleigh; William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan; James Stewart; John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl; Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham; Sir Evan Nepean; and a sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval.

Grant&#x27;s father was an officer in the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya and Germany. He ran a carpet business and pursued hobbies such as golf and watercolour painting; he raised his family in Chiswick, West London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane. In September 2006, a collection of Capt. Grant&#x27;s paintings was hosted by The John Martin Gallery in a charity exhibition, organised by his son, called &quot;James Grant: 30 Years of Watercolours&quot;. Hugh&#x27;s mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French, and music for more than 30 years in the state schools of west London. She died at 67 of pancreatic cancer.

On &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in 2002, Grant credited his mother with &quot;any acting genes that [he] might have.&quot; Both his parents were children of military families, but despite that background, he has said, his family was not always affluent as he grew up. He spent many of his childhood summers hunting and fishing with his grandfather in Scotland. Grant has an older brother, James &quot;Jamie&quot; Grant, a New York-based investment banker.

Grant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick, then moved to St Peter&#x27;s Primary School in Hammersmith, followed by Wetherby School, an independent preparatory school in Notting Hill. From 1969 to 1978, he attended Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, at the time a direct grant grammar school. He was educated on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket, and football. He also represented Latymer Upper on the quiz show &quot;Top of the Form&quot;, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.

In 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford, where he studied English literature and graduated with a 2.1 grade. Then viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet, he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and played Fabian in a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He also starred in his first film, &quot;Privileged&quot; (1982), produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation. He turned down an offer from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, to pursue a PhD in art history because he failed to secure a grant.

==Career==
===1982–1986: Early roles and breakthrough ===

After making his debut in the Oxford-financed film &quot;Privileged&quot; (1982), Grant dabbled in a variety of jobs, such as working as an assistant groundsman at Fulham Football Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager. At a screening of &quot;Privileged&quot; at BAFTA in London, he was approached by a talent agent offering to represent him. Still intending to begin his MPhil at the Courtauld Institute, Grant declined, but then later reconsidered, thinking that acting for a year would be a good way to save some money for his studies. Soon afterwards he was offered a supporting role in &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984) starring Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, but was prevented from playing the role because he did not yet have an Equity card, which could only be earned through acting in regional theatre. To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate in Nottingham. Richard Digby Day directed him in small roles at the Nottingham Playhouse in &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, an avant-garde production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.

Bored with small acting parts, Grant created a sketch-comedy group called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London&#x27;s pub comedy circuit with stops at &quot;The George IV&quot; in Chiswick, &quot;Canal Cafe Theatre&quot; in Little Venice and &quot;The King&#x27;s Head&quot; in Islington. The Jockeys of Norfolk proved a hit at the 1985 Edinburgh Festival Fringe after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on Russell Harty&#x27;s BBC2 TV show &quot;Harty Goes to...&quot;. In 1986 he played Eric Birling in a production of &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, directed by Richard Wilson, giving a performance that Grevel Lindop, writing in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, described as &quot;outstanding&quot;. In 1985 and 1986, Grant had minor roles in eight television productions, including TV films, historical miniseries and single episodes of series. His first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory&#x27;s Edwardian drama film &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel. He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he balanced small roles on television with film work, which included playing Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in the BAFTA Award-nominated &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987) and a supporting role in &quot;The Dawning&quot; (1988) opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons. In 1988 he had a leading role in Ken Russell&#x27;s horror film, &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot;. He was Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called &quot;Remando al viento&quot; (1988) and portrayed legendary champagne merchant Charles Heidsieck in the television film &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; (1989). In 1990 he had a small role in the sport/crime drama &quot;The Big Man&quot;, opposite Liam Neeson, in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent; the film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991 he played Julie Andrews&#x27; gay son in the ABC made-for-television film &quot;Our Sons&quot;.

In 1991 he also starred as Frederic Chopin in &quot;Impromptu&quot;, opposite Judy Davis as his lover George Sand. In 1992 he appeared in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Bitter Moon&quot;, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an &quot;anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In 1993 he had a supporting role in the Merchant-Ivory drama &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;. Grant later jokingly called many of the productions of his early career &quot;Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they&#x27;d get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America.&quot;

===1994–1999: &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and stardom ===

At 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994). &quot;If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you&#x27;d know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny,&quot; he later recalled. Released in 1994 with Grant as the protagonist, &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244 million, making him an overnight international star. His entry in &quot;The Trouble with Men: Masculinities in European and Hollywood Cinema&quot; states &quot;&quot;Four Weddings&quot; made him a truly international star whose image was endlessly promoted in tabloid newspaper articles, television chat shows and magazine profiles, especially in mass circulation women&#x27;s magazines. Grant was careful to play up to the affable and self-deprecating English gent. His interviewers commented frequently on his romantic attractiveness, a modern matinée idol, blue eyed, very good looking in a classically English way, with his floppy hair and charming smile, his impeccable manners leavened by the occasional expletive&quot;.

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and, among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter (Richard Curtis), who is known for writing about himself and his own life. Grant later expressed &quot;Although I owe whatever success I&#x27;ve had to &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions: One was that I was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth, as I&#x27;m sure Richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought that&#x27;s all I could do. I suppose, because those films happened to be successful, no one, perhaps understandably, ... bothered to rent all the other films I&#x27;d done&quot;.

In July 1994, he signed a two-year production deal with Castle Rock Entertainment and, by October, he became founder and director of the UK-based Simian Films Limited. He appointed his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, as the head of development to look for prospective projects. Simian Films produced two Grant vehicles in the 1990s and lost a bid to produce &quot;About a Boy&quot; to Robert De Niro&#x27;s TriBeCa Productions. The company closed its US office in 2002 and Grant resigned as director in December 2005. Before the release of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, Grant had reunited with its director Mike Newell for the tragicomedy &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot; (1995), which was labelled a &quot;determinedly off-beat film&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He portrayed the supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;It shows that he has range as an actor&quot; but the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; disapproved on grounds that the film &quot;plays like a vanity production for Grant&quot;. Janet Maslin, praising Grant as &quot;superb&quot; and &quot;a dashing cad under any circumstances&quot;, commented, &quot;For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today.&quot; His next role was as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in &quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain&quot; (1995).
Grant&#x27;s first studio-financed Hollywood project was opposite Julianne Moore in Chris Columbus&#x27;s comedy &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995). Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;grotesquely pandering caper&quot; and singled out Grant&#x27;s performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend&#x27;s unexpected pregnancy, for his &quot;insufferable muggings&quot;. Grant himself has been highly critical of his performance in &quot;Nine Months&quot;, stating in a 2016 interview that &quot;I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I&#x27;d been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, 20th Century Fox, the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker&quot;. Next in 1995, he starred as Emma Thompson&#x27;s suitor in her Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, directed by Ang Lee. In 1995 he also performed in &quot;Restoration&quot;; Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that Grant is &quot;having a fine and liberating time playing a supercilious court portrait painter&quot;, and Kevin Thomas of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said he has &quot;some delicious moments&quot; in the film. He made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller &quot;Extreme Measures&quot;. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel each gave the film three out of four stars, with Siskel writing &quot;Hugh Grant&#x27;s work in &quot;Extreme Measures&quot; is a refreshing standout.&quot;

After a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, which was written by Richard Curtis and produced by much of the same team that was responsible for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. This new Working Title production displaced &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363 million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, &quot;&quot;Notting Hill&quot; stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds.&quot; Reactions to his Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com&#x27;s Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, &quot;Grant&#x27;s performance stands as an emblem of what&#x27;s wrong with &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. What&#x27;s maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He&#x27;s become one of those actors who&#x27;s all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow&#x27;s feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out.&quot; The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant&#x27;s turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a delightfully funny deadpan&quot;.

Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot;, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, &quot;Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [and] strikes one wrong note and then another&quot;, whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said, &quot;If he&#x27;d been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he&#x27;d accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That&#x27;s how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures.&quot;

===2000–2009: Continued romantic comedy roles===

While promoting Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000) on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, &quot;It&#x27;s my millennium of bastards&quot;. &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; starred Grant, in the words of film critic Andrew Sarris, as &quot;a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [who] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters Mr. Allen has ever created&quot;. In a role devoid of his comic attributes, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.&quot; In 2000, Grant also joined the supervisory board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company. In 2001, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; was proclaimed by &quot;Variety&quot; to be &quot;as sly an overthrow of a star&#x27;s polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory&quot;. The film, adapted from Helen Fielding&#x27;s novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281 million worldwide. He was, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, fitting as &quot;a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god&#x27;s countenance that he knows all too well&quot;.

In 2002, Grant starred as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;About a Boy&quot;. The BBC thought Grant delivered an &quot;immaculate comic performance&quot;, and with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, &quot;About a Boy&quot; was determined by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to be &quot;that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;The acid comedy of Grant&#x27;s performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs&quot;, while Roger Ebert observed that &quot;the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource&quot;. Released a day after the blockbuster &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;About a Boy&quot; was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129 million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and &quot;GQ&quot; honoured him as one of the magazine&#x27;s men of the year 2002. &quot;His performance can only be described as revelatory&quot;, wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that &quot;Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness.&quot; &quot;The New York Observer&quot; concluded: &quot;[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant&#x27;s performance.&quot;

&quot;About a Boy&quot; also marked a notable change in his boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant&#x27;s maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it &quot;looked good on him&quot;. He added that Grant&#x27;s &quot;pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with &#x27;love me&#x27; cuteness now betray a shark&#x27;s casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it&#x27;s not just his surface that&#x27;s more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency.&quot;

He was paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), which made $199 million internationally but received poor reviews. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; concluded that Grant&#x27;s creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was &quot;little more than a Britishism machine&quot;. &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, &quot;Love Actually&quot;, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as &quot;the ultimate romantic comedy&quot; and accumulated $246 million at the international box office. It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations. Roger Ebert claimed that &quot;Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian&quot; and has &quot;so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport&quot;. Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called his performance &quot;an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair&quot; as the star &quot;flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style&quot;.

In 2004, he reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262 million commercially. Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next re-teamed with Paul Weitz (&quot;About a Boy&quot;) for the black comedy &quot;American Dreamz&quot; (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an &quot;American Idol&quot;-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host&#x27;s heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell&#x27;s villainous act to its limit&quot;. &quot;American Dreamz&quot; failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; proposed that this &quot;just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant&quot;, and critic Carina Chocano said, &quot;He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy.&quot;

In 2007, he starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot;. The Associated Press described it as &quot;a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that&#x27;s simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough&quot;. Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The film, with its revenues totalling $145 million, allowed him to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex&#x27;s career: He&#x27;s too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he&#x27;s far too brazen to feel anything like shame.&quot; In 2009, he starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Did You Hear About the Morgans?&quot;, which was a critical failure and box office disappointment.

===2012–2017: Mid-career experimentation===

Grant was featured in the Wachowskis&#x27; and Tom Tykwer&#x27;s epic science fiction film &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; in 2012, playing six different dark characters. In the same year, Grant lent his voice to the Aardman stop motion animation &quot;The Pirates! Band of Misfits&quot;. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film &quot;The Rewrite&quot; (2014), starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant&#x27;s performance was praised by many critics; director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favourites of the year and called Grant a &quot;perfect leading man&quot;.

In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described his performance as &quot;the only bit of fun&quot; in the film, and Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave the film a mixed review but stated that &quot;while it can&#x27;t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably&quot;.

In 2016, Grant played St. Clair Bayfield, partner of the title character, in the film &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Meryl Streep. His performance drew raves from film critics as &quot;career-best&quot; (&quot;Screen International&quot;), &quot;one of his best performances in years&quot; (Indiewire), &quot;best work of his career&quot; (&quot;Variety&quot;) where he &quot;goes deeper, darker and riskier&quot; (&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;). Rafer Guzman of &quot;Newsday&quot; said &quot;Surely the 55-year-old actor has just sealed his first-ever Oscar nomination.&quot; Carrie Rickey of &quot;Yahoo! Movies&quot; commented that Grant &quot;deserves the Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the recognition — finally — that he is unique and irreplaceable among modern actors&quot;. He was nominated for his first individual Screen Actors Guild Award and also earned nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Critics&#x27; Choice Award, a Satellite Award and a European Film Award. Several critics put his work among the best acting performances of the year. Most award pundits predicted Grant would receive his first Academy Award nomination for his performance, but he was not nominated.

His next appearance was as Phoenix Buchanan, the main antagonist of &quot;Paddington 2&quot;, which was a commercial and critical success. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described his performance as &quot;scene-stealing&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot; commented &quot;Grant continues to make an astonishing comeback in his career, once again by playing into his expert comedic abilities as Phoenix Buchanan, who dons each of his ridiculous disguises with a kind of egotistical obliviousness that Grant is perfect at pulling off.&quot; Grant went on to win London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Supporting Actor of the Year and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. Grant&#x27;s performance was ranked as the 22nd greatest movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019.

===2018–present: Mature career renaissance===

In 2018, Grant returned to television screens after 25 years, as Jeremy Thorpe opposite Ben Whishaw as Norman Josiffe in the BBC One miniseries &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, which marked his second collaboration with director Stephen Frears. The miniseries, and in particular Grant, were widely and highly praised. &quot;Digital Spy&quot;&#x27;s review stated that &quot;There&#x27;s always been a bit of the devil in Grant&#x27;s best turns, and in Thorpe, a man with a fully-realised dark side, he&#x27;s found his richest part in years&quot;. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote, &quot;Hugh Grant is Thorpe, and everything about his performance is exactly so. It&#x27;s the role of Grant&#x27;s life, and he performs it even more brilliantly than he did Phoenix Buchanan in &quot;Paddington 2&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s become tediously predictable to praise this drama but, as Thorpe, Hugh Grant really has proved he&#x27;s getting better as he&#x27;s getting older&quot;. Grant was nominated for several awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.

In 2019, Grant played another against-type role, in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;, his second collaboration with the director following &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; Grant plays Fletcher, a seedy and unscrupulous private investigator, which he called &quot;a fun bit of casting&quot; referring to his Hacked Off campaigning. He has stated he based his character on tabloid reporters who &quot;used to be my enemies and now they&#x27;re my friends&quot;. Even though the film received mostly mixed reviews, Grant&#x27;s performance was praised. Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called Grant &quot;a beating comic heart&quot; of the film, adding that &quot;he weighs up every wry line with relish, and Ritchie makes strong use of his deadpan comic talents.&quot; Joe Morgenstern of &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; also highly praised his work, writing, &quot;[I]n a word, Mr. Grant is sensational. In two more words, he&#x27;s absolutely hilarious; it&#x27;s some of the best work he&#x27;s done on screen.&quot;

In 2020, Grant starred in HBO miniseries &quot;The Undoing&quot;, opposite Nicole Kidman and Donald Sutherland. The miniseries was premiered on 25 October 2020 to mixed reviews, though Grant&#x27;s performance was widely acclaimed. Film critic Caryn James said Grant has the &quot;richest part&quot; and added, &quot;He sharply defines Jonathan as a slippery character, and walks the line expertly to keep us off guard. How much should we trust Jonathan? When he starts confessing some secrets, is all or any of it true? With this role and that in the recent &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, Grant has become expert at bringing his charm to darker characters.&quot; Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com was less impressed with the series but called Grant&#x27;s performance as the &quot;series-best&quot;. Grant received a Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination for his performance.
In 2023, Grant reunited with Guy Ritchie for the action &quot;Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre&quot; alongside Jason Statham and Aubrey Plaza. The movie was originally planned to be released on early 2022 but had several delays. While the film was a box office flop with mixed reviews, Grant&#x27;s performance still received mostly positive response. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said Grant &quot;delivers a fantastic character performance&quot; and &quot;is so committed that he throws off the balance of the ensemble because no one else is as good as he is&quot;. He next appeared as an ambitious rogue and con artist Forge in the fantasy adventure film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;. Jonah Nink of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised his performance by saying &quot;None of the cast holds a fireball to Hugh Grant, however, who owns every second of his goofball performance as one of the film&#x27;s villains.&quot;

Also in 2023, Grant appeared as an Oompa-Loompa in &quot;Wonka&quot;, a film which serves as a prequel to the Roald Dahl novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, exploring Willy Wonka&#x27;s origins. In selecting Grant for the role, &quot;Wonka&quot; director Paul King told &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, &quot;Going back to the book, and reading all those poems, and hearing [the Oompa Loompas&#x27;] voice as a very sort of cynical, sarcastic, cruel, funny, but wicked voice, I went, &#x27;Oh... That&#x27;s sort of a bit like Hugh! Despite initial backlash from the dwarfism community over his casting, Grant ultimately received praise for his performance, with Nick Levine of &quot;NME&quot; writing &quot;A scene-stealing Grant provides the comic highlights as Lofty, a supercilious Oompa Loompa with a grudge against Chalamet&#x27;s title character, Willy Wonka.&quot; In 2024, Grant had a guest appearance in Stephen Frears-directed, Kate Winslet-starring HBO limited series &quot;The Regime&quot;, for which he was nominated for Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor. The same year he played a fictional version of Thurl Ravenscroft who voiced Tony the Tiger in the Jerry Seinfeld comedy film &quot;Unfrosted&quot;. Grant&#x27;s performance was praised with Matt Schimkowitz of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; describing him as the film&#x27;s &quot;MVP&quot; and William Bibbiani of &quot;TheWrap&quot; writing that he &quot;has the film&#x27;s only consistently funny subplot&quot;.

Grant next starred in the A24 horror film &quot;Heretic&quot; (2024). The film received mostly positive reviews, with &quot;Variety&quot; saying it&#x27;s yet another &quot;wildly against-type&quot; role in his career. Bilge Ebiri of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; said it was a &quot;riveting turn&quot; for Grant. For his performance, he has received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In 2025, Grant returned to the romantic comedy genre in a supporting role, reprising his role as Daniel Cleaver in &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot;. Grant has stated that his role is brief and the film has more dramatic depth than previous parts, claiming the script has made him cry. The film has received a positive reception and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; review commented: &quot;Grant, who scores many of the script’s best lines, brings a shot of mischievous vitality every time he’s onscreen, as well as some poignant commentary on mortality and lasting connection during a sobering juncture for Daniel. The actor’s career renaissance of the past decade has made him a value-added bonus to pretty much any project in which he appears.&quot; In a negative review of the film, &quot;The Guardian&quot; still praised Grant&#x27;s performance, citing him as the only cast member, alongside Emma Thompson, who doesn&#x27;t phone it in.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Over his career Grant has received numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Volpi Cup for Best Actor as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards and four Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Screen persona==
Grant began his career as a character actor but became predominantly a comedy (especially a romantic comedy) actor from his rise to stardom in mid-1990s until the 2010s. He said he moved away from romantic comedies after the failure of &quot;Did You Hear About the Morgans?&quot; (2009). In a 2020 interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, he said: &quot;I got old and ugly and I&#x27;m not appropriate for romantic comedy films anymore, which has been a great blessing&quot;. Even though his recent credits include political dramas like &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot; and crime films like &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;, Grant is still often associated with his Richard Curtis-scripted romantic comedy films. In the British press, it is common to compare young romantic comedy actors to him.

Remarking upon his romantic comedy star era, some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, while some others have dismissed Grant as a &quot;&quot;. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a longtime collaborator, said, &quot;His range hasn&#x27;t been fully tested, but each performance is unique.&quot; Many of Grant&#x27;s films of the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Rita Kempley, due to Grant&#x27;s &quot;comic overreactions—the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids&quot;. She added: &quot;He&#x27;s got more tics than Benny Hill.&quot; His penchant for conveying his characters&#x27; feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, Grant must get &quot;his jiving and shucking under control&quot;. Film historian David Thomson opined in &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot; that the actor equated merely &quot;itchy mannerisms&quot; with screen acting.

Grant&#x27;s screen persona in his films of the 2000s gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally &quot;gone [were] the self-conscious &#x27;Aren&#x27;t I adorable&#x27; mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies&quot;. According to Carina Chocano, amongst film critics, the two tropes most commonly associated with Grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; and &quot;About a Boy&quot; and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself.

Nonetheless, Grant has occasionally acted in dramas. He played a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for young actors in the drama film &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot;, which received critical praise, and for &quot;a very quiet, dignified&quot; performance as Frédéric Chopin in James Lapine&#x27;s biopic film &quot;Impromptu&quot;. In 2012, he played six &quot;incredibly evil&quot; characters in the epic drama film &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, an experience he has talked about positively, saying:

After &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, Grant has never starred in a romantic comedy film with exceptions of the dramedy &quot;The Rewrite&quot; (2014), where &quot;romantic comedy is only a small part of it.&quot; and his brief return as his &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; character Daniel Cleaver in &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot; (2025). Grant is known as a meticulous performer who approaches his roles like a character actor, working hard to make his acting appear spontaneous. In a career spanning more than 35 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance. However, in 2020, after moving on to more character roles, he has stated that he &quot;enjoys acting now&quot;.

==Personality==
Grant has expressed boredom with playing the celebrity in the press and is known in the media for his guarded privacy. On probing of his personal life, he has remained steadfast in &quot;offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough&quot;. He has described himself as a reluctant actor, has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be &quot;a phase&quot; in his life, lasting no more than ten years.

A 2007 &quot;Vogue&quot; profile referred to him as a man with a &quot;professionally misanthropic mystique&quot;. He has expressed distaste for focus groups, market research, and emphasis on opening weekend box-office numbers, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s so destructive to the filmmaking process. What was wrong with the way they used to release films, more slowly, let them build?&quot; The director Mike Newell has said: &quot;There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that&#x27;s gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy.&quot; Filmmaker Paul Weitz said that Grant is funny and that &quot;he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless&quot;. British newspapers regularly refer to him as &quot;grumpy&quot;.

Grant is a self-confessed &quot;committed and passionate&quot; perfectionist on a film set. The American film critic Dave Kehr has written that Grant &quot;is known in the film industry as a meticulous performer who takes his time to prepare a role – someone who works hard to make it look easy – though that isn&#x27;t a trait he admires in himself&quot;. He is noted by co-workers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard.

He dropped his agent in 2006, ending a 10-year relationship with CAA. He has proclaimed in interviews that he does not listen to external views on his career: &quot;They&#x27;ve known for years that I have total control. I&#x27;ve never taken any advice on anything.&quot;

In 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a &quot;highly defamatory&quot; article published in January 1995. The company&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Today&quot;, which ceased publication the following November, had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a &quot;foul-mouthed tongue lashing&quot; on the set of &quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain&quot;.

On 27 April 2007, he accepted undisclosed damages from Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles&#x27; &quot;allegations and factual assertions are false&quot;. Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: &quot;I was tired of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.&quot; He went on to take the opportunity to stress, &quot;I&#x27;m also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called &#x27;close friends&#x27; or &#x27;close sources&#x27; on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist.&quot;

=== Legal issues ===

On 27 June 1995, Grant was arrested in Los Angeles, California, in a police vice operation near Sunset Boulevard for receiving oral sex in a public place from Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown. He pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180 by Judge Robert J. Sandoval, was placed on two years&#x27; summary probation, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program.

The arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of his first major studio film, &quot;Nine Months&quot;, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant did not make excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; Grant answered, &quot;I think you know in life what&#x27;s a good thing to do and what&#x27;s a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it.&quot;

On &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, he declined host Larry King&#x27;s repeated invitations to probe his psyche, saying that psychoanalysis was &quot;more of an American syndrome&quot; and he himself was &quot;a bit old fashioned&quot;. He told the host: &quot;I don&#x27;t have excuses.&quot; CNN reported that &quot;Many are also applauding Grant for his refreshing honesty in a culture that has become fed up with overuse of the word &#x27;abuse,&#x27; but Grant did not resort to an excuse.&quot; Radio host Scott Shannon said, &quot;He went ahead and faced the music and handled it with tongue [in] cheek.&quot;

In April 2007, he was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo Ian Whittaker. Grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident. Charges were dropped on 1 June 2007 by the Crown Prosecution Service on the grounds of &quot;insufficient evidence&quot;.

=== Phone hacking exposé ===

In April 2011, Grant published an article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; titled &quot;The Bugger, Bugged&quot; about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for &quot;News of the World&quot;. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;News of the World&quot;, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron&#x27;s inaction could be explained by self-interest: &quot;Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament – that Cameron&#x27;s either a liar or an idiot.&quot;

When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to &quot;drag their feet&quot; on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch&#x27;s journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: &quot;20 percent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what&#x27;s wrong with that, anyway? It doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone particularly.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his &quot;turning the tables&quot; on a tabloid journalist.

While the allegations regarding the &quot;News of the World&quot; continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of murdered Milly Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, culminating in his appearance on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; in July 2011. Grant later said: &quot;It&#x27;s been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I&#x27;ve been doing for the last 25 years.&quot;

On 5 February 2018, Mirror Group Newspapers apologised for its actions towards Grant and other public figures, calling the affair &quot;morally wrong&quot;. This came after Grant accepted a six-figure sum to settle a High Court action. He donated the payout to the press campaign group &quot;Hacked Off&quot;.

In April 2024 Grant announced that he had settled a case against the publisher of &quot;The Sun&quot;, News Group Newspapers (NGN). In the case, Grant had claimed journalists employed by NGN had used private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house. Grant said he &quot;did not want to accept&quot; the &quot;enormous sum of money&quot; he had been offered to settle—but that a trial was likely to prove &quot;very expensive&quot;. Grant further stated that had he proceeded he would have faced a bill of up to £10 million even if he had won the case. NGN denied the claims against it.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
In 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production &quot;Remando Al Viento&quot; (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron&#x27;s former lover Claire Clairmont. He began dating Hurley during filming and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention. While dating Hurley, Grant gained international notoriety for soliciting the services of prostitute Divine Brown, in 1995. They separated in May 2000. Grant is godfather to Hurley&#x27;s son Damian, born in 2002.

Grant has five children with two women. In September 2011, he had a daughter with Tinglan Hong, who was variously misreported in the press as a receptionist at a Chinese restaurant in London or a Chinese actress. His daughter&#x27;s Chinese name is Jing Xi (驚喜), meaning &quot;happy surprise&quot;. Grant and Hong had a &quot;fleeting affair&quot;, according to his publicist. In 2012, he stated that Hong had been &quot;badly treated&quot; by the media; the press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter, with Hong obtaining an injunction to allow him to visit them in peace.

In September 2012, Grant&#x27;s second child, a son, was born to Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein. Later, Grant reunited briefly with Hong, and she gave birth to Grant&#x27;s third child, a son, in December 2012.

Grant&#x27;s daughters with Eberstein were born in December 2015 and March 2018. He and Eberstein married on 25 May 2018.

===Political views===
In 2011, Grant appeared at the Liberal Democrats&#x27; conference on the News International phone-hacking scandal, where he briefly met then-party leader Nick Clegg. Grant said that he was attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that &quot;You, more than any of the other parties, have a good bill of health. You have never been in bed with these scumbags.&quot;

In the 2015 general election, Grant expressed support for Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander and later hosted a dinner for the Liberal Democrats, in which he met the winner of a draw of donors to the Liberal Democrats. In an email sent by former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, Grant wrote: &quot;I am not a Lib Dem, a Tory, a Labourite or anything in particular but I recognise political guts.&quot; In the 2015 election, he endorsed two Labour candidates: Tom Watson and his former agent, Michael Foster.

During the 2019 general election Grant campaigned for tactical voting to stop a Conservative majority and Brexit. He was seen canvassing with Liberal Democrats candidates, Labour candidates, and independent Dominic Grieve.

In the 2024 general election, Grant publicly endorsed Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, for the newly-established Bristol Central seat. Grant stated that Denyer was &quot;a politician with integrity, who puts the public first&quot;.

=== Sport ===

As a young boy, he played rugby union on his school&#x27;s first XV team at centre and also played football. He is a fan of Fulham. He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south-west London after college and remains an &quot;impassioned Fulham supporter&quot;. He is also a supporter of Italian club Como. His other interests include tennis and snooker.

In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England v Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: &quot;I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen&quot;.

=== Relationships with co-stars ===
In 2018, Grant mentioned the on-set tension that he and Robert Downey Jr. had, stating: &quot;He [Downey] hated me. He took one look at me and wanted to kill me. I was so hurt.&quot; After Grant confirmed their decades-long feud, Downey went on Twitter to publicly make amends with him, to which Grant agreed.

In addition to the confirmation, Grant also said that he and Drew Barrymore did not get along during production of &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot;. &quot;Well, Drew, I think did hate me a bit. But I admired her. We just were very different human beings,&quot; Grant said. &quot;She was very L.A. and I was an old grumpy Londoner. The funny thing is, although it was fractionally tense on the set of that film, I think the chemistry is rather good between us. Sometimes tension makes a good crackle.&quot; Barrymore had also been one out of three leading ladies Grant listed whom he did not get along with, the others being Julianne Moore and Rachel Weisz. However, on a &quot;Graham Norton Show&quot; appearance, Grant told Graham Norton he did not know why he mentioned Weisz and he was probably &quot;going for a &#x27;comedy triple&#x27;&quot;. He is now on good terms with Barrymore and appeared on &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot;.

Grant has praised many other female co-stars, including Sandra Bullock, Sarah Jessica Parker, Emma Thompson, and Meryl Streep, who co-starred with him in &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; and was &quot;a genius&quot; according to Grant. He referred to his &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; co-star Renée Zellweger as &quot;delightful&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
Grant is a patron of the DIPEx Charity, which operates the website Healthtalkonline. He is also patron of the Fynvola Foundation, named after his late mother; it supports the Lady Dane Farmhouse, a home in Faversham for adults with learning disabilities.

Since his mother&#x27;s death in 2001, Grant has worked as a fundraiser and ambassador for Marie Curie Cancer Care, promoting the charity&#x27;s annual Great Daffodil Appeal on several occasions. He is also a patron of Pancreatic Cancer Action.

In December 2023, Grant worked with Hammersmith and Fulham Council to support their annual &quot;Big H&amp;F Christmas Day Lunch&quot;, with Grant spending Christmas Day serving Christmas dinner to elderly residents who might otherwise spend Christmas alone, and be at risk of social isolation and loneliness.

===Investments===
In 2001 Grant bought the print &quot;Liz&quot; by Andy Warhol for £2m. He sold it in 2007 for £13m.

<text>The Bomfunk MC&#x27;s is a Finnish hip hop group that was active from 1998 to 2005, before reuniting in 2018. The group&#x27;s frontman is rapper B.O. Dubb (born Raymond Ebanks, formerly known as B.O.W.), and the main producer is Jaakko Salovaara, also known as JS16.

==Career==
===1999–2005===
The band&#x27;s debut release was the 1999 album &quot;In Stereo&quot; (Sony Music), which included the singles &quot;Freestyler&quot;, &quot;Uprocking Beats&quot;, and &quot;B-Boys &amp; Flygirls&quot;, all of which gained popularity in the United Kingdom. &quot;Uprocking Beats&quot; reached the number one position on the Finnish Dance charts. &quot;In Stereo&quot; sold over 600,000 units.

The album&#x27;s success led to the release of &quot;Freestyler&quot; in Scandinavia and Germany. By 2000, &quot;Freestyler&quot; had become popular across Europe, becoming the region&#x27;s highest-selling single of the year. The single also reached the number one position in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany, and peaked at number two in the United Kingdom.
The Bomfunk MC&#x27;s won the 2000 Best Nordic Act award at the MTV Europe Music Awards.

In 2002, the group released their second album, &quot;Burnin&#x27; Sneakers&quot;, which included the singles &quot;Super Electric&quot;, &quot;Live Your Life&quot; featuring Max&#x27;C, and &quot;(Crack It!) Something Goin&#x27; On&quot; with Jessica Folcker. While this album received less international attention, it sold well in Finland. &quot;Something Goin&#x27; On&quot; reached the top 10 in Germany.

In September 2002, DJ Gismo left the band (later joining the band Stonedeep) and was promptly replaced by Riku Pentti (DJ) and Okke Komulainen (keyboards). After their addition, Bomfunk MC&#x27;s released a special remix of &quot;Back to Back&quot;.

In 2004, the group released their third and final album, &quot;Reverse Psychology&quot;, under Universal Music. This was preceded by the single &quot;No Way in Hell&quot;. Later that year, they released another single, &quot;Hypnotic&quot;, featuring Elena Mady. Half of the album was produced by JS16, while the other half was produced by Pentti, Komulainen, and Ville Mäkinen, collectively known as The Skillsters Plus One.

&quot;Reverse Psychology&quot; and its singles received limited attention outside the Nordic countries. Both singles reached the German top 100 but failed to chart elsewhere in Western Europe. Fan reception was mixed, as many fans continued to see DJ Gismo as a key figure in the band, despite his minimal involvement in the band&#x27;s music production, apart from providing scratches. Remixes attributed to DJ Gismo were actually produced by JS16, the band&#x27;s main producer.

In 2006, Bomfunk MC&#x27;s toured New Zealand during university orientation, performing in Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, Hamilton, and Auckland in support of their album &quot;Reverse Psychology&quot;.

===2019–present===
Many of the band&#x27;s collaborators pursued other musical projects, activities, or faded into obscurity. The band&#x27;s main producer and mentor, JS16, remained musically active as a solo artist; in 2007, he released his first solo track in over five years, &quot;Rosegarden,&quot; which gained significant club play. He is also a successful remixer and forms half of the popular dance act Dallas Superstars.

In the summer of 2019, the band made a comeback with their classic lineup. They performed at several festivals, debuting two new tracks, &quot;Can&#x27;t Runaway&quot; and &quot;Mic Drop.&quot; B.O. Dubb and DJ Gismo participated, along with their producer JS16, who officially became a member of the group.

In February 2019, the video for &quot;Freestyler&quot; was reshot as a tribute to the 20th anniversary of its release. The new version features the original band members and re-enacts scenes from the original, but with a modern twist. This includes replacing the Sony mini-disc player that controlled the music with a smartphone, changing the main character from male to female, and incorporating modern dance styles. The video was shot in Belgrade, Serbia.

<doc id="170784" wikidata="Q5750307" url="?curid=170784" title="HiM (American band)">
<text>HiM is a dub-influenced post-rock group formed in 1995 by Doug Scharin, drummer for the bands Codeine, Rex and June of 44. Their first album, &quot;Egg&quot;, was their most dub-based effort. Each successive album has gone more in a quasi-world music direction. After some recording for &quot;Crooklyn Dub Consortium&quot; and Wordsound, &quot;Interpretive Belief System&quot;, HiM settled on a lineup of Scharin with Bundy K. Brown, Rob Mazurek and Jeff Parker, members or occasional members of Tortoise and Isotope 217. Their first album was the underground hit &quot;Sworn Eyes&quot;, produced by Doug Scharin. A few personnel changes followed, and the revamped lineup including members of June of 44. HiM released &quot;Our Point of Departure&quot; in 1999, which signified a very clear shift toward a more jazz-like sound, followed by a major American and European tour. In 2003, HiM released &quot;Many in High Places Are Not Well&quot; on Fat Cat Records, which was received as their most successful and fully realized release. &quot;Peoples&quot; was released in mid-2006, featuring a cleaner sound with more vocals than any of HiM&#x27;s previous releases. Included in this line-up are Martin Perna and Jordan McLean from Antibalas, Griffin Rodriguez from Need New Body/Icy Demons, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade). The latest HiM records, &quot;1110&quot; and &quot;ん&quot;, released in 2008 and 2009 on Afterhours in Tokyo, are collaborations between Doug Scharin, Josh Larue and the Tokyo-based group, Ultra Living.

<doc id="170787" wikidata="Q848590" url="?curid=170787" title="Bounty Killer">
<text>Rodney Basil Price OD (born 12 June 1972), known as Bounty Killer, is a Jamaican reggae and dancehall deejay. AllMusic describes him as &quot;one of the most aggressive dancehall stars of the &#x27;90s, a street-tough rude boy with an unrepentant flair for gun talk&quot;. He is considered one of the best dancehall lyricists of all time.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Price moved to Kingston at an early age, along with his mother and siblings. His father owned and ran the Black Scorpio sound system and Price started his musical career as a sound system deejay in his early teens. At the age of 14, Price was shot by a stray bullet during a gunfight between rival political factions, and while convalescing in hospital decided on the name Bounty Killer. After recovering, he increased his performances on a greater number of sound systems, and turned his attention towards recording.
===1990s===
Before his entry into the dancehall industry, Bounty Killer was in the retail industry as an entrepreneur selling figurines. He was then encouraged to record at King Jammy&#x27;s Recording Studio in Kingston. Price eventually recorded with King Jammy, the first session being in Spring 1992. One of his first tunes was the &quot;Coppershot&quot;, which Jammy was unwilling to release due to its lyrics glorifying gun culture. Jammy&#x27;s brother Uncle T disagreed and released the single himself, which went on to become an underground hit in both Jamaica and New York.

In 1993, Price performed at the popular reggae festival Sting (held in Portmore, Jamaica every year on Boxing Day), whereupon he had a high-profile clash with fellow deejay Beenie Man. The rivalry continued through the 1990s, with both accusing the other of a stolen act. They settled their differences after both realized the negative effect their feud was having on the industry. He has also had heated rivalries with several other top deejays, including Merciless, Super Cat and Vybz Kartel, throughout his career.

He increased control over his output in 1995 by leaving Jammy and setting up his own Scare Dem Productions company and Priceless Records label.

During the 1990s, Price voiced for several producers and labels in Jamaica, releasing songs such as &quot;Defend the Poor&quot;, &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Book, Book, Book&quot;, &quot;Babylon System&quot; &quot;Down in the Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Look Good&quot;. At about this time, he became known in USA and in Europe, recording with such artists as Busta Rhymes, No Doubt, Masta Killa, The Fugees, Wyclef Jean, Mobb Deep, Capone-N-Noreaga, Swizz Beatz and AZ.

In the mid-1990s, he began releasing albums, with four released in 1994. His 1996 album &quot;My Xperience&quot; was hugely successful, spending six months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; reggae chart.

In 1997, Bounty Killer made a cover version of Rose Royce hit single &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; with Swedish singer Robyn. The song was a success in the Caribbean. It was featured in She&#x27;s So Lovely (Sean Penn film).

In 1998, he contributed the song &quot;Deadly Zone&quot; to the album &quot;Blade: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture&quot;.

Price has expressed disdain for popular rap, which he called &quot;embarrassing to reggae,&quot; even when collaborating with Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and others he considers hardcore.

===2000s===
Further success followed with albums such as &quot;Ghetto Dictionary Volume I: Art of War&quot; and &quot;Ghetto Dictionary Volume II: Mystery&quot;, the latter receiving a Grammy nomination, which he lost to veteran Reggae producer Lee Scratch Perry, Bounty Killer later admitting that he felt he should have won the award, as Lee Scratch should have won that category during his glory days. In 2006, he signed with VP Records and released the compilation album &quot;Nah No Mercy – The Warlord Scrolls&quot; on 7 November 2006. He has been credited with having inspired many young artists such as Vybz Kartel, Mavado and Elephant Man and several other members of The Alliance.

In 2002, a collaboration with No Doubt, the song &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, won Bounty Killer his first Grammy Award, for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a duo or group. The win made Bounty Killer one of the few hardcore Dancehall artists to win a Grammy Award. Hey Baby also sold over a million copies making it Bounty Killer&#x27;s first single to go platinum. The deejay was also voted &#x27;Guinness greatest Dancehall icon&#x27; in 2012 and later won deejay of the year in 2013, in The STAR People&#x27;s Choice Award presented by The Jamaica Gleaner.

In 2003, Price canceled two of his concerts after the LGBT magazine &quot;Outrage!&quot; petitioned Scotland Yard for his arrest, claiming songs about bashing gays would incite harassment against the gay community. He returned in 2006 after a three-year hiatus, performing uncensored lyrics at several venues without recrimination. He has since directed his focus to social commentary and party lyrics, admitting that he will not pay attention to nor attack the gay community in his music.

In 2014, Bounty Killer and long-term rival Beenie Man put aside their differences and recorded a single together, &quot;Legendary&quot;. The two performed a well-received Verzuz battle together on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on 23 May 2020.

Bounty revealed as of June 2020, he had a new album in the works with Damian Marley as the executive producer.

===Personal life===
Price was arrested twice at the annual Reggae Sumfest: he was arrested but not charged in a 2001 altercation with another performer, and arrested and charged in 2008 for using profanity during his performance. He was also arrested on 3 February 2009, after allegedly running seven traffic lights in Kingston, Jamaica, and charged with refusal to take a breathalyzer test and disobeying red lights.

Price was arrested by police in June 2006, and charged with assaulting the mother of his child. According to the &quot;Jamaica Star&quot;, &quot;The complainant was allegedly punched in the face several times, dragged some distance away and her head slammed into a wall.&quot;

===Foundation===
In 2018, Price started a charity called the Bounty Killer Foundation with a series of donations to the Kingston Public Hospital in Jamaica which he said had treated his gun shot wound in 1986. In 2020, Price through his foundation made a cash donation to Jamaican reggae singer, Junior Byles who suffered from mental illness and cancer.

<text>Simon Phillip Hugh Callow (born 15 June 1949) is an English actor. Known as a character actor on stage and screen, he has received numerous accolades including an Olivier Award and Screen Actors Guild Award as well as nominations for two BAFTA Awards. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to acting by Queen Elizabeth II in 1999.

Callow rose to prominence originating the title role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the 1979 Peter Shaffer play &quot;Amadeus,&quot; for which he received a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Callow joined the Miloš Forman 1984 film adaptation, this time portraying Emanuel Schikaneder. In 1992, Callow won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director of a Musical for &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;. As an actor, he won acclaim for his comedic roles in &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985) and &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) earning a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for each. Other notable roles include in &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004).

His television roles include Tom Chance in the Channel 4 series &quot;Chance in a Million&quot; (1984) and The Duke of Sandringham in the series &quot;Outlander&quot; from 2014 to 2016. He portrayed Napoleon in &quot;The Man of Destiny&quot; (1981), and Charles Dickens in numerous television projects. He has also appeared on numerous shows such as &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Rome&quot;, &quot;Angels in America&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Galavant&quot;, &quot;Hawkeye&quot;, and &quot;The Witcher&quot;.

==Early years==
Callow was born on 15 June 1949 in Streatham, South London, the son of Yvonne Mary (née Guise), a secretary and Neil Francis Callow, a businessman. His father was of French descent and his mother was of Danish and German ancestry. His father left when Simon was 18 months old, and he was brought up by his mother and grandmothers. He and his mother travelled to Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia) when he was nine to try and reconcile with his father. This did not happen and Callow was sent for three years to boarding school in South Africa. He and his mother returned to Britain when he was twelve. He was raised as a Catholic. Callow was a student at the London Oratory School in West Brompton, and then went on to study briefly at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, where he was active in the gay liberation movement. He gave up his degree course after a year to take a three-year acting course at the Drama Centre London.

==Career==
===Acting===
Callow&#x27;s immersion in the theatre began after he wrote a fan letter to Sir Laurence Olivier, the artistic director of the National Theatre, and received a response suggesting he join their box-office staff. While watching actors rehearse, he realised he wanted to act.

Callow made his stage debut in 1973, appearing in &quot;The Three Estates&quot; at the Assembly Rooms Theatre, Edinburgh. In the early 1970s, he joined the Gay Sweatshop theatre company and performed in Martin Sherman&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Passing By&quot;. In 1977, he took various parts in the Joint Stock Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Epsom Downs&quot; and in 1979, he starred in Snoo Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Soul of the White Ant&quot; at the Soho Poly.

Callow appeared as Verlaine in &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (1982), Lord Foppington in &quot;The Relapse&quot; (1983) and the title role in &quot;Faust&quot; (1988) at the Lyric Hammersmith, where he also directed &quot;The Infernal Machine&quot; (with Dame Maggie Smith) in 1986. In 1985, he played Molina in &quot;Kiss of the Spiderwoman&quot; at the Bush Theatre, London. He played Mozart in the premiere of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Amadeus&quot; at the National Theatre (1979), also appearing in the 1983 BBC original cast radio production. He later wrote of having &quot;discovered Mozart quite early: the operas, the symphonies, the concertos, the wind serenades were all very much part of my musical landscape when I was asked to play the part of the composer in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Amadeus&quot;; possibly this was one of the reasons I got the job.&quot; He appeared at the National Theatre as Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1979) and Fulganzio in &quot;Life of Galileo&quot; (1980).

Callow appeared with Saeed Jaffrey in the 1994 British television drama series &quot;Little Napoleons&quot;, playing a scheming Conservative councillor in local government. In 1996, Callow directed Cantabile in three musical pieces (&quot;Commuting&quot;, &quot;The Waiter&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Ricercare No. 4&quot;) composed by his friend Stephen Oliver. &quot;Ricercare No. 4&quot; was commissioned by Callow especially for Cantabile. He voice-acted the sly and traitorous Wolfgang in &quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot;. In 2004, he appeared on a Comic Relief episode of &quot;Little Britain&quot; for charity causes. In 2006, he wrote a piece for the BBC1 programme &quot;This Week&quot; bemoaning the lack of characters in modern politics. He has starred as Count Fosco, the villain of Wilkie Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, in film (1997) and on stage (2005, in the Andrew Lloyd Webber &quot;musical&quot; in the West End).

Callow starred in the three-part original Gold comedy &quot;The Rebel&quot; in 2016.

In 2022, he joined the cast of the UK revival of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot; replacing Gary Wilmot as Elisha Whitney. The production would complete a UK tour before finishing with a run at the Barbican Centre.
From 11 July to 3 August 2008, Callow appeared at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada in &quot;There Reigns Love&quot;, a performance of the sonnets of William Shakespeare. The same year, he appeared at the Edinburgh Festival, performing &quot;Dr. Marigold&quot; and &quot;Mr. Chops&quot; by Charles Dickens, adapted and directed by Patrick Garland; repeating them from December 2009 to January 2010 at the Riverside Studios and on tour in 2011.

In February 2008, he played the psychiatrist in the Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Equus&quot;.

Between March and August 2009, he played Pozzo in Sean Mathias&#x27;s production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; by Samuel Beckett with Ian McKellen as Estragon, Patrick Stewart as Vladimir, and Ronald Pickup as Lucky. The production toured Britain before a run at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, in London

From June to November 2010, he appeared in a national tour of a new one-man play, &quot;Shakespeare: the Man from Stratford&quot;, written by Jonathan Bate, directed by Tom Cairns, and produced by the Ambassador Theatre Group. The play was renamed &quot;Being Shakespeare&quot; for its West End debut at the Trafalgar Studios, where it opened on 15 June 2011. It was revived at the same theatre in March 2012, prior to a run in New York City and Chicago. In March 2014, it returned to the West End, this time at the Harold Pinter Theatre.

In October 2014, Callow appeared in a comedy sketch made for Channel 4&#x27;s&quot; The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night&quot; to raise awareness of testicular cancer. The same year, he played the recurring role of the fictional Duke of Sandringham in the Starz period TV series, &quot;Outlander&quot;.

In December 2022, Callow appeared as Dick in the Christmas special of BBC dark comedy &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;, &quot;The Bones of St Nicholas&quot;.

===Film===
He made his first film appearance in 1984 as Schikaneder in &quot;Amadeus&quot;. The following year, he appeared as the Reverend Mr Beebe in &quot;A Room with a View&quot;. His first television role was in the &quot;Carry On Laughing&quot; episode &quot;Orgy and Bess&quot; in 1975, but it was cut from the final print. He starred in several series of the Channel 4 situation comedy &quot;Chance in a Million&quot;, as Tom Chance, an eccentric individual to whom coincidences happened regularly. Roles like this and his part in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; brought him to a wider audience. Callow portrayed Pliny the Elder in CBBC&#x27;s 2007 children&#x27;s drama series, &quot;Roman Mysteries&quot; in the episode &quot;The Secrets of Vesuvius&quot;. He played Armand Duquesne in Marvel&#x27;s Hawkeye on Disney+.

===Directing===
Callow also directed plays and wrote: his &quot;Being An Actor&quot; (1984) was a critique of &#x27;director dominated&#x27; theatre, in addition to containing autobiographical sections relating to his early career as an actor. In 1992, he directed the play &quot;Shades&quot; by Sharman MacDonald and the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, featuring costumes designed by Jasper Conran. In 1995, he directed a stage version of the classic French film &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

Among opera productions directed by Callow are a &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in Lucerne, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; for Scottish Opera in 1988, &quot;Il tritico&quot; for the Broomhill Trust, Kent in August 1995, Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Consul&quot; at Holland Park Opera, London in 1999 and &quot;Le roi malgré lui&quot; by Chabrier at Grange Park Opera in 2003. He also directed &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; at the Old Vic, London in 1991, with Wilhelmenia Fernandez in the title role.

One of Callow&#x27;s best-known books is &quot;Love Is Where It Falls&quot;, an analysis of his 11-year relationship with Peggy Ramsay (1908–91), a prominent British theatrical agent from the 1960s to the 1980s. He has also written extensively about Charles Dickens, whom he has played several times: in a one-man show, &quot;The Mystery of Charles Dickens&quot; by Peter Ackroyd; in the films &quot;Hans Christian Andersen: My Life as a Fairytale&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Carol: The Movie;&quot; and on television several times including &quot;An Audience with Charles Dickens&quot; (BBC, 1996) and in &quot;The Unquiet Dead&quot;, a 2005 episode of the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the 2011 season finale, again taking the role of Dickens.

In December 2004, he hosted the London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus Christmas Show, &quot;Make the Yuletide Gay&quot; at the Barbican Centre in London. He is currently one of the patrons of the Michael Chekhov Studio London.
In July 2006, the London Oratory School Schola announced Callow as one of their new patrons. In November 2007, he threatened to resign the post over controversy surrounding the Terrence Higgins Trust (an AIDS charity of which Callow is also a patron). Other patrons of the Catholic choir are Princess Michael of Kent and the Scottish composer James MacMillan. He reprised his role as Wolfgang in &quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot; and voice-acted the wild and action-seeking Hunter, as well.

===Author===
Callow has written biographies of Oscar Wilde, Charles Laughton, Orson Welles, and Richard Wagner. He has also written an anthology of Shakespeare passages, &quot;Shakespeare on Love&quot;, and contributed to Cambridge&#x27;s &quot;Actors on Shakespeare&quot; series.

A devotee of classical music, he has contributed articles to &quot;Gramophone&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

===Narration===
Callow was the reader of &quot;The Twits&quot; and &quot;The Witches&quot; in the Puffin Roald Dahl Audio Books Collection (), and has done audio versions of several abridged P.G. Wodehouse books that feature, among others, the fictional character Jeeves. They include &quot;Very Good, Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;. Callow is the reader of the audio book edition of William E. Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Michelangelo, God&#x27;s Architect&quot;, published by Princeton University Press. Callow narrated the audiobook of Robert Fagles&#x27; 2006 translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;The Aeneid&quot;. In November 2009, &quot;Mini Stories&quot;, a recording by the Caput Ensemble of Haflidi Hallgrimsson&#x27;s settings of the surreal poetry of Daniil Kharms, featuring Callow as the narrator, was released by Hyperion Records.

Callow played Stroganoff in the 1987 Saturday Night Theatre production of &quot;A Bullet in the Ballet&quot; dramatised by Pat Hooker on BBC Radio 4.

==Personal life==
Callow came out as gay in his 1984 book &quot;Being An Actor&quot;. He was listed 28th in &quot;The Independent&quot; 2007 listing of the most influential gay men and women in the UK. He married his partner Sebastian Fox in June 2016.

In an interview, Callow stated: I&#x27;m not really an activist, although I am aware that there are some political acts one can do that actually make a difference and I think my coming out as a gay man was probably one of the most valuable things I&#x27;ve done in my life. I don&#x27;t think any actor had done so voluntarily and I think it helped to change the culture.

Although he was a prominent supporter of Stonewall when it was set up in 1989, he has more recently distanced himself from the organisation due to its stance on trans self-identification.

In August 2014, Callow was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the referendum on that issue.

In the 1999 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to acting.

<doc id="170803" wikidata="Q331769" url="?curid=170803" title="Mood (psychology)">
<text>In psychology, a mood is an affective state. In contrast to emotions or feelings, moods are less specific, less intense and less likely to be provoked or instantiated by a particular stimulus or event. Moods are typically described as having either a positive or negative valence. In other words, people usually talk about being in a good mood or a bad mood. There are many different factors that influence mood, and these can lead to positive or negative effects on mood.

Mood also differs from temperament or personality traits which are even longer-lasting. Nevertheless, personality traits such as optimism and neuroticism predispose certain types of moods. Long-term disturbances of mood such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder are considered mood disorders. Mood is an internal, subjective state, but it often can be inferred from posture and other behaviors. &quot;We can be sent into a mood by an unexpected event, from the happiness of seeing an old friend to the anger of discovering betrayal by a partner. We may also fall into a mood.&quot;

==Etymology==

Etymologically, the word &quot;mood&quot; derives from the Old English which denoted military courage, but could also refer to a person&#x27;s humor, temper, or disposition at a particular time. The cognate Gothic translates both &quot;mood, spiritedness&quot; and &quot;anger&quot;.

The English word &quot;mood&quot; which means emotional condition or state of mind was originally derived from the Proto-Germanic root &quot;moda-&quot;.

==Types of mood==
===Positive mood===

Positive mood can be caused by many different aspects of life, as well as have certain effects on people as a whole. Good mood is usually considered a state without an identified cause; people cannot pinpoint exactly why they are in a good mood. People seem to experience a positive mood when they have a clean slate, have had a good night sleep, and feel no sense of stress in their life.

There have been many studies done on the effect of positive emotion on the cognitive mind and there is speculation that positive mood can affect our minds in good or bad ways. Generally, positive mood has been found to enhance creative problem solving and flexible yet careful thinking. Some studies have stated that positive moods let people think creatively, freely, and be more imaginative. Positive mood can also help individuals in situations in which heavy thinking and brainstorming are involved. In one experiment, individuals who were induced with a positive mood enhanced performance on the Remote Associates Task (RAT), a cognitive task that requires creative problem solving. Moreover, the study also suggests that being in a positive mood broadens or expands the breadth of attentional selection such that information that may be useful to the task at hand becomes more accessible for use. Consequently, greater accessibility of relevant information facilitates successful problem solving. Positive mood also facilitates resistance to temptations, especially with regard to unhealthy food choices. Interpersonal relationships have also been shown to have an effect on maintaining a positive mood. Social activities correlate with positive mood as well indicating that social interactions with people may increase an individual&#x27;s positive mood. Therefore, people that are isolated from society or in the out-group may have a more negative mood than individuals that have a strong social circle.

Positive mood has also been proven to show negative effects on cognition as well. According to the article &quot;Positive mood is associated with implicit use of distraction&quot;, &quot;There is also evidence that individuals in positive moods show disrupted performance, at least when distracting information is present&quot;. The article states that other things in their peripheral views can easily distract people who are in good moods; an example of this would be if you were trying to study in the library (considering you are in a positive mood) you see people constantly walking around or making small noises. The study is basically stating that it would be harder for positive moods to focus on the task at hand. In particular, happy people may be more sensitive to the hedonic consequences of message processing than sad people. Thus, positive moods are predicted to lead to decreased processing only when thinking about the message is mood threatening. In comparison, if message processing allows a person to maintain or enhance a pleasant state then positive moods need not lead to lower levels of message scrutiny than negative moods. It is assumed that initial information regarding the source either confirms or disconfirms mood-congruent expectations. Specifically, a positive mood may lead to more positive expectations concerning source trustworthiness or likability than a negative mood. As a consequence, people in a positive mood should be more surprised when they encounter an untrustworthy or dislikable source rather than a trustworthy or likable source.

===Negative mood===

Like positive moods, negative moods have important implications for human mental and physical wellbeing. Moods are basic psychological states that can occur as a reaction to an event or can surface for no apparent external cause. Since there is no intentional object that causes the negative mood, it has no specific start and stop date. It can last for hours, days, weeks, or longer. Negative moods can manipulate how individuals interpret and translate the world around them, and can also direct their behavior.

Negative moods can affect an individual&#x27;s judgment and perception of objects and events. In a study done by Niedenthal and Setterland (1994), research showed that individuals are tuned to perceive things that are congruent with their current mood. Negative moods, mostly low-intense, can control how humans perceive emotion-congruent objects and events. For example, Niedenthal and Setterland used music to induce positive and negative moods. Sad music was used as a stimulus to induce negative moods, and participants labeled other things as negative. This proves that people&#x27;s current moods tend to affect their judgments and perceptions. These negative moods may lead to problems in social relationships. For example, one maladaptive negative mood regulation is an overactive strategy in which individuals over dramatize their negative feelings in order to provoke support and feedback from others and to guarantee their availability. A second type of maladaptive negative mood regulation is a disabling strategy in which individuals suppress their negative feelings and distance themselves from others in order to avoid frustrations and anxiety caused by others&#x27; unavailability.

Negative moods have been connected with depression, anxiety, aggression, poor self-esteem, physiological stress and decrease in sexual arousal. In some individuals, there is evidence that depressed or anxious mood may increase sexual interest or arousal. In general, men were more likely than women to report increased sexual drive during negative mood states. Negative moods are labeled as nonconstructive because it can affect a person&#x27;s ability to process information; making them focus solely on the sender of a message, while people in positive moods will pay more attention to both the sender and the context of a message. This can lead to problems in social relationships with others.

Negative moods, such as anxiety, often lead individuals to misinterpret physical symptoms. According to Jerry Suls, a professor at the University of Iowa, people who are depressed and anxious tend to be in rumination. However, although an individual&#x27;s affective states can influence the somatic changes, these individuals are not hypochondriacs.

Although negative moods are generally characterized as bad, not all negative moods are necessarily damaging. The Negative State Relief Model states that human beings have an innate drive to reduce negative moods. People can reduce their negative moods by engaging in any mood-elevating behavior (called Mood repair strategies), such as helping behavior, as it is paired with positive value such as smiles and thank you. Thus negative mood increases helpfulness because helping others can reduce one&#x27;s own bad feelings.

==Factors which affect mood==
===Lack of sleep===

Sleep has a complex, and as yet not fully elucidated, relationship with mood. Most commonly if a person is sleep deprived he/she will become more irritable, angry, more prone to stress, and less energized throughout the day. &quot;Studies have shown that even partial sleep deprivation has a significant effect on mood. University of Pennsylvania researchers found that subjects who were limited to only 4.5 hours of sleep a night for one week reported feeling more stressed, angry, sad, and mentally exhausted. When the subjects resumed normal sleep, they reported a dramatic improvement in mood.&quot; Generally, evening oriented people, as compared to morning ones, show decreased energy and pleasantness and heightened tension.

However, in a subset of cases sleep deprivation can, paradoxically, lead to increased energy and alertness and enhanced mood. This effect is most marked in persons with an eveningness type (so called night-owls) and people suffering from depression. For this reason it has sometimes been used as a treatment for major depressive disorder.

=== Environment ===
Nature can also have a positive effect on mood. Studies have shown that exposure to natural environments increases positive affect and decreases negative affect, meaning that one&#x27;s mood is often better when in a nature setting. An example of this is how direct exposure to sunlight has been proven to improve mood and has been used to treat symptoms of depression. Further, walking outdoors as opposed to walking indoors made individuals much happier, which additionally illustrates that nature has a positive effect on our mood. While nature often improves our mood, it can worsen it as well. There is a common mood disorder called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) that often occurs during the winter months when there is less daylight and it is colder outside. SAD is characterized by depressed mood, increased appetite, and increased sleep. This displays how an individual&#x27;s mood can be negatively affected by nature as well. Studies have also shown that depending on the season, temperature can regulate mood.

===Nutrition===

Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women. Red meat is found to be protective against mood and anxiety disorders. Fruits and vegetables are associated with positive mood, independent of demographic or lifestyle factors. Research indicates that alcohol and energy drinks are associated with mood changes.

===Facial expression===

Research studies indicate that voluntary facial expressions, such as smiling, can produce effects on the body that are similar to those that result from the actual emotion, such as happiness. Paul Ekman and his colleagues studied facial expressions of emotions and linked specific emotions to the movement of corresponding facial muscles. Each basic emotion is associated with a distinctive facial expression, due to feedback from the expression that contributes to the emotional feeling. Ekman found that these expressions of emotion are universal and recognizable across widely divergent cultures.

=== Hormones ===
Hormones, which change with age, can also determine what type of mood someone is and how well they are able to regulate their moods.

==Mood disorders==

Depression, chronic stress, bipolar disorder, etc. are considered mood disorders. It has been suggested that such disorders result from chemical imbalances in the brain&#x27;s neurotransmitters, however some research challenges this hypothesis.

== Social mood ==
The idea of social mood as a &quot;collectively shared state of mind&quot; (Nofsinger 2005; Olson 2006) is attributed to Robert Prechter and his socionomics. The notion is used primarily in the field of economics (investments).

In sociology, philosophy, and psychology, crowd behavior is the formation of a &quot;common mood&quot; directed toward an object of attention.

<doc id="170807" wikidata="Q303438" url="?curid=170807" title="Mountain Meadows Massacre">
<text>The Mountain Meadows Massacre (September 7–11, 1857) was a series of attacks during the Utah War that resulted in the mass murder of at least 120 members of the Baker–Fancher wagon train. The massacre occurred in the southern Utah Territory at Mountain Meadows, and was perpetrated by settlers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) involved with the Utah Territorial Militia (officially called the Nauvoo Legion) who recruited and were aided by some Southern Paiute Native Americans. The wagon train, made up mostly of immigrant families from Arkansas, was bound for California, traveling on the Old Spanish Trail that passed through the Territory.

After arriving in Salt Lake City, the Baker–Fancher party made their way south along the Mormon Road, eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows. The party&#x27;s journey occurred amidst hostilities between Mormon settlers and the U.S. government, with war hysteria rampant amongst the Mormons. Acting on rumors of hostile behavior on the part of the travelers, local Mormon militia leaders, including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, made plans to attack them as they camped at the meadow. The leaders of the militia, wanting to give the impression of tribal hostilities, persuaded Southern Paiutes to join with a larger party of militiamen disguised as Native Americans in an attack on the wagon train. 

During the militia&#x27;s first assault, the travelers fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually, fear spread among the militia&#x27;s leaders that some immigrants had caught sight of the white men, likely discerning the actual identity of a majority of the attackers. As a result, militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the travelers. By this time, the travelers were running low on water and provisions, and allowed some members of the militiawho approached under a white flagto enter their camp. The militia members assured the immigrants they were protected, and after handing over their weapons, the immigrants were escorted away from their defensive position. After walking a distance from the camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the travelers. The perpetrators killed all the adults and older children in the group, in the end sparing only seventeen young children ages six and under.

Following the massacre, the perpetrators buried some of the remains but ultimately left most of the bodies exposed to wild animals and the climate. Local families took in the surviving children, with many of the victims&#x27; possessions and remaining livestock being auctioned off. Investigations, which were interrupted by the American Civil War, resulted in nine indictments in 1874. Of the men who were indicted, only Lee was tried in a court of law. After two trials in the Utah Territory, Lee was convicted by a jury, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on March 23, 1877.

Historians attribute the massacre to a combination of factors, including war hysteria about a possible invasion of Mormon territory and Mormon teachings against outsiders during the Mormon Reformation. Scholars debate whether senior leadership in the LDS Church, including Brigham Young, directly instigated the massacre or if responsibility for it lay only with the leaders of the militia.

==History==
===Baker–Fancher party===

In early 1857, the Baker–Fancher party was formed from several groups mainly from Marion, Crawford, Carroll and Johnson counties in northwestern Arkansas. They assembled into a wagon train at Beller&#x27;s Stand, south of Harrison, to emigrate to southern California. The group was initially referred to as both the Baker train and the Perkins train, but later referred to as the Baker–Fancher train (or party). It was named after &quot;Colonel&quot; Alexander Fancher who, having already made the journey to California twice before, had become its main leader. By contemporary standards the Baker–Fancher party was prosperous, carefully organized and well-equipped for the journey. They were joined along the way by families and individuals from other states, including Missouri. The group was relatively wealthy, and planned to restock its supplies in Salt Lake City, as did most wagon trains at the time.

===Interactions with Mormon settlers===

At the time of the Fanchers&#x27; arrival, the Utah Territory, though legally a democracy, was effectively a theocracy under the leadership of Brigham Young, the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who had established colonies along the California Trail and the Old Spanish Trail. U.S. President James Buchanan had recently issued an order to send federal troops to Utah, which led to rumors being spread in the territory about its motives. Young issued various orders that urged the local population to prepare for the arrival of the troops. Eventually Young issued a declaration of martial law.

The Baker–Fancher party was refused provisions in Salt Lake City and chose to leave there and take the Old Spanish Trail, which passed through southern Utah. In August 1857, the Mormon apostle George A. Smith traveled throughout the southern part of the territory instructing Mormon settlers to stockpile grain. While on his return trip to Salt Lake City, Smith camped near the Baker–Fancher party on August 25, 1857, at Corn Creek. They had traveled the south from Salt Lake City, and Jacob Hamblin suggested that the wagon train continue on the trail and rest their cattle at Mountain Meadows, which had good pasture and was adjacent to his homestead.

While most witnesses said that the Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about their supposed misdeeds. United States Army Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, and the findings were published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin&#x27;s account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek, resulting in the deaths of eighteen cows and two or three people who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. He also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party&#x27;s wealth.

===Conspiracy and siege===

The Baker–Fancher party left Corn Creek and continued the to Mountain Meadows, passing Parowan and Cedar City, southern Utah communities led respectively by Stake Presidents William H. Dame and Isaac C. Haight. Haight and Dame were, in addition, the senior regional military leaders of the Iron Military District of the Nauvoo Legion. Over half the employees of the Iron County iron manufacturing plant were in that militia district. 

As the party approached, several meetings were held in Cedar City and nearby Parowan by local LDS Church leaders pondering how to implement Young&#x27;s declaration of martial law. On the afternoon of Sunday, September 6, Haight held his weekly Stake High Council meeting after church services and brought up the issue of what to do with the immigrants. The plan for a Native American massacre was discussed, but not all the Council members agreed it was the right approach. The Council resolved to take no action until Haight sent a rider, James Haslam, out the next day to carry an express to Salt Lake City (a six-day round trip on horseback) for Young&#x27;s advice, as Utah did not yet have a telegraph system. Following the council, Haight decided to send a messenger Joseph Clewes south to John D. Lee. What Haight told Lee remains a mystery, but considering the timing it may have had something to do with Council&#x27;s decision to wait for advice from Young.

The dispirited Baker–Fancher party found water and fresh grazing for its livestock after reaching grassy, mountain-ringed Mountain Meadows, a widely known stopover on the old Spanish Trail, in early September. They anticipated several days of rest and recuperation there before the next would take them out of Utah. On September 7, the party was attacked by Nauvoo Legion militiamen dressed as Native Americans and some Native American Paiutes. The Baker–Fancher party defended itself by encircling and lowering their wagons, wheels chained together, along with digging shallow trenches and throwing dirt both below and into the wagons, which made a strong barrier. Seven immigrants were killed during the opening attack and buried somewhere within the wagon encirclement. Sixteen more were wounded. The attack continued for five days, during which the besieged families had little or no access to freshwater or game food and their ammunition was depleted. Meanwhile, organization among the local Mormon leadership reportedly broke down. Eventually, fear spread among the militia&#x27;s leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had probably discerned the identity of their attackers. This resulted in an order to kill all the emigrants, with the exception of small children.

===Killings and aftermath===

On Friday, September 11, 1857, two militiamen approached the Baker–Fancher party wagons with a white flag and were soon followed by Indian Agent and militia officer John D. Lee. Lee told the battle-weary emigrants that he had negotiated a truce with the Paiutes. Under Mormon protection, the wagon-train members would be escorted safely back to Cedar City, away, in exchange for turning all of their livestock and supplies over to the Native Americans. Accepting this offer, the emigrants were led out of their fortification, with the adult men being separated from the women and children. The men were paired with a militia escort and when the signal was given, the militiamen turned and shot the male members of the Baker–Fancher party standing by their side. The women and children were then ambushed and killed by more militia that were hiding in nearby bushes and ravines. Members of the militia were sworn to secrecy. A plan was set to blame the massacre on the Native Americans.

The militia did not kill small children who were deemed too young to relate what had happened. Nancy Huff, one of the seventeen survivors and just over four years old at the time of the massacre, recalled in an 1875 statement that an eighteenth survivor was killed directly in front of the other children. &quot;At the close of the massacre there was eighteen children still alive, one girl, some ten or twelve years old, they said was too big and could tell, so they killed her, leaving seventeen.&quot; The survivors were taken in by local Mormon families. Seventeen of the children were later reclaimed by the U.S. Army and returned to relatives in Arkansas. The treatment of these children while they were held by the Mormons is uncertain, but Captain James Lynch&#x27;s statement in May 1859 said the surviving children were &quot;in a most wretched condition, half starved, half naked, filthy, infested with vermin, and their eyes diseased from the cruel neglect to which they had been exposed.&quot; Lynch&#x27;s July 1859 affidavit added that they when they first saw the children they had &quot;little or no clothing&quot; and were &quot;covered with filth and dirt&quot;.

Leonard J. Arrington, founder of the Mormon History Association, reports that Brigham Young received the rider, James Haslam, at his office on the same day. When he learned what was contemplated by the militia leaders in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter stating the Baker–Fancher party was not to be meddled with, and should be allowed to go in peace (although he acknowledged the Native Americans would likely &quot;do as they pleased&quot;). Young&#x27;s letter arrived two days too late, on September 13, 1857.

The livestock and personal property of the Baker–Fancher party, including women&#x27;s jewelry, clothing and bedstuffs were distributed or auctioned off to Mormons. Some of the surviving children saw clothing and jewelry that had belonged to their dead mothers and sisters subsequently being worn by Mormon women and the journalist J.H. Beadle said that jewelry taken from Mountain Meadows was seen in Salt Lake City.

===Investigations and prosecutions===
An early investigation was conducted by Brigham Young, who interviewed John D. Lee on September 29, 1857. In 1858, Young sent a report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs stating that the massacre was the work of Native Americans. The Utah War delayed any investigation by the U.S. federal government until 1859, when Jacob Forney and U.S. Army Brevet Major James Henry Carleton conducted investigations. In Carleton&#x27;s investigation, at Mountain Meadows he found women&#x27;s hair tangled in sage brush and the bones of children still in their mothers&#x27; arms. Carleton later said it was &quot;a sight which can never be forgotten.&quot; After gathering up the skulls and bones of those who had died, Carleton&#x27;s troops buried them and erected a cairn and cross.

Carleton interviewed a few local Mormon settlers and Paiute Native American chiefs and concluded that there was Mormon involvement in the massacre. He issued a report in May 1859, addressed to the U.S. Assistant Adjutant-General, setting forth his findings. Jacob Forney, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah, also conducted an investigation that included visiting the region in the summer of 1859. Forney retrieved many of the surviving children of massacre victims who had been housed with Mormon families and gathered them up for transportation to their relatives in Arkansas. Forney concluded that the Paiutes did not act alone and the massacre would not have occurred without the white settlers, and Carleton report to the U.S. Congress called the mass killings a &quot;heinous crime&quot;, blaming both local and senior church leaders for the massacre.

In March 1859, Judge John Cradlebaugh, a federal judge brought into the territory after the Utah War, convened a grand jury in Provo concerning the massacre, but the jury declined any indictments. Nevertheless, Cradlebaugh conducted a tour of the Mountain Meadows area with a military escort. He attempted to arrest John D. Lee, Isaac Haight, and John Higbee, who fled before they could be found. Cradlebaugh publicly charged Brigham Young as an instigator to the massacre and therefore an &quot;accessory before the fact&quot;. Possibly as a protective measure against the mistrusted federal court system, Mormon territorial probate court judge Elias Smith arrested Young under a territorial warrant, perhaps hoping to divert any trial of Young into a friendly Mormon territorial court. Apparently because no federal charges ensued, Young was released.


Further investigations were cut short by the American Civil War in 1861, but proceeded in 1871 when prosecutors obtained the affidavit of militia member Philip Klingensmith. Klingensmith had been a bishop and blacksmith from Cedar City; by the 1870s, however, he had left the church and moved to Nevada.

Lee was arrested on November 7, 1874. Dame, Philip Klingensmith, Ellott Willden, and George Adair Jr. were indicted and arrested while warrants to pursue the arrests of four others who had gone into hiding (Haight, Higbee, William C. Stewart, and Samuel Jukes) were being obtained. Klingensmith escaped prosecution by agreeing to testify. Brigham Young excommunicated some participants, including Haight and Lee, from the LDS Church in 1870. The U.S. posted bounties of $5000 USD () each for the capture of Haight, Higbee, Stewart, and Klingensmith.

Lee&#x27;s first trial began on July 23, 1875, in Beaver, before a jury of eight Mormons and four non-Mormons. One of Lee&#x27;s defense attorneys was Enos D. Hoge, a former territorial supreme court justice. The trial led to a hung jury on August 5, 1875. Lee&#x27;s second trial began September 13, 1876, before an all-Mormon jury. The prosecution called Daniel Wells, Laban Morrill, Joel White, Samuel Knight, Samuel McMurdy, Nephi Johnson, and Jacob Hamblin. Lee also stipulated, against advice of counsel, that the prosecution be allowed to re-use the depositions of Young and Smith from the previous trial. Lee called no witnesses in his defense, and was convicted.

Lee was entitled under Utah Territorial statute to choose the method of his execution from three possible options: hanging, firing squad, or decapitation. At sentencing, Lee chose to be executed by firing squad. In his final words before his sentence was carried out at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee said that he was a scapegoat for others involved. Brigham Young stated that Lee&#x27;s fate was just, but it was not a sufficient blood atonement, given the enormity of the crime.

==Criticism and analysis==
===Media coverage===

Initial published reports of the incident date back at least to October 1857 in the &quot;Los Angeles Star&quot;. A notable report on the incident was made in 1859 by Carleton, who had been tasked by the U.S. Army to investigate the incident and bury the still exposed corpses at Mountain Meadows. The first period of intense nationwide publicity about the massacre began around 1872 after investigators obtained Klingensmith&#x27;s confession. In 1868 C. V. Waite published &quot;An Authentic History Of Brigham Young&quot; which described the events. In 1872, Mark Twain commented on the massacre through the lens of contemporary American public opinion in an appendix to his semi-autobiographical travel book &quot;Roughing It&quot;. In 1873, the massacre was given a full chapter in T. B. H. Stenhouse&#x27;s Mormon history &quot;The Rocky Mountain Saints&quot;. The massacre itself also received international attention, with various international and national newspapers also covering John D. Lee&#x27;s 1874 and 1877 trials as well as his execution in 1877.

The massacre has been treated extensively by several historical works, beginning with Lee&#x27;s own &quot;Confession&quot; in 1877, expressing his opinion that George A. Smith was sent to southern Utah by Brigham Young to direct the massacre.

In 1910, the massacre was the subject of a short book by Josiah F. Gibbs, who also attributed responsibility for the massacre to Young and Smith. The first detailed and comprehensive work using modern historical methods was &quot;The Mountain Meadows Massacre&quot; in 1950 by Juanita Brooks, a Mormon scholar who lived near the area in southern Utah. Brooks found no evidence of direct involvement by Brigham Young, but charged him with obstructing the investigation and provoking the attack through his rhetoric.

Initially, the LDS Church denied any involvement by Mormons, and into the 21st century was relatively silent on the issue. In 1872, it excommunicated some of the participants for their role in the massacre. Even after irrefutable evidence surfaced in 1999, the LDS Church didn&#x27;t officially recognize its members&#x27; responsibility for the attack through at least 2002. 150 years after the tragedy in September 2007, the LDS Church published its first official statement of regret on the topic, and told the Associated Press via a church spokesperson that the statement should not be seen as an apology.

In modern times, the murders have been called an act of domestic terrorism in many works of literature, and is considered the largest act of domestic terrorism in United States history prior to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Other descriptors include &quot;the darkest deed of the nineteenth century&quot; and &quot;a crime that has no parallel in American history for atrocity&quot;. LDS historian Richard Turley called it &quot;the worst event in Latter-day Saint history&quot;, and historian of the American West Will Bagley stated it was &quot;the most brutal act of religious terrorism in America history&quot; before the 2001 September 11 attacks.

===Varying perspectives===

As described by Richard E. Turley Jr., Ronald W. Walker, and Glen M. Leonard, historians from different backgrounds have taken different approaches to describe the massacre and those involved: 
*Portraying the perpetrators (white Mormon settlers) as fundamentally good and the Baker-Fancher party as evil people who committed outrageous acts of anti-Mormon instigation prior to the massacre; 
*Describing the opposite view that the perpetrators were evil and the emigrants were innocent;
*Portraying both the perpetrators and victims as complicated, and that many different coinciding circumstances contributed to the Mormon settlers committing an atrocity against travelers who, regardless of the authenticity of any accusations of anti-Mormon behavior, did not deserve the punishment of death.

Prior to 1985, many textbooks available in Utah Public Schools blamed the Paiute people as primarily responsible for the massacre, or placed equal blame on the Paiute and Mormon settlers (if they mentioned the massacre at all).

===Explanatory theories===

Historians have ascribed the massacre to a number of factors, including strident Mormon teachings in the years prior to the massacre, war hysteria, and alleged involvement of Brigham Young.

====Strident Mormon teachings====
For the decade prior to the Baker–Fancher party&#x27;s arrival there, Utah Territory existed as a theodemocracy led by Brigham Young. During the mid-1850s, Young instituted a Mormon Reformation, intending to &quot;lay the axe at the root of the tree of sin and iniquity&quot;. In January 1856, Young said &quot;the government of God, as administered here&quot; may to some seem &quot;despotic&quot; because &quot;...judgment is dealt out against the transgression of the law of God.&quot;

In addition, during the preceding decades, the religion had undergone a period of intense persecution in the American Midwest. In particular, they were officially expelled from, and an Extermination Order was issued by Governor Boggs, the state of Missouri during the 1838 Mormon War, during which prominent Mormon apostle David W. Patten was killed in battle. After Mormons moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, the religion&#x27;s founder Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith were killed in 1844. Following these events, faithful Mormons migrated west hoping to escape persecution. However, in May 1857, just months before the Mountain Meadows massacre, apostle Parley P. Pratt was shot dead in Arkansas by Hector McLean, the estranged husband of Eleanor McLean Pratt, one of Pratt&#x27;s plural wives. Parley Pratt and Eleanor entered a Celestial marriage (under the theocratic law of the Utah Territory), but Hector had refused Eleanor a divorce. &quot;When she left San Francisco she left Hector, and later she was to state in a court of law that she had left him as a wife the night he drove her from their home. Whatever the legal situation, she thought of herself as an unmarried woman.&quot;

Mormon leaders immediately proclaimed Pratt as another martyr, with Brigham Young stating, &quot;Nothing has happened so hard to reconcile my mind to since the death of Joseph.&quot; Many Mormons held the people of Arkansas collectively responsible. &quot;It was in accordance with Mormon policy to hold every Arkansan accountable for Pratt&#x27;s death, just as every Missourian was hated because of the expulsion of the church from that state.&quot;

Mormon leaders were teaching that the Second Coming of Jesus was imminent – &quot;...there are those now living upon the earth who will live to see the consummation&quot; and &quot;...we now bear witness that his coming is near at hand&quot;. Based on a somewhat ambiguous statement by Joseph Smith, some Mormons believed that Jesus would return in 1891 and that God would soon exact punishment against the United States for persecuting Mormons and martyring Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Patten and Pratt. In their Endowment ceremony, faithful early Latter-day Saints took an oath to pray that God would take vengeance against the murderers. As a result of this oath, several Mormon apostles and other leaders considered it their religious duty to kill the prophets&#x27; murderers if they ever came across them. The sermons, blessings, and private counsel by Mormon leaders just before the Mountain Meadows massacre can be understood as encouraging private individuals to execute God&#x27;s judgment against the wicked.

In Cedar City, the teachings of church leaders were particularly strident. Mormons in Cedar City were taught that members should ignore dead bodies and go about their business. Col. William H. Dame, the ranking officer in southern Utah who ordered the Mountain Meadows massacre, received a patriarchal blessing in 1854 that he would &quot;be called to act at the head of a portion of thy Brethren and of the Lamanites (Native Americans) in the redemption of Zion and the avenging of the blood of the prophets upon them that dwell on the earth&quot;. In June 1857, Philip Klingensmith, another participant, was similarly blessed that he would participate in &quot;avenging the blood of Brother Joseph&quot;.

Thus, historians argue that southern Utah Mormons would have been particularly affected by an unsubstantiated rumor that the Baker–Fancher wagon train had been joined by a group of eleven miners and plainsmen who called themselves &quot;Missouri Wildcats&quot;, some of whom reportedly taunted, vandalized and &quot;caused trouble&quot; for Mormons and Native Americans along the route (by some accounts claiming that they had the gun that &quot;shot the guts out of Old Joe Smith&quot;). They were also affected by the report to Brigham Young that the Baker–Fancher party was from Arkansas where Pratt was murdered. It was rumored that Pratt&#x27;s wife recognized some of the Mountain Meadows party as being in the gang that shot and stabbed Pratt.

====War hysteria====

The Mountain Meadows massacre was caused in part by events relating to the Utah War, an 1857 deployment toward the Utah Territory of the United States Army, whose arrival was peaceful. In the summer of 1857, however, the Mormons expected an all-out invasion of apocalyptic significance. From July to September 1857, Mormon leaders and their followers prepared for a siege that could have ended up similar to the seven-year Bleeding Kansas problem occurring at the time. Mormons were required to stockpile grain, and were enjoined against selling grain to emigrants for use as cattle feed. As far-off Mormon colonies retreated, Parowan and Cedar City became isolated and vulnerable outposts. Brigham Young sought to enlist the help of Native American tribes in fighting the &quot;Americans&quot;, encouraging them to steal cattle from emigrant trains, and to join Mormons in fighting the approaching army.

Scholars have asserted that George A. Smith&#x27;s tour of southern Utah influenced the decision to attack and destroy the Fancher–Baker emigrant train near Mountain Meadows, Utah. He met with many of the eventual participants in the massacre, including W. H. Dame, Isaac Haight, John D. Lee and Chief Jackson, leader of a band of Paiutes. He noted that the militia was organized and ready to fight and that some of them were eager to &quot;fight and take vengeance for the cruelties that had been inflicted upon us in the States.&quot;
Among Smith&#x27;s party were a number of Paiute Native American chiefs from the Mountain Meadows area. When Smith returned to Salt Lake, Brigham Young met with these leaders on September 1, 1857, and encouraged them to fight against the Americans in the anticipated clash with the U.S. Army. They were also offered all of the livestock then on the road to California, which included that belonging to the Baker–Fancher party. The Native American chiefs were reluctant, and at least one objected they had previously been told not to steal, and declined the offer.

====Brigham Young====

There is a consensus among historians that Brigham Young played a role in provoking the massacre, at least unwittingly, and in concealing its evidence after the fact. However, they debate whether Young knew about the planned massacre ahead of time and whether he initially condoned it before later taking a strong public stand against it. Young&#x27;s use of inflammatory and violent language in response to the Federal expedition added to the tense atmosphere at the time of the attack. Following the massacre, Young stated in public forums that God had taken vengeance on the Baker–Fancher party. It is unclear whether Young held this view because he believed that this specific group posed an actual threat to colonists or because he believed that the group was directly responsible for past crimes against Mormons. However, in Young&#x27;s only known correspondence prior to the massacre, he told the Church leaders in Cedar City:

According to historian MacKinnon, &quot;After the [Utah] war, U.S. President James Buchanan implied that face-to-face communications with Brigham Young might have averted the conflict, and Young argued that a north-south telegraph line in Utah could have prevented the Mountain Meadows massacre.&quot; MacKinnon suggests that hostilities could have been avoided if Young had traveled east to Washington D.C. to resolve governmental problems instead of taking a five-week trip north on the eve of the Utah War for church-related reasons.

A modern forensic assessment of a key affidavit, purportedly given by William Edwards in 1924, has complicated the debate on complicity of senior Mormon leadership in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Analysis indicates that Edwards&#x27;s signature may have been traced and that the typeset belonged to a typewriter manufactured in the 1950s. The Utah State Historical Society, which maintains the document in its archives, acknowledges a possible connection to Mark Hofmann, a convicted forger and extortionist, via go-between Lyn Jacobs who provided the society with the document.

==Remembrances==
The first monument for the victims was built two years after the massacre, by Major Carleton and the U.S. Army. This monument was a simple cairn built over the gravesite of 34 victims, and was topped by a large cedar cross. The monument was found destroyed and the structure was replaced by the U.S. Army in 1864. By some reports, the monument was destroyed in 1861, when Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows. Wilford Woodruff, who later became President of the Church, said that upon reading the inscription on the cross, which read, &quot;Vengeance is mine, thus saith the Lord. I shall repay&quot;, Young responded, &quot;it should be vengeance is mine and I have taken a little.&quot; In 1932, residents of the surrounding area constructed a memorial wall around the remnants of the monument.

Starting in 1988, the Mountain Meadows Association, composed of descendants of both the Baker–Fancher party victims and the Mormon participants, designed a new monument in the meadows; this monument was completed in 1990 and is maintained by the Utah State Division of Parks and Recreation. In 1999, the LDS Church replaced the U.S. Army&#x27;s cairn and the 1932 memorial wall with a second monument, which it now maintains. In August 1999, when the LDS Church&#x27;s construction of the 1999 monument had started, the remains of at least 28 massacre victims were dug up by a backhoe. The forensic evidence showed that the remains of the males had been shot by firearms at close range and that the remains of the women and children showed evidence of blunt force trauma.

In 1955, to memorialize the victims of the massacre, a monument was installed in the town square of Harrison, Arkansas. On one side of this monument is a map and short summary of the massacre, while the opposite side contains a list of the victims. In 2005, a replica of the U.S. Army&#x27;s original 1859 cairn was built in the community of Carrollton, Arkansas, the former county seat of Carroll County, Arkansas. it is maintained by the Mountain Meadows Monument Foundation.

In 2007, the 150th anniversary of the massacre was remembered by a ceremony held in the meadows. Approximately 400 people, including many descendants of those slain at Mountain Meadows and Elder Henry B. Eyring of the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles attended this ceremony.

In 2011, the site was designated as a National Historic Landmark after joint efforts by descendants of those killed and the LDS Church.

In 2014, archaeologist Everett Bassett discovered two rock piles he believes mark additional graves. The locations of the possible graves are on private land and not at any of the monument sites owned by the LDS Church. The Mountain Meadows Monument Foundation has expressed their desire that the sites be conserved and given national monument status. Other descendant groups have been more hesitant in accepting the sites as legitimate grave markers.

<doc id="170808" wikidata="Q212871" url="?curid=170808" title="Synchrotron radiation">
<text>Synchrotron radiation (also known as magnetobremsstrahlung) is the electromagnetic radiation emitted when relativistic charged particles are subject to an acceleration perpendicular to their velocity (). It is produced artificially in some types of particle accelerators or naturally by fast electrons moving through magnetic fields. The radiation produced in this way has a characteristic polarization, and the frequencies generated can range over a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Synchrotron radiation is similar to bremsstrahlung radiation, which is emitted by a charged particle when the acceleration is parallel to the direction of motion. The general term for radiation emitted by particles in a magnetic field is &quot;gyromagnetic radiation&quot;, for which synchrotron radiation is the ultra-relativistic special case. Radiation emitted by charged particles moving non-relativistically in a magnetic field is called cyclotron emission. For particles in the mildly relativistic range (≈85% of the speed of light), the emission is termed &quot;gyro-synchrotron radiation&quot;.

In astrophysics, synchrotron emission occurs, for instance, due to ultra-relativistic motion of a charged particle around a black hole. When the source follows a circular geodesic around the black hole, the synchrotron radiation occurs for orbits close to the photosphere where the motion is in the ultra-relativistic regime. 


==History==

Synchrotron radiation was first observed by technician Floyd Haber, on April 24, 1947, at the 70 MeV electron synchrotron of the General Electric research laboratory in Schenectady, New York. While this was not the first synchrotron built, it was the first with a transparent vacuum tube, allowing the radiation to be directly observed.

As recounted by Herbert Pollock:

==Description==
A direct consequence of Maxwell&#x27;s equations is that accelerated charged particles always emit electromagnetic radiation. Synchrotron radiation is the special case of charged particles moving at relativistic speed undergoing acceleration perpendicular to their direction of motion, typically in a magnetic field. In such a field, the force due to the field is always perpendicular to both the direction of motion and to the direction of field, as shown by the Lorentz force law.

The power carried by the radiation is found (in SI units) by the relativistic Larmor formula:

formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the vacuum permittivity,
* formula_3 is the particle charge,
* formula_4 is the magnitude of the acceleration,
* formula_5 is the speed of light,
* formula_6 is the Lorentz factor,
* formula_7,
* formula_8 is the radius of curvature of the particle trajectory.

The force on the emitting electron is given by the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force.

When the radiation is emitted by a particle moving in a plane, the radiation is linearly polarized when observed in that plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle. Considering quantum mechanics, however, this radiation is emitted in discrete packets of photons and has significant effects in accelerators called quantum excitation. For a given acceleration, the average energy of emitted photons is proportional to formula_9 and the emission rate to formula_6.

==From accelerators==
Circular accelerators will always produce gyromagnetic radiation as the particles are deflected in the magnetic field. However, the quantity and properties of the radiation are highly dependent on the nature of the acceleration taking place. For example, due to the difference in mass, the factor of formula_11 in the formula for the emitted power means that electrons radiate energy at approximately 1013 times the rate of protons.

Energy loss from synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators was originally considered a nuisance, as additional energy must be supplied to the beam in order to offset the losses. However, beginning in the 1980s, circular electron accelerators known as light sources have been constructed to deliberately produce intense beams of synchrotron radiation for research.

==In astronomy==

Synchrotron radiation is also generated by astronomical objects, typically where relativistic electrons spiral (and hence change velocity) through magnetic fields.
Two of its characteristics include power-law energy spectra and polarization. It is considered to be one of the most powerful tools in the study of extra-solar magnetic fields wherever relativistic charged particles are present. Most known cosmic radio sources emit synchrotron radiation. It is often used to estimate the strength of large cosmic magnetic fields as well as analyze the contents of the interstellar and intergalactic media.

===History of detection===
This type of radiation was first detected in the Crab Nebula in 1956 by Jan Hendrik Oort and Theodore Walraven, and a few months later in a jet emitted by Messier 87 by Geoffrey R. Burbidge. It was confirmation of a prediction by Iosif S. Shklovsky in 1953. However, it had been predicted earlier (1950) by Hannes Alfvén and Nicolai Herlofson. Solar flares accelerate particles that emit in this way, as suggested by R. Giovanelli in 1948 and described by J.H. Piddington in 1952.

T. K. Breus noted that questions of priority on the history of astrophysical synchrotron radiation are complicated, writing:


=== From supermassive black holes ===

It has been suggested that supermassive black holes produce synchrotron radiation in &quot;jets&quot;, generated by the gravitational acceleration of ions in their polar magnetic fields. The nearest such observed jet is from the core of the galaxy Messier 87. This jet is interesting for producing the illusion of superluminal motion as observed from the frame of Earth. This phenomenon is caused because the jets are traveling very near the speed of light &quot;and&quot; at a very small angle towards the observer. Because at every point of their path the high-velocity jets are emitting light, the light they emit does not approach the observer much more quickly than the jet itself. Light emitted over hundreds of years of travel thus arrives at the observer over a much smaller time period, giving the illusion of faster than light travel, despite the fact that there is actually no violation of special relativity.

===Pulsar wind nebulae===
A class of astronomical sources where synchrotron emission is important is pulsar wind nebulae, also known as plerions, of which the Crab nebula and its associated pulsar are archetypal.
Pulsed emission gamma-ray radiation from the Crab has recently been observed up to ≥25 GeV, probably due to synchrotron emission by electrons trapped in the strong magnetic field around the pulsar.
Polarization in the Crab nebula at energies from 0.1 to 1.0 MeV, illustrates this typical property of synchrotron radiation.

===Interstellar and intergalactic media===
Much of what is known about the magnetic environment of the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium is derived from observations of synchrotron radiation. Cosmic ray electrons moving through the medium interact with relativistic plasma and emit synchrotron radiation which is detected on Earth. The properties of the radiation allow astronomers to make inferences about the magnetic field strength and orientation in these regions. However, accurate calculations of field strength cannot be made without knowing the relativistic electron density.

===In supernovae===
When a star explodes in a supernova, the fastest ejecta move at semi-relativistic speeds approximately 10% the speed of light. This blast wave gyrates electrons in ambient magnetic fields and generates synchrotron emission, revealing the radius of the blast wave at the location of the emission. Synchrotron emission can also reveal the strength of the magnetic field at the front of the shock wave, as well as the circumstellar density it encounters, but strongly depends on the choice of energy partition between the magnetic field, proton kinetic energy, and electron kinetic energy. Radio synchrotron emission has allowed astronomers to shed light on mass loss and stellar winds that occur just prior to stellar death.

<text>Radio City Music Hall (also known as Radio City) is an entertainment venue and theater at 1260 Avenue of the Americas, within Rockefeller Center, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Nicknamed &quot;The Showplace of the Nation&quot;, it is the headquarters for the Rockettes. Radio City Music Hall was designed by Edward Durell Stone and Donald Deskey in the Art Deco style.

Radio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a Metropolitan Opera House, although plans for the opera house were canceled in 1929. It opened on December 27, 1932, as part of the construction of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of two venues built for Rockefeller Center&#x27;s &quot;Radio City&quot; section, the other being the RKO Roxy Theatre (later the Center Theatre); the &quot;Radio City&quot; name came to apply only to Radio City Music Hall. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the theater to bankruptcy. Radio City was designated a New York City Landmark in May 1978, and it was restored and allowed to remain open. The theater was extensively renovated in 1999.

Radio City&#x27;s four-tiered auditorium was the world&#x27;s largest when it opened. The theater also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City was initially intended to host stage shows, within a year of its opening it was converted into a movie palace, hosting performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it primarily hosted concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the &quot;Radio City Christmas Spectacular&quot;. Radio City has also hosted televised events including the Grammy Awards, the Tony Awards, the Daytime Emmy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, and the NFL Draft, as well as university graduation ceremonies.

==History==
===Development===

==== Planning ====
The construction of Rockefeller Center occurred between 1932 and 1940. on land that John D. Rockefeller Jr. leased from Columbia University. The Rockefeller Center site was originally supposed to be occupied by a new opera house for the Metropolitan Opera. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. The new building was too expensive for the opera to fund by itself, and it needed an endowment; the project ultimately gained the support of John D. Rockefeller Jr. The planned opera house was canceled in December 1929 due to various issues, but Rockefeller made a deal with RCA to develop Rockefeller Center as a mass media complex with four theaters. This was later downsized to two theaters.

Samuel Roxy Rothafel, a successful theater operator who was renowned for his domination of the city&#x27;s movie theater industry, joined the center&#x27;s advisory board in 1930. He offered to build two theaters: a large vaudeville &quot;International Music Hall&quot; on the northernmost block, with more than 6,200 seats, and the smaller 3,500-seat &quot;RKO Roxy&quot; movie theater on the southernmost block. The idea for these theaters was inspired by Roxy&#x27;s failed expansion of the 5,920-seat Roxy Theatre on 50th Street, one and a half blocks away. The Music Hall was to have a single admission price of $2 per person. Roxy also envisioned an elevated promenade between the two theaters, but this was never published in any of the official blueprints.

==== Design process ====
In September 1931, a group of NBC managers and architects toured Europe to find performers and look at theater designs. However, the group did not find any significant architectural details that they could use in the Radio City theaters. In any case, Roxy&#x27;s friend Peter Clark turned out to have much more innovative designs for the proposed theaters than the Europeans did.

Roxy had a list of design requests for the Music Hall. First, he did not want the theater to have either a large balcony over the box seating or rows of box seating facing each other, as implemented in opera houses. One alternative called for &quot;a rather deep balcony&quot; and a shallower second balcony, but would have obstructed views from the rear orchestra. Consequently, the final plan used three tiers of balconies, cantilevered off the back wall. Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts so the sets could be changed easily. Roxy wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful, and he wished for the auditorium to be oval in shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval auditoriums had better acoustic qualities. Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, orchestra pit seats, and dressing-room chairs. Roxy also wanted the theater to have an &quot;intimate&quot; design as well. According to architect Henry Hofmeister, a single level of steeply raked stadium seating would likely have been used in a larger auditorium, quoting a theatrical proverb: &quot;A house divided against the performer cannot stand.&quot;

Despite Roxy&#x27;s specific requests for design features, the Music Hall&#x27;s general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center. The Music Hall was to be at the northwest corner of the Rockefeller Center complex, at the base of the 1270 Sixth Avenue office building; the theater&#x27;s rear wall would have to support the offices above. Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone and interior designer Donald Deskey in the Art Deco style. Stone used Indiana Limestone for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three signs with the theater&#x27;s name were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented fire escapes were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors and commissioned Ezra Winter for the grand foyer&#x27;s mural, &quot;Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth&quot;. Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall. He had reportedly called Winter&#x27;s painting &quot;God-awful&quot; and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better. To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the theater. Deskey&#x27;s plan was regarded the best of 35 submissions, and he ultimately used the rococo style in his interior design.

==== Naming and construction ====
The International Music Hall evolved into a theater called Radio City Music Hall. The names &quot;Radio City&quot; and &quot;Radio City Music Hall&quot; derive from one of the complex&#x27;s first tenants, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which planned a mass media complex called Radio City on the west side of Rockefeller Center. Over time, the appellation of &quot;Radio City&quot; devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex&#x27;s western section. Radio City Music Hall was the only part of the complex that retained the name by 1937, and the name &quot;Radio City&quot; became shorthand for the theater.
Construction on Radio City Music Hall started in December 1931, and the theater topped out in August 1932. Its construction set many records at the time, including the use of of copper wire and of brass pipe. In November 1932, Russell Markert&#x27;s précision dance troupe the Roxyettes (later to be known as the Rockettes) left the Roxy Theatre and announced that they would be moving to Radio City. By then, Roxy was busy adding music acts in preparation for the theater&#x27;s opening at the end of the year.

=== Opening ===
Radio City Music Hall opened to the public on December 27, 1932, with a lavish stage show featuring numbers including Ray Bolger, Ronnie Mansfield, Doc Rockwell, Martha Graham, The Mirthquakers, The Tuskegee Choir and Patricia Bowman. The opening was meant to be a return to high-class variety entertainment. However, Radio City&#x27;s opening program flopped because the program was very long, spanning from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. the next day, and a multitude of acts were crammed onto the world&#x27;s largest stage, ensuring that individual acts were lost in the cavernous hall. As the premiere went on, audience members, including John Rockefeller Jr, waited in the lobby or simply left early. Some news reporters, tasked with writing reviews of the premiere, guessed the ending of the program because they left beforehand.

Reviews ranged from furious to commiserate. The film historian Terry Ramsaye wrote that &quot;if the seating capacity of the Radio City Music Hall is precisely 6,200, then just exactly 6,199 persons must have been aware at the initial performance that they were eye witnesses to [...] the unveiling of the world&#x27;s best &#x27;bust&#x27;&quot;. Set designer Robert Edmond Jones resigned in disappointment, and Graham was fired. Despite the negative reviews of the performances, the theater&#x27;s design was very well received. One reviewer stated: &quot;It has been said of the new Music Hall that it needs no performers; that its beauty and comforts alone are sufficient to gratify the greediest of playgoers.&quot;

=== Conversion to movie house ===
Radio City&#x27;s initial policy of live shows was so poorly received that, just two weeks after its opening, its managers announced that the theater would switch to showing feature films, accompanied by a spectacular stage show that Roxy had perfected. The announcement came amid false rumors that the theater would close. On January 11, 1933, after incurring a net operating loss of $180,000, Radio City became a movie and live-show house. The first film shown on the giant screen was Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&quot;. One critic said the same year that the Music Hall &quot;is alone in carrying on the tradition of bigger things which underlay the whole project at the beginning&quot;. William G. Van Schmus was hired as the theater&#x27;s managing director that March, though he had never managed a theater before. The top admission in the theater&#x27;s first year was 40 cents during the day and 88 cents at night.

Radio City became the premiere showcase for films from the RKO-Radio studio, with &quot;Topaze&quot; being the first RKO film to play there in 1933. Some of the films that premiered at Radio City Music Hall included &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said that, in total, the theater hosted the premieres of over 650 movies. At the theater&#x27;s peak, four complete performances were presented every day.

==== 1930s to 1950s ====

In addition to its movie screenings, Radio City hosted a holy hour for Catholics, Protestants, and Jews starting in 1933. The theater started experimenting with operatic performances in May 1934. The performances were so popular that Van Schmus decided to produce more opera shows to be performed four times a day. Van Schmus subsequently hired Serge Sudeikin, Albert Johnson, and Boris Aronson as the theater&#x27;s art directors, under senior producer Leon Leonidoff. Early films screened at Radio City included &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), the first feature film to use three-strip Technicolor production; a 1936 film version of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;; and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), Walt Disney&#x27;s first full-length feature film. The theater&#x27;s non-cinematic events included a stage show about the history of lighting, as well as a fundraiser for the Red Cross. By January 1937, more than 25 million people had visited the theater over the previous four years, paying total admission of $17.5 million.

Radio City was used for Easter worship services starting in 1940. The next year, the theater hosted &quot;the most elaborate benefit performance ever held in New York&quot;, a World War II fundraiser. After Van Schmus died in January 1942, G. S. Eysell took over as the managing director. During this time, Radio City hosted films such as &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), &quot;Sunny&quot; (1941), &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; (1947). Lines for the theater&#x27;s Christmas show frequently stretched around the block. Performances by the Rockettes and a 60-member orchestra accompanied many live shows. Ernö Rapée, who had headed Radio City&#x27;s orchestra since its opening, continued to lead the theater&#x27;s orchestra until he died in 1945. Radio City continued to operate every day, although it sometimes closed briefly for part of the day. For example, it partially closed after U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945 and again during a fuel shortage the next year.

Alexander Smallens became the theater&#x27;s musical director in 1947, and Raymond Paige assumed that position three years later. The theater&#x27;s sound system was upgraded in mid-1953, enabling the venue to show 3D films without intermission. Radio City disbanded its in-house male chorus in 1958, instead hiring choral acts from around the world. The theater also hosted benefit parties for Big Brothers Inc. from 1953 to at least 1959. Through the next decade, Radio City was successful regardless of the status of the city&#x27;s economic, business, and entertainment sectors as a whole. It remained open even as other theaters such as the Paramount and the Roxy closed. A committee led by Radio City&#x27;s director, Russell V. Dowling, selected the theater&#x27;s live acts and other performances.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====

Upon its 30th anniversary in 1962, Radio City had nearly 200 million total patrons to date, more than the entire U.S. population at the time. The theater had shown 532 feature films to date; the most frequent actor was Cary Grant, who had appeared in 25 such films. Even so, officials had intended to close down Radio City Music Hall in 1962, one of several such unheeded announcements. Radio City closed temporarily in 1963 due to fears of a power failure, and the first full-day closure in its history took place on November 26, 1963, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. By 1964, Radio City had an estimated 5.7 million annual visitors, who paid ticket prices of between 99 cents and $2.75 (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). The theater had evolved to show fewer adult-oriented films, instead choosing to show films for general audiences. However, Radio City&#x27;s operating costs were almost twice as high as those of smaller performance venues. In addition, with the loosening of regulations on explicit content, Radio City&#x27;s audience was mostly relegated to families.

Radio City was closed entirely for five days in March 1965 for its first full cleaning, which included changing the curtains and painting the ceiling. While the seating areas and floors had been cleaned regularly, the walls and ceilings had never been thoroughly cleaned and had accumulated a layer of dirt measuring almost thick. Two or three hundred workers cleaned the theater around the clock, and it reopened on March 8, 1965, with the film &quot;Dear Heart&quot;. Repairs were also performed on the theater&#x27;s organs during the nighttime. Also in 1965, Will Irwin and Rayburn Wright replaced Raymond Paige as the theater&#x27;s musical directors following the latter&#x27;s death. Russell V. Downing retired as Radio City&#x27;s president in 1966 and was replaced by James F. Gould. As president of Radio City, Gould expanded its programming to include events such as rock concerts and wrestling matches before he retired in 1973. Radio City had its 200 millionth visitor in January 1967, a little less than two years after its renovation.

Tourism to New York City started to decline by 1969, which affected the theater&#x27;s attendance. Even in the early 1970s, Radio City had five million visitors a year, more than the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty combined. However, the proliferation of subtitled foreign movies had reduced attendance at Radio City. Changes in film distribution made it difficult to secure exclusive bookings of many films, forcing Radio City&#x27;s managers to show reruns. Radio City preferred to show only family-friendly movies, which further limited their film choices. As a result, popular films such as &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; failed Radio City&#x27;s screening criteria. By 1972, Radio City had fired the performers&#x27; unions as well as six of the 36 Rockettes. The theater&#x27;s management donated a painting by Stuart Davis to the Museum of Modern Art to reduce Radio City Music Hall&#x27;s tax burden. That October, Radio City was closed temporarily after officials could not reach an employment agreement with the theater&#x27;s musicians. Though the theater reopened a few days later, this was the first time it had ever been closed due to staffing issues.

Another labor dispute in 1973 forced Radio City to cut back its policy of mixed films and stage shows. A total shutdown was only avoided when the musicians&#x27; union agreed to a three-year contract in which musicians would be paid for 38 weeks per year, rather than 52. This allowed Radio City&#x27;s managers to schedule other forms of live entertainment for the theater during the remaining 14 weeks. These live shows were split into two periods of seven weeks. Radio City&#x27;s managers attempted to draw patrons by using the stage for rock concerts, pop festivals, and telecasts of boxing matches. Nonetheless, Radio City continued to lose $600,000 a year by early 1975. It cost $55,000 a week just to rent the theater, plus another $20,000 for employee salaries. There were just 3.5 million visitors annually, despite high attendance during Christmas, Easter, and the summer. Yet again, rumors spread that the venue would close, but Radio City&#x27;s managers denied these claims. Architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that Radio City was still more popular than other visitor attractions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Bronx Zoo.

=== Bankruptcy and threat of closure ===

In 1977, annual attendance reached an all-time low of 1.5 million, a 70 percent decrease from the 5 million visitors reported in 1968. The theater needed about 4 million annual visitors to break even. By January 1978, Radio City was in debt, and officials stated that it could not remain open after April. Rockefeller Center president Alton Marshall announced that, due to a projected loss of $3.5 million for the upcoming year, Radio City Music Hall would close on April 12. This came after the theater had lost $2.3 million in 1977. Many of Radio City&#x27;s regular patrons moved to the suburbs, and there was a lingering fear of crime in New York City. A lack of family-friendly movies was also a factor in the planned closure. One proposal included converting the theater into tennis courts, a shopping mall, an aquarium, a hotel, a theme park, or the American Stock Exchange. Despite the potential tax benefits of preserving the theater, Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers were uninterested in saving Radio City, as they were focused on the site&#x27;s real-estate development potential. Huxtable claimed that the managers&#x27; approach was &quot;singularly lacking in any creative or cultural sensitivities&quot;.

Radio City Music Hall Ballet Company dance captain Rosemary Novellino formed the Showpeople&#x27;s Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall. Lieutenant governor Mary Anne Krupsak, who had once been a Rockette, was also involved in the preservation efforts. The alliance made hundreds of calls to Rockefeller Center&#x27;s manager; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described that the callers &quot;jammed the switchboards&quot; there. The Rockettes also protested outside New York City Hall. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) held public hearings on whether to designate the theater&#x27;s interior as a city landmark in March 1978. Of more than 100 speakers, most argued in favor of landmark status, but Rockefeller Center president Alton G. Marshall said that &quot;landmark designation may well be the last nail in the Music Hall&#x27;s coffin.&quot; In total, more than 100,000 people supported designating Radio City as a landmark. The LPC designated the interior as a city landmark on March 28.

Rockefeller Center Inc. filed a lawsuit to try to reverse the landmark designation, claiming that landmark status would be unattractive to potential investors, but the lawsuit was unsuccessful. Rockefeller Center Inc. indicated that it would demolish the theater had it succeeded in overturning the landmark designation. In April, just a few days before the planned closing date, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease Radio City. Plans for a 20-story mixed-use tower above Radio City were announced the same month, with rents from the proposed tower providing the necessary funds to keep the theater open. An alternative involving transferring the theater&#x27;s air rights to another building in the complex was also privately discussed. The UDC and Rockefeller Center Inc. agreed on April 12 to keep Radio City open, just hours before it had been set to close. On May 12, 1978, Radio City Music Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Radio City lost $2.3 million in the first ten months of 1978, despite the fact that a Frank Sinatra concert there had grossed more than $1.7 million. From April 13 to September 13, 1978, when the UDC operated the theater, losses totaled $1.2 million. The plans for an office building above the theater were recommended in a draft study that was published in February 1979. Davis Brody Associates had designed a 31-story office and hotel building that was to be cantilevered over the theater, with an entrance carved out of Radio City&#x27;s Sixth Avenue lobby. The office building was ultimately not built. Robert F. Jani instead assumed control of Radio City&#x27;s programming, with plans to restore the venue to its original condition. The film-plus-stage-spectacle format ended at the theater on April 25, 1979, with the screening of &quot;The Promise&quot;. The theater was closed immediately afterward for renovation. It reopened with a ceremony on May 31, 1979.

===Late 20th century===

After the theater reopened to the public, Radio City started creating its own music concerts. Previously, the theater had only hosted events created by external producers. Time slots were set aside for movie screenings, but Radio City had mostly turned to stage shows. By January 1980, Radio City was hosting shows such as the stage adaptation of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and the &quot;Rockettes Spectacular.&quot; However, the theatrical shows proved to be unpopular, so, in 1983, the Radio City Music Hall shifted to creating music concerts and participating in the production of films and TV shows. The parent company, Radio City Music Hall Productions (a subsidiary of Rockefeller Center Inc.), started creating or co-creating films and Broadway shows such as &quot;Legs&quot; and &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;.

By the early 1980s, the LPC was considering designating the original Rockefeller Center complex as a city landmark, including the exterior of Radio City Music Hall. In 1983, the LPC held hearings to determine how much of Rockefeller Center should be protected as a landmark. The Rockefeller family and Columbia University acknowledged that the buildings were already symbolically landmarks, but their spokesman John E. Zuccotti recommended that only the block between 49th and 50th Streets be protected. By contrast, almost everyone else who supported Rockefeller Center&#x27;s landmark status recommended that the entire complex be landmarked. The LPC granted landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex&#x27;s buildings, including the previously unprotected exterior of Radio City Music Hall, on April 23, 1985. Rockefeller Center&#x27;s original buildings also became a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

Radio City finally recorded a net gain of $2.5 million in 1985, its first profit in three decades. This was partly attributed to the addition of music concerts, which appealed toward younger viewers. Radio City also started hosting televised events including the Grammy Awards, the Tony Awards, the Daytime Emmy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, and the NFL Draft. A new golden curtain was installed at the main stage in January 1987. The curtain was the third one to be installed since Radio City&#x27;s opening in 1932; it had last been replaced in 1965. Because of Radio City&#x27;s historic status, the curtain had to be the same style, texture, and color as the previous curtains.

In 1997, Radio City was leased to the Madison Square Garden Company (then known as Cablevision), providing funding to keep the Rockettes and the &quot;Christmas Spectacular&quot; at Radio City. In exchange, Cablevision would be able to renovate and manage the theater. Radio City was closed on February 16, 1999, for a comprehensive renovation. During the closure, many components were cleaned, modernized, or replaced, including the curtains, seats, carpets, doorknobs, and light fixtures. Workers installed a gold-silk curtain measuring wide, as well as 5,901 seats upholstered in salmon-colored fabric. The ceiling was also restored by John Canning. The renovation was originally projected to cost $25 million, but the cost increased to $70 million due to various additional tasks that surfaced during the extensive refurbishment. Radio City received a $2.5 million tax break from the Empire State Development Corporation, which was meant to accommodate the expenditure of up to $66 million in renovation costs. The theater reopened with a gala concert on October 4, 1999.

=== Early 21st century ===
Radio City Music Hall announced a decision to remain open on March 12 and 13, 2020, amid a ban on gatherings of 500 or more in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. This decision initially stood in contrast to many other venues and public events in New York City, which had shut down. Radio City decided to remain closed after March 13, with no set reopening date, since other venues had also closed indefinitely. This affected events like the 74th Tony Awards, originally scheduled for June 7 but was then postponed after Radio City&#x27;s closure. In early 2021, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that Radio City would be able to open with limited capacity that April. Cuomo subsequently announced Radio City would reopen that June, without capacity limits or mask restrictions, but only to patrons who had received a COVID-19 vaccine.

Development firm Tishman Speyer submitted proposals to the LPC to construct a rooftop terrace on Radio City Music Hall, as well as a pedestrian bridge to 1270 Avenue of the Americas. These plans dated from an original proposal for the theater that was never carried out. The LPC approved the plans in March 2021. At the time, the terrace was scheduled to open in late 2021 and would only be usable by tenants of 1270 Avenue of the Americas and their guests. The garden opened in September 2021 and is formally known as Radio Park. Designed by the firm of HMWhite, Radio Park includes birch trees, a set of bleachers, and various pathways. The entirety of Radio Park is placed on a gradual slope because the connection to 50 Rockefeller Plaza is higher than Radio City Music Hall&#x27;s roof.

==Architecture==

===Facade===

Radio City Music Hall is on the east side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. Located in a niche partially under 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the theater is housed under the building&#x27;s first setback on the seventh floor. An entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station, served by the , is on Sixth Avenue directly adjacent to the north end of the marquee, within the same structure that houses Radio City Music Hall.

Its exterior has a long marquee sign that wraps around the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, as well as narrower, seven-story-high signs on the north and south ends of the marquee&#x27;s Sixth Avenue side; both signs display the theater&#x27;s name in neon letters. The main entrance to Radio City was placed at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, underneath the marquee. Although the theater&#x27;s main entrance could have been placed anywhere along the Sixth Avenue frontage, the architects chose to place the entrance near the intersection of 50th Street, rather than in the middle of the block, because it was highly visible from the Broadway theater district to the west. Additionally, a corner site allowed the architects to place more doorways on the facade than a midblock site would have.
The theater&#x27;s exterior also has visual features signifying its purpose. Above the entrance, Hildreth Meiere created six small bronze plaques of musicians playing different instruments, as well as three larger metal and enamel plaques signifying dance, drama, and song; these plaques denote the theater&#x27;s theme. At one point, a tennis court was located on the theater&#x27;s rooftop garden.

===Interior===

The interior contains a grand foyer, a large main auditorium, and stairs and elevators that lead to several mezzanines. Designed by Edward Durell Stone, the theater had Art Deco decoration, whose sharp lines represented a break with the traditional ornate rococo ornament associated with movie palaces at the time. Donald Deskey coordinated the interior design process and designed some of the wallpaper, furniture, and other decor in Radio City. Deskey&#x27;s geometric Art Deco designs incorporate glass, aluminum, chrome, bakelite, and leather; these materials are used in the theater&#x27;s wall coverings, carpet, light fixtures, and furniture. All of the theater&#x27;s staircases were fitted with brass railings, an aspect of the Art Deco style.

Deskey commissioned textile designers Marguerita Mergentime and Ruth Reeves to create carpet designs and designs for the fabrics covering the walls. Reeves designed a carpet that contained musical motifs in &quot;shades of red, brown, gold, and black&quot;, but her design was replaced in 1999. Mergentime also produced geometric designs of nature and musicians for the walls and carpets, which still exist. Deskey also created his own carpet design consisting of &quot;singing head&quot; depictions, which still exists. Rene Chambellan produced six &quot;playful&quot; bronze plaques of vaudeville characters, which are located in the lobby just above the entrances to the theater. Henry Varnum Poor designed all of Radio City&#x27;s ceramic fixtures, especially the lighting bases.

====Lobbies and grand foyer====
The entrance to Radio City is at its southwestern corner, where there are adjacent ticket and advance sales lobbies. Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each on the northern and southern walls and two booths in the center. Originally, six ticket booths were placed about from the main doors, dividing the lobby into corridors measuring wide. This permitted adequate traffic flow within the lobby while also making it difficult for crowds to congregate. Large black pillars support a low, slightly coffered ceiling. Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations. The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall. This location allowed the advance-sales booth to be distinguished from the general sales booths while also not blocking traffic flow.

To the ticket lobby&#x27;s east and the advance sales lobby&#x27;s northeast is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby. The space is about deep and extends the width of the auditorium. Two long, tubular chandeliers created by Edward F. Caldwell &amp; Co. hang from the ceiling. The northern side of the grand foyer contains Ezra Winter&#x27;s mural. A grand staircase, leading up to the first-mezzanine foyer, runs along the northern wall next to Winter&#x27;s mural. Another set of stairs below the grand staircase descends from the northern side of the foyer to the main lounge one level below. A smaller staircase to the first-mezzanine lounge runs along the southern wall, connecting to a curved extension of that level&#x27;s balcony. The southern and northern sides of the grand foyer, respectively leading to 50th and 51st Streets, contain shallow vestibules with red marble walls. The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit. The grand foyer&#x27;s eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains mirrors within gold frames. Eleven doors leading to Radio City&#x27;s auditorium are also located on the grand foyer&#x27;s eastern side. Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors&#x27; exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances that have taken place at Radio City.

The foyer connects to four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is to the west of the northern exit vestibule. Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations. The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by Edward Trumbull and represent wine, women, and song.

Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men&#x27;s smoking room, a women&#x27;s lounge, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design. A 1932 &quot;New York Times&quot; article described the reasons for such varied designs: &quot;Since the auditoriums, men&#x27;s lobbies, smoking rooms and women&#x27;s lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.&quot;

====Auditorium====

Architectural critic Douglas Haskell said of the auditorium: &quot;The focus is the great proscenium arch, over high and feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The &#x27;ceiling&#x27;, uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.&quot; In the theater&#x27;s early years, the Federal Writers&#x27; Project noted that &quot;nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous&quot;. At the time, Radio City had the world&#x27;s largest orchestra; the most expansive theater screen; the heaviest proscenium arch in a theater; and the &quot;finest precision dancers&quot;, the Rockettes.

=====Seating areas=====
The auditorium has around 5,960 seats. Around 3,500 of these seats are at the ground-level orchestra, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanines. The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters. Six aisles extend the length of the orchestra level, dividing each row into sections of up to 14 seats. The aisles measure wide at the rear, tapering to at the center and at the front. A crossover aisle separates the front one-third of the orchestra from the rear two-thirds. Each row of seats was originally placed apart, giving more legroom than in contemporary theaters.

 Radio City contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium, as well as a main lounge in the basement. Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the rear orchestra. Since the mezzanines are shallow, there is no need to have a crossover aisle, and only four aisles are provided. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.

=====Other design features=====
The auditorium&#x27;s ceiling contains eight telescoping bands, which Haskell described as the &quot;northern lights&quot;. Each of the bands&#x27; edges contains a overlap with the next band, placed at intervals. In Joseph Urban&#x27;s original plans, the ceiling was to be coffered but, after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall&#x27;s ceiling. The current design was put forth by Raymond Hood, who derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written. The arches are made of plaster and contain ridges every . The original plans had been to build the arches themselves in a curved shape, but this would have concentrated the sound onto several small spots. The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves. The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy and grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air-conditioning system, amplifying equipment, and organ pipes. The sound system could be controlled by a light organ in front of the orchestra pit.

The Great Stage, designed by Peter Clark, measures ; it is placed within a proscenium arch that resembles a setting sun. Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner. There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The original curtain weighed three tons and measured wide by tall. The center of the stage contains a rotating floor measuring across. The floor is divided into three sections that can be lowered and raised either separately or in sync. The orchestra pit, which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a &quot;bandwagon&quot; that was lifted from the basement and could move vertically or longitudinally. The bandwagon could also be lifted to the central opening. From the stage, it could be lowered back into the basement or moved to the side.

There is a complex system of indirect cove lighting at the front of the stage, facing the audience. When Radio City first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.

====Main lounge====
The main lounge in the basement is about twice the size of the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black &quot;permatex&quot;, which was a new material at the time of Radio City&#x27;s construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped piers, as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes. The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see ). Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge. The lounge also contained a passageway to the &quot;Forum&quot;, along Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, where it linked with Rockefeller Center&#x27;s other buildings.

The landing for Radio City&#x27;s elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men&#x27;s smoking room and a women&#x27;s lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders. The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men&#x27;s restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men&#x27;s restrooms on each mezzanine level. The women&#x27;s lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as Witold Gordon&#x27;s &quot;History of Cosmetics Mural&quot;, located on the room&#x27;s walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women&#x27;s restroom is similar to the men&#x27;s restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.

====Offstage====

The offstage area of Radio City contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a carpenter&#x27;s studio, a scene shop, sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a green room for performers&#x27; guests, and a dormitory. Two elevators are placed on either side of the stage, as well as a circular staircase. The female performers&#x27; restrooms and dressing rooms are placed as close as possible to the stage, and the male performers&#x27; dressing rooms are placed on the opposite side of the stage. This was in conformance with Roxy&#x27;s belief that &quot;happy performers make successful shows&quot;. Above the auditorium were two studios for Roxy, as well as a broadcast studio, rehearsal room, and two preview rooms.

The elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators. The elevator system was so advanced that the U.S. Navy incorporated identical hydraulics in constructing World War II aircraft carriers; according to Radio City lore, during the war, government agents guarded the basement to hide the U.S. Navy&#x27;s technological advantage.

===Art===
The public areas of Radio City feature the work of many Depression-era artists, who were commissioned by Deskey as part of his general design scheme. The large mural in the grand foyer, &quot;Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth&quot;, was painted by Ezra Winter and depicts a fable from a Native American tribe in Oregon. The murals on the wall of the grand lounge, which depict five eras of differing theater scenes, are collectively known as the &quot;Phantasmagoria of the Theater&quot; by Louis Bouche. Three female nudes cast in aluminum were commissioned for the theater, but Roxy thought that they were inappropriate for a family venue. Although the Rockefellers loved the sculptures, the only one that was displayed on opening night was &quot;Goose Girl&quot; by Robert Laurent, which is located on the first mezzanine and depicts a nude aluminum girl beside a slender aluminum goose. Since opening night the other two sculptures have been put on display at Radio City. &quot;Eve&quot; by Gwen Lux is displayed in the southwest corner of the grand foyer, and &quot;Spirit of the Dance&quot; by William Zorach is visible from the grand lounge.

Each of the public restrooms have adjoining lounges that display various works of art. The third-floor women&#x27;s restroom contains the &quot;Panther Mural&quot; by Henry Billings, which is accompanied by Deskey&#x27;s abstract wall coverings in the women&#x27;s lounge. The women&#x27;s lounge on the second mezzanine houses Yasuo Kuniyoshi&#x27;s oil painting of &quot;larger-than-life botanical designs&quot; along the entire wall, which had originally been commissioned by Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe before she suffered a nervous breakdown and left the mural incomplete. Deskey created a wall covering for the men&#x27;s lounge on the second mezzanine, containing masculine icons and nicotine motifs. He also designed the first-mezzanine women&#x27;s lounge, a room full of mirrors with a blue-and-white carpet and frosted low-intensity lights. Witold Gordon painted a map with caricatures and stereotypical motifs in the men&#x27;s lounge on the same floor, as well as a &quot;History of Cosmetics Mural&quot; in the women&#x27;s lounge in the basement. Stuart Davis created &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, a mural of masculine stereotypical pastimes in the basement-level men&#x27;s lounge; the work was donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1975 and loaned back to Radio City in 1999. Finally, Edward Buk Ulreich created a &quot;Wild West Mural&quot; on the third-mezzanine men&#x27;s lounge.

===Organs===
Radio City Music Hall has two Wurlitzer theatre organs. The organ in the main theatre is the largest instrument built by the Wurlitzer company. It consists of 58 ranks of pipes and 4,178 pipes, played from twin 4-manual consoles located to the left and right of the stage, which permits two organists to play the instrument simultaneously. The broadcast booth atop the theatre contains a smaller (3-manual, 14 rank) Wurlitzer organ, although it has been unplayable for some time. Richard Leibert was Radio City&#x27;s chief organist from its opening on December 27, 1932, until his retirement in 1971, at which time Raymond Bohr succeeded him. Both organs have been recorded extensively by Ashley Miller, Dick Leibert, Raymond Bohr, and Eddie Layton, and Leibert presented a daily program of organ music broadcast from the theater on the NBC Radio Network in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Notable events==

===Music and shows===
Under conductor Ernö Rapée, from 1932 to 1942, there were weekly broadcasts of live concerts from Radio City on the NBC Blue Network radio program &quot;Radio City Music Hall of the Air&quot;. On October 8, 1939, Radio City&#x27;s symphony orchestra performed the world premiere of Eugene Zador&#x27;s opera &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; for national radio broadcast on &quot;Radio City Music Hall of the Air&quot;. Originally the work was supposed to be performed on the stage of Radio City, but ticket sales were so strong that the production moved to the larger Center Theatre but with Radio City&#x27;s artistic leaders and performers still attached.

The Grateful Dead played eight shows over nine days in October 1980, culminating on Halloween; two of the shows from this run were released as the video &quot;Grateful Dead: Dead Ahead&quot;. In the 1980s, Liberace grossed $2.5 million from 14 performances with a combined audience of 82,000, setting a box-office record for Radio City Music Hall at the time. Adele performed a one-night-only concert at Radio City, which was recorded on November 17, 2015, and broadcast on NBC on December 14, 2015.

The &quot;Radio City Christmas Spectacular&quot; is an annual Christmas stage musical produced by MSG Entertainment, which operates the theater. A New York Christmas tradition since 1933, it features the women&#x27;s precision dance team known as the Rockettes. The Irish dance show &quot;Riverdance&quot; made its North American debut at Radio City in March 1996, breaking box-office records.

===Television===
Radio City Music Hall has been used for televised game shows such as &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. For two weeks in November 1988, the theater hosted &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which was taking its first road trip. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; announcer Don Pardo announced during the two weeks. Radio City Music Hall was also the site for &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; four-thousandth episode in May 2002, at which time the show&#x27;s Million Dollar Masters invitational tournament also occurred. The theater hosted the show again in November 2007 for the nighttime show&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Radio City was used again in November 2006 for a 2-week &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; event.

David Letterman hosted the &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; Sixth Anniversary Special at Radio City Music Hall in 1988, and did so again for the show&#x27;s Tenth Anniversary Special in 1992. The next year, Lyons Group (parent company of Barney &amp; Friends at the time), taped a live stage show called &quot;Barney Live in New York City&quot; at the theater. In February 1998, Radio City Music Hall was a setting for the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; music special &quot;Elmopalooza&quot;, with Jon Stewart, David Alan Grier and others with the cast of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and the Muppets.

In October 2001, the concert &quot;Come Together: A Night for John Lennon&#x27;s Words and Music&quot; was simulcast live from the theater on The WB and TNT. The concert had been delayed following the September 11 attacks the month before.

In 2013, it was announced that &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; would hold its live shows from the Radio City Music Hall starting with its eighth season that summer; it had held its live shows at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center for its seventh season to accommodate new judge Howard Stern. The move was also intended to take advantage of New York tax credits. &quot;AGT&quot; would broadcast its live rounds from Radio City Music Hall until Stern&#x27;s departure in 2016, after which the show moved to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

===Sports===

The first sports event at Radio City Music Hall was a boxing card headlined by Roy Jones Jr. and David Telesco that took place on January 15, 2000. On April 13, 2013, Nonito Donaire faced Guillermo Rigondeaux in a boxing card held at Radio City Music Hall.

In 2004, the WNBA&#x27;s New York Liberty played six home games at Radio City while their then-regular home, Madison Square Garden, prepared to host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Liberty played their first game in front of 5,945 fans against the Detroit Shock in July 2004. Courtside seats were stage left and stage right along the baseline and the Rockettes performed at halftime. The court from Madison Square Garden was moved to Radio City Music Hall during this time.

Radio City Music Hall was the site of the NFL Draft between 2006 and 2014. Prior to being held at Radio City, the NFL Draft had been hosted at other locations in New York City since 1965, but after the 2014 draft, the National Football League hosted the draft in a series of other cities nationwide.

=== Awards ceremonies ===
The Broadway League presented the Tony Awards, the annual ceremony for Broadway theatre, at Radio City Music Hall during most years from 1997 to 2019, as well as in 2022. Radio City is planned to host the Tony Awards in 2025 as well. Radio City has also hosted the Grammy Awards, the annual ceremony presented by the Recording Academy for music, six times. The theater&#x27;s first Grammys was in 1980, and its last Grammys was in 1998. The MTV Video Music Awards have been hosted at the theater 12 times from 1984 to 2018.

<text>Joseph Raymond Frenette (April 16, 1935 – July 13, 2018) was a Canadian politician in New Brunswick. He was a Liberal representative for the riding of Moncton East in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1974 until 1998 when he retired after a short term as the 28th premier of New Brunswick.

== Life and career ==
Frenette was born on April 16, 1935 in Beresford, New Brunswick, the son of Berthilde Pitre and Samuel Frenette. He attended the Collège du Sacré-Coeur in Bathurst. Before his election to the legislature, he was a Councillor for the village of Lewisville and, after Lewisville was amalgamated with the city of Moncton, he was a Moncton city Councillor.

He twice ran for leader of the New Brunswick Liberals. He lost in 1982 to Doug Young, and in 1985 to Frank McKenna. He served as interim leader of the party from 1983 to 1985 and again from October 1997 to May 1998, also serving as Premier.

Frenette was Frank McKenna&#x27;s right-hand man in the legislature, serving as his House Leader throughout his tenure as leader from 1985 to 1997. He resigned from the New Brunswick legislature in July 1998.

Following his political career, Frenette was appointed by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to be a director of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) for a three-year term from 1998 to 2001 following which he served as chair from 2001 to 2005.

On May 11, 2006, it was announced that he would be New Brunswick chair of Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.

On July 13, 2018, Frenette died at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton, aged 83.

<text>Raymond Duchamp-Villon (5 November 1876 – 9 October 1918) was a French sculptor.

==Life and art==
Duchamp-Villon was born Pierre-Maurice-Raymond Duchamp in Damville, Eure, in the Normandy region of France, the second son of Eugène and Lucie Duchamp (née Nicolle), the daughter of painter and engraver Émile Frédéric Nicolle. Of the six Duchamp children, four would become successful artists. He was the brother of Jacques Villon (1875–1963), painter, printmaker; Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968), painter, sculptor and author; Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (1889–1963), painter. Duchamp-Villon inherited his love for art from his mother.

From 1894 to 1898 Raymond Duchamp-Villon lived in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris with his brother Jacques and studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Rheumatic fever forced him to abandon his studies in 1898 and it left him partially incapacitated for a time. This unforeseen event altered the course of his life as he began to pursue an interest in sculpture. He started by creating small statuettes and essentially became self-taught, achieving a high level of mastery and acumen. In 1902 and 1903, he exhibited at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts but to distinguish himself from his artist brother, he began to use the Duchamp-Villon designation on all his works.

In 1905 Duchamp-Villon had his first exhibition at the Salon d&#x27;Automne and a show at the Galerie Legrip in Rouen with his brother Jacques. Two years later they moved to the village of Puteaux at the outskirts of Paris where the three Duchamp brothers were part of the regular meetings of what became known as the Section d&#x27;Or, involving artists, poets and critics. Raymond&#x27;s reputation was such that he was made a member of the jury of the sculpture section of the Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1907 and was later instrumental in promoting the Cubist movement.
In 1911 he exhibited at the Galerie de l’Art Contemporain in Paris and the following year his work was included in a show organized by the Duchamp brothers at the Salon de la Section d’Or at the Galerie de la Boétie. All three of the Duchamp brothers then showed their work at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City that helped introduce modern art to United States.
In 1913 he took part in exhibitions at the Galerie André Groult in Paris, the Galerie S. V. U. Mánes in Prague, and in 1914 at Der Sturm Gallery in Berlin. During World War I Raymond Duchamp-Villon served in the French army in a medical capacity, but still worked on his major cubist sculpture, &quot;The Large Horse&quot;.

In late 1916, Raymond Duchamp-Villon contracted typhoid fever while stationed at the military quarters in Champagne. As a result, he was taken to the military hospital at Cannes where he died.

In 1967, in Rouen, his last surviving artist brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called &quot;Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp.&quot; Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

<text>The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is a species of beetle in the family Curculionidae. The boll weevil 
feeds on cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it migrated into the United States from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.

==Description==
The adult insect has a long snout, a grayish color, and is usually less than in length.

==Life cycle==

Adult weevils overwinter in well-drained areas in or near cotton fields, and farms after diapause. They emerge and enter cotton fields from early spring through midsummer, with peak emergence in late spring, and feed on immature cotton bolls.

The boll weevil lays its eggs inside buds and ripening bolls (fruits) of the cotton plants. The female can lay up to 200 eggs over a 10- to 12-day period. The oviposition leaves wounds on the exterior of the flower bud. The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days within the cotton squares (larger buds before flowering), feed for 8 to 10 days, and then pupate. The pupal stage lasts another 5 to 7 days. The lifecycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer. Under optimal conditions, 8 to 10 generations per season may occur.

Boll weevils begin to die at temperatures at or below . Research at the University of Missouri indicates they cannot survive more than an hour at . The insulation offered by leaf litter, crop residues, and snow may enable the beetle to survive when air temperatures drop to these levels.

Other limitations on boll weevil populations include extreme heat and drought. The weevil&#x27;s natural predators include fire ants, other insects, spiders, birds, and a parasitoid wasp, &quot;Catolaccus grandis&quot;. The weevils sometimes emerge from diapause before cotton buds are available.

==Infestation==

The insect crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico in 1892 and reached southeastern Alabama in 1909. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the U.S., traveling 40 to 160 miles per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost U.S. cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.

The boll weevil contributed to Southern farmers&#x27; economic woes during the 1920s, a situation exacerbated by the Great Depression in the 1930s.

The boll weevil appeared in Venezuela in 1949 and Colombia in 1950. The Amazon Rainforest was thought to present a barrier to the insect&#x27;s further spread, until it was detected in Brazil in 1983. An estimated 90% of the cotton farms in Brazil are now infested. During the 1990s, the weevil spread to Paraguay and Argentina. The International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) has proposed a control program similar to that used in the U.S.

==Control==
During early years of the weevil&#x27;s presence, growers sought relatively warm soils and early-ripening cultivars. Following World War II, the development of new pesticides such as DDT enabled U.S. farmers again to grow cotton as an economic crop. DDT was initially extremely effective, but U.S. weevil populations developed resistance by the mid-1950s. Methyl parathion, malathion, and pyrethroids were subsequently used, but environmental and resistance concerns arose as they had with DDT, and control strategies changed.

While many control methods have been investigated since the boll weevil entered the United States, insecticides have always remained the main control methods. In the 1980s, entomologists at Texas A&amp;M University pointed to the spread of another invasive pest, the red imported fire ant, as a factor in the weevils&#x27; population decline in some areas.

Other avenues of control that have been explored include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitoid wasp &quot;Catolaccus grandis&quot;, the fungus &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;, and the &quot;Chilo&quot; iridescent virus. Genetically engineered Bt cotton is not protected from the boll weevil.

Although it was possible to control the boll weevil, the necessary insecticide was costly. The goal of many cotton entomologists was to eventually eradicate the pest from U.S. cotton. In 1978, a large-scale test was begun in eastern North Carolina and in adjacent Southampton County, Virginia, to determine the feasibility of eradication. Based on the success of this test, area-wide programs were begun in the 1980s to eradicate the insect from whole regions. These are based on cooperative effort by all growers together with the assistance of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Research methods were developed. The ability to distinguish between individuals which had eaten certain substances and those which had not was needed, to determine effectiveness of the active ingredients used. Lindig et al. 1980 studied several dietary dyes as markers. They find Calco Oil Red N-1700 to persist from larval feeding to adulthood, and for females to their eggs, although the resulting first instar was too faintly pink to be distinguishable.

The program has been successful in eradicating boll weevils from all cotton-growing states with the exception of Texas, and most of this state is free of boll weevils. Problems along the southern border with Mexico have delayed eradication in the extreme southern portions of this state. Follow-up programs are in place in all cotton-growing states to prevent the reintroduction of the pest. These monitoring programs rely on pheromone-baited traps for detection. The boll weevil eradication program, although slow and costly, has paid off for cotton growers in reduced pesticide costs. This program and the screwworm program of the 1950s are among the biggest and most successful insect control programs in history.

==Impact==
The Library of Congress American Memory Project contains a number of oral history materials on the boll weevil&#x27;s impact.

It devastated black Americans disproportionately because most were directly financially dependent on cotton as a cash crop. Because they were more likely to labor as tenant farmers or sharecroppers on cotton plantations in the Southern United States - the epicenter of the Boll Weevil infestation, black farmers, suffered disproportionately. Additionally, Government intervention such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, resulted in the abandonment and loss of cropland for black farmers.

By 1922 it was taking 8% of the cotton in the country annually. This failure of the south&#x27;s primary crop became a major impetus for the Great Migration of the time, although not the only one. Thereby it was one of the factors in the birth of the Harlem Renaissance - including the culture of the Cotton Club. A 2009 study found &quot;that as the weevil traversed the American South [in the period 1892-1932], it seriously disrupted local economies, significantly reduced the value of land (at this time still the most important asset in the American South), and triggered substantial intraregional population movements.&quot; A 2020 &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot; study found that the boll weevil spread between 1892 and 1922 had a beneficial impact on educational outcomes, as children were less likely to work on cultivating cotton. A 2020 NBER paper found that the boll weevil spread contributed to fewer lynchings, less Confederate monument construction, less KKK activity, and higher non-white voter registration.

The boll weevil infestation has been credited with bringing about economic diversification in the Southern US, including the expansion of peanut cropping. The citizens of Enterprise, Alabama, erected the Boll Weevil Monument in 1919, perceiving that their economy had been overly dependent on cotton, and that mixed farming and manufacturing were better alternatives.

==In popular culture==
Music
*&quot;Boll Weevil&quot; is a traditional blues song covered by artists including Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter, Buster “Bus” Ezel, Woody Guthrie. It reached #2 on the Billboard chart in 1961 in a recording by Brook Benton.
*In their self-titled debut album, The Presidents of the United States of America made reference to a wide range of animals including on the track, Boll Weevil. Music critic Michael Sun wrote, &quot;By the time track five, ‘Boll Weevil’, rolls around, there&#x27;s been enough cameos from birds, spiders, monkeys, fish, frogs, pigs, and beetles to fill a zoo, all referenced without agenda or coded meaning — just fun, plain and simple.&quot;
*The Bollweevils are a Chicago based punk band

Sports
*The boll weevil is the mascot for the University of Arkansas at Monticello and is listed on several &quot;silliest&quot; or &quot;weirdest&quot; mascots of all time. It was also the mascot of a short-lived minor league baseball team, the Temple Boll Weevils, which were alternatively called the &quot;Cotton Bugs&quot;.

<doc id="170823" wikidata="Q3082718" url="?curid=170823" title="Frank McKenna">
<text>Francis Joseph McKenna (born January 19, 1948) is a Canadian businessman and former politician and diplomat. He is currently Deputy Chairman of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. He served as Canadian Ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2006. He served as the 27th premier of New Brunswick from 1987 to 1997, winning every seat in the province in his first election.

==Early life==
Frank McKenna was born on January 19, 1948, in Apohaqui, New Brunswick, one of eight children of Olive and Joseph McKenna. McKenna was raised in his grandparents&#x27; home. They lived adjacent to his parents as his large family could not be wholly housed in his parents&#x27; home.

Raised Catholic, after completing Sussex High 
School (in Sussex, New Brunswick), he completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science and Economics at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He began graduate studies at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, but after working for a stint with Allan MacEachen, he took MacEachen&#x27;s advice that most politicians are lawyers and enrolled in law school at the University of New Brunswick (Fredericton).

After earning a law degree, he moved to Chatham and began practicing law. He garnered a place in contemporary Acadian folklore as the defence lawyer in the high-profile widely publicized murder case of famous New Brunswick boxing champion, Yvon Durelle.

==New Brunswick politics==

A few years later, he entered provincial politics and won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1982 election to represent Chatham, New Brunswick. He became leader of the provincial Liberals in 1985, and won one of the largest electoral victories in Canadian history in the 1987 election when his party won every seat in the legislature.

McKenna&#x27;s term in office was viewed mostly as a success. His key priority throughout his term was job creation and he was known to say that the &quot;best social program we have is a job.&quot; He encouraged small business growth and tried to entice large companies to invest in the province with tax incentives, often directly calling individual professionals to urge them to bring their talents to New Brunswick. Another of his strategies was to raise the collective self-confidence of New Brunswickers, which he believed would increase productivity. He introduced a sophisticated public relations operation which included the use of controversial video news releases.

McKenna&#x27;s time as premier, however, also saw some controversy. In his first move as premier, McKenna dismissed several senior public servants in an effort to gain greater control over the province&#x27;s public service, which some observers perceived as a drastic step away from the integrity of the province&#x27;s impartial and professional public service.

McKenna was also criticized for increasing the number of communications personnel on the government payroll but countered this complaint by pointing out that the primary government communications agency, Communications New Brunswick, had been depoliticized.

He was also criticized for creating a toll free telephone number to the premier&#x27;s office which had the number 1-800-MCKENNA, the number was functional throughout North America and was used for both New Brunswick constituents and business interests that were considering moving to the province.

Believing ten years was long enough for a premier to hold office, and having pledged to serve such a term when first elected, McKenna resigned in 1997 – 10 years to the day of the 1987 election.

==Business career==
After leaving office, McKenna moved to Cap-Pélé, New Brunswick, near Moncton, and returned to the practice of law and sat on numerous corporate boards. He also purchased (with his son, James McKenna), Glenwood Kitchen Ltd., a manufacturer of high-end custom cabinetry in Shediac, New Brunswick. His membership on the Canadian advisory board of the Carlyle Group drew adverse media attention; the media ceased pursuing the issue when McKenna explained that the board was established to advise on a Canadian investment fund that the group never created and that the board had never become active.

Following the announcement of his appointment as Canadian ambassador to Washington, he resigned his position as counsel at law firms including McInnes Cooper and Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt, as well as all positions on corporate boards including his role as interim chairman of the board of CanWest Global Communications, a post he assumed upon the death of its founder and chairman Israel Asper.

==Ambassador==
McKenna was mentioned as a possible Ambassador to the US to succeed Michael Kergin after Paul Martin took power. Speculation increased after John Manley turned down Prime Minister Martin&#x27;s offer. Many in the press commented on McKenna&#x27;s business connections being an asset, notably as a member of the Carlyle Group and his friendship with former President George H. W. Bush.

On January 5, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s office confirmed that McKenna would be the 21st Ambassador to the United States. On January 14, the posting was formally announced and would be effective on March 1. McKenna became the Ambassador on March 8 when U.S. President George W. Bush accepted his credentials.

On February 22, 2005, McKenna told reporters Canada was already a part of the U.S. National Missile Defense (NMD) (or Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)) program through an amendment to the NORAD agreement made on August 5, 2004, which granted U.S. access to NORAD&#x27;s missile warning systems explicitly for use in NMD. However, Martin contradicted this two days later when he announced that Canada would not formally participate in the NMD program but focus on other items of shared defence/security interest. While Canadian defence minister Bill Graham said McKenna was simply misunderstood (as the NORAD agreement and missile defence are separate), this initial contradiction was interpreted by others as evidence of characteristic indecision by the Martin government and was seen to somewhat hamper McKenna&#x27;s credibility.

As Ambassador, McKenna attracted more media attention than most of his recent predecessors on both sides of the border. In the U.S., his message was one of dispelling common urban legends and misconceptions about Canada, while in Canada he urged Canadians to be more understanding of the American people and culture, particularly following what he argued is their understandable sensitivity after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

McKenna generated controversy after giving a luncheon speech on September 29, 2005, to a Toronto business club. McKenna blasted the U.S. bureaucracy and Congressional system of government saying &quot;the government of the United States is in large measure dysfunctional.&quot; He contrasted it with Canada&#x27;s government, and praised Canada&#x27;s strong parliamentary party discipline as being much more &quot;efficient&quot; though sometimes less preferable.

On January 25, 2006, McKenna offered his resignation as Ambassador, writing to Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper that he wished to be relieved of his duties, but offering to stay on until his successor was chosen. He was succeeded as ambassador by Michael Wilson on March 13, 2006.

==Prospective career in federal politics==
Since leaving politics in 1997, McKenna served for a brief time on the Security Intelligence Review Committee. He has been touted several times as a potential Atlantic Canadian minister in the cabinets of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin. He expressed some interest in running in the 2004 federal election but announced he would not do so because of the lack of an available riding in the Moncton, New Brunswick, area. He did not want to push aside any incumbent Liberal member of Parliament.

After resigning the premiership of New Brunswick, McKenna was identified as a potential future leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, and Prime Minister of Canada. A poll released on August 23, 2005, commissioned by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, showed that McKenna was the top choice of the public to succeed Prime Minister Paul Martin. Among the general public, McKenna beat former New Democratic Party Ontario Premier Bob Rae by a margin of 23 to 11 while among self-identified Liberals, McKenna beat former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada John Manley by a margin of 28 to 13. The October 2005 issue of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine had pollster Darrell Bricker and Liberal strategist Warren Kinsella create odds for potential Liberal leadership candidates. They made McKenna the favourite with 7 to 2 odds beating Scott Brison (8 to 1), Martin Cauchon (10 to 1), Michael Ignatieff and John Manley (each 15 to 1) among others.

On January 30, 2006, McKenna confirmed earlier reports that he was not running for the Liberal leadership to replace Paul Martin, who announced his resignation as party leader on the January 23, 2006 election night. McKenna acknowledged the strength of the Liberal brand stating: &quot;You&#x27;ve got pretty good odds of being the prime minister if you&#x27;re the leader of the Liberal party&quot; – every leader of the Liberal party since Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1896 had become prime minister. However, he put an end to his involvement in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership race, explaining his decision by saying that he did not want &quot;his life to become consumed by politics.&quot; and that: &quot;I reminded myself of my vow upon leaving office that, having escaped the trap, I wouldn’t go back for the cheese.&quot;

Following Stéphane Dion&#x27;s resignation as federal Liberal leader after the 2008 election, McKenna was once again touted as a possibility to take the helm of the federal Liberal Party. However, on October 28, 2008, McKenna said that he would not be seeking the leadership, saying &quot;Although I have been deeply moved by expressions of support for me from across the country, I have not been persuaded to change my long-standing resolve to exit public life for good,&quot; and
&quot;My only regret is that I cannot honour the expectations of friends and supporters who have shown enormous loyalty to me.&quot;

==Banking==
McKenna was appointed as Deputy Chair, TD Bank Financial Group effective May 1, 2006. McKenna was appointed to the board of Brookfield Asset Management effective August 2006, and subsequently Chair of the Board since August 2010.

McKenna is referenced in the book &quot;Clinton Cash&quot; by Peter Schweizer. The majority of the reference is regarding the Keystone Pipeline decision-making process. Hillary Clinton serving as secretary of State in the United States, and the monetary involvement with TD Bank in Canada is described in depth. The book describes TD Bank, with McKenna as vice chairman, as having &quot;paid Bill more than any other financial institution for Lectures. More than Goldman Sachs, UBS, JPMorgan, or anyone on Wall Street.&quot; Quoting from the book,

<text>The shipworms, also called Teredo worms or simply Teredo (, via Latin ), are marine bivalve molluscs in the family Teredinidae, a group of saltwater clams with long, soft, naked bodies. They are notorious for boring into (and commonly eventually destroying) wood that is immersed in seawater, including such structures as wooden piers, docks, and ships; they drill passages by means of a pair of very small shells (&quot;valves&quot;) borne at one end, with which they rasp their way through. They are sometimes called &quot;termites of the sea&quot;. Carl Linnaeus assigned the common name &quot;Teredo&quot; to the best-known genus of shipworms in the 10th edition of his taxonomic &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot; (1758).

== Characteristics ==
Removed from its burrow, the fully grown teredo ranges from several centimeters to about a meter in length, depending on the species. An average adult shipworm measures in length and less than in diameter, but some species grow to considerable size. The body is cylindrical, slender, naked, and superficially (worm-shaped). In spite of their slender, worm-like forms, shipworms possess the characteristic morphology of bivalves. The ctinidia lie mainly within the branchial siphon, through which the animal pumps the water that passes over the gills.

The two siphons are very long and protrude from the posterior end of the animal. Where they leave the end of the main part of the body, the siphons pass between a pair of calcareous plates called pallets. If the animal is alarmed, it withdraws the siphons and the pallets protectively block the opening of the tunnel.

The pallets are not to be confused with the two valves of the main shell, which are at the anterior end of the animal. Because they are the organs that the animal applies to boring its tunnel, they generally are located at the tunnel&#x27;s end. They are borne on the slightly thickened, muscular anterior end of the cylindrical body and they are roughly triangular in shape and markedly concave on their interior surfaces. The outer surfaces are convex and in most species are deeply sculpted into sharp grinding surfaces with which the animals bore their way through the wood or similar medium in which they live and feed. The valves of shipworms are separated and the aperture of the mantle lies between them. The small &quot;foot&quot; (corresponding to the foot of a clam) can protrude through the aperture.

When shipworms bore into submerged wood, bacterial symbionts embedded within a sub-organ called the typhlosole in the shipworm gut, aid in the digestion of the wood particles ingested, The &quot;Alteromonas&quot; or &quot;Alteromonas&quot;-sub-group of bacteria identified as the symbiont species in the typhlosole, are known to digest lignin, and wood material in general. The tough molecular layers of lignin surround the cellulose elementary fibrils in the wood particles, and the lignin must be digested initially to allow access by other enzymes into the cellulose for digestion. Another bacterial species (&quot;Teredinibacter turnerae&quot;), in the gills secrete a variety of cellulose-digesting enzymes which may be secreted into the shipworm gut via a special organ called the gland of Deshayes. These secretions aid the shipworm&#x27;s own carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in digesting the wood particles in combination with the enzymes and potentially other metabolites secreted by the symbiont bacterial in the typhlosole.

The excavated burrow is usually lined with a calcareous tube. The valves of the shell of shipworms are small separate parts located at the anterior end of the worm, used for excavating the burrow. The protective role of the shells is lost because the animal spends all its life surrounded by wood.

&quot;Teredo navalis&quot; develops from eggs to metamorphosing larvae in about five weeks. They spend half of this time in the mother&#x27;s gill chamber before being discharged as free-swimming larvae into the sea. Their sexes alternate, young are hermaphrodites while adults can be either male or female. Typically, organisms are male at first and female subsequently. A second male to female phase may occur, however shipworms rarely live long enough to complete the second phase. They have a lifespan of 1 to 3 years.

== Anatomy ==
Shipworm anatomy reveals the typical organs of a bivalve mollusk, although with dimensional or positional peculiarities due to the thinness and length of the occupied space. Furthermore, some structures find no equivalent in other bivalve groups.

* Gills are divided in two halves, the anterior one of small size, the posterior one much more developed. They are linked by the alimentary tract running on the side of the visceral mass.
* The heart-kidney system is tilted, bringing the kidneys in a dorsal position relative to the heart, whose atria find themselves behind the ventricle. Furthermore, the anterior and posterior aorta become respectively posterior and anterior.
* The anus opens at the end of a long anal tube.
* The digestive gland is divided into several parts, with separate orifices in the stomach.
* A vast caecum is linked to the stomach.
* The digestive tube bears a very peculiar structure, the gland of Deshayes, probably homologous to salivary glands, which link to the oesophagus and stretch to the dorsal side of the posterior part of the gills.
* The orifice of the gallery bears pallets with their own musculature.
* The siphon retractor muscles are inserted on the calcareous covering of the gallery, and not on the shell&#x27;s valves which are much further out.
* The anterior and posterior anterior muscles have an antagonistic action.
Normally, the shipworm&#x27;s body fills the entire length of the gallery, but the anterior region can retract itself slightly with respect to the latter&#x27;s extremity. Without the gills, the viscera only cover one-fourth of the total length and only their anterior part is partially covered by the shell.

== Taxonomy ==

Shipworms are marine animals in the phylum Mollusca, order Bivalvia, family Teredinidae. They were included in the now obsolete order &quot;Eulamellibranchiata&quot;, in which many documents still place them.

Ruth Turner of Harvard University was the leading 20th century expert on the Teredinidae; she published a detailed monograph on the family, the 1966 volume &quot;A Survey and Illustrated Catalogue of the Teredinidae&quot; published by the Museum of Comparative Zoology. More recently, the endosymbionts that are found in the gills have been subject to study the bioconversion of cellulose for fuel energy research.

Shipworm species comprise several genera, of which &quot;Teredo&quot; is the most commonly mentioned. The best known species is &quot;Teredo navalis&quot;. Historically, &quot;Teredo&quot; concentrations in the Caribbean Sea have been substantially higher than in most other salt water bodies.

Genera within the family Teridinidae include:

== Species ==

The Teredo genus has approximately 20 species that live in wooden materials such as logs, pilings, ship, and practically any other submerged wooden construction from temperate to tropical ocean zones. The species is thought to be native to the Atlantic Ocean and was once known as the Atlantic shipworm, although its exact origin is unknown. The longest marine bivalve, &quot;Kuphus polythalamia&quot;, was found from a lagoon near Mindanao island in the southeastern part of the Philippines, which belongs to the same group of mussels and clams. The existence of huge mollusks was established for centuries and studied by the scientists, based on the shells they left behind that were the size of baseball bats (length , diameter ). The bivalve is a rare creature that spends its life inside an elephant tusk-like hard shell made of calcium carbonate. It has a protective cap over its head which it reabsorbs to burrow into the mud for food. The case of the shipworm is not just the home of the black slimy worm. Instead, it acts as the primary source of nourishment in a non-traditional way. &quot;K. polythalamia&quot; sifts mud and sediment with its gills. Most shipworms are relatively smaller and feed on rotten wood. This shipworm instead relies on a beneficial symbiotic bacteria living in its gills. The bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide for energy to produce organic compounds that in turn feed the shipworms, similar to the process of photosynthesis used by green plants to convert the carbon dioxide in the air into simple carbon compounds. Scientists found that &quot;K. polythalamia&quot; cooperates with different bacteria than other shipworms, which could be the reason why it evolved from consuming rotten wood to living on hydrogen sulfide in the mud. The internal organs of the shipworm have shrunk from lack of use over the course of its evolution. The scientists are planning to study the microbes found in the single gill of &quot;K. polythalamia&quot; to find a new possible antimicrobial substance.

== Habitat ==

&quot;Teredo navalis&quot; are a cosmopolitan species that can be found both in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Since they occupy wooden flotsam and natural driftwood such as dead tree trunks, they are spread as the wood is carried by currents. They also travel inside the wooden-hulled vessels that help increase their spread worldwide. However, the origin of &quot;T. navalis&quot; remains uncertain due to the widespread usage of ships in global trade and the resulting spreading of shipworms.

During the free-living larva stage, the species colonizes new habitats and spreads. Larvae are extremely sensitive to the presence of wood and will take advantage of any opportunity to attach to and penetrate wooden structures. In the Baltic Sea, free-floating piles carved by shipworms can be observed floating hundreds of kilometers away from the original wooden structures. The limiting element for propagation is salinity, which must be greater than 8% for successful reproduction. Consequently, freshwater is deadly to these invertebrates. Reproduction occurs during warm summer months, and the larvae mature for production in just eight weeks. Each year, several generations can be produced. Their ideal temperature range is and therefore &quot;T. navalis&quot; can be found in temperate and tropical zones.

The shipworm lives in waters with oceanic salinity. Accordingly, it is rare in the brackish Baltic Sea, where wooden shipwrecks are preserved for much longer than in the oceans.

The range of various species has changed over time based on human activity. Many waters in developed countries that had been plagued by shipworms were cleared of them by pollution from the Industrial Revolution and the modern era; as environmental regulation led to cleaner waters, shipworms have returned. Climate change has also changed the range of species; some once found only in warmer and more salty waters like the Caribbean have established habitats in the Mediterranean.

== Cultural impact ==

Shipworms greatly damage wooden hulls and marine piling, and have been the subject of much study to find methods to avoid their attacks. Copper sheathing was used on wooden ships in the latter 18th century and afterwards, as a method of preventing damage by teredo worms. The first historically documented use of copper sheathing was experiments held by the British Royal Navy with , which was coppered in 1761 and thoroughly inspected after a two-year cruise. In a letter from the Navy Board to the Admiralty dated 31 August 1763 it was written &quot;that so long as copper plates can be kept upon the bottom, the planks will be thereby entirely secured from the effects of the worm.&quot;

In the Netherlands the shipworm caused a crisis in the 18th century by attacking the timber that faced the sea dike. After that the dikes had to be faced with stones. In 2009, &quot;Teredo&quot; caused several minor collapses along the Hudson River waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey, due to damage to underwater pilings.

In the early 19th century, engineer Marc Brunel observed that the shipworm&#x27;s valves simultaneously enabled it to tunnel through wood and protected it from being crushed by the swelling timber. With that idea, he designed the first tunnelling shield, a modular iron tunnelling framework which enabled workers to tunnel through the unstable riverbed beneath the Thames. The Thames Tunnel was the first successful large tunnel built under a navigable river.

Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s poem &quot;Though All the Fates&quot; pays homage to &quot;New England&#x27;s worm&quot; which, in the poem, infests the hull of &quot;[t]he vessel, though her masts be firm&quot;. In time, no matter what the ship carries or where she sails, the shipworm &quot;her hulk shall bore, / [a]nd sink her in the Indian seas&quot;. The hull of the ship wrecked by a whale, inspiring &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; had been weakened by shipworms. In the Norse Saga of Erik the Red, Bjarni Herjólfsson, said to be the first European to discover the Americas, had his ship drift into the Irish Sea where it was eaten up by shipworms. He allowed half the crew to escape in a smaller boat covered in seal tar, while he stayed behind to drown with his men.

== Use as seafood ==
In Palawan and Aklan in the Philippines, the shipworm is called and is eaten as a delicacy. It is prepared as kinilaw—that is, raw (cleaned) but marinated with vinegar or lime juice, chopped chili peppers and onions, a process very similar to shrimp ceviche. Similarly, &quot;T. navalis&quot; can be found inside the dead and rotten trunk of mangroves in West Papua, Indonesia. To the locals, the Kamoro tribe, it is referred to as and is considered as a delicacy in daily meals. It can be eaten fresh and raw (cleaned) or cooked (cleaned and boiled) as well and usually marinated with lime juice and chili peppers. Since &quot;T. navalis&quot; are related to clams, mussels, and oysters, the taste of the flesh has been compared to a wide variety of foods, from milk to oysters. Similarly, the delicacy is harvested, sold, and eaten from those taken by local natives in the mangrove forests of West Papua and some part of Borneo Island, Indonesia, and the central coastal peninsular regions of Thailand near Ko Phra Thong.

&quot;T. navalis&quot; grow faster than any other bivalve because it does not require much energy to create its small shell. They can grow to be about long in just six months. Mussels and oysters, on the other hand, with their much bigger shells, can take up to two years to reach harvestable size.

<doc id="170826" wikidata="Q8142814" url="?curid=170826" title="Uneconomic growth">
<text>Uneconomic growth is economic growth that reflects or creates a decline in the quality of life. The concept is used in human development theory, welfare theory, and ecological economics. It is usually attributed to ecological economist Herman Daly, though other theorists may also be credited for the incipient idea, According to Daly, &quot;uneconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and well-being that is worth more than the items made.&quot; The cost, or decline in well-being, associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of &quot;the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system.&quot;

==Types of growth==
The rate or type of economic growth may have important consequences for the environment (the climate and natural capital of ecologies). Concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society have led some to advocate lower levels of growth, from which comes the idea of uneconomic growth and Green parties which argue that economies are part of a global society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without damaging them.

Canadian scientist David Suzuki argued in the 1990s that ecologies can only sustain typically about 1.5–3% new growth per year, and thus any requirement for greater returns from agriculture or forestry will necessarily cannibalize the natural capital of soil or forest. Some think this argument can be applied even to more developed economies.

==The role of technology, and Jevons paradox==
Mainstream economists would argue that economies are driven by new technology—for instance, we have faster computers today than a year ago, but not necessarily physically more computers. Growth that relies entirely on exploiting increased knowledge rather than exploiting increased resource consumption may thus not qualify as uneconomic growth. In some cases, this may be true where technology enables lower amounts of input to be used in producing the same unit of product (and/or it reduces the amount or hazardousness of the waste generated per unit product produced) (e.g., the increased availability of movies through the Internet or cable television electronically may reduce the demand for physical video tapes or DVDs for films). Nonetheless, it is crucial to also recognise that innovation- or knowledge-driven growth still may not entirely resolve the problem of scale, or increasing resource consumption. For instance, there might likely be more computers due to greater demand and replacements for slower computers.

The Jevons Paradox is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource. For example, given that expenditure on necessities and taxes remain the same, (i) the availability of energy-saving lightbulbs may mean lower electricity usage and fees for a household but this frees up more discretionary, disposable income for additional consumption elsewhere (an example of the &quot;rebound effect&quot;) and (ii) technology (or globalisation) that leads to the availability of cheaper goods for consumers also frees up discretionary income for increased consumptive spending.

On the other hand, new renewable energy and climate change mitigation technology (such as artificial photosynthesis) has been argued to promote a prolonged era of human stewardship over ecosystems known as the Sustainocene. In the Sustainocene, &quot;instead of the cargo-cult ideology of perpetual economic growth through corporate pillage of nature, globalised artificial photosynthesis will facilitate a steady state economy and further technological revolutions such as domestic nano-factories and e-democratic input to local communal and global governance structures. In such a world, humans will no longer feel economically threatened, but rather proud, that their moral growth has allowed them to uphold Rights of Nature.&quot;

<text>Paula Elizabeth Yates (24 April 1959 – 17 September 2000) was a Welsh television presenter and writer. Yates is best known for her work on two television programmes, &quot;The Tube&quot; and &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;. She was subjected to intense media attention and scrutiny, owing to her popularity and her relationships with musicians Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence.

==Early life==
Born on 24 April 1959 in Colwyn Bay, Wales, to English parents, Yates was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith (whose stage name was Heller Toren, and who later wrote under the pseudonym Helene Thornton). Up until 1997, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot;. A DNA test in that year revealed that her biological father was game show host Hughie Green.

Yates described her childhood as lonely and isolated; her mother, she claimed, was absent for much of her upbringing. She attended a village primary school, Penrhos College, and Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a house near Conwy. After the break-up of her parents&#x27; marriage in 1975, Yates lived mostly with her mother despite having a closer relationship with Jess, and also had periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.

==Career==
In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called &quot;Natural Blonde&quot; in the &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, shortly after posing for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme &quot;The Tube&quot;, having been a minor co-host of BBC TV chat shows with presenter Terry Wogan. She also appeared alongside her friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof documentary on pop group Bananarama.

In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; from the Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One album by B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation). 

After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood. She continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show &quot;The Tube&quot;. 

Yates became known for her &quot;on the bed&quot; interviews on the show &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof. She casually asked the questions she felt people really wanted the answers to: &quot;Is it true you had an affair with Prince?&quot; (to Kylie Minogue) — and persuaded Sting to take his trousers off live on air.

At the time of her death in 2000, Yates was working on a book titled &quot;Sex and Death&quot;, writing about her life from the moment she visited Hutchence&#x27;s body in the morgue.

==Personal life==
Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They began a romantic relationship in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi, was born in 1983. After ten years together, Yates and Geldof married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches on 13 March 1989, and Pixie on 17 September 1990.

Whilst married to Geldof, Yates had a year-long affair with American singer Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby. She had a six-year long affair with actor Rupert Everett. 

In 1985, Yates met INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence while interviewing him for Channel 4&#x27;s rock magazine programme &quot;The Tube&quot;. During this appearance on &quot;The Tube&quot;, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when she walked up to him and said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to have that boy [Hutchence]&quot;. Yates was unmoved by the manager&#x27;s request and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years, even taking her young daughter Fifi along. Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been under way for some months before their &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; interview in October 1994. 

Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. On 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to a daughter by Hutchence, Tiger Lily.

On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney. The official verdict into his death said that he killed himself by hanging. Yates wrote in her police statement that Hutchence was &quot;frightened and couldn&#x27;t stand a minute more without his baby&quot;. During their phone conversations on the morning of his suicide, he had said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll live without Tiger&quot;. Yates also wrote that Geldof had threatened them repeatedly, saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget, I am above the law.&quot; Yates became distraught, refusing to accept the coroner&#x27;s verdict of suicide and insisting that it was a case of auto-erotic asphyxiation. She eventually sought psychiatric treatment.

In December 1997, a few weeks after Hutchence&#x27;s death and while Yates was fighting for custody of her daughter with Hutchence, Yates suffered another blow when a DNA test result confirmed tabloid media reports that Jess Yates, who had died in April 1993, was not her biological father. A paternity test proved that the talent show host Hughie Green, who had died six months before Hutchence, was her biological father.

In June 1998, Geldof won full custody of the couple&#x27;s three daughters after Yates attempted suicide. She met Kingsley O&#x27;Keke during her stay in treatment, but the pair broke up after a six-week romance. O&#x27;Keke later sold his story to a tabloid newspaper.

==Death==
On 17 September 2000, on Pixie&#x27;s 10th birthday, Yates died at her home in Notting Hill at the age of 41 of a heroin overdose. The coroner ruled that it was not a suicide, but a result of &quot;foolish and incautious&quot; behaviour. Yates was discovered in the presence of her then-four-year-old daughter, Tiger Lily. A friend disclosed during the inquest that Yates had not taken illegal drugs for nearly two years, and the coroner, Paul Knapman, concluded that although the amount Yates had taken would not have killed an addict, &quot;an unsophisticated taker of heroin&quot; like Yates had no tolerance for the drug.

Soon after Yates&#x27;s death, Geldof assumed foster custody of Tiger Lily so that she could be brought up with her three older half-sisters, Fifi, Peaches, and Pixie. Her aunt, Tina Hutchence, the sister of Michael Hutchence, was denied permission by the judge to apply for Tiger Lily to live with her in California. In 2007, Geldof adopted Tiger Lily and changed her surname to Geldof; as of 2019, Tiger&#x27;s legal name was Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.

On 7 April 2014, Yates&#x27;s second-oldest daughter, Peaches, also died of a heroin overdose, aged 25. One day before her death, she uploaded a picture to her Instagram of herself as a young girl and her mother under the caption &quot;Me and my Mum.&quot;

==Legacy==
On 14 March 2023, Yates was the subject of a two-part Channel 4 documentary, entitled &quot;Paula&quot;, which looked at her life and career. The documentary highlighted the intense media surrounding Yates and the often negative coverage in the British press. &quot;Paula&quot; included interviews with her friends and social commentators including best friend Belinda Brewin, Nicky Clarke, Robbie Williams, Vanessa Feltz and Grace Dent, and used archive footage of Yates and previously unheard recorded interviews, conducted shortly after the death of Hutchence. Brewin revealed that she and Yates had been shopping on the Fulham Road in London, when they met Diana, Princess of Wales, who told Yates: &quot;I love it when you&#x27;re on the front page of the papers, because it means I got the day off&quot;. 

In a review for &quot;Paula&quot;, Lucy Mangan, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, hailed the documentary as &quot;a glorious celebration of the most witty, flirty woman to ever grace our TVs&quot; and gave the show 4/5 stars. Carol Midgeley, writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, also gave the documentary 4/5 stars, opining that Yates was a &quot;fizzling force of nature&quot;. Gerard Gilbert, writing for the newspaper &quot;I&quot;, rated the documentary 3/5 stars, adding that he &quot;was left with a tragic sense that Yates&#x27;s untimely death robbed us of an intriguing second act&quot;.

The first episode of the documentary garnered 970,000 viewers, beating that night&#x27;s BBC2 and Channel 5 offerings.

<doc id="170829" wikidata="Q211251" url="?curid=170829" title="Shock absorber">
<text>A shock absorber or damper is a mechanical or hydraulic device designed to absorb and damp shock impulses. It does this by converting the kinetic energy of the shock into another form of energy (typically heat) which is then dissipated. Most shock absorbers are a form of dashpot (a damper which resists motion via viscous friction).

== Description ==

Pneumatic and hydraulic shock absorbers are used in conjunction with cushions and springs. An automobile shock absorber contains spring-loaded check valves and orifices to control the flow of oil through an internal piston (see below).

One design consideration, when designing or choosing a shock absorber, is where that energy will go. In most shock absorbers, energy is converted to heat inside the viscous fluid. In hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic fluid heats up, while in air cylinders, the hot air is usually exhausted to the atmosphere. In other types of shock absorbers, such as electromagnetic types, the dissipated energy can be stored and used later. In general terms, shock absorbers help cushion vehicles on uneven roads and keep wheels in contact with the ground.

=== Vehicle suspension ===

In a vehicle, shock absorbers reduce the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality and vehicle handling. While shock absorbers serve the purpose of limiting excessive suspension movement, their intended main purpose is to damp spring oscillations. Shock absorbers use valving of oil and gasses to absorb excess energy from the springs. Spring rates are chosen by the manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicle, loaded and unloaded. Some people use shocks to modify spring rates but this is not the correct use. Along with hysteresis in the tire itself, they damp the energy stored in the motion of the unsprung weight up and down. Effective wheel bounce damping may require tuning shocks to an optimal resistance.

Spring-based shock absorbers commonly use coil springs or leaf springs, though torsion bars are used in torsional shocks as well. Ideal springs alone, however, are not shock absorbers, as springs only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy. Vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock absorbers and springs or torsion bars. In this combination, &quot;shock absorber&quot; refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration. Now, composite suspension systems are used mainly in 2 wheelers and also leaf springs are made up of composite material in 4 wheelers.

=== Construction ===

Shock absorbers are an important part of car suspension designed to increase comfort, stability and overall safety. The shock absorber, produced with precision and engineering skills, has many important features. The most common type is a hydraulic shock absorber, which usually includes a piston, a cylinder, and an oil-filled chamber. The piston is connected to the piston rod, which extends into the cylinder and divides the cylinder into two parts. One chamber is filled with hydraulic oil, while the other chamber contains or air. When there is an accident or vibration in the vehicle, the piston moves into the cylinder, forcing the hydraulic fluid through small holes, creating resistance and dissipating energy in the form of heat. This dampens oscillations, reducing further bouncing or wobble of the car. Shock construction requires a balance of features such as piston design, fluid viscosity, and overall size of the unit to ensure performance. As technology developed, other types of shock absorbers emerged, including gas and electric shock absorbers, that provided improved control and flexibility. The design and manufacture of shock absorbers is constantly evolving due to the continuous improvement of vehicle dynamics and passenger comfort.

==Early history==
In common with carriages and railway locomotives, most early motor vehicles used leaf springs. One of the features of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping, and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension, the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was &quot;impossible&quot; to use them as main springs. However the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs, and whether wet or dry. It also operated in both directions. Motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung Druid forks from about 1906, and similar designs later added Friction disk shock absorber rotary friction dampers, which damped both ways - but they were adjustable (e.g. 1924 Webb forks). These friction disk shock absorber s was also fitted to many cars.

One of the problems with motor cars was the large variation in sprung weight between lightly loaded and fully loaded, especially for the rear springs. When heavily loaded the springs could bottom out, and apart from fitting rubber &#x27;bump stops&#x27;, there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded, which were often called &#x27;shock absorbers&#x27;. Realizing that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency, these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period, but were not a solution to the problem that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat. What was called for was damping that operated on the rebound.

Although C.L. Horock came up with a design in 1901 that had hydraulic damping, it worked in one direction only. It does not seem to have gone into production right away, whereas mechanical dampers such as the Gabriel Snubber started being fitted in the late 1900s (also the similar Stromberg Anti-Shox). These used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring but met friction when drawn out. Gabriel Snubbers were fitted to an 11.9HP Arrol-Johnston car which broke the 6 hour Class B record at Brooklands in late 1912, and the Automator journal noted that this snubber might have a great future for racing due to its light weight and easy fitment.

French engineers Gaston Dumond and Ernest Mathis patented two different hydraulic shock absorbers with rectilinear motion in 1906–1907, but those were not commercially successful.

One of the earliest hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed by Polyrhoe Carburettors Ltd. This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type &#x27;shock absorbers&#x27; mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction. The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, in place of the rear spring to chassis mount, so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part. This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself.

The first production hydraulic dampers to act on the main leaf spring movement were probably those based on an original concept by Maurice Houdaille patented in 1908 and 1909. These used a lever arm which moved hydraulically damped vanes inside the unit. The main advantage over the friction disk dampers was that it would resist sudden movement but allow slow movement, whereas the rotary friction dampers tended to stick and then offer the same resistance regardless of speed of movement. There appears to have been little progress on commercialising the lever arm shock absorbers until after World War I, after which they came into widespread use, for example as standard equipment on the 1927 Ford Model A and manufactured by Houde Engineering Corporation of Buffalo, NY.

==Types of vehicle shock absorbers==

Most vehicular shock absorbers are either twin-tube or mono-tube types with some variations on these themes.

===Twin-tube===

====Basic twin-tube====
Also known as a &quot;two-tube&quot; shock absorber, this device consists of two nested cylindrical tubes, an inner tube that is called the &quot;working tube&quot; or the &quot;pressure tube&quot;, and an outer tube called the &quot;reserve tube&quot;. At the bottom of the device on the inside is a compression valve or base valve. When the piston is forced up or down by bumps in the road, hydraulic fluid moves between different chambers via small holes or &quot;orifices&quot; in the piston and via the valve, converting the &quot;shock&quot; energy into heat which must then be dissipated.

====Twin-tube gas charged====
Variously known as a &quot;gas cell two-tube&quot; or similarly named design, this variation represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form. Its overall structure is very similar to the twin-tube, but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube. The result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in &quot;foaming&quot; or &quot;aeration&quot;, the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly. Twin-tube gas charged shock absorbers represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspension installations.

====Position sensitive damping====
Often abbreviated simply as &quot;PSD&quot;, this design is another evolution of the twin-tube shock. In a PSD shock absorber, which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas, a set of grooves has been added to the pressure tube. These grooves allow the piston to move relatively freely in the middle range of travel (i.e., the most common street or highway use, called by engineers the &quot;comfort zone&quot;) and to move with significantly less freedom in response to shifts to more irregular surfaces when upward and downward movement of the piston starts to occur with greater intensity (i.e., on bumpy sections of roads— the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range on either side of the comfort zone is called the &quot;control zone&quot;). This advance allowed car designers to make a shock absorber tailored to specific makes and models of vehicles and to take into account a given vehicle&#x27;s size and weight, its maneuverability, its horsepower, etc. in creating a correspondingly effective shock.

====Acceleration sensitive damping====
The next phase in shock absorber evolution was the development of a shock absorber that could sense and respond to not just situational changes from &quot;bumpy&quot; to &quot;smooth&quot; but to individual bumps in the road in a near instantaneous reaction. This was achieved through a change in the design of the compression valve, and has been termed &quot;acceleration sensitive damping&quot; or &quot;ASD&quot;. Not only does this result in a complete disappearance of the &quot;comfort vs. control&quot; tradeoff, it also reduced pitch during vehicle braking and roll during turns. However, ASD shocks are usually only available as aftermarket changes to a vehicle and are only available from a limited number of manufacturers.

====Coilover====
Coilover shock absorbers are usually a kind of twin-tube gas charged shock absorber inside the helical road spring. They are common on motorcycles and scooter rear suspensions, and widely used on front and rear suspensions in cars.

===Mono-tube===

The principal design alternative to the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, which is also a gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock&#x27;s fluid and gas components. The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks. However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way—it does not have any directionality. It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under &quot;high&quot; pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle&#x27;s weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.

Mercedes became the first auto manufacturer to install mono-tube shocks as standard equipment on some of their cars starting in 1958. They were manufactured by Bilstein, patented the design and first appeared in 1954s. Because the design was patented, no other manufacturer could use it until 1971 when the patent expired.

=== Spool valve ===
Spool valve dampers are characterized by the use of hollow cylindrical sleeves with machined-in oil passages as opposed to traditional conventional flexible discs or shims. Spool valving can be applied with monotube, twin-tube, or position-sensitive packaging, and is compatible with electronic control.

Primary among benefits cited in Multimatic’s 2010 patent filing is the elimination of performance ambiguity associated with flexible shims, resulting in mathematically predictable, repeatable, and robust pressure-flow characteristics.

===Remote reservoir/piggy-back===
An extra tube or container of oil connected to the oil compartment of the (main) shock via a flexible pipe (remote reservoir) or inflexible pipe (piggy-back shock). Increases the amount of oil a shock can carry without increasing its length or thickness.

===Bypass shock===
Allows each section of suspension travel to have an independent suspension tune. Bypass shock, double bypass shock, triple bypass shock etc. Triple bypass would have a separate set of suspension tuning controls for each of its three sections of suspension travel: initial travel, mid-travel, full-travel.

==Theoretical approaches==
There are several commonly used principles behind shock absorption:
* Hysteresis of structural material, for example the compression of rubber disks, stretching of rubber bands and cords, bending of steel springs, or twisting of torsion bars. Hysteresis is the tendency for otherwise elastic materials to rebound with less force than was required to deform them. Simple vehicles with no separate shock absorbers are damped, to some extent, by the hysteresis of their springs and frames.
* Dry friction as used in wheel brakes, by using disks (classically made of leather) at the pivot of a lever, with friction forced by springs. Used in early automobiles such as the Ford Model T, up through some British cars of the 1940s and on the French Citroën 2CV in the 1950s. Although now considered obsolete, an advantage of this system is its mechanical simplicity; the degree of damping can be easily adjusted by tightening or loosening the screw clamping the disks, and it can be easily rebuilt with simple hand tools. A disadvantage is that the damping force tends not to increase with the speed of the vertical motion.
* Solid state, tapered chain shock absorbers, using one or more tapered, axial alignment(s) of granular spheres, typically made of metals such as nitinol, in a casing. , 
* Fluid friction, for example the flow of fluid through a narrow orifice (hydraulics), constitutes the vast majority of automotive shock absorbers. This design first appeared on Mors racing cars in 1902. One advantage of this type is, by using special internal valving, the absorber may be made relatively soft to compression (allowing a soft response to a bump) and relatively stiff to extension, controlling &quot;rebound&quot;, which is the vehicle response to energy stored in the springs; similarly, a series of valves controlled by springs can change the degree of stiffness according to the velocity of the impact or rebound. Specialized shock absorbers for racing purposes may allow the front end of a dragster to rise with minimal resistance under acceleration, then strongly resist letting it settle, thereby maintaining a desirable rearward weight distribution for enhanced traction. 
* Compression of a gas, for example pneumatic shock absorbers, which can act like springs as the air pressure is building to resist the force on it. Enclosed gas is compressible, so equipment is less subject to shock damage. This concept was first applied in series production on Citroën cars in 1954. Today, many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen, to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use. This causes foaming which temporarily reduces the damping ability of the unit. In very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use, there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber to act as a reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas. In aircraft landing gear, air shock absorbers may be combined with hydraulic damping to reduce bounce. Such struts are called &quot;oleo struts&quot; (combining oil and air) .
* Inertial resistance to acceleration, the Citroën 2CV had shock absorbers that damp wheel bounce with no external moving parts. These consisted of a spring-mounted 3.5 kg (7.75 lb) iron weight inside a vertical cylinder and are similar to, yet much smaller than versions of the tuned mass dampers used on tall buildings.
* Composite hydropneumatic suspension combines many suspension elements in a single device: spring action, shock absorption, ride-height control, and self leveling suspension. This combines the advantages of gas compressibility and the ability of hydraulic machinery to apply force multiplication.
* Conventional shock absorbers can be combined with air suspension springs - an alternate way to achieve ride-height control, and self leveling suspension.
* In an electrorheological fluid damper, an electric field changes the viscosity of the oil. This principle allows semi-active damper applications in automotive and various industries.
* Magnetic field variation: a magnetorheological damper changes its fluid characteristics through an electromagnet.
* The effect of a shock absorber at high (sound) frequencies is usually limited by using a compressible gas as the working fluid or mounting it with rubber bushings.

==Special features==
*Some shock absorbers allow tuning of the ride via control of the valve by a manual adjustment provided at the shock absorber. 
*In more expensive vehicles the valves may be remotely adjustable, offering the driver control of the ride at will while the vehicle is operated. 
*Additional control can be provided by dynamic valve control via computer in response to sensors, giving both a smooth ride and a firm suspension when needed, allowing ride height adjustment or even ride height control. 
*Ride height control is especially desirable in highway vehicles intended for occasional rough road use, as a means of improving handling and reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the vehicle when operating on improved high speed roads.
*Heatsinks, fans, or liquid cooling to prevent or delay shock fade and failure (oil leak) due to overheating

==Shock absorber and strut comparison==

* A strut is a structural component that combines the shock absorber with other suspension parts like the coil spring and steering knuckle into one compact unit 
* Unlike a shock absorber, a strut has a reinforced body and stem.
* Struts are subjected to multidirectional loads, while a shock absorber only damps vibration, only receiving a load along its axis.
* Struts and shock absorbers have a different way of attachment. Shock absorbers are mounted through rubber or urethane bushings to the frame and suspension. A strut is hard mounted to the suspension and is mounted to the frame through a rotating plate providing the upper pivot point of the steering.

<text>The Canadian province of Nova Scotia was a British colony with a system of responsible government since 1848, before it joined Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since Confederation, the province has been a part of the Canadian federation and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters.

Nova Scotia has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The premier is Nova Scotia&#x27;s head of government, and the king in right of Nova Scotia is its head of state and is represented by the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Nova Scotia, and presides over that body.

Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also occur if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion. Nova Scotia has had 27 individuals serve as premier since Confederation, of which 12 were Conservatives, 14 were Liberals, and one New Democrat.

Two premiers of Nova Scotia later became prime minister of Canada, John Sparrow David Thompson and Charles Tupper.

<text>The year 1965 in television involved some significant events.
Below is a list of television-related events in 1965.

==Events==
*January 1 – Comedian Soupy Sales, who hosted the &quot;Lunch With Soupy Sales&quot; children&#x27;s program on New York City&#x27;s WNEW-TV, encourages his young viewers to send him money from their parents&#x27; pants and pocketbooks and send them to him, and in return he would &quot;send you a postcard from Puerto Rico!&quot; Days later, when he actually got response, he declared that he was joking and that cash contributions would be donated to charity, but WNEW suspended Sales for two weeks over the incident.
*February 22 – A new, videotaped production of the 1957 special &quot;Cinderella&quot;, by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, airs on CBS with young Lesley Ann Warren (in the title role) starring alongside Ginger Rogers, Walter Pidgeon, and Celeste Holm.
*March 11 – After months of speculation, Vivian Vance announces she is departing &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; following the conclusion of its third season. She would return to the series for guest appearances a few years later, a tradition that continued into Lucille Ball&#x27;s following series, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;.
*March 24 – Live TV pictures from the US uncrewed moon probe Ranger 9 are transmitted prior to its impact.
*April 5 – TEN10 opens in Sydney, Australia, with the highlight of the opening night being the variety special &quot;TV Spells Magic&quot;.
*April 15 – Paul Bryan (Ben Gazzara) gets bad news from his doctor and sets out to do all the things he never had time for, in the Kraft Suspense Theatre episode entitled &quot;Rapture at Two-Forty.&quot; This will serve as the pilot for the series &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, which will premiere on September 13 and run until 1968.
*April 21 – The Beach Boys appear on &quot;Shindig!&quot; performing their most recent hit, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;
*April 26 – Brazil&#x27;s largest TV network, Rede Globo, begins broadcasting.
*April 28 – &quot;My Name Is Barbra&quot;, Barbra Streisand&#x27;s first TV special, airs on CBS.
*May 2 – The Rolling Stones make their second appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.
*June 4 – The launch of the Gemini 4 space mission is broadcast in color by NBC. All three networks would carry the launch of Gemini 5 in color that August and all subsequent crewed space launches.
*July 31 - GTV (Ghana) begins as GBC TV, making it the first television station in Ghana.
*August 1 – Cigarette adverts are banned from UK television, though pipe tobacco and cigar adverts continue until 1992.
*August 6 – BBC withdraws a planned airing of &quot;The War Game&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Play&quot; anthology series; the network, officially, deems the film&#x27;s depiction of a fictional nuclear attack on the United Kingdom and its aftermath as &quot;too horrifying&quot; to air on television, though it was widely believed that government pressure led to the banning. The film would win the 1966 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, and BBC would not screen the film on-air until 1985.
*September – ABC, CBS, and NBC, begin transitioning a majority of their prime-time programming towards color, with NBC virtually all their programming in color, and ABC and CBS over half of their programs, while keeping some of them in black-and-white due to production costs. 
*September 10 – The first &quot;National Geographic Special&quot;, a chronicle of a 1963 U.S. expedition to Mount Everest, airs on CBS.
*September 12 
**NBC takes over telecasts of the American Football League, with most of the games being broadcast in color.
**The Beatles appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; for the fourth and final time, performing songs from their new album &quot;Help!&quot;. This appearance was videotaped on August 14 before the group launched their U.S. tour the following night at Shea Stadium (Sunday, August 15, 1965).
*September 13 – &quot;Today&quot; on NBC goes color.
*September 25 - &quot;The Beatles&quot; cartoons debut on ABC for 39 episodes through October 21, 1967.
*September 29 - Sistema Nacional de Televisión (as TV Cerro Cora) begins the first television broadcasts in Paraguay.
*October 4 – Pope Paul VI&#x27;s visit to New York receives saturation television coverage on all three major American television networks. The Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium is broadcast in color.
*October 17 – WBMG-TV in Birmingham, Alabama launches on channel 42, sharing dual CBS/NBC affiliation with crosstown WAPI-TV—and allowing viewers in the Birmingham market to watch more programming from those networks that WAPI did not have room for (including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The CBS Evening News&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;). The setup lasts until 1970, when WAPI takes sole affiliation with NBC and WBMG does the same with CBS. At the same time, WCFT-33 in Tuscaloosa and WHMA-40 in Anniston become exclusive affiliates of CBS. Like WBMG, Channels 33 and 40 were dual affiliates of NBC and CBS.
*November 5 – Katie Holstrum (Inger Stevens) and Congressman Glen Morley (William Windom) are married in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; episode entitled &quot;To Have and To Hold&quot;.
*November 15 – &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; on NBC goes color on a regular basis, the first network evening newscast to be colorcast nightly.
*November 25 – CBS airs the first color broadcast of an NFL football game, a Thanksgiving Day matchup between the Baltimore Colts and Detroit Lions.
*November 28 – Julie Andrews&#x27; first TV special airs on NBC.
*December 4 – &quot;TV Guide&quot; launches its Montana edition and now covers all of the contiguous U.S. (A Hawaii edition will be launched in 1968.)
*December 9 – &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; premieres on CBS.
*December 21 – A production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by the New York City Ballet airs on CBS.
;Also in 1965
*Three independently affiliated stations in the Philadelphia market—The &quot;Other Big 3 in Philly&quot;—start operations: WIBF (channel 29) opens on May 16; WKBS-TV (channel 48) opens on September 1 (and operates until 1983); and WPHL-TV (channel 17) opens on September 17.
* Motorola introduces the first successful rectangular tube color TV to the mass market.
* &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; moves to 12:00 noon on NBC, which would make the show a hit on the network for many years.

<text>A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.

The term originally referred to portions of a log that had been riven (split lengthwise) into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright&#x27;s work than to the materials they used.

==History==
The spoked wheel was invented to allow the construction of lighter and swifter vehicles. The earliest physical evidence for spoked wheels were found in the Sintashta culture, dating to 2000 BCE. Soon after this, horse cultures of the Caucasus region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war chariots for the greater part of three centuries. They moved deep into the Greek peninsula, where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical Greece after the breaking of Minoan dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical Sparta and Athens. 

Neo-Chalcolithic/proto-historic period (1800-1200 BCE) paintings in various regions of India such as Chibbar Nulla, Chhatur Bhoj Nath Nulla, Kathotia, etc. depict the usage of chariots with spoked wheels. 

Celtic chariots introduced an iron rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium BCE. The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire wheels and rubber tires were invented.

== Construction ==

Spokes can be made of wood, metal, or synthetic fiber depending on whether they will be in tension or compression.

===Compression spokes===
The original type of spoked wheel with wooden spokes was used for horse-drawn carriages and wagons. In early motor cars, wooden spoked wheels of the artillery type were normally used.

In a simple wooden wheel, a load on the hub causes the wheel rim to flatten slightly against the ground as the lowermost wooden spoke shortens and compresses. The other wooden spokes show no significant change.

Wooden spokes are mounted radially. They are also dished, usually to the outside of the vehicle, to prevent wobbling. Also, the dishing allows the wheel to compensate for expansion of the spokes due to absorbed moisture by dishing more.

===Tension spokes===

For use in bicycles, heavy wooden-spoked wheels were replaced by lighter wheels with spokes made of tensioned, adjustable metal wires, called wire wheels. These are also used in wheelchairs, motorcycles, automobiles, and early aircraft.

====Types====
Some types of wheels have removable spokes that can be replaced individually if they break or bend. These include bicycle and wheelchair wheels. High quality bicycles with conventional wheels use spokes of stainless steel, while cheaper bicycles may use galvanized (also called &quot;rustless&quot;) or chrome plated spokes. While a good quality spoke is capable of supporting about 225 kgf (c. 500 pounds-force or 2,200 newtons) of tension, they are used at a fraction of this load to avoid suffering fatigue failures. Since bicycle and wheelchair wheel spokes are only in tension, flexible and strong materials such as synthetic fibers, are also occasionally used. Metal spokes can also be ovalized or bladed to reduce aerodynamic drag, and butted (double or even triple) to reduce weight while maintaining strength.

A variation on the wire-spoked wheel was Tioga&#x27;s &quot;Tension Disk&quot;, which appeared superficially to be a solid disk but was in fact constructed using the same principles as a normal tension-spoked wheel. Instead of individual wire spokes, a continuous thread of Kevlar (aramid) was used to lace the hub to the rim under high tension. The threads were encased in a translucent disk for protection and some aerodynamic benefit, but this was not a structural component.

====Tangential lacing====
Wire spokes can be radial to the hub but are more often mounted tangentially to the hub. Tangential spoking allows for the transfer of torque between the rim and the hub. Tangential spokes are thus necessary for the drive wheel, which has torque at the hub from pedalling, and any wheels using hub-mounted brakes such as disk or band brakes, which transfer torque from the rim to the brake in the opposite direction—(via the hub) when braking.

====Wheelbuilding====
Constructing a tension-spoked wheel from its constituent parts is called wheelbuilding and requires the correct building procedure for a strong and long-lasting end product. Tensioned spokes are usually attached to the rim or sometimes the hub with a spoke nipple. The other end is commonly peened into a disk or uncommonly bent into a &quot;Z&quot; to keep it from pulling through its hole in the hub. The bent version has the advantage of replacing a broken spoke in a rear bicycle wheel without having to remove the rear gears.

Wire wheels, with their excellent weight-to-strength ratio, soon became popular for light vehicles. For everyday cars, wire wheels were soon replaced by the less expensive metal disc wheel, but wire wheels remained popular for sports cars up to the 1960s. Spoked wheels are still popular on motorcycles and bicycles.

== Spoke length ==

When building a bicycle wheel, the spokes must have the correct length, otherwise there may not be enough threads engaged, producing a weaker wheel, or they may protrude through the rim and possibly puncture the inner tube.

=== Calculation ===

For bicycle spokes, the spoke length is defined from the flange seat to the thread tip. For spokes with bent ends, the nominal spoke length does &quot;not&quot; include the width of the spoke at the bent end.

For wheels with crossed spokes (which are the norm), the desired spoke length is
:formula_1
where
* d = distance from the center of hub (along the axis) to flange, for example 30 mm,
* r1 = spoke hole circle radius of the hub, for example 19.5 mm,
* r2 = half of effective Rim Diameter (ERD), or the diameter the ends of the spokes make in a built wheel (see &#x27;Discussion&#x27; attached to this article for explanation) of the rim, for example 301 mm,
* r3 = radius of spoke holes in the &quot;flange&quot;, for example 1.1 mm,
* m = number of spokes to be used for one side of the wheel, for example =18,
* k = number of crossings per spoke, for example 3 and
* a = 360° &quot;k&quot;/&quot;m&quot;, for example = 60°.

Regarding d: For a symmetric wheel such as a front wheel with no disc brake, this is half the distance between the flanges. For an asymmetric wheel such as a front wheel with disc brake or a rear wheel with chain derailleur, the value of d is different for the left and right sides.

a is the angle between (1) the radius to a nipple hole in the rim to which a spoke is attached, and, (2) the radius to the flange hole holding the spoke. The spoke crosses either 1, 2, or 3 oppositely pointing spokes depending on the lacing design. On the flange, the angle between the radii of adjacent holes is 360°/&quot;m&quot; (for equally spaced holes). For each spoke crossed, the hub is rotated with reference to the rim one &quot;angle between adjacent flange holes&quot;. Thus, multiplying the &quot;angle between adjacent flange holes&quot; by &quot;k&quot; gives the angle a. For example, a 32 spoke wheel has 16 spokes per side, 360° divided by 16 equals 22.5°. Multiply 22.5° (&quot;angle between adjacent flange holes&quot;) by the number of crossings to get the angle a—if 3-crosses, the 32 spoke wheel has an angle a of 67.5°. Regarding r3: The size of the spoke holes in the flange does not matter for the needed spoke length. This term removes the effect of the hole size. Since the holes are usually small (just over 2 mm in diameter), the effect is small and in practice matters little.

For radially spoked wheels (zero crossings), the formula simplifies to the Pythagorean theorem, with spoke length l plus r3 being the slope, r2 minus r1 being the base, and d being the rise:
:formula_2; or solving for the length
:formula_3

=== Derivation ===

The spoke length formula computes the length of the space diagonal of an imaginary rectangular box. Imagine holding a wheel in front of you such that a nipple is at the top. Look at the wheel from along the axis. The spoke through the top hole is now a diagonal of the imaginary box. The box has a depth of &quot;d&quot;, a height of &quot;r&quot;2-&quot;r&quot;1cos(&quot;α&quot;) and a width of &quot;r&quot;1sin(&quot;a&quot;).

Equivalently, the law of cosines may be used to first compute the length of the spoke as projected on the wheel&#x27;s plane (as illustrated in the diagram), followed by an application of the Pythagorean theorem.

<text>The year 1963 involved some significant events in television. Below are lists of notable TV-related events.

==Events==
*January 1 – Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy)&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first serialized animated series based on the popular manga, is broadcast for the first time, on the Japanese television station Fuji Television.
*January 13 – BBC Television broadcasts the play &quot;Madhouse on Castle Street&quot; in the &quot;Sunday-Night Theatre&quot; series. The play co-stars a young American folk music singer named Bob Dylan.
*March 12 – Television broadcasts begin in the Nakhichevan ASSR (present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within Azerbaijan) with the launch of Nakhchivan TV.
*April 1 – German terrestrial channel ZDF (pronounced &quot;tseht-day-ehf&quot;) begins broadcasting.
*April 15 - Three months after the first test broadcast, Television Singapura Channel 5 (now Mediacorp Channel 5) signs on as Singapore&#x27;s first TV station.
*May 15 – First television pictures transmitted from a US manned space capsule (&quot;Faith 7&quot;). Due to the poor picture quality, only NBC carries the transmission, and on tape-delay, not live.
*July 8 – The English comedy sketch &quot;Dinner for One&quot; with Freddie Frinton, having been shown live on Peter Frankenfeld&#x27;s show &quot;GutenAbend&quot; in 1962, is recorded in English by Norddeutscher Rundfunk before an audience at the Theater am Besenbinderhof, Hamburg, West Germany. Regularly repeated on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Germany and elsewhere, it is not seen in its entirety on British television until 2018.
*July 22 – Bob Crane quits his DJ job at radio station KNX to become a regular on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; after dividing time between the Screen Gems TV show and the CBS Radio affiliate. Crane had been a top five morning drive radio DJ since the mid-1950s in the Los Angeles market.
*August 28 – Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his I Have a Dream speech which is covered by major American networks.
*September 2 – &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; becomes network television&#x27;s first half-hour weeknight news broadcast, when the show is lengthened from 15 to 30 minutes.
*September 9 – One week later, NBC also expands its evening network news program, &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, to 30 minutes.
*September 27 – &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot; makes its debut on TV across North America with the first episode entitled &quot;Blue Water Sailor&quot;.
*September 29 – &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; makes its debut on CBS, which later got cancelled in 1964 after one season (due to competition with the ever popular NBC western Bonanza airing in the same time slot).
*September 30 – BBC Television begins using a globe as its symbol. They will continue to use it in varying forms until 2002.
*October 1 – ABC News at last drops its dependence on outside sources of news film and begins to rely on its own camera crews.
*October 14 − ABC affiliate WGHP in High Point, North Carolina signs on the air.
*November 22 – All three major U.S. networks start pre-emptions for a week following the news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The pre-emptions unofficially begin a few minutes after President Kennedy is shot: on the top-rated American soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Nancy Hughes (Helen Wagner) is in the middle of a discussion with Grandpa (Santos Ortega) about Bob&#x27;s (Don Hastings) decision to invite Lisa (Eileen Fulton) to Thanksgiving dinner when Walter Cronkite interrupts Wagner mid-speech to deliver the bulletin. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; continues for one more scene (at this time, the show is transmitted live) before Cronkite cuts in permanently. News of the assassination, and later the funeral procession, are the first television broadcasts across the Pacific Ocean (via Relay 1 satellite).
*November 23 – On BBC Television in the United Kingdom:
**William Hartnell stars as the First Doctor in the very first episode of science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (first of the 4-part serial &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;). So many people complain of having missed it (because of the disruption to schedules caused by the assassination of John F. Kennedy) that the following Saturday episode 1 is repeated before the broadcast of episode 2. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; runs until 1989 and is revived from 2005.
**&quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; broadcasts a serious Kennedy tribute episode. 
*November 24 – Jack Ruby murders John F. Kennedy&#x27;s suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald live on television.
*November 25 – All major American networks cover the state funeral of John F. Kennedy.
*November 28 - CBS&#x27; Huntsville television station WHNT begins on the air.
*December 7 – Instant replay is used for the first time during the live transmission of the Army–Navy Game by its inventor, director Tony Verna.
*December 28 – The launch of television broadcasting service in Malaysia, TV Malaysia, as predecessor of RTM TV1, member of Radio Televisyen Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, presided by government leaders from studios in Ampang Road in the capital.
*In Blanchard, North Dakota, construction on the KTHI TV transmitter mast (now KVLY-TV) was completed. Upon completion, its height of 2,063 ft (629m) made it the tallest structure in the world until 1966, when the nearby KXJB-TV mast (now KRDK) was completed. It still stands today, but at 1,987 ft tall due to an FCC spectrum repack.
*For the first time, most Americans say that they get more of their news from television than newspapers.
*The television remote control is authorized by the FCC.
