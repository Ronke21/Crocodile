<text>Earl Simmons (December 18, 1970 – April 9, 2021), known professionally as DMX, was an American rapper and actor. The recipient of various accolades, he won an American Music Award, a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award, and was nominated for six Grammy Awards. Regarded as an influential figure in the late 1990s and one of the greats of hip hop, his music is characterized by his &quot;aggressive&quot; rapping style, with lyrical content varying from hardcore themes to prayers. His violent lyricism helped popularize the horrorcore genre.

DMX began rapping in the early 1990s. After an unsuccessful tenure on Columbia Records, he signed with Ruff Ryders Entertainment in a joint venture with Def Jam Recordings to release his debut studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s Dark and Hell Is Hot&quot; (1998), which was met with critical and commercial success—selling 251,000 copies in its first week and spawning the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 20 single, &quot;Ruff Ryders Anthem&quot;. His second album, &quot;Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood&quot; (1999), was followed by his third, (1999), which became his best-selling release and was supported by his second top 40 single, &quot;Party Up (Up in Here)&quot;. His fourth album, &quot;The Great Depression&quot; (2001), was followed by his fifth, &quot;Grand Champ&quot; (2003), which was led by the single &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot; and included the international bonus track &quot;X Gon&#x27; Give It to Ya&quot;. DMX became the first artist to have their first five albums consecutively debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and by his death on April 9, 2021, he had sold over 75 million records worldwide.

DMX acted in commercially successful films such as &quot;Belly&quot; (1998), alongside rapper Nas, &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; (2000) and &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; (2003), alongside Jet Li, and &quot;Exit Wounds&quot; (2001), alongside Steven Seagal. In 2006, he starred in the reality television series &quot;&quot;, which was primarily aired on the BET cable television network. In 2003, he published a book of his memoirs titled &quot;E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX&quot;.

==Early life==
Earl Simmons was born on December 18, 1970, in Mount Vernon, New York. He was the son of 19-year-old Arnett Simmons and 18-year-old Joe Barker. Simmons was the middle child of the family; his mother had given birth to a daughter, Bonita, two years prior, and later gave birth to a second daughter, Shayla, and two stillborn sons. His father, Barker, painted watercolor paintings of street scenes to sell at local fairs, having moved to Philadelphia to fulfill his career.

In his childhood years, Simmons first suffered from physical violence at the hands of his mother and was diagnosed with bronchial asthma. He was raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. He disassociated himself from the spirituality after he was injured in an accident by a driver. At the age of five, his mother sent him to live with relatives in Yonkers&#x27; School Street housing apartments. After suffering from his mother&#x27;s abuse, he was expelled from a middle school at the age of ten, having been sent to a group home. He then returned to Yonkers at age fifteen, sleeping in empty storage bins and befriending stray dogs. Due to poor grades at Yonkers Middle High School, Simmons was unable to finish his track and field team schedule. Broke, he robbed several students to find food and clothing for himself, as well as a leather collar and harness for his pet dog. He began carjacking.

==Musical career==
===1985–1995: Career beginnings===
His career began in 1985, when he beatboxed for a local rapper named Ready Ron. They would do small shows together where Ron would perform as a rapper, and DMX would beatbox and provide adlibs. After some time, he realized Ron was becoming more prominent on the scene, so he decided to start rapping himself under the name &quot;DMX&quot; inspired by the Oberheim DMX drum machine—he made it an initialism for &quot;Divine Master Of the Unknown&quot; and later &quot;Darkman X&quot;. After serving a two-year prison sentence, he began writing his own lyrics and performing at the local recreation center for younger children. In 1988, while in prison for carjacking, he began dedicating more of his free time to writing lyrics and battling other inmates. During this time, he had created a style called &quot;Spellbound&quot; where he spelled each word out letter by letter. He and future rival, K-Solo, engaged in battles. The initial Ruff Ryders group started with a preteen Jadakiss, Swizz Beatz as a child, and DMX. In 1988, Irv Gotti was roommates with producer Chad Elliott who later introduced him in the Schlobohm housing projects in Yonkers to DMX and brothers Joaquin &quot;Waah&quot; and Darrin &quot;Dee&quot; Dean, who had mentioned they were creating a company called Ruff Ryders together. Gotti convinced Waah to buy him a drum machine to produce records for DMX. Elliott and Gotti produced a beat in 1989 called &quot;Born Loser&quot; which became one of DMX&#x27;s first music demo&#x27;s.

He later made an appearance on &quot;The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show&quot; in January 1991, where he provided a freestyle. &quot;The Source&quot; praised DMX in its &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column that highlighted unsigned hip-hop artists. In 1991, DMX signed a management deal with the then-unknown record label Ruff Ryders Entertainment. Later that year, Columbia Records signed DMX to its subsidiary labels Chaos Records and Ruffhouse Records, which released his major debut single &quot;Born Loser&quot; in 1993. Failing to meet commercial projections and not reaching any music charts, he was then terminated from his contract with Ruffhouse and became an independent artist. In January 1994, Death Row Records attempted to sign the rapper in a joint venture with Ruff Ryders, although this never materialized.

===1996–1997: Building hype and signing to Def Jam===
After two years of struggling in the industry, his friend and associate, Irv Gotti, became the president of A&amp;R at Def Jam Recordings. After showcasing for then-president Lyor Cohen, DMX was signed to Def Jam Recordings in May 1997.

===1998–2000: Debut album and commercial success===

DMX recorded tracks from April 1997 to January 1998 for his debut album. During this time, his guest appearances on Mase&#x27;s singles &quot;24 Hrs. to Live&quot; and &quot;Take What&#x27;s Yours&quot;, The Lox&#x27;s single &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot;, and Def Jam labelmate LL Cool J&#x27;s single &quot;4, 3, 2, 1&quot; created a strong buzz for his upcoming album. In February 1998, he released his debut major-label single &quot;Get at Me Dog&quot; on Def Jam Recordings. The single received an RIAA certification of gold. His first major-label album &quot;It&#x27;s Dark and Hell Is Hot&quot;, which included the single &quot;Ruff Ryders&#x27; Anthem&quot;, was then released in May 1998. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the U.S. and sold over six million copies. In December 1998, he released his album &quot;Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood&quot;. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went multi-platinum. DMX became the only rapper alive to have his first two consecutive number-one Billboard 200 albums within a one-year period (seven months by calculation) and the first since Tupac Shakur; DMX&#x27;s record would later be surpassed two different times in 2020 by YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who made the number one position with two albums in six months (a month down by proxy, making it the fastest) and also had three number one albums in ten months between 2019 and 2020, also beating another &quot;Billboard&quot; record by DMX involving a quantity of number one rap albums within a year.

He released his third album &quot;... And Then There Was X&quot;, on December 21, 1999. It was his third album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Its most popular single, &quot;Party Up (Up in Here)&quot;, became his first top ten hit on the R&amp;B charts, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards. The album was certified six-times Platinum, and was also nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards. In 2000, DMX also made a cameo appearance in the Sum 41 music video for &quot;Makes No Difference&quot;.

In late 2000, he joined other Hip Hop and Nu Metal artists on the Anger Management Tour. Appearing alongside Limp Bizkit, Godsmack and Sinnistar for the second half of the tour from November 24 to December 19, 2000.

===2001–2004: Return to music===
After improving his legal situation, DMX returned to the studio to complete his fourth album, &quot;The Great Depression&quot;. With its release on October 23, 2001, it was his fourth album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, featuring the singles &quot;Who We Be&quot;, &quot;We Right Here&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s triple platinum certification, its commercial and critical success was lower than his previous album. His fifth album, &quot;Grand Champ&quot;, released in September 2003, once again debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming his final album in his lifetime to do so. It sold over four million in the U.S., including the singles &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot; and &quot;Get It on the Floor&quot;. After its release, he informed the public that he planned to retire, intending for &quot;Grand Champ&quot; to be his final album.

===2005–2011: &quot;Year of the Dog... Again&quot; and &quot;The Definition of X&quot;===

After conflict with Def Jam, and in exchange for signing Nas (his &quot;Belly&quot; co-star) to the label in a de facto trade, DMX signed to Columbia Records, Def Jam&#x27;s former parent company, in January 2006, returning to the label since 1992. He recorded his sixth album, &quot;Year of the Dog... Again&quot;, while switching between the two labels, which caused numerous delays. It was released on August 1, 2006, and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He released two more singles, &quot;Lord Give Me a Sign&quot; and &quot;We in Here&quot;. The album received mixed reviews from critics. On June 12, 2007, Def Jam released his greatest hits album, &quot;The Definition of X: The Pick of the Litter&quot;.

In 2009, DMX claimed he would pursue preaching in Jersey City, New Jersey as well as continue to produce music. He completed a Gospel music album prior to his incarceration. According to MTV, he had semi-retired to study the Bible in an effort to give messages behind the pulpit. Def Jam released another compilation album in 2010 titled &quot;The Best of DMX&quot;, which features hit singles including &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot; and &quot;X Gon&#x27; Give It To Ya&quot;.

===2011–2013: &quot;Undisputed&quot;===
On October 11, 2011, DMX performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. He stated that he has been working &quot;nonstop, every day&quot; on his seventh album, which was titled &quot;Undisputed&quot;. A video for a new track titled &quot;Last Hope&quot; was released via the Internet on September 24, 2011, and was later included on &quot;The Weigh In&quot; EP released digitally on May 5, 2012. In late February 2012, Seven Arts Pictures acquired the catalog of DMX&#x27;s music and signed DMX to a two-album deal. During a performance at New York&#x27;s Santos Party House on December 25, 2011, DMX stated that the new album would be titled &quot;Undisputed&quot; and would be released on March 26, 2012. After numerous delays, the album was eventually released on September 11, 2012, and featured production from Swizz Beatz and J.R. Rotem with a guest appearance by MGK.

===2013–2021: Def Jam reunion and &quot;Exodus&quot;===
In 2013, DMX announced he had begun working on his eighth studio album. He collaborated with producers Swizz Beatz and Dame Grease. In December, after regaining his passport, he embarked on a world tour with performances in Bulgaria and Kosovo. On January 7, 2015, Seven Arts Music announced that DMX would be releasing &quot;Redemption of the Beast&quot; the following week; however, close personal friend and recurring collaborator producer/rapper/entrepreneur Swizz Beatz and DMX&#x27;s management confirmed that this was false. On January 13, 2015, Seven Arts Music released &quot;Redemption of the Beast&quot;, without acquiring a legal artist contract. On January 15, 2015, it was announced by DMX&#x27;s brother/manager Montana that DMX was no longer signed to Seven Arts Music and that they would be taking legal action against Seven Arts Music for the unauthorized release of &quot;Redemption of the Beast&quot;.

Long-time collaborator Swizz Beatz stated that two of the collaborators on the album would be Kanye West and Dr. Dre.

He joined fellow labelmate, LL Cool J, in the reunion with the label.

DMX&#x27;s eighth and posthumous studio album, &quot;Exodus&quot;, was released through Def Jam on May 28, 2021.

==Personal life==

===Religion===
DMX was a born-again Christian, and stated that he read the Bible every day. While in jail, DMX stated that he had a purpose for being there: DMX was a transitional deacon and aspired to become ordained as a pastor, stating that he received this call in 2009. In 2016, he gave a sermon at a church in Phoenix, Arizona.

===Relationships and children===

DMX was the father of 15 children from 9 different women. He married his childhood friend Tashera Simmons in 1999. They divorced in 2014. They had four children together: Xavier (born 1992), Tacoma (born 1999), Sean (born 2002), and Praise Mary Ella (born 2005). In July 2010, after his first of three incarcerations that year, Tashera announced their separation. They remained friends, although in 2016, Tashera accused DMX of missing his $10,000/month child support payment.

DMX had a daughter, Sasha (born 2002), with Patricia Trejo. In 2012, Trejo sued DMX for $1 million in unpaid child support. The case was settled in 2013.
DMX and Monique Wayne, a Maryland resident, fought over her claim that he was the father of her son born in 2004. She sued him for defamation and for child support. After genetic testing proved that DMX was the father, in January 2008, DMX was ordered to pay Wayne $1.5 million, but a judge vacated the judgment in May 2008.

DMX also fathered a son and a daughter with Yadira Borrego. The son was 11 years old at the time of DMX&#x27;s death, while the daughter&#x27;s age was not known by the general public. He fathered another child with his fiancée Desiree Lindstrom on August 16, 2016.

DMX&#x27;s final two children, twin boys, were born on December 5, 2019. Their mother is Pebbles Junell.

DMX did not have a will. As a result, legal battles ensued in probate courts following his death.

===Finances and bankruptcies===
DMX filed for bankruptcy three times. His first filing was on July 30, 2013, citing his child support obligations as his priority claim. The filing was challenged by the United States Trustee Program and was dismissed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on November 11, 2013.

===Feud with Ja Rule===
During the 1990s, DMX formed a close bond with fellow up-and-coming rappers Jay-Z and Ja Rule. The three collaborated many times and formed a group known as Murder Inc. The group was short-lived due to internal issues between DMX and Jay-Z. After the breakup of the group DMX disparaged Ja Rule, accusing him of being a copycat and drawing comparisons between himself and what he saw as Ja Rule stealing his signature &quot;gruff&quot; style of delivery. DMX would then release his second album &quot;Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood&quot; which contained the diss track &quot;We Don&#x27;t Give Fuck&quot; that was directed towards Ja Rule and produced by Irv Gotti. Ja Rule would then respond in the song &quot;We Different&quot; from the compilation album Irv Gotti Presents: The Murderers. DMX would also go on to throw shots at Ja Rule in his song &quot;Do You&quot; from Funkmaster Flex&#x27;s mixtape The Mix Tape, Vol. IV.

In 2002, DMX released his diss track &quot;They Want War&quot; on DJ Kay Slay&#x27;s mixtape Streetsweepers Presents The Regulator Pt. 5 The Final Chapter. Ja Rule never responded directly but he went on to diss DMX in his songs &quot;Fuck With Us&quot; and &quot;Connected&quot; from his album &quot;The Last Temptation&quot;. The next year DMX would take shots at Ja Rule in the song &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; with Eminem and Obie Trice from the &quot;Cradle 2 The Grave&quot; soundtrack. DMX would also release another diss track titled &quot;Ruled Out&quot; and he would also diss Ja Rule again in his song &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot;. Ja Rule then dissed DMX in Caddillac Tah&#x27;s song &quot;Duck&quot; and his own songs &quot;Clap Back&quot; and &quot;Blood In My Eye&quot; from his album of the same name. However, as time passed and the feud faded into obscurity, DMX said that he wanted to officially bring it to an end when he was released from prison in 2005: &quot;Gotti came to me in jail and said I want to make peace with you and him. I was like, &#x27;Alright Gotti, let&#x27;s do it.&quot; Despite this, DMX and Ja Rule did not officially end their feud until 2009, at VH1&#x27;s Hip Hop Honors.

===Feud with Jay-Z===
When DMX partnered with Jay-Z and Ja Rule in Murder Inc., there was a feud between the two, which also contributed to the failure of the group and working together. According to reports, the feud started in the early 1990s after a rap battle between the two, which led to DMX&#x27;s disdain for Jay-Z. Prior to DMX&#x27;s death, the feud, although it fizzled out over the years, continued when DMX said in an Instagram video that he wanted to rap battle Jay-Z on Verzuz.

Simmons stated that it was from an asthma attack.

On April 2, 2021, at approximately 11:00pm, Simmons was rushed to White Plains Hospital, where he was reported to be in critical condition following a heart attack at his home possibly resulting from a drug overdose.

DMX&#x27;s former wife, Tashera Simmons and Ruff Ryders founders Waah &amp; Dee also gave a speech. There was some controversial testimonies like former Def Jam chief Lyor Cohen, when his video featured an overhead view of a beach and explained how Earl Simmons was a wonderful man while DMX was a gremlin. Additionally, Def Jam cofounder Russell Simmons compared his own issues with drug abuse to DMX via video. The homegoing ended with DMX&#x27;s obituary read on stage and a virtual performance from Faith Evans.

At the funeral, New York City community leader and peacemaker Erica Ford presented DMX&#x27;s family several citations and proclamations from the New York governor&#x27;s and Senate&#x27;s office, including a proclamation from the New York state Senate declaring December 18—DMX&#x27;s birthday—&quot;Earl &#x27;DMX&#x27; Simmons Day.&quot; Additional citations came from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Mike Spano of Yonkers (the hometown of DMX). Cuomo had the flag flying over the state capitol on the day of DMX&#x27;s death presented to his family.

On June 28, 2021, his music was represented by former Def Jam labelmate Method Man, close friend Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes and actor Michael K. Williams (who himself would pass away five months later) at the BET Awards 2021.

=== Impact ===
DMX had a significant impact on hip hop music and is considered a &quot;legend&quot; in the genre. He&#x27;s credited for having &quot;defined 2000s rap&quot; and for being &quot;among the most prolific rappers of his era&quot;. He broke and set numerous records. His early work was vastly different from most mainstream hip hop music at the time; while Puff Daddy and other artists of the Bad Boy Records label were at the height of popularity, characterized by their &quot;big-budget videos, lavish party-throwing, and dancefloor-ready music&quot;, DMX achieved success with a more dark, aggressive, &quot;rugged&quot;, less &quot;marketable&quot; style.

According to an Apple Music radio host: &quot;It was a complete 180...Puff was controlling the clubs; you were watching Bad Boy Records pop bottles, wear Rolexes, Jesus pieces, Coogi sweaters. Then here comes this crazy energetic figure from Yonkers with the Timbs and the bandanas, running around with pitbulls, giving a perspective on the streets that a lot of people weren&#x27;t familiar with and taking command of what hip-hop didn&#x27;t look like.&quot; DMX&#x27;s commercially successful violent lyricism helped popularize the horrorcore genre.

<text>A laundry symbol, also called a care symbol, is a pictogram indicating the manufacturer&#x27;s suggestions as to methods of washing, drying, dry-cleaning and ironing clothing. Such symbols are written on labels, known as care labels or care tags, attached to clothing to indicate how a particular item should best be cleaned. While there are internationally recognized standards for the care labels and pictograms, their exact use and form differ by region. In some standards, pictograms coexist with or are complemented by written instructions.

== Standards ==
GINETEX, the France-based European association for textile care labelling, was formed in 1963 in part to define international standards for the care and labelling of textiles. By the early 1970s, GINETEX was working with ISO to develop international standards for textile labelling, eventually leading to the ISO 3758 standard, &quot;Textiles – Care labelling code using symbols&quot;. ISO 3758 was supplemented in 1993, revised in 2005 and again in 2012 and 2023 with reviews of the standard held on a five-year cycle.

In March 1970, the Canadian Government Specifications Board published 86-GP-1, &quot;Standard for Care Labelling of Textiles&quot;, which promoted a symbol-based textile care labelling system in which symbols were colored: green indicated &quot;no precautions are necessary&quot;, yellow indicated &quot;some caution is necessary&quot;, and red indicated &quot;prohibited&quot;. Publication 86-GP-1 was revised several times over the following three decades; the most noteworthy change was in 1979, when temperatures changed from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and any additional instructions were to be added in text, in both English and French. In 2003, the system was withdrawn in favor of a black-and-white symbol-based system harmonized with North American and international standards. The inclusion of care symbols on garments made or sold in Canada has always been voluntary; only fabric content labels are mandatory (since 1972).

In 1996, in the United States, ASTM International published a system of pictorial care instructions as D5489 &quot;Standard Guide for Care Symbols for Care Instructions on Textile Products,&quot; with revisions in 1998, 2001, 2007, 2014, and 2018.

American Cleaning institute developed and published their guide to fabric care symbols.

Additional textile care labelling systems have been developed for Australia, China, and Japan. Worldwide, all of these systems tend to use similar pictograms or labelling to convey laundry care instructions. , the pictograms are not encoded in Unicode standards, because these symbols are not in the public domain across various countries, and are copyrighted.

==Pictograms==
=== General ===
The care label describes the allowable treatment of the garment without damaging the textile. Whether this treatment is necessary or sufficient, is not stated. A milder than specified treatment is always acceptable. The symbols are protected and their use is required to comply with the license conditions; incorrect labelling is prohibited. A bar below each symbol calls for a gentler treatment than usual and a double bar for a very gentle treatment.

=== Washing ===
A stylized &quot;washtub&quot; is shown, and the number in the tub means the maximum wash temperature (degrees Celsius). A bar under the tub signifies a gentler treatment in the washing machine. A double bar signifies very gentle handling. A hand in the tub signifies that only (gentle) hand washing (not above 40 °C) is allowed. A cross through washtub means that the textile may not be washed under normal household conditions. In the North American standard, dots are used to indicate the proper temperature range.

In the European standard, the level of wash agitation recommended is indicated by bars below the wash tub symbol. Absence of bar indicates a maximum agitation (cotton wash), a single bar indicates medium agitation (synthetics cycle) and a double bar indicates very minimal agitation (silk/wool cycle). The bar symbols also indicate the level of spin recommended with more bars indicating lower preferred spin speed.

=== Bleaching ===
An empty &quot;triangle&quot; (formerly lettered Cl) allows the bleaching with chlorine or non-chlorine bleach. Two oblique lines in the triangle prohibit chlorine bleaching. A crossed triangle prohibits any bleaching.

=== Drying ===
A &quot;circle in the square&quot; symbolizes a clothes dryer. One dot requires drying at reduced temperature and two dots for normal temperature. The crossed symbol means that the clothing does not tolerate machine drying. In the US and Japan, there are other icons for natural/line drying.

==== Tumble drying ====
==== Natural drying ====
=== Ironing ===
The &quot;iron&quot; with up to three dots allows for ironing. The number of dots are assigned temperatures: one prescribes , two for and three for . An iron with a cross prohibits ironing.

=== Professional cleaning ===
A &quot;circle&quot; identifies the possibilities of professional cleaning. A bar under the symbol means clean gently, and two bars means very gentle cleaning.

==== Dry cleaning ====
The letters P and F in a circle are for the different solvents used in professional dry cleaning.

==== Wet cleaning ====
The letter W in a circle is for professional wet cleaning.

<text>Echo &amp; the Bunnymen are an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1978. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson. By 1980, Pete de Freitas joined as the band&#x27;s drummer.

Their 1980 debut album &quot;Crocodiles&quot; went into the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. After releasing their second album &quot;Heaven Up Here&quot; in 1981, the band&#x27;s cult status was followed by mainstream success in the UK in 1983 when they scored a UK Top 10 hit with &quot;The Cutter&quot;, and the album which the song came from, &quot;Porcupine&quot;, hit number 2 in the UK. &quot;Ocean Rain&quot; (1984), continued the band&#x27;s UK chart success with its lead single &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; entering into the top 10.

After they released a self-titled album in 1987, McCulloch left the band and was replaced by singer Noel Burke. In 1989, de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident. After working together as Electrafixion, McCulloch and Sergeant regrouped with Pattinson in 1997 and returned as Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, before Pattinson&#x27;s departure in 1998. The band has done some touring and released several albums since the late 1990s to varying degrees of success. In more recent years the band have headlined the Rockaway Beach Festival twice. 

==History==
===Early years===
Ian McCulloch began his career in 1977, as one third of the Crucial Three, a bedroom band which also featured Julian Cope and Pete Wylie. When Wylie left, McCulloch and Cope formed the short-lived A Shallow Madness with drummer Dave Pickett and organist Paul Simpson, during which time such songs as &quot;Read It in Books&quot;, &quot;Robert Mitchum&quot;, &quot;You Think It&#x27;s Love&quot; and &quot;Spacehopper&quot; were written by the pair. When McCulloch left the band, A Shallow Madness changed their name to the Teardrop Explodes, and McCulloch joined with guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson to form Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. This early incarnation of the band featured a drum machine, assumed by many to be &quot;Echo&quot;, though this has been denied by the band. In the 1982 book &quot;Liverpool Explodes!&quot;, Will Sergeant explained the origin of the band&#x27;s name:

In November 1978, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen made their debut at Liverpool&#x27;s Eric&#x27;s Club, appearing as the opening act for the Teardrop Explodes. The band played one song, a 20-minute version of &quot;Monkeys&quot; which was entitled &quot;I Bagsy Yours&quot; at the time.

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s debut single &quot;The Pictures on My Wall&quot; was released on Bill Drummond &amp; David Balfe&#x27;s Zoo Records in May 1979, the B-side being &quot;Read It in Books&quot; (also recorded by the Teardrop Explodes approximately six months later as the B-side of their final Zoo Records single &quot;Treason&quot;). Though credited as a McCulloch/Cope collaboration, McCulloch has denied on more than one occasion that Cope had any involvement with its writing.

With the group now gaining wider attention, they were invited to record a four-song set for the BBC&#x27;S John Peel Show on August 22, at which time they were still using a drum machine. This was the first of six live sets they would cut for the Peel show between 1979 and 1983. 

By the time of their debut album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Crocodiles&quot; (July 1980), the drum machine had been replaced by Trinidad-born Pete de Freitas. Unlike the other band members, who were from working class Liverpool families, de Freitas was considered &quot;posh&quot; - he came from an affluent background, grew up in the south of England, and attended an elite private school. Despite his different background, the drummer&#x27;s affable and outgoing manner was a welcome addition for his famously fractious bandmates. De Freitas met the trio at their September 15, 1979 gig at Eric&#x27;s in Liverpool and immediately joined the band, but his October 12 live debut with them at London&#x27;s Electric Ballroom was less than auspicious. Supporting hugely popular ska bands Madness and Bad Manners, the Bunnymen proved an uncomfortable fit, and they were booed off after just two songs.

&quot;Rescue&quot; (produced by Ian Broudie), the lead single from &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, reached No. 62 on the UK singles chart but the album (co-produced by manager Bill Drummond and his business partner David Balfe of the Teardrop Explodes) broke into the Top 20, reaching No. 17, and garnered wide critical acclaim. 

Eschewing the traditional &quot;pin-up&quot; cover shot, &quot;Crocodiles&quot; featured an atmospheric cover image, which showed the band posed in a mysterious woodland setting, lit by hidden coloured lights. Designed by Martyn Atkins and photographed by Brian Griffin, it became the first in a coordinated series of elemental-themed album covers by Atkins and Griffin, which spanned their first four LPs, each depicting the band posed at some distance from the camera, in a visually striking natural setting -- a forest (&quot;Crocodiles&quot;), a beach at sunset (&quot;Heaven Up Here&quot;), a frozen waterfall in Iceland (&quot;Porcupine&quot;) and a subterranean river (&quot;Ocean Rain&quot;). It would not be until their fifth, self-titled album that the band employed a traditional group portrait.

===&quot;Shine So Hard&quot;===
The band embarked on their first major concert tour between September and December 1980 to promote &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, supported by London band the Sound, during which they performed their first European concerts in France, The Netherlands and Germany. The end of the Camo tour was followed by a four-month break, mainly dedicated to the preparation and recording of their second LP. 

Manager Bill Drummond (later of KLF) and lighting director Bill Butt launched plans for a one-off promotional concert event as the final date of the Camo tour, which would be professionally filmed and recorded. It was primarily intended to provide material for the group&#x27;s first music video, but Drummond and Butt&#x27;s vision went well beyond the conventional three-minute pop-rock promotional clip, and it reflected their desire to capture Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s live performance during this crucial breakthrough phase of their career. Butt was slated to direct, but British film union regulations at the time meant that the film would not be distributed commercially unless it was directed by a union member. Butt took over as producer, and on the recommendation of their mutual friend, Patrick Duval, Butt engaged novice filmmaker John Smith, who had earned a union ticket for a film he had directed while at university.

After extensive consultation with their clients, Smith and Duval were &quot;embedded&quot; in Buxton with the band in the week leading up to the concert, and they were given a completely free hand to structure, shoot and edit the project. Smith and Duval shaped the first part of the film around the differing characters of the four band members, filming both the town and the musicians, but using unusual shooting angles and perspectives. This material was then assembled into an impressionistic sequence of seemingly disconnected images, which are gradually revealed to be a montage of the activities of the band members as they prepare for and head to the show.

The concert was staged on January 17, 1981, in the striking Victorian-era glass concert hall in the Buxton Pavilion Gardens in Derbyshire before a specially invited audience. Before the show, advertisements had been placed in the music press, and 500 lucky fans who responded were given free passes and a map directing them to the secret location (called &quot;Gomorrah&quot; in the advertisement), which also advised &quot;BE PREPARED: THIS IS AN ATLAS ADVENTURE&quot;. For an additional fee of £5, coach transport was provided for fans from London, Liverpool and other cities. 

Although inclement winter weather complicated the rehearsals, causing transport headaches for the band, as well as for their fans, the concert went ahead as planned, with the band taking the stage 30 minutes after the scheduled start time. The performance was filmed by Smith, Duval and cameraman Mike Tomlinson, with multitrack audio recorded on the Manor Mobile studio by Peter Woods. The footage captures the band at the height of their early success, and documents both their musical prowess as a live act and the impressive staging and lighting designed by Bill Butt. The set list was drawn mainly from &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, plus previews of several tracks from the upcoming second album.

The finished 33-minute short film combined Smith and Duval&#x27;s opening montage with dynamic footage of four songs from the show. Titled &quot;Shine So Hard: An Atlas Adventure&quot;, it was given a limited UK cinema release, but Warner executives were reportedly dismayed by its avant-garde structure and the fact that the band don&#x27;t even appear clearly until partway through the film. The audio recordings of the four songs featured in the film were also released on the &quot;Shine So Hard&quot; EP, which reached #37 on the UK singles chart, thus becoming the group&#x27;s first British hit single. In 1982, the film was released as a limited edition of 500 VHS cassettes, redeemable only with a voucher given out to those who had attended the concert, and copies found their way onto the second-hand market.

===&quot;Heaven Up Here&quot;===
Beginning in April 1981, the band commenced another round of touring to promote the forthcoming album. This included their first American dates in New York, Toronto, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. After another round of shows in the UK and Europe mid-year, they returned to America for more shows during October, and in November they made their only visit to Australia, including a show on November 11 at the Manly Vale Hotel on Sydney&#x27;s northern beaches. This was recorded, and four tracks from that concert were subsequently included as bonus tracks on the 2003 CD reissue of the second album.

&quot;Heaven Up Here&quot; was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales during March, and was released in May 1981. Produced by the band and Hugh Jones, it proved a very positive and enjoyable recording experience for the band, and became an even bigger critical and commercial success, reaching the UK Top Ten (No. 10), although &quot;A Promise&quot;, the sole single lifted from the album, only reached UK No. 49. The cover image continued the elemental theme of &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, and depicted the group standing on a beach, with their backs to the camera, looking out to sea, silhouetted against a bank of storm clouds at sunset, with a flock of seagulls flying across sky in front of them. The photograph was taken on the beach at Porthcawl in South Wales on a day off from recording. According to photographer Brian Griffin, they had to use buckets of fish offal to entice the seagulls to fly through the shot. Manager Bill Drummond and Korova label head, Rob Dickins, reportedly hated the image and Atkins, Griffin and the band had to fight to have it accepted as the cover shot.

===&quot;Porcupine&quot; and mainstream success===
After another break over the winter, the band played three UK dates in April 1982. In June, they achieved their first top 20 UK hit single with &quot;The Back of Love&quot; (No. 19). In July, they began a short round of festival appearances and headlining concerts in Britain and Europe, including an appearance at the first WOMAD festival, where they were joined onstage for the song &quot;All My Colours (Zimbo)&quot; by the Drummers of Burundi. Their only American date that year was a one-off show at New York&#x27;s Peppermint Lounge on August 24, and their 1982 touring schedule concluded with four UK dates in December.

Much of 1982 was taken with the difficult and protracted process of recording of their highly anticipated third album &quot;Porcupine&quot;, which reunited them with &quot;Crocodiles&quot; producer Ian Broudie (who was also Sergeant&#x27;s housemate at the time). Several members also undertook outside projects during the year. Pete de Freitas produced and played drums on Liverpool band the Wild Swans&#x27; debut single &quot;Revolutionary Spirit&quot;, and lead guitarist Will Sergeant recorded a solo album of instrumental music titled &quot;Themes for &#x27;Grind&#x27; &quot;(1982).

The original version of &quot;Porcupine&quot; was rejected by Warner Bros as &quot;too uncommercial&quot;, so (over Sergeant&#x27;s objections) the band agreed to re-record the entire LP, and Drummond brought in noted Indian violinist and composer Shankar to add strings. During this period, tensions within the band had increased dramatically. Bassist Les Pattinson was openly expressing his weariness with the industry, and personal relations among the four deteriorated to the point that they either refused to speak to each other or argued when they did. McCulloch later described the band&#x27;s mood at this time as &quot;horrible&quot;, and de Freitas stated that, in stark contrast to the quick and confident making of &quot;Heaven Up Here&quot;, he felt that &quot;we had to drag it out of ourselves&quot; with &quot;Porcupine&quot;. Despite these impediments, the re-recording went relatively smoothly, and the sessions ultimately produced their UK chart breakthrough.

Released in early 1983, the more radio-friendly &quot;The Cutter&quot;, became their first top 10 single, climbing to No. 8, while the parent album &quot;Porcupine&quot; (Feb. 1983), hit No. 2 in the album chart. Now firmly established as a chart act, further hits followed with a one-off single, the dance-oriented &quot;Never Stop&quot; (No. 15), and the epic &quot;The Killing Moon&quot;, a preview from the new album featuring a dramatic McCulloch vocal, which became the band&#x27;s second UK top 10 single at No. 9.

===&quot;Ocean Rain&quot;===
The band kicked off a hectic year of touring in 1984 with their first dates in Japan, in January, followed by a month-long round of dates in the United States beginning in March. April-May saw them playing concerts in Europe and the UK, followed by the second and more extensive leg of their U.S. tour during August-September, concluding with a show at the famed Greek Theater in Los Angeles on September 9. The band then immediately undertook an intensive two-month UK tour, beginning in Dublin on September 15 and concluding at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy on October 24 (their last concert of 1984).

Following a PR campaign that proclaimed it &quot;the greatest album ever made&quot; according to McCulloch, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Rain&quot; reached No. 4, and today is widely regarded as the band&#x27;s landmark album. Single extracts &quot;Silver&quot; (UK No. 30) and &quot;Seven Seas&quot; (UK No. 16) consolidated the album&#x27;s continued commercial success. In the same year, McCulloch had a minor solo hit with his cover version of the Kurt Weill standard &quot;September Song&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Ocean Rain&quot;, manager Bill Drummond announced that the band was taking a year off to write material for the next album, but at the end of 1984 they replaced him, reportedly because they were unhappy that the band wasn&#x27;t making enough money. Drummond was succeeded by Duran Duran tour manager Mick Hancock.

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen resumed work with a tour of Scandinavia in April 1985, performing cover versions of songs from Television, the Rolling Stones, Talking Heads and the Doors. Recordings from the tour emerged as the semi-bootleg &quot;On Strike&quot;. On 21 June, they performed a headlining set at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival, where they premiered two new songs from their next album.

===Fifth album and departure of de Freitas===
&quot;Ocean Rain&quot; proved difficult to follow up, and their only releases in 1985 were the single, &quot;Bring on the Dancing Horses&quot; (UK No. 21), and a compilation album, &quot;Songs to Learn &amp; Sing&quot;, which made No. 6 in the UK album chart. 

1985/86 proved to be the turning point in the group&#x27;s career. During their regular winter break, drummer Pete de Freitas had moved to America with a loose group of musical colleagues, friends and hangers-on dubbed The Sex Gods, but the other Bunnymen and his family later revealed that de Freitas was suffering from escalating mental health and drug problems, and following a New Year&#x27;s Eve drug binge in New Orleans, de Freitas announced that he had quit the band. 

With tour commitments looming, the remaining members hastily recruited former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham as their new drummer, but he did not fit in, and left after their Spring 1986 American tour. Cunningham was replaced by former ABC drummer David Palmer. The group began recording material for the new album with Broudie and producer Clive Langer but they were unhappy with the results and the recordings were shelved.

They then recorded with Laurie Latham, who was chosen by McCulloch because he had been impressed by Latham&#x27;s work on the Stranglers&#x27; single &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. Three tracks from these sessions made their way onto the next album, including the song &quot;Jimmy Brown&quot;, which was re-titled &quot;Bring on the Dancing Horses&quot; and released as their only single of 1986.

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen returned to the studio to record more material with a new producer, Gil Norton, but in July, David Palmer left the group and de Freitas expressed his wish to rejoin. The other members were concerned about both his commitment to the band and his drug and mental health problems, so he returned to group as a hired musician rather than a full member of the band. The revised lineup performed live on BBC TV in September, presenting two new songs, &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Lips Like Sugar&quot;, but by this stage, they were under intense pressure from their label to create what Warners considered to be more commercial material. Will Sergeant later recalled the band&#x27;s outrage when Warner executive Rob Dickens played them Peter Gabriel&#x27;s album &quot;So&quot;, declaring &quot;I want you to sound like this!&quot;

Their fifth studio album, the self-titled &quot;Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&quot; (1987), was recorded with Palmer, but when de Freitas returned in late 1986, it was largely re-recorded. Released in mid-1987, the record sold well (UK No. 4), and was a small American hit, their only LP to have significant sales there. It is also significant as the final album to be recorded with the original lineup. 

Like &quot;Porcupine&quot;, the making of the album proved to be a difficult and protracted process. Early sessions with Gil Norton took place at the famous Cologne studio of German producer Conny Plank, but both band and label were unhappy with the results and these recordings were shelved. They began re-recording material from the Cologne sessions with Laurie Latham in Brussels, but the sessions were grueling, with Latham spending up to a month on a single song, and tensions within the band were being inflamed by McCulloch&#x27;s increasing alcohol use, and the star treatment he was being accorded. 

In the United States, the band&#x27;s best-known songs were &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; and &quot;Lips Like Sugar&quot;. &quot;Bring on the Dancing Horses&quot; is well known as one of the songs on the soundtrack to the John Hughes film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. The band also contributed a cover version of the Doors song &quot;People Are Strange&quot; to &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; soundtrack, which featured a guest appearance by original Doors keyboard player Ray Manzarek, who also contributed keyboards to a re-recorded version of &quot;Bedbugs and Ballyhoo&quot;. &quot;Never Stop&quot; was used in the Alan Bennett film &quot;History Boys&quot;.

Although the album was a significant commercial success, it received mixed reviews from critics, and was disliked by the band, who were sharply critical of the mixing and production.

===Departure of McCulloch, death of de Freitas, sixth album, and disbandment===
The group jointly headlined an American tour with New Order in August-September 1987, followed by a UK tour in the northern autumn. After a winter break they undertook another round of touring in the U.S. and the UK, to general acclaim, but the March 1988 single release of their cover of the Doors&#x27; &quot;People Are Strange&quot; drew withering reviews from the music press, with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; denouncing it as &quot;a rancid effort&quot;. 

The end of the original Echo &amp; The Bunnymen came in March 1988. Following a Japanese tour, McCulloch announced that the band was breaking up. He hastily departed for the UK to see his father, who had just suffered two heart attacks, but he died before McCulloch arrived.

Months of speculation finally ended in September 1988 when McCulloch officially informed the other members that he was leaving the band, but Sergeant told McCulloch that he, Pattinson and de Freitas would continue working together. McCulloch departed, and later began work on his first solo album &quot;Candleland&quot;.

Following an abortive attempt to record with singers Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson of the B-52s, the group advertised for a new lead singer. Former Bourgie Bourgie singer Paul Quinn and former Colenso Parade singer Oscar Askin, both auditioned but ultimately turned down offers to take over from McCulloch. Keyboardist Jake Brockman (a touring member of the band for several years previously, and a contributor to the 1987 album) was promoted to full member, and after hearing an album by the defunct UK group St Vitus Dance, the Bunnymen offered the lead singer spot to vocalist Noel Burke, who accepted after the band assured him that they did not want &quot;a McCulloch clone&quot;. 

Their plans were thrown into disarray when Pete de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident on 14 June 1989. De Freitas was on his way to Liverpool from London to take part in the group&#x27;s first rehearsal with Burke, when his Ducati motorbike collided with another vehicle on the A51 At Longdon Green in Staffordshire, killing him instantly. He was 27 years old and was survived by his widow and their infant daughter, who was born in 1988.

After recruiting new drummer Damon Reece to replace de Freitas, the new five-piece Bunnymen recorded the psychedelic-tinged &quot;Reverberation&quot; in 1990 with renowned former Beatles engineer and producer Geoff Emerick. The album did not generate much interest among fans or critics, it sold poorly, and the band was dropped by Warner Bros.

In a 2003 interview, McCulloch said of his replacement with Burke:

I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious what I think. Noel Burke... the name says it all really doesn&#x27;t it? No, that&#x27;s not fair. It wasn&#x27;t his fault, it was Will and Pete who were the berks really. But no, I thought it was disgraceful and after that I suppose it was quite surprising that I continued working with Will after that. I&#x27;m glad I did though. Johnny Marr called them Echo and the Bogusmen when that happened.

Meanwhile, McCulloch released his well-received debut solo album &quot;Candleland&quot; in September 1989, shortly after de Freitas&#x27; death. His follow-up solo album was &quot;Mysterio&quot; in 1992.

After two more unsuccessful singles, which were released independently, the Bunnymen disbanded in 1993.

===Reformation===

In 1994, McCulloch and Sergeant began working together again under the name &quot;Electrafixion&quot;; in 1997, Pattinson rejoined the duo, meaning the three surviving members of the original Bunnymen line-up were now working together again. Rather than continue as Electrafixion, the trio resurrected the Echo &amp; the Bunnymen name and released the album &quot;Evergreen&quot; (1997), which reached the UK Top 10.

Immediately before the release of the band&#x27;s next album &quot;What Are You Going to Do with Your Life?&quot; (1999), Les Pattinson quit to take care of his mother. McCulloch and Sergeant have continued to tour and record as Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, touring repeatedly and releasing the albums &quot;Flowers&quot; (2001), &quot;Siberia&quot; (2005), &quot;The Fountain&quot; (2009) and &quot;Meteorites&quot; (2014). The &quot;Siberia&quot; band line up was Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Paul Fleming (keyboards), Simon Finley (drums) and Pete Wilkinson (bass), Hugh Jones produced &quot;Siberia&quot; after previously engineering early Bunnymen albums. Since August 2009 the group&#x27;s touring incarnation has comprised McCulloch and Sergeant along with Stephen Brannan (bass), Gordy Goudie (guitar), Nicholas Kilroe (drums) and Jez Wing (keyboards).

In 2002, the group received the Q Inspiration award. The award is for inspiring &quot;new generations of musicians, songs and music lovers in general.&quot; The band were said to be worthy winners as they have done much to promote the Mersey music scene. In a later interview for &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine, McCulloch said &quot;It validates everything that we&#x27;ve tried to achieve—cool, great timeless music. It&#x27;s not like an inspiration award affecting the past, it&#x27;s affecting the current music.&quot;

On 11 September 2006, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen released an updated version of their 1985 &quot;Songs to Learn and Sing&quot; compilation. Now re-titled &quot;More Songs to Learn and Sing&quot;, this compilation was issued in two versions, a 17-track single CD and a 20-track version with a DVD featuring eight videos from their career.

In March 2007, the Bunnymen announced that they had re-signed to Warner and were working on a new album. The band were said to be planning a live DVD, titled &quot;Dancing Horses&quot;, which contained interviews with the band. This was released in May 2007 on Snapper/SPV. The live line up was Ian McCulloch, Will Sergeant, Simon Finley (drums), Paul Fleming (keyboards), Gordy Goudie (guitar) and Steve Brannan (bass).

On 11 January 2008, McCulloch was interviewed on &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; at the start of Liverpool 08. He was asked about new Bunnymen material and he revealed that a new album would coincide with their gig at the Royal Albert Hall in September. He went on to say that the album was &quot;the best one we&#x27;ve made, apart from &quot;Ocean Rain&quot;&quot;.

In a 20 April 2008 interview with the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, McCulloch announced &quot;The Fountain&quot; as the title of the new Echo &amp; the Bunnymen album with producers John McLaughlin and Simon Perry, which was originally due to be released in 2008 but was finally released on 12 October 2009. &quot;Think I Need It Too&quot;, the first single from the album, was released on 28 September 2009.

On 1 September 2009, former keyboard player Jake Brockman died on the Isle of Man when his motorbike collided with a converted ambulance. Brockman had played keyboards for the band during the 1980s.

In December 2010, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen went on tour playing their first two albums &quot;Crocodiles&quot; and &quot;Heaven Up Here&quot; in their entirety.

Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s most recent album of new material, &quot;Meteorites&quot;, was released on 26 May 2014 in the UK, and on 3 June 2014 in the US via 429 Records. The album was released on the pledgemusic.com website. It was produced and mixed by Youth, who also co-wrote three of the tracks and played some bass. It was the band&#x27;s first UK Top 40 album entry since 1999.

In 2018, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen announced and released an album of reworked orchestral versions of older material and two new songs, titled &quot;The Stars, the Oceans &amp; the Moon&quot;, to mixed reception.

In September 2023, a four-date tour saw the group perform &quot;Ocean Rain&quot; in full in the UK.

<text>The Faint is an American indie rock band. Formed in Omaha, Nebraska, the band consists of Todd Fink, Graham Ulicny, Dapose and Clark Baechle. The Faint was originally known as Norman Bailer and included Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes, with whom The Faint toured in 2005). He quit shortly after the band was formed, though the Faint continued to share a spot with Bright Eyes on Saddle Creek Records.

==History==
The band originally consisted of Clark Baechle, Todd Fink (formerly Todd Baechle), and Joel Petersen. Growing up, Fink, Petersen, and Baechle skateboarded in their free time, until Fink developed knee problems, which shifted their hobbies towards making music. They signed to Saddle Creek Records and released a few singles, but were unable to establish widespread sales. After adding Matt Bowen, the Faint released &quot;Media&quot;. At the end of 1998, Jacob Thiele joined the band, and shortly thereafter, Matt Bowen was replaced by Ethan Jones. They toured the U.S., playing what would become the songs that would comprise the next album, &quot;Blank-Wave Arcade&quot;, which had a more dance and techno-influenced sound and was an underground hit. Before recording the album, however, Jones left the band and was replaced on bass guitar by Joel Petersen, who played both bass and guitar on the album. Partway through the creation of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, the Faint added Dapose, a death metal guitarist formerly of LEAD. Their next album, recorded with Mike Mogis and released in 2004, was called &quot;Wet from Birth&quot;. Conor Oberst claimed in an August 2020 interview with Pitchfork Magazine that The Faint were offered a major label record deal, but turned it down out of loyalty and commitment to Saddle Creek, which at the time was still a collaborative project between members of The Faint, Cursive and Bright Eyes.

In May 2008, the Faint announced that they had split from Saddle Creek, and that their fifth studio album would be self-released under their own label, blank.wav. The album, entitled &quot;Fasciinatiion&quot;, was released on August 5, 2008, in the U.S. The first single from the album was &quot;The Geeks Were Right&quot;, which was released on Boys Noize Records. It was also announced that the band would tour North America with British electronic group Ladytron during the spring.

Since the release of &quot;Fasciinatiion&quot;, two of the band members, Clark Baechle and Todd Fink have been quietly, with little advertising, performing under the name Depressed Buttons, playing remixes of other artists, and DJing for various small clubs and venues.

The band performed an original song &quot;Teach Me Teacher&quot; on the children&#x27;s show Yo Gabba Gabba! in the third-season episode &quot;School&quot;, which originally aired September 19, 2010.

On October 30, 2012, Saddle Creek Records released a deluxe edition of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; with the original album remastered, bonus and unreleased tracks, and a DVD of archival footage, live projections from that era&#x27;s tour dates, and live footage. The band announced that it would play &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; in its entirety along with fan favorites during a tour of 24 cities across North America.

In 2016, Graham Ulicny (of Reptar) replaced Jacob Thiele on keyboards. Thiele died on February 13, 2020.

==Other projects== 

===Vverevvolf Grehv===
&quot;Vverevvolf Grehv&quot; (pronounced as Werewolf Grave) is the brainchild of Dapose. The music of Vverevvolf Grehv combines the brutality of death metal, the tempos of speed metal and the sonic decimation of noise with the complexities of electronic music genres such as snare rush and IDM. He is influenced by Merzbow’s work, the writings of Howard Bloom, and numerous classical composers.

===Broken Spindles===
&quot;Broken Spindles&quot; was a band solely consisting of Joel Petersen of Omaha, Nebraska, who also played bass, guitar and keyboards in The Faint. The music of Broken Spindles ranged from instrumental electronic songs to sparse piano pieces to rock-influenced pop songs. Broken Spindles originally started in 2001 as the soundtrack for a friend&#x27;s film.

<text>Vitalism is a belief that starts from the premise that &quot;living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things.&quot; Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the &quot;vital spark&quot;, &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;élan vital&quot; (coined by vitalist Henri Bergson), &quot;vital force&quot;, or &quot;vis vitalis&quot;, which some equate with the soul. In the 18th and 19th centuries, vitalism was discussed among biologists, between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Vitalist biologists such as Johannes Reinke proposed testable hypotheses meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but their experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by empirical evidence, and hence regard it either as a superseded scientific theory, or as a pseudoscience since the mid-20th century.

Vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies: many traditional healing practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient Egypt. In Greek philosophy, the Milesian school proposed natural explanations deduced from materialism and mechanism. However, by the time of Lucretius, this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable &quot;clinamen&quot; of Epicurus), and in Stoic physics, the &quot;pneuma&quot; assumed the role of &quot;logos&quot;. Galen believed the lungs draw &quot;pneuma&quot; from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of &quot;pneuma&quot;, helping to shape later aether theories.

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist Francis Glisson (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of epigenesis in embryology, that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot; (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a &quot;vis essentialis&quot; (an organizing, formative force). Carl Reichenbach (1788–1869) later developed the theory of Odic force, a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to Newton&#x27;s action at a distance and the mechanism of Cartesian dualism with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called &quot;organic&quot; matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).

As worded by Charles Birch and John B. Cobb, &quot;the claims of the vitalists came to the fore again&quot; in the 18th century: &quot;Georg Ernst Stahl&#x27;s followers were active as were others, such as the physician genius Francis Xavier Bichat of the Hotel Dieu.&quot; However, &quot;Bichat moved from the tendency typical of the French vitalistic tradition to progressively free himself from metaphysics in order to combine with hypotheses and theories which accorded to the scientific criteria of physics and chemistry.&quot; John Hunter recognised &quot;a &#x27;living principle&#x27; in addition to mechanics.&quot;

Johann Friedrich Blumenbach was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of &quot;Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte&quot;. Blumenbach cut up freshwater &quot;Hydra&quot; and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a &quot;formative drive&quot; (&quot;Bildungstrieb&quot;) in living matter. But he pointed out that this name,
===19th century===

Jöns Jakob Berzelius, one of the early 19th century founders of modern chemistry, argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions. Berzelius contended that compounds could be distinguished by whether they required any organisms in their synthesis (organic compounds) or whether they did not (inorganic compounds). Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but Friedrich Wöhler synthesised urea from inorganic components in 1828. However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This &quot;Wöhler Myth&quot;, as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, &quot;ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until &#x27;one afternoon the miracle happened.

Between 1833 and 1844, Johannes Peter Müller wrote a book on physiology called &quot;Handbuch der Physiologie&quot;, which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller&#x27;s commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a soul makes each organism an indivisible whole. He claimed that the behaviour of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.

Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of spontaneous generation, performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur &quot;fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena.&quot; Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, Liebig, Traube and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a &quot;vital action&quot;.

===20th century===

Hans Driesch (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws. His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch&#x27;s reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience. Vitalism is a superseded scientific hypothesis, and the term is sometimes used as a pejorative epithet. Ernst Mayr (1904–2005) wrote:

Other vitalists included Johannes Reinke and Oscar Hertwig. Reinke used the word &quot;neovitalism&quot; to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced Carl Jung.

John Scott Haldane adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an idealist philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that teleology was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book &quot;Mechanism, life and personality&quot; in 1913. Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: &quot;we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity&quot;, &quot;every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience&quot;. The work of Haldane was an influence on organicism. Haldane stated that a purely mechanist interpretation could not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

By 1931, biologists had &quot;almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief.&quot;

==Emergentism ==
Contemporary science and engineering sometimes describe emergent processes, in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents. This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy. According to Emmeche &quot;et al.&quot; (1997):

== Mesmerism ==

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, in the theories of Franz Mesmer (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term &quot;animal magnetism&quot; to translate Mesmer&#x27;s magnétisme animal can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of &quot;magnetic&quot; force from those referred to, at that time, as &quot;mineral magnetism&quot;, &quot;cosmic magnetism&quot; and &quot;planetary magnetism&quot;.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word &quot;&quot;animal&quot;,&quot; for its root meaning (from Latin &quot;animus&quot;=&quot;breath&quot;) specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.

Mesmer&#x27;s ideas became so influential that King Louis XVI of France appointed two commissions to investigate mesmerism; one was led by Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the other, led by Benjamin Franklin, included Bailly and Lavoisier. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and trances. In Franklin&#x27;s garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been &quot;mesmerized&quot;; he hugged each in turn to receive the &quot;vital fluid,&quot; but fainted at the foot of a &#x27;wrong&#x27; one. At Lavoisier&#x27;s house, four normal cups of water were held before a &quot;sensitive&quot; woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that &quot;the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid.&quot;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in medical philosophies: many traditional healing practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the Yoruba concept of ase. In the European tradition founded by Hippocrates, these vital forces were associated with the four temperaments and humours. Multiple Asian traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of qi or prana. Amongst unterritorialized traditions such as religions and arts, forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as memorial tenets.

Complementary and alternative medicine therapies include energy therapies, associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as therapeutic touch, Reiki, external qi, chakra healing and SHEN therapy. In these therapies, the &quot;subtle energy&quot; field of a patient is manipulated by a practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a &quot;complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...&quot;

The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: &quot;...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body.&quot; The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.

== Criticism ==
Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. Molière had famously parodied this fallacy in &quot;Le Malade imaginaire&quot;, where a quack &quot;answers&quot; the question of &quot;Why does opium cause sleep?&quot; with &quot;Because of its dormitive virtue (i.e., soporific power).&quot; Thomas Henry Huxley compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its &quot;aquosity&quot;. His grandson Julian Huxley in 1926 compared &quot;vital force&quot; or &quot;élan vital&quot; to explaining a railroad locomotive&#x27;s operation by its &quot;élan locomotif&quot; (&quot;locomotive force&quot;).

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for organic chemistry and developmental biology, but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, Jacques Loeb published &quot;The Mechanistic Conception of Life&quot;, in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as Bertrand Russell put it (&quot;Religion and Science&quot;). He offered this challenge:

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

Bechtel states that vitalism &quot;is often viewed as unfalsifiable, and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine.&quot; For many scientists, &quot;vitalist&quot; theories were unsatisfactory &quot;holding positions&quot; on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, stated &quot;And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only cranks will believe tomorrow.&quot;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the pseudoscientific retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. Alan Sokal published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of &quot;scientific theories&quot; of spiritual healing. Use of a technique called therapeutic touch was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, &quot;nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism&quot; and added that &quot;Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time.&quot;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr. discusses vitalism&#x27;s past and present roles in chiropractic and calls vitalism &quot;a form of bio-theology.&quot; He further explains that:

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

Keating also mentions Skinner&#x27;s viewpoint:

According to Williams, &quot;[t]oday, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body&#x27;s vital force.&quot; &quot;Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality.&quot;

Victor Stenger states that the term &quot;bioenergetics&quot; &quot;is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable exchanges of energy within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the bioenergetic field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry.&quot;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics. Joanne Stefanatos states that &quot;The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics.&quot; Stenger offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called &quot;human energy fields&quot;. Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.

Vitalistic thinking has been identified in the naive biological theories of children: &quot;Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought.&quot;

<text>Lulu Kennedy-Cairns (born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie; 3 November 1948) is a Scottish singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. Her career has spanned six decades. Her debut single, a cover version of The Isley Brothers song &quot;Shout&quot;, reached the top ten of the UK singles chart in 1964. In 1967, she rose to international prominence after appearing in the film &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, singing the theme song, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks.

During the 1960s, she achieved another five top-ten hits in the United Kingdom, including &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot;, which won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1969. With a powerful voice, in 1974, she sang the title song for the James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. In the mid-1990s, Lulu had her first number-one single in the UK: &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, with English boy band Take That.

In 2002, she achieved her most recent top-ten entry in the UK chart when her collaboration with Irish singer Ronan Keating, &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonite&quot;, peaked at number four. She has released 15 studio albums, with &quot;Together&quot; (2002) being her highest-charting, peaking at number four on the UK albums chart. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000 Birthday Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to music, entertainment and charity.

==Life and career==
Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie was born in Lennoxtown, Stirlingshire and grew up in Dennistoun, Glasgow, where she attended Thomson Street Primary School and Onslow Drive School. She lived in Gallowgate for a while before moving to Garfield Street, Dennistoun. When she was 12 or 13, she and her manager approached a band called the Bellrocks seeking stage experience as a singer. She appeared with them every Saturday night. Alex Thomson, the group&#x27;s bass player, said that even then her voice was remarkable. She has two brothers and a sister, and her father, who died at 71, was reportedly a heavy drinker. Aged 14, she received the stage name &quot;Lulu&quot; from her future manager Marion Massey, who commented: &quot;Well, all I know is that she&#x27;s a real lulu of a kid.&quot;

In August 2017, Lulu&#x27;s family history was the subject of an episode in the UK series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; The research showed that her mother had been brought up by another family. The investigation into her genealogy showed that Lulu&#x27;s maternal grandparents had different religions. Her grandfather Hugh Cairns was a Catholic and her grandmother, Helen Kennedy, was a Protestant. Cairns had been a member of a Catholic gang and was found in the research to have been in and out of prison at the time of the birth of Lulu&#x27;s mother. Kennedy was found to be the daughter of a Worthy Mistress of the Ladies&#x27; Orange Lodge 52. The discovery explained why the two families had opposed the union between Kennedy and Cairns.

===Early chart hits===
In 1964, under the wing of Marion Massey, she was signed to Decca Records. While only fifteen, her version of the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Shout&quot;, credited to &quot;Lulu &amp; the Luvvers&quot;, and delivered in a raucous but mature voice, peaked at No. 7 on the UK chart. Massey guided her career for more than 25 years, for most of which time they were partners in business, and Massey&#x27;s husband Mark produced some of Lulu&#x27;s recordings.

After the success of &quot;Shout&quot;, Lulu&#x27;s next charting single was &quot;Leave a Little Love&quot; in 1965, which returned her to the UK Top Ten. Her next record, &quot;Try to Understand&quot;, made the Top 40.

In 1966, Lulu toured Poland with the Hollies, being the first British female singer to appear live behind the Iron Curtain. In the same year, she recorded two German-language tracks, &quot;Wenn du da bist&quot; and &quot;So fing es an&quot;, for the Decca Germany label. All her Decca recordings were made available in 2009 on a 2-CD set entitled &quot;Shout!&quot;, issued on RPM Records. After two hit singles with the Luvvers, Lulu embarked on a solo career.

After failing to reach the chart in 1966, Lulu left Decca and signed with Columbia, to be produced by Mickie Most. She returned to the UK singles chart in April 1967, reaching No. 6 with &quot;The Boat That I Row&quot;, written by Neil Diamond. All seven singles she cut with Mickie Most made the UK Singles Chart, ending with &quot;Boom Bang-A-Bang&quot; reaching number 2 in 1969. When Most died in 2003, Lulu was full of praise for him and told the BBC that they had been very close.

Lulu made her acting debut in 1967 &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, a British vehicle for Sidney Poitier. Lulu both acted in the film and sang the title song, with which she had a major hit in the United States, reaching No. 1. &quot;To Sir with Love&quot; became the best-selling single of 1967 in the United States. It sold well in excess of one million copies and was awarded a gold disc, being ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as the number 1 song of the year. In the UK, &quot;To Sir With Love&quot; was released on the B-side of &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;, a number 11 hit.

===Television series===

In the late 1960s, Lulu&#x27;s pop career in the UK thrived and she had several television series of her own. Her first BBC series aired in 1965 on BBC2, where she co-hosted &quot;Gadzooks! It&#x27;s The In-Crowd&quot;, with Alan David, completing the run as solo host under the rebranded &quot;Gadzooks!&quot; In 1966, she made regular appearances on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Stramash!&quot; After appearing again on BBC2 in 1967, in a successful TV series &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, that featured music and comedy, Lulu was given her own BBC1 TV series in 1968, which ran annually until 1975 under various titles, including &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Back in Town&quot;, &quot;Happening For Lulu&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Lulu&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;. The series often featured resident guests, including Adrienne Posta, Roger Kitter, Paul Greenwood and Pan&#x27;s People, along with dance troupes choreographed by Nigel Lythgoe and Dougie Squires. The 1972 series was billed as &quot;It&#x27;s Lulu... Not to mention Dudley Moore&quot;, with Dudley Moore and his trio appearing in each of the thirteen shows. Bernie Clifton was her resident guest for the last of the BBC series, airing from January to April 1975. Her BBC series included music and comedy sketches and appearances by star guests.

One episode, from January 1969, is remembered for an unruly live appearance from the Jimi Hendrix Experience. During that appearance, after playing about two minutes of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, Hendrix stopped and announced, &quot;We&#x27;d like to stop playing this rubbish and dedicate a song to Cream, regardless of what kind of group they may be in, dedicate to Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Jack Bruce.&quot; Hendrix and his band then broke into &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. The studio director signalled for Hendrix to stop, but he continued. Hendrix was told he would never work at the BBC again, but was unrepentant. He told his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to sing with Lulu. I&#x27;d look ridiculous.&quot;

Concurrently with her TV series, Lulu also hosted several &quot;one-off&quot; specials. They included &quot;Lulu At Bern&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; in 1969, a show recorded in Sweden with the Young Generation, 1970&#x27;s &quot;The Young Generation Meet Lulu&quot; (also recorded in Sweden), and &quot;Bruce Forsyth Meets Lulu&quot; in 1975.

===Eurovision Song Contest===
On 29 March 1969, Lulu represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest, performing the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot;, written by Peter Warne and Alan Moorhouse. The song was chosen from a selection of six by viewers of her BBC1 variety series &quot;Happening for Lulu&quot;, and on a special show hosted by Michael Aspel in which she performed all six one after another. One song, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go On...&quot;, written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, came last in the postcard vote but was later recorded by Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw, Polly Brown and Elton John himself, as well as by Lulu. In Madrid, Lulu was accompanied by Sue and Sunny while the orchestra was conducted by Lulu&#x27;s musical director Johnny Harris. Lulu later recalled:

&quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; won, though three other songs, from Spain, (&quot;&quot; by Salomé), the Netherlands, (&quot;De troubadour&quot; by Lenny Kuhr) and France, (&quot;Un jour, un enfant&quot; by Frida Boccara) tied with her on 18 votes each. The rules were subsequently altered to prevent such ties in future years, but the result caused Austria, Portugal, Norway, Sweden and Finland not to enter the 1970 contest. Lulu&#x27;s song came out the best in sales, with German, French, Spanish and Italian versions alongside the original English. Later she told John Peel; &quot;I know it&#x27;s a rotten song, but I won, so who cares? I&#x27;d have sung &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot; standing on my head if that&#x27;s what it took to win... I am just so glad I didn&#x27;t finish second like all the other Brits before me, that would have been awful.&quot; Despite her dislike it is her second biggest UK hit to date, reaching number 2 on the chart in 1969.

In 1975, Lulu herself hosted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the qualifying heat for the Eurovision Song Contest, in which the Shadows performed six shortlisted songs. In 1981, she joined other Eurovision winners at a charity gala held in Norway, and she was a panellist at the 1989 UK heat, offering views on two of the competing eight entries. In 2009, she provided comment and support to the six acts shortlisted to represent the UK at Eurovision 2009 on BBC1 TV.

Just weeks before her 1969 Eurovision appearance, Lulu had married Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees in a ceremony in Gerrards Cross. Maurice&#x27;s older brother Barry was opposed to their marriage as he believed them to be too young. Their honeymoon in Mexico had to be postponed because of Lulu&#x27;s Eurovision commitment. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced in 1973, but remained on good terms.

===Post-Eurovision===
From 30 June to 2 July 1967, Lulu appeared with the Monkees at the Empire Pool, Wembley, and her brief romance with Davy Jones of the Monkees during a concert tour of the United States in March 1968 received much publicity in the UK press.

In 1969, Lulu recorded &quot;New Routes&quot;, a new album, at Muscle Shoals studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama: several of the songs, including a version of Jerry Jeff Walker&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;, featured slide guitarist Duane Allman. The album was recorded for Atlantic&#x27;s Atco label and produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin.

===1970s: &quot;James Bond&quot; theme===
Lulu began 1970 by appearing on the BBC&#x27;s review of the 1960s music scene &quot;Pop Go the Sixties&quot;, performing &quot;Boom Bang-A-Bang&quot; live on BBC1 on 31 December 1969. She recorded another Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin album in the US, &quot;Melody Fair&quot;, and scored a US Top 30 hit, &quot;Oh Me Oh My (I&#x27;m a Fool for You Baby)&quot;, (later covered by Aretha Franklin, Tina Arena, Buster Poindexter, and John Holt) and collaborated with the Dixie Flyers on &quot;Hum a Song (From Your Heart)&quot;.

Four more German-language tracks (&quot;Ich brauche deine Liebe&quot;, &quot;Wach&#x27; ich oder träum&#x27; ich&quot;, &quot;Warum tust du mir weh&quot;, and &quot;Traurig, aber wahr&quot;) were recorded on the Atlantic/WEA label. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 10 May 1972, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

Lulu was one of the main artists invited to appear on the BBC&#x27;s anniversary show &quot;Fifty Years Of Music&quot; in 1972. The same year she starred in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Opera House, Manchester, and repeated her performance at the London Palladium in 1975. She returned to the same role in different London-based productions from 1987 to early 1989. She made an appearance on the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; in 1973, singing &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; and &quot;Happy Heart&quot;. Also in 1972, Lulu made a brief but memorable appearance, alongside Ringo Starr, on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. She and Starr fight with Michael Palin, in his &quot;It&#x27;s Man&quot; character as a talk show host whose programme goes awry.

On 27 May 1974, BBC1 screened &quot;Bruce Forsyth Meets Lulu&quot; a special variety TV show for the UK bank holiday. In 1974, she performed the title song for the James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Two slightly different versions of the song were used, at the start and end respectively; James Bond was mentioned in the end version. Released as a single, it is the only Bond film title track not to chart as a single in either the United Kingdom or the United States.

In the same year, Lulu covered David Bowie&#x27;s songs &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; and &quot;Watch That Man&quot;. Bowie and Mick Ronson produced the recordings. Bowie played saxophone and provided backing vocals. Rumours of a brief affair between him and Lulu were confirmed in her 2002 autobiography. &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; became her first Top 10 hit in five years, peaking at No. 3 in the UK chart in February 1974, and was a Top 10 hit in several other European countries. She recorded other songs with Bowie, including his &quot;Dodo,&quot; that were never officially released. In 1975, she released the disco single &quot;Take Your Mama For A Ride&quot;, which peaked in the UK chart at No. 37, remaining in the Top 75 for four weeks.

On 31 December 1976, Lulu performed &quot;Shout&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot;, celebrating British pop music, as part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s impending Silver jubilee celebrations. In 1977, Lulu became interested in Siddha Yoga and married hairdresser John Frieda. They divorced in 1991. They had one son, Jordan Frieda.

===1980s: Other ventures===
Lulu&#x27;s chart success waned in the 1980s but she remained in the public eye, acting and hosting a long-running radio show on London&#x27;s Capital Radio station. She was associated with Freemans fashion catalogue during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979 she recorded for Elton John&#x27;s label The Rocket Record Company and released &quot;I Love to Boogie&quot;.

Notable London stage appearances came in the early 1980s and included Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Song and Dance&quot; and the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. Lulu damaged her vocal cords while performing in the Lloyd Webber show, requiring surgery that threatened her singing voice. She co-hosted a revived series of &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; for ITV in the early 1980s. In 1981, she returned to the US chart with &quot;I Could Never Miss You (More Than I Do)&quot;, a Top 20 hit that also reached No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart despite stalling at No. 62 in the UK. Early the following year, she had a more modest US hit with &quot;If I Were You&quot;, which just missed the Top 40, appeared in the video for &quot;Ant Rap&quot; alongside Adam and the Ants, and was nominated for a Grammy for &quot;Who&#x27;s Foolin&#x27; Who&quot; from the &quot;Lulu&quot; album.

She won the Rear of the Year award in 1983 and rerecorded a number of her songs. They included &quot;Shout&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in 1986 in the UK, securing her a spot on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Lulu was one of only two performers (Cliff Richard being the other) to have sung on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in each of the five decades that the show ran. A follow-up single to &quot;Shout&quot;, an updated version of Millie&#x27;s 1960s hit &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;, failed to chart and Lulu stopped recording until 1992, focusing instead on TV, acting and live performances. The two tracks were released on the Jive Records label. Lulu has had releases on the Decca, Columbia, Atco, Polydor, Chelsea, Alfa, Jive, Dome, RCA, Mercury and Universal labels. She has also released singles for GTO, Atlantic, Globe, EMI, Concept, Lifestyle, Utopia and Rocket, and Epic in the US.

In 1985 her first autobiography, &quot;Lulu : Her Autobiography&quot;, was published. On television, she replaced Julie Walters as Adrian Mole&#x27;s mother in &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole&quot; in 1987. In 1989 and 1990 she voiced the title character in the animated series &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; on ITV. In 1989, Lulu and her manager of 25 years, Marion Massey, parted company. During their twenty-five year association, Massey and Lulu were equal partners as a business enterprise but, encouraged by her husband John Frieda, Lulu ended their business association in 1989 as she was frustrated that she was no longer seen as a recording artist and Massey was unable to further her recording career.

===1990s: Musical comeback and &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;===
In 1993, Lulu made a recording comeback with the single &quot;Independence&quot;, which reached No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the title track from the &quot;Independence&quot; album, and all four singles released from the album reached the lower ends of the UK chart, as did two later singles, released in 1994. Her second single after &quot;Independence&quot; was &quot;I&#x27;m Back for More&quot;, a duet with soul singer Bobby Womack, which charted at No. 27. The album was not successful, peaking at #67 in the UK Albums Chart. Also in 1993, the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Fight&quot;, co-written by Lulu, her brother Billy Lawrie, and Steve DuBerry, became an international hit for Tina Turner.

Later that year, she guested on the cover version of the Dan Hartman song &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, with boy band Take That. The single reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and Lulu appeared as Take That&#x27;s supporting act on their 1994 tour. At that time, she also appeared as an unhappy public relations client of Edina Monsoon in two episodes of the BBC television programme &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, and teamed with French and Saunders many times, including their send up of the Spice Girls (the Sugar Lumps) for Comic Relief in 1997, when she took the role of &quot;Baby Spice&quot;, mimicking Emma Bunton. An album, provisionally titled &quot;Where the Poor Boys Dance&quot;, was completed in late 1997 and due for release in early 1998, but was postponed by the record label, Mercury. A single, &quot;Hurt Me So Bad&quot;, was released in April 1999, which rose no higher than No. 42 in the UK and, a year later, the title track from the cancelled album reached No. 24, with Lulu appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to promote it.

In 1999, Lulu returned to BBC One to host the Saturday night National Lottery game show &quot;Red Alert&quot;. The theme song, sung by Lulu, was released as a single but only reached No.59 in the UK. She also co-wrote and recorded a duet with UK pop singer Kavana entitled &quot;Heart Like the Sun&quot;, but it was not released commercially until Kavana&#x27;s 2007 &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection, &quot;Special Kind of Something: The Best of...&quot;.

===2000: Return to prominence and &quot;Together&quot;===
Now known as Lulu Kennedy-Cairns (her late mother&#x27;s birth name before she was adopted by the McDonald family), in 2000 she was awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II. Lulu&#x27;s autobiography, published in 2002, was titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Fight&quot; after the hit song she and her brother wrote with songwriter Steve DuBerry for Tina Turner, a song that Lulu herself released in 2003 as part of her album &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;. Her 2002 gold album, &quot;Together&quot;, was a collection of duets with Elton John and Paul McCartney among others, tracks from which were performed in a high-profile TV special for ITV, &quot;An Audience With Lulu&quot;, which saw Lulu reunited with her first husband Maurice Gibb for a live performance of &quot;First of May&quot;. Her rendition of &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot;, with Ronan Keating, reached #4 in the United Kingdom, matching the chart peak of the &quot;Together&quot; album.

In 2000, Lulu sat on the 5,387,862nd and final classic Mini when it came off the production line. In the ceremony at the Birmingham factory, Lulu drove a red Mini Cooper, registration 1959–2000, off the track to music from &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, the 1969 film in which several Mini Coopers featured prominently. In 2004, she released the album &quot;Back on Track&quot; and went on a UK-wide tour to celebrate forty years in the music business. The album charted at No. 68. In late 2004, she returned to radio as the host of a two-hour radio show on BBC Radio 2, playing an eclectic blend of music from the 1950s to the 2000s. In 2005, Lulu released &quot;A Little Soul in Your Heart&quot;, a collection of soul classics that entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 28. In March 2006, she launched her official MySpace profile. She also appeared on the popular British comedy programme &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;.

Lulu continued to act occasionally and starred alongside Tom Courtenay and Stephen Fry in the British film &quot;Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?&quot; She also appeared in the BBC&#x27;s reality TV show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; in 2006 as a judge, alongside Trevor Nelson, CeCe Sammy and Stewart Copeland. She was replaced by Tito Jackson for Series Two in 2007. In late June and early July 2006, she appeared on Take That&#x27;s tour of the UK and Ireland to perform their song &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;. She appeared on &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 6 on 20 March 2007 as a mentor for the female contestants, and the following night performed &quot;To Sir With Love&quot;. Later in 2007, she appeared in the UK as a guest for Jools Holland in a series of concerts and features, and on Holland&#x27;s CD release &quot;Best of Friends&quot;, performing &quot;Where Have All the Good Guys Gone?&quot; Lulu&#x27;s complete Atco recordings, made between 1969 and 1972, were released on 12 November 2007. The two-CD set included previously unreleased and demo versions of some of her recordings from this period. In December 2007 she released a download single on iTunes in the UK, called &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot;. At this time Lulu was also promoting a range of beauty products on QVC, called &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, and appeared on a 2007 Christmas television advert for the Morrisons supermarket chain in the UK.

In November 2008, Lulu was announced as one of a number of Scottish celebrities to feature in the advertising campaign for Homecoming Scotland, a year-long event to encourage people around the world with Scottish heritage to return to Scotland. Also in November 2008, Lulu posted the following message on her website, celebrating the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States: &quot;Barack Obama Is In – Yippee, now we have got hope in the World. I&#x27;ve just turned 60, Obama is the new president of the USA and I think its going to be a fantastic year. Love Lu X&quot;. In the 1979, 1983 and 1987 UK general elections, Lulu had been a supporter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative Party.

In January 2009, Lulu began a four-week stint as an advisor/coach on the BBC show &quot;&quot;, helping to choose the singer to represent the UK at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. In the summer of 2009, Lulu guest presented on STV&#x27;s daily lifestyle show &quot;The Hour&quot;, alongside main presenter Stephen Jardine. She appeared between 27 and 31 July. The Scottish magazine programme airs weekdays at 5pm. Around this time she pitched her range of &quot;Lulu&#x27;s&quot; anti-ageing products and other cosmetics through the home shopping channel QVC (UK), using her youthful appearance as a promotional tool. After appearing at an ABBA tribute concert in Hyde Park, London during September 2009, Lulu announced that she would be touring the UK in a Here Come the Girls alongside Chaka Khan and Anastacia. The trio promoted the concert series on UK TV, ahead of the first performance in November 2009, which took on twenty different dates.

===2010s: Touring and Commonwealth Games ===
In early 2010, Lulu sang the theme &quot;The Word Is Love&quot; for the film &quot;Oy Vey! My Son Is Gay!!&quot; and toured the UK a second time with Here Come the Girls alongside Anastacia and Heather Small. In November 2010 she hosted the BBC TV series &quot;Rewind the 60s&quot;, with each episode focusing on a year during the 1960s, highlighting the social and political issues of the decade, as well as music and interviews with personalities.

On 26 February 2011, she appeared in the second heat in the third series of &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot;. She danced to Soulja Boy&#x27;s hit &quot;Crank That&quot;. In May 2011, she made an appearance on the ITV2 programme, &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot; and, in July 2011, she performed at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. In October and November 2011, Lulu took part in the BBC series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Partnered by Brendan Cole, she was eliminated 5th.

In August 2014, Lulu opened the closing ceremony of the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. On 11 February 2015, she appeared on &quot;The Great Comic Relief Bake Off&quot; in aid of Comic Relief, when she revealed that she had never before made a pastry. On 1 April 2017, she appeared as a guest on &quot;All Round to Mrs. Brown&#x27;s&quot; alongside Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. On 17 August 2017, she was the subject of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; programme.

On 19 March 2018, she joined the cast of &quot;42nd Street&quot; playing the lead role Dorothy Brock for a 16-week tenure. Between April and June 2019, Lulu toured with Take That and their Greatest Hits tour, performing &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;. On 18 December 2019, she performed &quot;Run Rudolph Run&quot; and &quot;Shout&quot; in the &quot;Miss World 2019&quot; pageant.
===2020s: &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; and television===
In October 2021, Lulu was a guest judge on the BBC program &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK&quot;. In March 2022, she voiced a character in &quot;My Old School&quot;, the film about 30-year-old fraudulent pupil Brandon Lee at Bearsden Academy in Glasgow, and also sang the closing theme, &quot;My Old School&quot;.

In January 2023, Lulu appeared on the fourth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Piece of Cake&quot;. She was the second contestant voted out of the competition. Her &quot;For The Record&quot; UK Tour in 2023 was Lulu&#x27;s first tour since 2019, an ambitious and extensive return to her live performance schedule. On 3 November 2023, to celebrate her seventy-fifth birthday, Lulu announced her &quot;Champagne for Lulu!&quot; UK tour dates for 2024. Her only London performance will mark her sixth decade anniversary of her first hit single, &quot;Shout,&quot; scheduled for 17 April at the London Palladium

<text>Edward Henry Carson, Baron Carson, PC, PC (Ire), KC (9 February 1854 – 22 October 1935), from 1900 to 1921 known as Sir Edward Carson, was an Irish unionist politician, barrister and judge, who was the Attorney General and Solicitor General for England, Wales and Ireland as well as the First Lord of the Admiralty for the British Royal Navy. From 1905 Carson was both the Irish Unionist Alliance MP for the Dublin University constituency and leader of the Ulster Unionist Council in Belfast. In 1915, he entered the war cabinet of H. H. Asquith as Attorney-General. Carson was defeated in his ambition to maintain Ireland as a whole in union with Great Britain. His leadership, however, was celebrated by some for securing a continued place in the United Kingdom for the six northeastern counties, albeit under a devolved Parliament of Northern Ireland that neither he nor his fellow unionists had sought. He is also remembered for his open-ended cross-examination of Oscar Wilde in a legal action that led to plaintiff Wilde being prosecuted, gaoled and ruined. Carson unsuccessfully attempted to intercede for Wilde after the case.

== Early life ==

Edward Carson, the second son of Edward Henry Carson, architect, was born at 4 Harcourt Street, in Dublin, into a wealthy Anglican family. The Carsons were of Scottish origin, Edward&#x27;s grandfather having originally moved to Dublin from Dumfries in 1815. Carson&#x27;s mother was Isabella Lambert, the daughter of Captain Peter Lambert, part of an old Anglo-Irish family, the Lamberts of Castle Ellen, County Galway. Carson spent holidays at Castle Ellen, which was owned by his uncle. He was one of six children (four boys and two girls). Edward was educated at Arlington House in Portarlington, Wesley College, Dublin and Trinity College Dublin, where he read law and was an active member of the College Historical Society. It was said that he also played hurling with the college team. Carson graduated BA and MA.

He spoke Irish and was a regular player of Gaelic games as a child.

He later received an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901.

== As a barrister ==

In 1877 Carson was called to the Irish Bar after graduating from King&#x27;s Inns. He gained a reputation for fearsome advocacy and supreme legal ability and became regarded as a brilliant barrister, among the most prominent in Ireland at the time. He was also an acknowledged master of the appeal to the jury by his legal wit and oratory. He was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel (Ireland) in 1889 and was Called to the English Bar at Middle Temple on 26 April 1893. He was twice admitted to the Inn, once on 1 November 1875 and then again on 21 April 1893, and was made a Bencher on 15 June 1900.
=== Oscar Wilde ===

In 1895, he was engaged by the Marquess of Queensberry to lead his defence against Oscar Wilde&#x27;s action for criminal libel. The Marquess, angry at Wilde&#x27;s ongoing homosexual relationship with his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, had left his calling card at Wilde&#x27;s club with an inscription accusing Wilde of being a &quot;posing somdomite&quot; . Wilde retaliated with a libel action, as homosexuality was, at the time, illegal.

Kevin Myers states that Carson&#x27;s initial response was to refuse to take the case. Later, he discovered that Queensberry had been telling the truth about Wilde&#x27;s activity and was therefore not guilty of the libel of which Wilde accused him.

Carson portrayed the playwright as a morally depraved hedonist who seduced naïve young men into a life of homosexuality with lavish gifts and promises of a glamorous artistic lifestyle. He impugned Wilde&#x27;s works as morally repugnant and designed to corrupt the upbringing of the youth. Queensberry spent a large amount of money on private detectives who investigated Wilde&#x27;s activity in the London underworld of homosexual clubs and procurers.

Wilde abandoned the case when Carson announced in his opening speech for the defence that he planned to call several male prostitutes who would testify that they had had sex with Wilde, which would have rendered the libel charge unsupportable as the accusation would have been proven true. Wilde was bankrupted when he was then ordered to pay the considerable legal and detective bills Queensberry had incurred in his defence.

Based on the evidence of Queensberry&#x27;s detectives and Carson&#x27;s cross-examinations of Wilde at the trial, Wilde was subsequently prosecuted for gross indecency in a second trial. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour, after which he moved to France, where he died penniless.

=== Cadbury Bros. ===

In 1908 Carson appeared for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in a libel action brought by George Cadbury. The &quot;Standard&quot; was controlled by Unionist interests which supported Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s Imperial Preference views. The Cadbury family were Liberal supporters of free trade and had, in 1901, purchased &quot;The Daily News&quot;. The &quot;Standard&quot; articles alleged that Cadbury Bros Ltd., which claimed to be model employers having created the village of Bournville outside Birmingham, knew of the slave labour conditions on São Tomé, the Portuguese island colony from which Cadbury purchased most of the cocoa used in the production of their chocolate.

The articles alleged that George&#x27;s son William had gone to São Tomé in 1901 and observed for himself the slave conditions, and that the Cadbury family had decided to continue purchasing the cocoa grown there because it was cheaper than that grown in the British colony of the Gold Coast, where labour conditions were much better, being regulated by the Colonial Office. The &quot;Standard&quot; alleged that the Cadbury family knew that the reason cocoa from São Tomé was cheaper was because it was grown by slave labour. This case was regarded at the time as an important political case as Carson and the Unionists maintained that it showed the fundamental immorality of free trade. George Cadbury recovered contemptuous damages of one farthing in a case described as one of Carson&#x27;s triumphs.

=== Archer-Shee case ===

Carson was also the victorious counsel in the 1910 Archer-Shee Case, exonerating a Royal Naval College, Osborne cadet of the charge of theft of a postal order. The cadet was from a quite prominent Roman Catholic banking family, and educated at Stonyhurst. On this case, Terence Rattigan based his play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;.

== Politics ==

Initially a radical Liberal, Carson&#x27;s political career began on 20 June 1892, when he was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland, although he was not then a member of the House of Commons. He was elected as Member of Parliament for the Dublin University constituency in the 1892 general election as a Liberal Unionist, although overall the Liberal Party won the election.

Carson maintained his career as a barrister and was admitted to the English Bar by The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in 1893 and from then on mainly practised in London. In 1896 he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. He was appointed Solicitor-General for England on 7 May 1900, receiving the customary knighthood. He served in this position until the Conservative government resigned in December 1905, when he was rewarded with membership of the Privy Council.

In the 1918 general election, Sinn Féin won 73 out of the 105 Irish seats in the House of Commons. In 25 constituencies, Sinn Féin won the seats unopposed. Unionists (including Ulster Unionist Labour Association) won 26 seats, all but three of which were in the six counties that today form Northern Ireland, and the Irish Parliamentary Party won only six (down from 84), all but one in Ulster. The Labour Party did not stand in the election, allowing the electorate to decide between home rule or a republic by having a clear choice between the two nationalist parties. Irish Republicans regarded these elections as the mandate to establish the First Dáil. As such, all persons in Ireland elected to Westminster were considered to have been elected to Dáil Éireann. Had he chosen to do so, Carson could have exercised the option of attending the meeting of the First Dáil in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. Like all of those elected to Irish seats in December 1918, he received an invitation, written as gaeilge, to attend. He kept the invitation as a souvenir. When his name was called out in the first roll call of the new Dáil, it was met by silence, and then laughter, from the Sinn Féin delegates and the audience in the Mansion House. He was listed as &quot;as láthair&quot;, or absent.

== Unionism ==

In September 1911, a huge crowd of over 50,000 people gathered at a rally near Belfast where Carson made a speech in which he urged his party to take on the governance of Ulster. With the passage of the Parliament Act 1911, the Unionists faced the loss of the House of Lords&#x27; ability to thwart the passage of the new Home Rule Bill. Carson disliked many of Ulster&#x27;s local characteristics and, in particular, the culture of Orangeism (although he had become an Orangeman at nineteen he left the institution shortly afterwards). He stated that their speeches reminded him of &quot;the unrolling of a mummy. All old bones and rotten rags.&quot;

Carson campaigned against Home Rule. He spoke against the Bill in the House of Commons and organised rallies in Ireland promoting a provisional government for &quot;the Protestant province of Ulster&quot; to be ready, should a third Home Rule Bill come into law.

On Sunday 28 September 1912, &quot;Ulster Day&quot;, he was the first signatory on the Ulster Covenant, which bound 447,197 signatories to resist Home Rule with the threat that they would use &quot;all means necessary&quot; after Carson had established the Ulster Volunteers, the first loyalist paramilitary group. From it, the Ulster Volunteer Force was formed in January 1913 to undergo military training and purchase arms. In Parliament Carson rejected any olive branch for compromise demanding Ulster &quot;be given a resolution rather than a stay of execution&quot;. The UVF received a large arms cache from Germany on the night of 24 April 1914. Historian Felician Prill says Germany was not trying to start a civil war, for the Ulster cause was not popular in Berlin. Later that year, a further shipment of arms from Germany was delivered to the pro-Home Rule and IRB-influenced Irish Volunteers at Howth near Dublin.

The Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons on 25 May 1914 by a majority of 77 and due to the Parliament Act 1911, it did not need the Lords&#x27; consent, so the bill was awaiting royal assent. To enforce the legislation, given the activities of the Unionists, H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government had prepared to send troops to Ulster. This sparked the Curragh Incident on 20 March. Together with the arming of the Irish Volunteers, Ireland was on the brink of civil war when the outbreak of the First World War led to the suspension of the Home Rule Act&#x27;s operation until the end of the war. By this time Carson had announced in Belfast that an Ulster Division would be formed from the U.V.F., and the 36th (Ulster) Division was swiftly organised.

Brown examines why Carson&#x27;s role in 1914 made him a highly controversial figure:
In 1914, suffragettes Flora Drummond and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam) besieged Carson&#x27;s home, arguing that his form of Ulster &quot;incitement to militancy&quot; passed without notice whilst suffragettes were charged and imprisoned for same action.

In a 1921 speech opposing the pending Anglo-Irish Treaty, Carson attacked the &quot;Tory intrigues&quot; that had led him on the course that would partition Ireland, an outcome he opposed almost as strongly as Home Rule itself. In the course of the speech, Carson said: Later in the speech, Carson said:

Although considering himself proudly British, Carson also considered himself a proud Irishman stating &quot;I am very proud as an Irishman to be a member of the British Empire&quot;.

== Cabinet member ==

On 25 May 1915, Asquith appointed Carson Attorney-General when the Coalition Government was formed after the Liberal government was brought down by the Shell Crisis and the resignation of Admiral Fisher. He resigned on 19 October, however, citing his opposition to Government policy on war in the Balkans. During Asquith&#x27;s coalition government of 1915–1916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith&#x27;s Liberal, Conservative, and Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by John Redmond. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. After Carson, the leading figure among the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915, he then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.

He played a major role in forcing the resignation of Asquith as Prime Minister, returning to office on 10 December 1916 as First Lord of the Admiralty, and elevated to the powerful British War Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio on 17 July 1917.

Carson was hostile to the foundation of the League of Nations as he believed that this institution would be ineffectual against war. In a speech on 7 December 1917, he said:

Talk to me of treaties! Talk to me of the League of Nations! Every Great Power in Europe was pledged by treaty to preserve Belgium. That was a League of Nations, but it failed.

Early in 1918, the government decided to extend conscription to Ireland, and that Ireland would have to be given home rule in order to make it acceptable. Carson disagreed in principle and again resigned on 21 January. He gave up his seat at the University of Dublin in the 1918 general election and was instead elected for Belfast Duncairn.

He continued to lead the Unionists, but when the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was introduced, advised his party to work for the exemption of six Ulster counties from Home Rule as the best compromise (a compromise he had previously rejected). This proposal passed and as a result, the Parliament of Northern Ireland was established.

In January 1921, he met in London over three days with Father O&#x27;Flanagan and Lord Justice Sir James O&#x27;Connor to try to find a mutual agreement that would end the Anglo-Irish war, but without result.

After the partition of Ireland, Carson repeatedly warned Ulster Unionist leaders not to alienate northern Catholics, as he foresaw this would make Northern Ireland unstable (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). In 1921, he stated: &quot;We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.&quot; In old age, while at London&#x27;s Carlton Club, he confided to the Anglo-Irish (and Catholic) historian Sir Charles Petrie his disillusionment with Belfast politics: &quot;I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.&quot;

Carson did not see himself as an Ulsterman and, unlike many northern unionists, it is thought he had an emotional connection with Ireland as a single entity.

== Judge ==

Carson was asked to lead the Unionists during the election to become the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. He declined due to his lack of connections with any Northern Ireland constituency (an opponent once taunted him saying: &quot;He has no country, he has no caste&quot;), and resigned the leadership of the party in February 1921. Carson was appointed one of seven Lords of Appeal in Ordinary on 24 May 1921 and was created a life peer under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 on 1 June 1921 as Baron Carson, of Duncairn in the County of Antrim.

== Later years ==

Carson retired in October 1929. In July 1933, during his last visit to Northern Ireland, he witnessed the unveiling of a large statue of himself in front of Parliament Buildings at Stormont. The statue was sculpted by L. S. Merrifield, cast in bronze, and placed upon a plinth. The inscription on the base read &quot;By the loyalists of Ulster as an expression of their love and admiration for its subject&quot;. It was unveiled by Lord Craigavon in the presence of more than 40,000 people.

=== State funeral ===

Lord Carson lived at Cleve Court, a Queen Anne house near Minster in the Isle of Thanet, Kent, bought in 1921. It was here that Carson died peacefully on 22 October 1935. Britain gave him a state funeral, which took place in Belfast at St Anne&#x27;s Cathedral; he is still the only person to have been buried there. From a silver bowl, soil from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland was scattered onto his coffin, which had earlier been covered by the Union Flag, which however was removed during the service. At his funeral service the choir sang his favourite hymn, &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;. A warship had brought his body to Belfast and the funeral took place on Saturday 26 October 1935. Thousands of ship workers stopped work and bowed their heads as HMS &quot;Broke&quot; steamed slowly up Belfast Lough, with Carson&#x27;s flag-draped coffin sat on the quarterdeck. This would be the last state funeral for a non-member of the royal family until the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965.

===Memories===

Even before his death, there was an organized effort to portray Carson as the heroic embodiment of the militant unionist spirit. In November 1932, the new Stormont Parliament became the greatest Carson monument, giving his admirers the symbolic endorsement of their state. His statue was unveiled as the speakers excited the audience with triumphalist images of Protestant deliverance from Catholic tyranny. Carson&#x27;s funeral in 1935 was attended with pomp and unionist symbolism, as happened again with the dedication of a plaque in his memory in 1938. Calling for unity with Britain, numerous ceremonial rituals, memorials, and anniversaries affirmed the legitimacy of the state, and the Protestant ascendancy.

== Private life ==

Carson married twice. His first wife was Annette Kirwan from County Galway, daughter of Henry Persse Kirwan, a retired County Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary. They were married on 19 December 1879. He had two sons and two daughters by his first wife (he described them as a &quot;rum lot&quot;), namely:
* The Hon. William Henry Lambert Carson, born 2 October 1880 (d. 1930)
* The Hon. Aileen Seymour Carson, born 13 November 1881
* The Hon. Gladys Isobel Carson, born 1885
* The Hon. Walter Seymour Carson, born 1890

The first Lady Carson died in 1913. His second wife was Ruby Frewen (1881–1966), a Yorkshirewoman, the daughter of Lt.-Col. Stephen Frewen, later Frewen-Laton MP (1857–1933) and Emily Augusta (Peacocke) Frewen. They were married on 17 September 1914; she was 32 and he was 60. They had one son:
* The Hon. Edward Carson MP, born 17 February 1920

<doc id="168327" wikidata="Q336809" url="?curid=168327" title="James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon">
<text>James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon (8 January 1871 – 24 November 1940), was a leading Irish unionist and a key architect of Northern Ireland as a devolved region within the United Kingdom. During the Home Rule Crisis of 1912–14, he defied the British government in preparing an armed resistance in Ulster to an all-Ireland parliament. He accepted partition as a final settlement, securing the opt out of six Ulster counties from the dominion statehood accorded Ireland under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. From then until his death in 1940, he led the Ulster Unionist Party and served Northern Ireland as its first Prime Minister. He publicly characterised his administration as a &quot;Protestant&quot; counterpart to the &quot;Catholic state&quot; nationalists had established in the south. Craig was created a baronet in 1918 and raised to the Peerage in 1927.

==Early life==
Craig was born at Sydenham, Belfast, the son of James Craig (1828–1900), a wealthy whiskey distiller who had entered the firm of Dunville &amp; Co as a clerk: by age 40 he was a millionaire and a partner in the firm. James Craig Snr. owned a large house called Craigavon, overlooking Belfast Lough. His mother, Eleanor Gilmore Browne, was the daughter of Robert Browne, a prosperous man who owned property in Belfast and a farm outside Lisburn. Craig was the seventh child and sixth son in the family; there were eight sons and one daughter in all.

He was educated at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, Scotland; his father had taken a conscious decision not to send his sons to any of the more fashionable public schools. After school he began work as a stockbroker, eventually opening his own firm in Belfast.

==Military career==
Craig enlisted in the 3rd (Militia) battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles on 17 January 1900 to serve in the Second Boer War. He was seconded to the Imperial Yeomanry, a cavalry force created for service during the war, as a lieutenant in the 13th battalion on 24 February 1900, and left Liverpool for South Africa on the SS &quot;Cymric&quot; in March 1900. After arrival he was soon sent to the front, and was taken prisoner in May 1900, but released by the Boers because of a perforated colon. On his recovery he became deputy assistant director of the Imperial Military Railways, showing the qualities of organisation that were to mark his involvement in both British and Ulster politics. In June 1901 he was sent home suffering from dysentery, and by the time he was fit for service again the war was over. He was promoted to captain in the 3rd Royal Irish Rifles on 20 September 1902, while still seconded to South Africa.

Service in South Africa is said to have made Craig far more politically aware and &quot;had given him a heightened awareness of the Empire and a pride in Ulster&#x27;s place in it&quot;.

==Politics==
=== Leader of Ulster opposition to Irish Home Rule ===
On his return to Ireland, having received a £100,000 legacy from his father&#x27;s will, he turned to politics. Following his brother Charles who had successfully stood as an Irish Unionist in a by-election in South Antrim the previous month, in the March 1903 by-election Craig attempted to secure the unionist seat of North Fermanagh. Unlike his brother, he narrowly failed to defeat his Russellite rival (Edward Mitchell). He had to wait until the 1906 General Election to win his first seat, East Down (the constituency he represented until returned from Mid Down in 1918). Already he was playing a leading organisational role for Irish Unionism in Ulster.

In 1905, he had co-founded the Ulster Unionist Council to coalesce loyalist opposition to Irish Home Rule in northern province. In this task he regarded the contribution of the parading Orange Order (that commanded 50 of 200 seats on the council) as key. Opening an Orange Hall in after the 1906 election he declared that he was &quot;an Orangeman first and a Member of Parliament afterwards&quot; and called for &quot;the Protestant community to rally around the [Orange] lodges, strengthen and support them&quot;.

In 1912, Craig helped orchestrate &quot;Ulster Day”. In a massed demonstration in Belfast, Edward Carson, the Dublin barrister he had nominated for the leadership of the UUC, led in signing the Ulster Covenant. The signatories pledged &quot;to stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom&quot;, and to use &quot;all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland&quot;.

In January 1913, unable to prevent passage of the Liberal government&#x27;s Home Rule Bill at Westminster, the UUC called the exclusion of Ulster from its provisions, a demand backed with a call for up to 100,000 Covenanters to be drilled and armed as Ulster Volunteers. On 23 September, Craig persuaded Carson to accept Chairmanship of a Provisional Government which he had planned and primed to assume the administration of Ulster should the Government move to enforce the authority of a new Dublin parliament.

In April 1914, Craig supported Major Frederick Crawford in arming the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) with rifles and ammunition purchased, and smuggled, from Imperial Germany. Years later (1934) in a speech in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland the political leader of the Northern Ireland Nationalists Cahir Healy spoke of Craig&#x27;s support in the arming of Loyalists and the potential for armed resistance to the Government of Ireland Act 1914: 

=== On women&#x27;s suffrage ===
In 1912, Craig broke with other Irish MPs, both unionist and nationalist, in voting for the Conciliation bill that would have extended the parliamentary vote (albeit on a restrictive property basis) for the first time to women. Consistent with the prominent role in mobilising opposition to home rule played by the Ulster Women&#x27;s Unionist Council (UWUC), and the invitation to women to sign their own declaration in support of the Ulster Covenant, in September 1913 Craig&#x27;s UUC informed the Women&#x27;s Council that the draft articles for the Provisional Government included provisions for female suffrage.

When in the spring of 1914, Carson, seeming to overrule Craig, made it clear that a potentially divisive endorsement of votes for women was not a political option for unionism, Dorothy Evans, organiser in Belfast for Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union declared an end to &quot;the truce&quot; that the organisation had &quot;held in Ulster&quot;. In the months that followed WSPU militants were implicated in a series of outrages against property that, in addition to arson attacks on Unionist-owned buildings and on male recreational and sports facilities, included forced entry into Craig&#x27;s home.

On 3 April 1913 police raided the flat in Belfast Evans was sharing with local activist Midge Muir, and found explosives. In court, five days later, the pair created uproar when they demanded to know why the gun-runner Craig was not appearing on the same charges.

=== Wartime government service ===
Following the United Kingdom declaration of war upon Germany in August 1914, Craig persuaded Lord Kitchener to remould the UVF into the 36th Ulster Division. He was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but unift for front line service he resigned his commission at the end of 1916 and took up a junior post, Treasurer of the Household, in the wartime coalition government of Lloyd George. He spoke in favour of conscripting Irishmen into the army in 1918 as the Government looked to extend the Military Services Act.

After the World War, Craig continued in the service of the coalition government first as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions (1919-1920) and then Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (1920–21). In February 1921, with the war of independence underway in the south, Craig succeeded Edward Carson as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.

=== Proponent of a devolved Belfast administration ===
Craig persuaded his fellow Unionists and the British Government that if exclusion, and thus partition, was to be the solution to the challenge posed by the Catholic-majority desire for Irish self government, it should apply to only six of the nine Ulster counties. In three, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, he argued Sinn Féiners would make government &quot;absolutely impossible for us&quot;. He also led Ulster Unionists in accepting that the six counties—Northern Ireland as they were to become—should have their own home-rule parliament in Belfast.

Writing to Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Craig had declared that it was only as a &quot;sacrifice in the interest of peace&quot; that unionists would accept a Northern Ireland parliament they had not asked for. But in debating the Government of Ireland Bill 1920, Craig noted that having &quot;all the paraphernalia of Government&quot; might make it more difficult for future Liberal and/or Labour government to push Northern Ireland against the will of its majority into all-Ireland arrangements Once Unionists had their own parliament, Craig felt able to assure his followers &quot;no power on earth would ever be able to touch them&quot;.

To make such assurance against British pressure for Irish unity doubly sure, in November 1921 Craig suggested to Lloyd George that Northern Ireland&#x27;s status be changed to that of a Crown dominion &quot;outside&quot; of the United Kingdom. Although in signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty, only weeks later the Prime Minister conceded Southern Ireland precisely this Canada-style form of statehood, to Craig he replied that he was not willing to give &quot;the character of an international boundary&quot; to &quot;a frontier based neither upon natural features nor broad geographical considerations&quot;.

Lloyd George was nonetheless persuaded in October 1920 to secure that still unsettled frontier by endorsing Craig&#x27;s proposal for a new &quot;volunteer constabulary ... raised from the loyal population&quot; and &quot;armed for duty within the six county area only&quot;. Into this Ulster Special Constabulary former UVF units were &quot;incorporated en masse&quot;.

=== Prime Minister of Northern Ireland ===

In the 1921 Northern Ireland general election, the first ever, Craig was elected to the newly created Northern Ireland House of Commons as one of the members for County Down. On 7 June 1921, Craig was appointed the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The House of Commons of Northern Ireland assembled for the first time later that day. By 1932 opposition to some of Craig&#x27;s policies became more direct. Opposition leader Cahir Healy pointed out the sectarian nature of the Prime Minister&#x27;s rule: 

In April 1934, in response to George Leeke&#x27;s question regarding the Protestant nature of the Unionist dominated parliament, Craig famously replied: The hon. Member must remember that in the South they boasted of a Catholic State. They still boast of Southern Ireland being a Catholic State. All I boast of is that we are a Protestant Parliament and a Protestant State. It would be rather interesting for historians of the future to compare a Catholic State launched in the South with a Protestant State launched in the North and to see which gets on the better and prospers the more. It is most interesting for me at the moment to watch how they are progressing. I am doing my best always to top the bill and to be ahead of the South.

This speech is often misquoted, intentionally or otherwise, as: &quot;A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People&quot;, and conflated with an incident which occurred respective to the naming of the New City of Craigavon. Knockmena (a corruption of the townland name, Knockmenagh) was the preferred name nationalists hoped would be used, and which might have attracted broad acceptance on both sides. On 6 July 1965, it was announced that the new city would be named Craigavon after Craig. A noted nationalist, Joseph Connellan, interrupted the announcement with the comment, &quot;A Protestant city for a Protestant people&quot;.

Later that year, speaking in the House of Commons at Stormont on 21 November 1934 in response to an accusation that all government appointments in Northern Ireland were carried out on a religious basis, he replied: &quot;... it is undoubtedly our duty and our privilege, and always will be, to see that those appointed by us possess the most unimpeachable loyalty to the King and Constitution. That is my whole object in carrying on a Protestant Government for a Protestant people. I repeat it in this House&quot;.

He was made a baronet in 1918, and in 1927 was created Viscount Craigavon, of Stormont in the County of Down. He was also the recipient of honorary degrees from The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (1922) and Oxford University (1926).

Craig had made his career in British as well as Northern Irish politics; but his premiership showed little sign of his earlier close acquaintance with the British political world. He became intensely parochial, and suffered from his loss of intimacy with British politicians in 1938, when the British government concluded agreements with Dublin to end the Anglo-Irish economic war between the two countries. He never tried to persuade Westminster to protect Northern Ireland&#x27;s industries, especially the linen industry, which was central to its economy. He was anxious not to provoke Westminster, given the precarious state of Northern Ireland&#x27;s position. In April 1939, and again in May 1940 in the Second World War, he called for conscription to be introduced in Northern Ireland (which the British government, fearing a backlash from nationalists, refused). He also called for Churchill to invade Ireland, alternatively known as Éire, using Scottish and Welsh troops in order to seize the valuable ports and install a Governor-General at Dublin. Lady Londonderry confided to Sir Samuel Hoare, the Home Secretary until the outbreak of the war, that Craigavon had become &quot;ga-ga&quot; but Craigavon was still Prime Minister when he died peacefully at his home at Glencraig, County Down, at the age of 69. He was buried on the Stormont Estate on 5 December 1940, and was succeeded as the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland by the Minister of Finance, J. M. Andrews.

Craig had a dual Irish-British self-identity, saying in a 1929 parliamentary debate that &quot;We are Irishmen ... always hold that Ulstermen are Irishmen and the best of Irishmen – much the best&quot;.

==Personal life==
His wife, Cecil Mary Nowell Dering Tupper (Viscountess Craigavon), whom he married on 22 March 1905 after a very brief courtship, was English, the daughter of Sir Daniel Tupper, assistant comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s department of the king&#x27;s household, and a fourth cousin of the future Queen Mother, Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon. They had twin sons and a daughter. A president of the Ulster Women&#x27;s Unionist Council, she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1941.

Craigavon was succeeded as second viscount by his elder son, James (1906–1974). His estate was valued at £3,228, 2s., 6d. effects in England: probate, 20 March 1941, CGPLA NIre., £24, 138 9s. 9d.: probate, 3 March 1941, CGPLA NIre.

Craig had a keen interest in Ulster Agriculture and was vice-president of Listooder and District Ploughing Society (the oldest in Ireland) from November 1906 until November 1921 and continued to present the all-Ireland cup class until 1926.

<text>The theme of adultery has been used in a wide range of literature through the ages, and has served as a theme for some notable works such as &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. As a theme it brings intense emotions into the foreground, and has consequences for all concerned. It also automatically brings its own conflict, between the people concerned and between sexual desires and a sense of loyalty.

As marriage and family are often regarded as basis of society, a story of adultery often shows the conflict between social pressure and individual struggle for happiness.

According to the American author Tom Perrotta, the novel of adultery is one of the leading 19th century literary traditions in Europe and in the United States. He states that these novels often feature women whose unhappy marriages push them into seeking romance and illicit sex. The main topic of these novels is the rebel-woman who seeks salvation for her unhappy public love-life.

In the Bible, incidents of adultery are present almost from the start. The story of Abraham contains several incidents and serve as warnings or stories of sin and forgiveness. Abraham attempts to continue his blood line through his wife&#x27;s maidservant, with consequences that continue through history. Jacob&#x27;s family life is complicated with similar incidents.

The following works of literature have adultery and its consequences as one of their major themes. (M) and (F) stand for &quot;adulterer&quot; and &quot;adulteress&quot; respectively.

<text>Maurice Pialat (; 31 August 1925 – 11 January 2003) was a French film director, screenwriter and actor known for the rigorous and unsentimental style of his films. His work is often described as &quot;realist&quot;, though many film critics acknowledge it does not fit the traditional definition of realism.

Pialat&#x27;s films are said to have dispensed with mannerisms, and his everyday stories tell the bittersweet nature of the French petty bourgeoisie. This earned him the disregard of some critics, but also enduring popularity, with films characterized by a psychological narrative style, often set outside the metropolises.

==Life and career==
Pialat was born in Cunlhat, Puy-de-Dôme, France. He originally intended to become a painter, but met with little success. Having acquired a camera at age 16, he tried his hand at documentary films before making his first notable short, &quot;L&#x27;amour existe&quot;, in 1960.

Pialat came to filmmaking late. He directed his feature-length debut, 1969&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfance nue&quot; (&quot;The Naked Childhood&quot;) at age 43. The film, which was co-produced by French New Wave director François Truffaut, won the Prix Jean Vigo.

During his 35-year career, Pialat completed ten major features, many of which—most notably &quot;Loulou&quot;—have been interpreted as autobiographical. He directed Gérard Depardieu in four films: &quot;Loulou&quot;, &quot;Police&quot;, &quot;Sous le soleil de Satan&quot; (&quot;Under the Sun of Satan&quot;), for which Pialat won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, and &quot;Le Garçu&quot; (1995).

In a posthumous tribute written for the French film magazine &quot;Positif&quot;, critic Noël Herpe called Pialat&#x27;s style &quot;a naturalism that was born of formalism&quot;. In English-language film criticism, he is often compared to his American contemporary John Cassavetes.

Summarizing Pialat&#x27;s stance as a filmmaker in a profile for &quot;Film Comment&quot;, critic Kent Jones wrote: &quot;To say that Pialat marched to the beat of a different drummer is to put it mildly. In fact, he didn&#x27;t really march at all. He ambled, and fuck anybody who got it into their head that they&#x27;d like to amble along with him. Or behind him. Or ahead of him.&quot;

==Style==
Pialat&#x27;s films are often noted for their loose yet rigorous style and for their elliptical editing and long takes. Describing the unique aesthetics of Pialat&#x27;s work, film critic Kent Jones wrote: &quot;More than Cassavetes, more than Renoir, Pialat wanted every frame of celluloid bearing his name to be marked by the here and the now. [...] He was always willing to bend his narratives around experience. And the frequent ruptures, discontinuities, perspective shifts, and ellipses in his work are less single-minded than those of Cassavetes, more far-reaching in their implications.&quot;

<text>Halle (; , ) is a Belgian city and municipality in the Halle-Vilvoorde district (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the province of Flemish Brabant. It is located on the Brussels–Charleroi Canal and on the Flemish side of the language border that separates Flanders and Wallonia. Halle lies on the border between the Flemish plains to the North (thick loam) and the undulating Brabant lands to the South (thinner loam). The city also borders on the Pajottenland to the west. It is about southwest of Brussels. The official language of Halle is Dutch, as in the rest of Flanders.

The municipality comprises the city of Halle proper and the towns of Buizingen and Lembeek. The neighboring towns are: Pepingen, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Beersel, Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, Braine-le-Château, and Tubize. The population of Halle has increased from 32,758 inhabitants in 1991 to 39,536 on 1 January 2019. The mayor is Eva Demesmaeker of the N-VA party.

== History ==

=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===
Borders have always played an important role in the history of Halle. Already in the prehistoric era, before the Roman conquests, a tribe of Nervii – either a Germanized Celtic people or a Celticized Germanic people – lived in this region. In the 7th century, Saint Waltrude, the daughter of an important Merovingian figure, gave some of her inherited land around Halle to the chapter of the abbey which she had just founded in Mons. From that time on and until the French Revolution, the region around Halle would depend to various degrees on the County of Hainaut. In the 8th century, Hubertus, archbishop of Tongeren, founded a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This may have been the start of the regional devotion that continues today.
The town must have grown quickly since Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut granted its freedom charters in 1225. The miraculous statue of the Virgin was sent to Halle in 1267 as a wedding gift to John II, Count of Holland and of Hainaut. The cult of Mary attracted important visitors, such as Edward I of England and Ludwig the Bavarian, making Halle an important frontier town between Hainaut and Brabant. A larger church, dedicated to Mary, was completed in the 15th century. The death of Philipe Bold, Duke of Burgundy in Halle in 1404 benefitted the city. All subsequent ruling Dukes of Burgundy paid visits here to honor the duke&#x27;s grave. In 1460 Louis XI of France decided to bury his stillborn son in the Halle church.

=== Renaissance and modern era ===
After the death of Mary of Burgundy, Flanders and Brabant revolted against her husband Maximilian. Hainaut, and therefore Halle, remained loyal to the Holy Roman emperor. Two attempts by a Brussels army to conquer Halle in 1489 failed. 

In the 16th century, Brussels and Halle were fighting again, this time over religion. Following the Protestant Reformation, the predominately Calvinistic Brabant tried to take over Catholic Hainaut. Again, two attempts failed, leading to an increased devotion among residents to the city&#x27;s miraculous statue. In 1621, with the support of archdukes Albert and Isabella, the Jesuits were invited to establish educational institutions in the city, expanding their religious influence.

Philip IV of Spain used his stake in Halle and the surrounding area as a warrant against a loan; in 1648 he was forced to cede the city to the Duke of Arenberg. Louis XIV&#x27;s wars at the end of the century resulted in serious losses. In the 18th century there was a resurgence in devotional and economic prosperity. 

The French Revolution at the end of the century suppressed much religious practice. But the pilgrimage site and the statue were spared confiscation thanks to the initiative of the inhabitants. When Napoleon gained power, his government restored religious services. The tradition of Napoleon princely visits to the church of Halle continues until this day.

Today, Halle is a regional services and care center, offering trade, educational establishments, general hospital, and public services (61% of the active population works in the services sector).

A train collision in February 2010 in Buizingen killed around 18 people.

== Flag and arms ==
The flag of Halle was adopted on 1 October 1991; it is quartered as saltire (argent and azure). Its proportions are 2:3. If you cut the flag in two vertically and flip both sides, you get a blue lozenge, hinting at Bavaria.

On the municipal coat of arms, the first quarter shows an argent-coloured Virgin with Child on an azure background. The fourth quarter is the coat of arms of the Wittelsbach family. The second and third quarters are the coat of arms of Hainaut, accentuating Halle&#x27;s position on the language border.

== Notable buildings ==

* The &quot;Sint-Martinusbasiliek&quot; (Basilica of Saint Martin), also known as the &quot;Gothic Church of Our Lady&quot;, is a basilica in High Gothic style that has been a popular pilgrimage site since the 14th–15th century. The church contains a celebrated miraculous image of the Holy Virgin, that of a Black Madonna.
* The former city hall on the main market square (&quot;Grote Markt&quot;) dates from the Renaissance City Hall.
* The former college of the Jesuits houses a music and dance academy. For a period it had housed the museum described below. 
* The South-West Brabant Museum moved to Den AST in Halle in 2014. Among its holdings are items related to the life and work of Adrien-François Servais and his son-in-law, Polish sculptor Cyprian Godebski. He created the monument to Servais that stands before the town hall.

== Events ==
* Annually at the beginning of Lent, Carnival is celebrated for three days. This is a colourful event, where various groups make floats and costumes or perform dances. The Halle carnival has been organized since 1905 and has grown to be one of the biggest carnivals in Belgium.
* On Easter Monday, the &quot;Sint-Veroonprocessie&quot; takes place. This is a religious procession where the relics of the saint are being carried around the village of Lembeek.
* Halle is the site of a popular pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The present format of this devotion is at least seven centuries old.
* The Hallerbos, the nearby forest named after the town, is known for the prolific bluebell carpet which covers the forest floor for a few weeks each spring, attracting many visitors.

== Notable people ==

* Jozef Cardijn (1882–1967), founder of the Young Christian Workers and cardinal
* Justus Lipsius (1547–1606) wrote his first historical work about Halle.
* Philip II, Duke of Burgundy (1342–1404) died in Halle.
* Adrien-François Servais (1807–1866), composer and cellist. He is commemorated by a statue on Halle&#x27;s main square. It was created by his son-in-law Cyprian Godebski, a noted Polish sculptor who taught at the Institute of Imperial Art in St. Petersburg before the Revolution.
* Koen Wauters (born 1967), singer, television presenter and racing driver

== Notable products ==
* Duivelsbier, a local beer, is now brewed by the Boon Brewery.
* The famous Lambic beer is conjectured to take its name from the village of Lembeek, now part of Halle.
* Halle used to have its own newspaper, named &quot;the future of Halle&quot;. (&quot;l&#x27;Avenir de Hal)&quot;

== International relations ==

*The first three episodes of series 1 were edited together on the DVD in what appeared to be a straight transfer from the video release in the 1980s. &quot;Pâté &amp; Chips&quot; ended with credits for all three episodes plus the original BBC Video ident, however a re-release of series 1 &amp; 2 in 2011 put all three episodes with their start and end credits back on them, on the same re-release the scene from the series 2 episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; which was missing on the original release has been put back into the episode. Over the years there has been a number of edits on DVD releases in all regions with region 1 having certain music edits on the DVD releases. Region 2 DVDs have some edits such as Milburn not appearing in &quot;The Loxley Lozenge&quot; as he did on original transmission and &quot;Uncle of the Bride&quot; and &quot;Big Day at Dream Acres&quot; on the DVD release being only 1 of 3 versions of each episode, &quot;Elegy for Fallen Wellies&quot; on the region 2 DVDs is the alternate version on DVD and not the original transmission version, another episode edited was on the re-release of series 3 &amp; 4 in 2010 when a line was removed from &quot;The Kink in Foggy&#x27;s Niblick&quot; when the lady golfers go walking past Compo and Clegg. Apart from &quot;Elegy for Fallen Wellies&quot; there doesn&#x27;t appear to be much editing on the later releases in region 2. A scene with Milburn and Pearl in the cafe is also cut from the series 8 episode &quot;Catching Digyby&#x27;s Donkey&quot;, which is present on the region 1 DVD release.

<doc id="168335" wikidata="Q296872" url="?curid=168335" title="Barry Gibb">
<text>Sir Barry Alan Crompton Gibb (born 1 September 1946) is a British musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. Along with his younger fraternal twin brothers, Robin and Maurice, he rose to worldwide fame as a member of the Bee Gees, one of the most commercially successful groups in the history of popular music. Gibb is well known for his wide vocal range including a far-reaching high-pitched falsetto. Gibb&#x27;s career has spanned over 70 years.

As a songwriter, he shares with John Lennon and Paul McCartney the record for most consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones, each having six. In total, he has written or co-written sixteen &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones.

In 1994, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with his brothers. In 1997, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of the Bee Gees. In 2007, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked him number 38 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot;. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists him as the second most successful songwriter in history, behind Paul McCartney.

Gibb was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to music and entertainment, and a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music and charity. He was also made an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia on 27 January 2022.

==Early years==
Barry Alan Crompton Gibb was born at Jane Crookall Maternity Home in Douglas, Isle of Man, on 1 September 1946, to Hugh Gibb (15 January 1916 – 6 March 1992), a drummer, and Barbara Gibb ( Pass; 17 November 1920 – 12 August 2016), both Manchester natives. He has English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Gibb&#x27;s grandfather Hugh Gibb Sr. was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1892. He has an older sister, Lesley Evans. His second name, &quot;Alan&quot;, was after his father&#x27;s youngest brother who died in infancy. According to Hugh Gibb, in a mix of fact and fiction, his third name, &quot;Crompton&quot;, was given to honour the Gibbs&#x27; ancestor Sir Isaac Crompton (actually Samuel Crompton).

When Gibb was born, his father was busy as a musician working at various hotels in Douglas, while his mother stayed at home looking after the children. Later, the Gibbs moved to Chapel House on Strang Road. When he was almost two years old, he was badly scalded in an accident involving a hot teapot his mother had just set on the table, which he was able to reach and knock over. He was in Nobles Hospital for about two and a half months. Gibb later commented on that incident:

In 1949, the Gibb family relocated to 50 St. Catherine&#x27;s Drive. Later that year, on 22 December, Gibb&#x27;s two younger brothers Robin and Maurice were born. When the twins were young, the family moved to Smedley Cottage, Spring Valley, also in Douglas.

Gibb started school on 4 September 1951, three days after his fifth birthday, attending Braddan school.
In 1952, the Gibb family relocated to 43 Snaefell Road, Willaston, which became their home for the next two years. The same year, he went to Tynwald Street Infants School. On his seventh birthday in 1953, he went to Desmesne Road Boys School.

==Musical career==
===1955–1966: early performances and songwriting===
In 1955, when the Gibb family moved back to their hometown of Manchester, the brothers formed the skiffle group the Rattlesnakes, consisting of Barry on vocals, lead and slide guitar, Robin and Maurice on vocals and acoustic guitar and friends/neighbours Paul Frost and Kenny Horrocks also providing vocals. By 1957, the Rattlesnakes played songs by Cliff Richard, Paul Anka, Buddy Holly, and the Everly Brothers. Gibb said that their first song played was Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;I Love You, Baby&quot;, however, in 1968, he remembered it as the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot;. The Rattlesnakes&#x27; first professional gig took place on 28 December 1957 in the Gaumont Cinema. Around 1958, Gibb&#x27;s guitar was accidentally broken by Frost, who described the guitar as &quot;broken in the middle&quot;. By May 1958 when the Gibbs moved to Northern Grove it signalled the departure of Frost and Horrocks. The brothers later changed the name of the group to Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats. Under that name, they performed regularly in &quot;Minor 15&quot;, a talent contest for under-fifteens held on Thursday nights from 7:00 to 9:00 pm at Princess Club in Chorlton.

At the beginning of August 1958, the Gibb family set sail for Australia as part of an assisted migration scheme from Southampton on the ship &quot;Fairsea&quot;. Also aboard was Red Symons, future guitarist of Skyhooks, as well as Kylie Minogue&#x27;s parents. The group later made a new group called the Bee Gees. In 1959, the brothers began singing between races at the Redcliffe Speedway to earn money. Their vocal talent brought them to the attention of Bill Gates, a radio deejay. Gates was also interested in Gibb&#x27;s original material including &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; and &quot;(Underneath the) Starlight of Love&quot;. After hearing those songs, Gates asked Gibb for more original material. Gibb quit school in September 1961 and the Gibbs moved to Surfers Paradise. The brothers spent the summers of 1961 and 1962 performing at hotels and clubs in the Gold Coast area. By September 1962, Gibb managed to audition songs to Col Joye. The Gibb family moved to Sydney at the start of 1963.

Around the same time, the Bee Gees were signed to Festival but they were assigned to Leedon. Their first single, &quot;The Battle of the Blue and the Grey&quot; was written by Gibb. All of the Bee Gees&#x27; singles from 1963 to 1966 were written by Gibb. In July 1963, Lonnie Lee, one of Australia&#x27;s top recording stars of the time, recorded what is said to be the first rock and roll recording of a Barry Gibb song. Recorded on Leedon Records and named &quot;I&#x27;d Like To Leave If I May&quot;, radio preferred the flip side. Also between 1963 and 1966, Gibb&#x27;s songs were recorded by numerous other Australian recording artists including Trevor Gordon, Noeleen Batley, Anne Shelton, April Byron, Ronnie Burns and Lori Balmer. One of them is his composition &quot;One Road&quot; which hit No. 2 in Australia New South Wales Chart and No. 32 on the Kent Music Report charts for Jimmy Little in 1964. Another of his compositions, &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Like to Be Alone&quot; by Bryan Davies, reached No. 25 on the New South Wales chart in 1964.

In 1966, Gibb won the annual Radio 5KA award for the best composition of the year, &quot;I Was a Lover, A Leader of Men&quot;.

===1967–1970: return to UK, commercial break-out and worldwide popularity===
The Bee Gees returned to the United Kingdom in early 1967. On 24 February, the group passed a live audition with Robert Stigwood and later signed to Robert Stigwood Organization also the same day that &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; was released by Polydor as a single in the United Kingdom. Stigwood became the manager of the Bee Gees. Colin Petersen, drummer, and Vince Melouney, lead guitarist, later joined the group. The result was their first international LP &quot;Bee Gees&#x27; 1st&quot;. The second single from the album &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; – on which Gibb provided the lead vocal – has become a standard, covered by hundreds of artists consistently throughout the years since.

Around the same time, the Gibb brothers contributed backing vocals on the track &quot;Cowman, Milk Your Cow&quot; a song written by Gibb and Robin sung by singer Adam Faith.

In 1967, Gibb was in The Speakeasy Club, a nightclub in London where he was introduced by Pete Townshend to John Lennon. Lennon was still wearing his outfit for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; photo shoot earlier that day on 30 March 1967; after a couple of scotch and cokes, Townshend said to Gibb, &quot;Do you want to meet John?&quot; and he led Gibb across to a room where Lennon was holding court and Townshend said, &quot;John. This is Barry Gibb, from the group the Bee Gees&quot; to which Lennon replied, &quot;Howyadoin&#x27;&quot;.&quot;So I met John Lennon&#x27;s back&quot;, Gibb says with a laugh, &quot;I didn&#x27;t meet his front&quot;. Gibb earlier said in 2010 about the meeting, &quot;It was virtually a closed club and you went downstairs and there was a coffin and if you were someone they knew and you were supposed to go in, the wall would turn around... and in you would go. There would be [Rolling] Stones lying around all over the place. It was one of those days when I met John Lennon – from the back. It was Pete Townshend who introduced me... [Lennon said], &#x27;Pleased to meet you&#x27;, and he carried on talking to his guest.&quot;

After many stresses on their personal and professional lives, both Barry and Robin collapsed from nervous exhaustion on a flight from Australia to Turkey in 1967. On 23 December 1967, Barry and Robin left England for Australia. As Gibb explained: &quot;But due to time difference we arrived on Christmas Day, we missed Christmas Eve altogether!&quot;. The pair celebrated Christmas with their manager Robert Stigwood&#x27;s family as Gibb said: &quot;We went on to Sydney&quot;.
At the end of 1967, fame was taking its toll and the group were at odds with each other. At the start of 1968, the Gibbs were vying for influence in determining the musical direction of the group, creating tension in the studio and on stage. Also in 1968, to promote &quot;Horizontal&quot; the group made their first appearance on U.S. television on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; as well as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The group later filmed a TV special &quot;Frankie Howerd Meets the Bee Gees&quot; with Frankie Howerd. His 1968 composition &quot;Only One Woman&quot; (UK No. 5) was the Marbles&#x27; most successful single up to date. The Bee Gees were invited by Hollywood manager Lee Hazlewood at his party alongside the members of the Monkees and Honey Ltd. The photos from that event were leaked, and two of the pictures showing Gibb was talking to actress Angela Cartwright, and the other, is Gibb who was shown playing guitar and the members of Honey Ltd. sing along.

In 1969, the Bee Gees released &quot;First of May&quot; as the A-side, with the flip side being &quot;Lamplight&quot; on which Robin sang the lead. Robert Stigwood chose &quot;First of May&quot; to be the A-side. No other songs were released from the album &quot;Odessa&quot;. Shortly after Robin announced his solo plans, the Bee Gees released their first single without him, &quot;Tomorrow Tomorrow&quot;. Barry also worked with Samantha Sang, co-writing and producing two songs &quot;The Love of a Woman&quot; and the B-side &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Happen Again&quot; released on Parlophone. He also produced songs for P.P. Arnold including &quot;Bury Me Down By the River&quot; (released as a single) which were originally recorded by the Bee Gees for their 1970 album. In the summer of 1969, Petersen left the group which now only featured Barry and Maurice as the Bee Gees. Pentangle drummer Terry Cox replaced Petersen to complete another 12 songs, but only five songs were released in the album.

The film &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot;, featuring only two Bee Gees after originally including Petersen, aired on BBC2 on 26 December 1970. When the group announced that they had split at the start of December 1969, Gibb spent January 1970 writing songs to record the following month.

===1970: debut as a solo artist===
In February 1970, he started to record his first solo album, &quot;The Kid&#x27;s No Good&quot;; he released his first solo single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Kiss Your Memory&quot;, but the rest of the songs that were supposed to be on the album were never released and only appeared in bootlegs. &quot;I&#x27;ll Kiss Your Memory&quot; did not chart in either the U.K. or U.S. but reached No. 16 in Netherlands in five weeks. Another country ballad, &quot;This Time&quot;, was chosen as the B-side. Bruce Eder of AllMusic stated that the songs on &quot;The Kid&#x27;s No Good&quot; were of country and sentimental numbers.

In April 1970 the album &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; was released four months after the break-up, featuring only Barry and Maurice, as Robin was working on his solo career. For the first time as a solo artist, he appeared on the panel of judges and performed &quot;One Bad Thing&quot; and &quot;The Day Your Eyes Meet Mine&quot; on &quot;Miss Teen Princess of the World&quot; pageant in Germany in June, his reaction was &quot;I&#x27;ve not appeared on stage for at least a year and three months, and I really miss people&quot;. In July 1970, Gibb travelled to Australia to act as compere for &quot;Go-Set&quot;, and on that occasion, he gave an interview on the magazine which revealed that sixteen months after the Bee Gees&#x27; break-up, he was still not ready to argue with his brothers, &quot;Obviously, we&#x27;re still brothers, but we are no longer as a group&quot;.

He considered the song &quot;One Bad Thing&quot; for the second single from his debut album. Atco pressed some copies of it in August 1970 with &quot;The Day Your Eyes Meet Mine&quot; as the B-side. It was distributed to radio stations in Canada and elsewhere, but it was decided to focus on the Bee Gees&#x27; reunion single, &quot;Lonely Days&quot;, released around August. While Polydor planned to release &quot;One Bad Thing&quot; by 2 October in territories outside North America and Canada. Gibb claimed that not only had he been focusing on writing and recording songs, but he had still hoped to be an actor, &quot;I have already had offers to play different parts but, without appearing swell headed, I haven&#x27;t found the right part yet&quot;. &quot;One Bad Thing&quot; was later given by Gibb to his friend Ronnie Burns, a singer from Australia, and later released it as a single on Festival Records.
===1970–1974: Bee Gees&#x27; reunion===
In August 1970, the Bee Gees reunited and recorded together again, writing &quot;Lonely Days&quot; and &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; at their first reunion session.

In 1971, the group released &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, which was their first American No. 1 hit. In October 1971, Gibb recorded three songs for the &quot;Barry Gibb Fan Club&quot;. One of the songs, &quot;King Kathy&quot;, was released as a single on Lyntone Records. Gibb had remained a constant creative force for the group and, by 1972, had set aside the idea of a parallel solo career and was ready to devote full attention to the band. &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; was the last album recorded fully at IBC Studios and their last album arranged by Bill Shepherd who had worked with the group since 1964. Also in 1972, Gibb moved to Los Angeles to record in the Record Plant studio. In 1973, the Bee Gees moved to Robert Stigwood&#x27;s RSO Records and released their first singles for Stigwood, &quot;Saw a New Morning&quot; and &quot;Life in a Tin Can&quot;. Stigwood was not ready to give up on the group, but he did not believe in the musical direction they were taking. At the suggestion of Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records, Stigwood sent them to work with Atlantic producer and arranger Arif Mardin who produced the next Bee Gees album in 1974. After a United States tour early in 1974, the group started to perform at small clubs in England.

===1975–1980: big success for disco works===
At the start of 1975, the group moved to Miami at the suggestion of Eric Clapton to work on their new album with R&amp;B producer Arif Mardin in Criteria Studios. The first song featuring Gibb&#x27;s falsetto was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;. In 1976, Gibb wrote &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot;, his brother Andy Gibb&#x27;s first US No. 1, and provided backup vocals.

During 1976, Gibb met with Vince Melouney and wrote two songs, &quot;Let It Ride&quot; and &quot;Morning Rain&quot;, that were never recorded. In November 1977, the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was released and its soundtrack became the best-selling soundtrack of all time. During 1977, Gibb co-wrote &quot;Emotion&quot;, the song remains Samantha Sang&#x27;s best-known hit. Gibb and Galuten wrote &quot;Save Me, Save Me&quot; originally recorded by the group Network and later covered by Frankie Valli, Dusty Springfield, Rare Earth, and Teri DeSario. The film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, featuring Gibb as Mark Henderson was shown in July 1978. Between December 1977 and September 1978, seven songs Barry wrote would reach No. 1 in United States. Andy&#x27;s third single, &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;, which was credited to all four Gibb brothers, was also a US No. 1 single. In 1978, Gibb wrote a title song to order for their manager Robert Stigwood&#x27;s film and stage musical &quot;Grease&quot; and was later recorded by singer Frankie Valli and reached No. 1 in the US. The song contains guitar work by Peter Frampton. In February 1978, he provided background vocals for his composition &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Gonna Keep Me From You&quot; which featured Teri DeSario on vocals.

After the Bee Gees&#x27; successful 1979 Spirits Having Flown Tour to promote the album of the same name, he wrote, produced, and sang on almost all of the songs on Andy Gibb&#x27;s final album, &quot;After Dark&quot;, released at the start of 1980.

===1980–1983: producer for other artists===
In September 1980, Gibb produced the three new songs on Andy Gibb&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Andy Gibb&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. In October 1980, Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Guilty&quot; was released, produced by the Gibb-Galuten-Richardson team. the lead off single, Woman In Love was released in August and within 5 weeks was #1 on the US charts. The two songs of which were vocal duets between Streisand and Gibb are &quot;Guilty&quot; a U.S. Top 5, and &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot; also reached the Top 10 in the U.S. and reached No. 1 on the US Adult contemporary chart. In 1981, the Bee Gees released &quot;Living Eyes&quot;. Songs from the album were not disco and the album was not a commercial success. In 1982, Clive Davis asked Gibb to write for Dionne Warwick, who was on his Arista label. Barry produced Warwick&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. The songs were all written by Gibb except &quot;Our Day Will Come&quot;. In August 1983, after Gibb met Kenny Rogers who asked for some songs, Gibb recorded his first demo for Rogers entitled &quot;Eyes That See in the Dark&quot;. At that time, Robin was working on his &quot;How Old Are You?&quot; album with Maurice playing instruments. The other songs intended for Kenny Rogers were written in late 1982, then at the start of 1983, Barry continued to record the demos until April 1983, while also recording songs with the Bee Gees for the film &quot;Staying Alive&quot;. In August 1983, he produced Rogers&#x27; new album &quot;Eyes That See in the Dark&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; by Rogers and Dolly Parton which became one of the best-selling singles in country music.

===1983–1986: break from the Bee Gees and switch to solo projects===
In August 1983, Irving Azoff signed Gibb to the MCA Records for North America. Gibb was signed for a few million dollars to a multi-album deal. Polydor still had rights to Gibb&#x27;s songs outside North America. In September 1984, his album &quot;Now Voyager&quot; was released. Two singles from the album included &quot;Shine, Shine&quot;, a US Top 40 single that reached the Top 10 in their Adult contemporary charts, and &quot;Fine Line&quot; which was less successful, only reaching No. 50 on the dance charts. The film &quot;Now Voyager&quot; starring Gibb was directed by Storm Thorgerson, in which Gibb is the protagonist, with actor Michael Hordern as his guide through a confusing world between life and death. The film includes a music video on most of the songs on &quot;Now Voyager&quot;. A video for &quot;Fine Line&quot; featuring Gibb without his trademark beard and was filmed in black and white.

In 1985, Gibb started to record demos for Diana Ross, for her album &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;. In the same year, he co-wrote most of the songs on Robin Gibb&#x27;s album &quot;Walls Have Eyes&quot;.

In late 1985 and early 1986, he wrote new songs for his next album, though his third album &quot;Moonlight Madness&quot; was not released and most of the songs on that album was later released in 1988. Producer Randy Jackson plays bass on all of the tracks. Gibb co-wrote three songs for Swedish singer Carola on her album &quot;Runaway&quot;. Also in 1985, he joined the short-lived supergroup the Bunburys with David English.

===1987–2002: later activity===
In early 1987, the Bee Gees started to record their first album in six years. In June and July 1987, Gibb and Maurice produced Andy Gibb&#x27;s four new songs; one of them is &quot;Arrow Through the Heart&quot; which was released in 2010. In 1987, Gibb co-wrote &quot;Up the Revolution&quot; by Elton John. And in 1988, Gibb recorded two new songs for the &quot;Hawks&quot; film. In September 1988, the film soundtrack of the film was released by Polydor only in the U.K. The songs were all performed by Gibb except &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (Diana Ross). The single from the soundtrack, &quot;Childhood Days&quot;, reached only No. 60 in Germany.

Around 1990, the Bee Gees recorded &quot;High Civilization&quot;. In September 1990, Gibb played guitar and produced &quot;Born to Be Loved by You&quot; by Kelli Wolfe, which was released as an unreleased B-side in August 1993. Around 1992, Gibb played guitar on Lulu&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Wake Up in Your Arms&quot;, released in 1993. In 1993, the Bee Gees recorded and released &quot;Size Isn&#x27;t Everything&quot;. In 1994, the Bee Gees and Polydor planned a tour to promote &quot;Size Isn&#x27;t Everything&quot;, but it was off in February, due to Gibb&#x27;s trouble with arthritis in the back, right hand and right knee. Gibb co-wrote &quot;I Will Be There&quot;, which was recorded as a demo for Tina Turner and released on Turner&#x27;s album &quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot;. In 2001, Gibb co-wrote &quot;I Cannot Give You My Love&quot; with Ashley Gibb, which was intended for Cliff Richard. In September 2001, the Bee Gees re-recorded &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;. However, this session featured only Robin and Maurice; Barry did not participate in the session, held at Middle Ear Studios in Miami Beach, Florida. In 2002, Gibb and Michael Jackson recorded &quot;All in Your Name&quot;. Also in 2002, Gibb sings background vocals on Michael Bublé&#x27;s version of the 1971 song &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;.

===2003–2012: Maurice&#x27;s death and semi-retirement of the Bee Gees===
Maurice died suddenly on 12 January 2003. Ten months later, in November of that year, Gibb produced and contributed background vocals and guitar to two songs performed by Cliff Richard, &quot;I Cannot Give You My Love&quot; and &quot;How Many Sleeps?&quot;; Maurice&#x27;s keyboard work from a 2001 demo version was included in this 2003 version. On 2 May 2004, Barry and Robin Gibb received the CBE award at Buckingham Palace; their nephew Adam accepted his father Maurice&#x27;s posthumous award. Also in 2004, Gibb co-wrote and sang background vocals on his son Steve Gibb&#x27;s solo single &quot;Living in the Rain&quot;. In January 2005, along with many artists, Gibb and his brother Robin recorded vocal parts for the charity single &quot;Grief Never Grows Old&quot; on behalf of victims of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. In April and May 2005, Barbra Streisand recorded songs for her new album produced by Gibb. In August 2006, two Gibb singles, &quot;Doctor Mann&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot;, were released on iTunes. &quot;Underworld&quot; was featured on the film soundtrack of &quot;Arctic Tale&quot; but not in the film. On 7 December 2006, Gibb joined 4,500 other musicians in a full-page advertisement in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; newspaper, calling for the British Government to extend the existing 50-year copyright protection of sound recordings in the United Kingdom. The fair play for musicians advertisement proposed that the copyright be extended to the American standard of 95 years and was a direct response to the Gowers Review (published by the British Government on 6 December 2006), which recommended the retention of the 50-year protection for sound recordings.

In 2007, &quot;Drown On the River&quot; was released as a single on iTunes. The song later appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;Deal&quot;. Also in the same year, Gibb sang background vocals on Jamie Jo&#x27;s song &quot;U Turn Me On&quot; and wrote the theme music for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Grease Is the Word&quot;. Gibb also appeared as a mentor in season six of &quot;American Idol&quot;. 

On 14 March 2009, Gibb teamed with Olivia Newton-John to present the one-hour finale performance at a star-studded 12-hour live concert at Sydney&#x27;s Sydney Cricket Ground, part of Sound Relief, a fundraiser to aid victims of the February 2009 Victorian Bushfires that devastated large tracts of heavily wooded and populated south-eastern Australia, where the Gibb family once lived. The concert was televised live nationally across Australia on the Max TV cable network. On 10 July 2009, Gibb was made a Freeman of the Borough of Douglas (Isle of Man). The award was also bestowed upon his brother Robin and posthumously upon his brother Maurice. In late 2009, Barry and Robin announced plans to record and perform together once again as the Bee Gees.

In 2010, Gibb withdrew from a planned appearance on the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot; which was released in March. In December 2011, his two songs, &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girl&quot; were released. On 21 February 2012, Gibb performed his first solo concert in the U.S. at the Seminole Hard Rock Cafe in Florida. He sang &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; with Maurice&#x27;s daughter, Samantha Gibb, who is a singer in her own band. Barry&#x27;s son Steve was also on stage as lead guitarist and sang a Maurice composition, &quot;On Time&quot;. On 20 May 2012, Robin Gibb died, making Barry the sole surviving Gibb brother.

===2012–present===
Gibb made his debut performance at the Grand Ole Opry on 27 July 2012, performing three songs with Ricky Skaggs. Skaggs later recorded &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Son&quot; on which Gibb added vocals for Skaggs&#x27; album &quot;Music to My Ears&quot; released in 2012.

He commenced a world tour in 2013 in Australia called Mythology Tour, featuring the Bee Gees anthology set album of the same name. He was joined on stage by his son Steve and Maurice&#x27;s daughter Samantha. On that tour, for the first time on stage, Gibb performed &quot;Playdown&quot; (1966), &quot;Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You&quot; (1967), &quot;I Started a Joke&quot; (1969) and &quot;With the Sun in My Eyes&quot; (1968). Also, for the first time, the music video of the Bee Gees&#x27; 2001 song &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, written by Gibb, was shown before the show began. This short tour inspired Festival Records to release a box set of the Bee Gees&#x27; three Australian albums, &quot;The Festival Albums Collection, 1965–1967&quot;, and a &#x27;best of&#x27; compilation of the group&#x27;s Australian era songs titled &quot;Morning of My Life&quot;.

On 28 January, Gibb was interviewed by CNN about his brothers and, in that same interview, Gibb talked about Justin Bieber, saying he is &quot;heading for a brick wall&quot;. In a &quot;Mirror&quot; interview with Gibb on 11 July 2014 he said he was still mourning following the death of Robin and credits his wife Linda, and Paul McCartney for helping him to recover. Gibb appeared on a McCartney tribute album, &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot;, released on 18 November 2014 performing &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;. Gibb&#x27;s friend, country singer TG Sheppard, said in an interview with Gary James that Gibb just moved to Nashville and was going into country music.

On 8 February 2015 at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Gibb, along with the group Pentatonix, presented the category of Best Pop Vocal Album. On 26 March 2015, Gibb was one of the headlining acts on a music festival called the Hard Rock Rising Miami Beach Global Music Festival alongside Andrea Bocelli, Gloria Estefan, Flo Rida, Jon Secada and Wyclef Jean.

On 26 June 2016, Gibb was scheduled to perform the &quot;legend&quot; spot at the Glastonbury Festival in England, but pulled out due to a family illness. He did, however, appear with Coldplay as a guest performer singing &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; and &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;.

On 28 June 2016, it was announced that Gibb had signed to Columbia Records and would release his second solo album, &quot;In the Now&quot;, on 7 October 2016. The album was Gibb&#x27;s first album with all new material since the Bee Gees&#x27; final studio album, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; (2001). &quot;In the Now&quot; was co-written by his sons Stephen and Ashley and produced with John Merchant.

On 25 June 2017, Gibb performed the &quot;legend&quot; spot at the Glastonbury Festival in England. He had joined Coldplay on stage during the same festival in 2016.

On 6 November 2020, Gibb announced his latest album entitled &quot;Greenfields&quot; which is a duets album featuring country artists Dolly Parton, Little Big Town, Alison Krauss and others. The album contains 11 Bee Gees tracks and one unreleased Gibb track, re-imagined as country songs. The song &quot;Words of a Fool&quot; featuring Jason Isbell was released the same day as a preview. The song was originally written by Gibb in 1986 for an unreleased album.
Barry was honored at the 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors in December 2023. In 2024, Gibb focused his attention on pre-production of the planned Bee Gees bio pic, serving as executive producer.

==Personal life==
Gibb&#x27;s first marriage was to Maureen Bates, whom he married on 22 August 1966 when he was 19 years old. The couple lived together for only a short time and were divorced in July 1970.

During the taping of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in London, Gibb met the former Miss Edinburgh, Linda Gray. On 1 September 1970 (his 24th birthday), they were married. Together, they have five children – Stephen (born 1973), Ashley (born 1977), Travis (born 1981), Michael (born 1984) and Alexandra (born 1991) – and seven grandchildren. Gibb and his wife became U.S. citizens in 2009, while retaining their UK citizenship.

In his 11 July 2014 interview with &quot;The Mirror&quot;, Gibb said he became friends with Michael Jackson: &quot;He would come to Miami and stay in our house. He&#x27;d sit in the kitchen and watch the fans outside his hotel on TV, just giggling – &#x27;Hee hee!&#x27; He lived upstairs for a while, right before his child-molestation trial. We never discussed the case. We would just sit around and write and get drunk. Michael liked wine – there were a few nights when he just went to sleep on the floor&quot;, adding that he misses Jackson.

Gibb owns a home in the UK, but has lived primarily in Miami since 1974. In January 2006, Gibb purchased the former home of the late country singers Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in Hendersonville, Tennessee, US intending to restore it and turn it into a songwriting retreat. The house was destroyed by fire on 10 April 2007 while under renovation, and a new house was built. The property was sold in 2014.

On 10 July 2009, Gibb was made a Freeman of the Borough of Douglas (Isle of Man). The award was also bestowed upon his brother Robin and posthumously upon his brother Maurice.

==Influences==
Gibb&#x27;s influences when he was in the Rattlesnakes were Tommy Steele, the Mills Brothers, the Everly Brothers, Paul Anka, and Cliff Richard. The Bee Gees acknowledged that they would sing in the style of the Everlys and then add a third harmony; the result was &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot; (1967). When Gibb heard Roy Orbison&#x27;s song &quot;Crying&quot;, he said: &quot;That was it. To me that was the voice of God.&quot;

Gibb also praises the vocal skills of Frankie Valli as one of his influences: &quot;Frankie Valli has become one of the hallmark voices of our generation. He created a style that we all still strive to emulate.&quot; Gibb was also influenced by country music as his songs on the 1970 unreleased &quot;The Kid&#x27;s No Good&quot; show: &quot;Country music always inspired us. I love Nashville and I love this music. Since my brothers passed, I&#x27;ve been able to be self-indulgent. I&#x27;ve been able to go where I love the music&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2007 Gibb was ranked by &quot;Q&quot; magazine at No. 38 on its list of &#x27;100 Greatest Singers&#x27;.

Gibb had a highly successful career as a member of the Bee Gees, a group near the top of the all-time top-sellers list. When the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, their citation read &#x27;Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.&#x27; The trio&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; pushed the film&#x27;s soundtrack past the 50 million mark in sales. It reigned as the top-selling album until Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. They are the only group in pop history to write, produce and record six straight No. 1 hits.

===Grammy awards===
Between his work with the Bee Gees, as an individual artist, and as songwriter/producer, Gibb has six Grammy wins from 15 nominations, plus two honorary Grammy awards.

The three Gibb brothers were appointed Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2002. On 2 May 2004, Barry and Robin received their awards at Buckingham Palace, along with their nephew Adam, who collected the award on behalf of his father Maurice, who had died in January 2003.
Gibb was also awarded a knighthood in the 2018 New Year Honours. He was also made an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia on 27 January 2022 in the 2022 Special Honours for eminent service to the performing arts as a musician, songwriter and record producer, to the advancement of Australian music artists and to philanthropy. In 2023, He became a Kennedy Center Honoree for contributions to American culture &amp; for being a &quot;pop music pioneer&quot;.

Gibb is also a prolific and successful songwriter and a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. In 1977, Gibb saw five of his songs simultaneously enter the Top Ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and, for one week in March, four of the top five songs were written by him. His songs were No. 1 for 27 out of 37 weeks from 24 December 1977 to 2 September 1978. Gibb also holds a very unusual record, in that he is the only songwriter in history to write four successive US No. 1 hits: in 1978, the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; was replaced at number one by Andy&#x27;s single, &quot;Love Is Thicker Than Water&quot;, followed by the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Night Fever&quot; for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by the Bee Gee&#x27;s &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;, recorded by Yvonne Elliman. He is the only male artist to have 10 songs on the 600 biggest songs of the Hot 100 Billboard in its history, having co-written, co-produced or performed them.

As a songwriter, Gibb has had No. 1 songs in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, when &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; became No. 1 in the UK as the Comic Relief single for 2009. His compositions for the Bee Gees have been recorded by numerous artists, including José Feliciano, Celine Dion, Al Green, Wyclef Jean, Janis Joplin, Jimmy Little, Barry Manilow, Olivia Newton-John, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross, Nina Simone, Barbra Streisand, Samantha Sang, Tina Turner, Conway Twitty, Frankie Valli, Luther Vandross, Sarah Vaughan, Jennifer Warnes, Dionne Warwick and Andy Williams. Australian musician David Campbell, praising Gibb, compared the Beach Boys and the Bee Gees: &#x27;And like Brian Wilson, Barry Gibb&#x27;s melodies made the songs timeless.&#x27;

Gibb&#x27;s solo songs have been recorded by number of artists, including Lou Reizner, Samantha Sang, P. P. Arnold, Ronnie Burns, Jerry Vale and many others. As a record producer, Gibb produced albums for Andy Gibb, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Kenny Rogers, and Diana Ross.

<text>Mark Wallinger (born 25 May 1959) is an English artist. Having previously been nominated for the Turner Prize in 1995, he won in 2007 for his installation &quot;State Britain&quot;. His work &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; (1999–2000) was the first piece to occupy the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. He represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2001. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (2013), a permanent commission for Art on the Underground, was created to celebrate 150 years of the London Underground. In 2018, the permanent work &quot;Writ in Water&quot; was realized for the National Trust to celebrate where Magna Carta was signed at Runnymede.

== Life and career ==

=== Education and artistic career ===

Wallinger was born in Chigwell, Essex, on 25 May 1959. He trained at the Chelsea School of Art in London, from 1978 to 1981, before studying for an MA from Goldsmiths, University of London from 1983 to 1985. After graduating in 1985, most of his degree show was exhibited by the Anthony Reynolds Gallery, and he continued to teach part-time at Goldsmiths.

=== Awards ===
In 1998, Wallinger won the Henry Moore Fellowship, British School at Rome, an award offered to outstanding scholars and artists with the opportunity to work in Rome for 3 to 12 months. In 2001, Wallinger was honored with the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program, one of the world&#x27;s most respected artist-in-residence programmes for established artists working in the fine arts, film, literature and music. The following year he received an Honorary Fellowship from the London Institute.

In 2003, Wallinger was the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Central England in Birmingham, UK. In 2007, he was awarded the Turner Prize. In 2009, Goldsmith College honoured Wallinger for his achievements which reflect the values important to the Goldsmiths community. In the same year Wallinger’s design was selected from a three-strong shortlist for the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project Commission. In 2010, he presented &quot;Sinema Amnesia&quot; in Çanakkale as part of “My City”, a project which invited five artists from five European countries to produce installations in different Turkish cities.

As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Mark Wallinger&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; work was elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.

In 2019, &quot;Writ in Water&quot;, a major architectural artwork by Mark Wallinger, in collaboration with Studio Octopi, for the National Trust at Runnymede, Surrey, was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize. In the same year, the project won the RIBA South East Award, the RIBA National Award, the Civic Trust Awards Commendation, MacEwen Award Shortlisting and EUMies Award Nomination, and the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Fountains or Water features by The Public Statues and Sculptures Association in 2021.

== Turner Prize ==
Mark Wallinger was awarded the 2007 Turner Prize for &quot;State Britain&quot;, a direct meticulous replica and reconstruction of Brian Haw’s protest peace camp outside the Houses of Parliament against policies towards Iraq. The installation occupied the entire length of Tate Britain’s Duveen Galleries, consisting of more than 600 banners, flags, teddy bears, peace signs, Haw’s tarpaulin shelter, and other materials amassed by Haw over his years of protest. The original display consisted of donations from the public, including paintings, banners and toys. This had been confiscated by the police under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. He also put a black line on the floor of the Tate and through the middle of his exhibit to mark part of a 1 kilometre exclusion zone from Parliament Square. The jury applauded the work for its “immediacy, visceral intensity and historic importance” integrating “a bold political statement with art’s ability to articulate fundamental human truths”. The art historian Yve-Alain Bois described &quot;State Britain&quot; as “one of the most remarkable political works of art ever”.

On speaking to the BBC about the award, Wallinger added, &quot;I am indebted to all those people who contributed to the making of &quot;State Britain&quot;. Brian Haw is a remarkable man who has waged a tireless campaign against the folly and hubris of our government’s foreign policy. For six-and-a-half years he has remained steadfast in Parliament Square, the last dissenting voice in Britain. Bring home the troops, give us back our rights, trust the people.&quot;

In 2011 the artwork was exhibited for the first time in the Netherlands at the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art.

== Venice Biennale ==
In 2001, the British Council revealed that they had selected Mark Wallinger to produce a solo show of new and past artworks for the British Pavilion at the 49th Venice Biennale. The show included sculpture, video, painting, and photography.

Wallinger presented the site-specific work, &quot;Facade&quot; (2001), which wrapped the front of the British Pavilion with an identical size replica colour photograph of the Pavilion itself printed on vinyl-coated material attached from scaffolding. In front of the pavilion &quot;Oxymoron&quot; (1996) was flying from a flagpole, a flag with the British Union Jack replaced by green and orange of the Irish flag colours. In addition to &quot;Angel&quot; (1997), &quot;Threshold to the Kingdom&quot; (2000), &quot;Life Class&quot; (2001), &quot;Ghost&quot; (2001), and &quot;Time and Relative Dimensions in Space&quot; (2001), the sculpture &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; (1999-2000), first presented on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, in 2000, welcomed visitors into the main gallery.

&quot;Ghost&quot; (2001) continued with Wallinger’s fixation and exploration of British horse racing traditions. It consisted of a negative reproduction image in a lightbox showing the famous 18th-century oil painting, &quot;Whistlejacket&quot; (c.1762) by George Stubbs, but altered by adding a horn on its head, thus turning it into a unicorn. In contrast, &quot;Time and Relative Dimensions in Space&quot; (2001) referred to the space-traveling machine from the British show Doctor Who. Recreated especially for the biennale, Wallinger delivered a reflective mirrored replica of the famous police box. 

== Later work ==
Wallinger&#x27;s later work appears to have largely turned away from his earlier preoccupations, instead apparently focusing on religion and death and the influence of William Blake. &quot;Angel&quot; is a video played in reverse showing the artist walking backwards at the bottom of the down escalator at Angel Underground Station while reciting the opening lines of the Gospel of John in the King James Bible. At the conclusion of the video the music of &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; that forms part of the British Coronation ceremony can be heard as Wallinger &#x27;ascends&#x27; up the stairs. &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, a show at the Whitechapel Gallery included several works on these subjects. &quot;Threshold to the Kingdom&quot; (2000), for example, is a slow motion video of people coming through automatic double doors at international arrivals at an airport. The video is accompanied by a recording of the famous &quot;Miserere&quot; by Gregorio Allegri. Wallinger has said that the title might be taken as a double meaning: arrival at the United Kingdom, but also at the kingdom of heaven, with a security guard playing the part of St. Peter.

The largest work in the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; show was &quot;Prometheus&quot;. This piece is in two parts – on the outside, in a dark corridor, is a video of Wallinger (or rather his alter-ego, &quot;Blind Faith&quot;) sitting in an electric chair and singing Ariel&#x27;s song from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. From the corridor, automatic double doors give access to a brightly lit room which has an electric chair bolted to one of the walls, giving a top-down &quot;God&#x27;s-eye view&quot; of it. On two facing walls are large photos of fists with the words &quot;LOVE&quot; and &quot;HATE&quot; written on them, a reference to the preacher played by Robert Mitchum in the film, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, who had similar tattoos on his knuckles. A circular steel loop gives out a continuous buzzing sound.

&quot;Ecce Homo&quot; was the first work to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. This work is a life-sized statue of a Christ figure, naked apart from a loin cloth, and with his hands bound behind his back. He wears a crown of barbed wire. The sculpture was placed at the very front edge of the massive plinth, emphasising its vulnerability and relative smallness. It was quite popular with the public and was later shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, where Wallinger was Britain&#x27;s representative.

He was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project in January 2008, and in February 2009 it was announced that his design had won the competition. Wallinger&#x27;s design is of a giant white horse modelled on another of his own racehorses, &#x27;Riviera Red&#x27;, and has been described by his supporters as &quot;an absolutely mesmerising conflation of old England and new, of the semi-mythical, Tolkienesque past and the six-lanes, all-crawling present&quot;.

He curated the exhibition &quot;The Russian Linesman: Frontiers, Borders and Thresholds&quot; at the Hayward Gallery in London, which lasted from February to May 2009.

In April 2011, it was announced that Mark Wallinger would be one of three artists (along with Chris Ofili and Conrad Shawcross) to collaborate with the Royal Ballet and the National Gallery to create a piece based on works by the Renaissance painter Titian. &quot;Titian Metamorphosis&quot;, which documented the entire project from conception to finished performances, was published by London-based publisher Art / Books in two editions in January 2013.

In February 2013, it was announced that Wallinger had created &quot;Labyrinth&quot; a set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every London tube station, to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground; each will be numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge. In October 2014, Art / Books published &quot;Labyrinth: A Journey Through London&#x27;s Underground by Mark Wallinger&quot;, a comprehensive photographic book of all 270 labyrinth designs in situ in the Underground stations.

In 2019 Wallinger displayed his sculpture entitled The World Turned Upside Down at the London School of Economics. The artwork attracted controversy for showing the island of Taiwan as a sovereign entity, rather than as part of the People’s Republic of China. After dueling protests by students from both the PRC and ROC and reactions by third party observers (which included the President of Taiwan, Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the co-chairs of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group in the House of Commons) the university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which chromatically displayed the PRC and ROC as different entities but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution&#x27;s position regarding the controversy.

In October 2019, Wallinger featured in a group show at Tension Fine Art alongside artists Julian Lowe and Stuart Elliot. The show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Tell By Looking&quot; was curated by Kate Love.

<doc id="168340" wikidata="Q899944" url="?curid=168340" title="Sewage sludge">
<text>Sewage sludge is the residual, semi-solid material that is produced as a by-product during sewage treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater. The term &quot;septage&quot; also refers to sludge from simple wastewater treatment but is connected to simple on-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks.

After treatment, and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced (for example with regards to heavy metal content), sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills, dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties, as pioneered by the product Milorganite.

The term &quot;Biosolids&quot; is often used as an alternative to the term sewage sludge in the United States, particularly in conjunction with reuse of sewage sludge as fertilizer after sewage sludge treatment. Biosolids can be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after stabilization processes such as anaerobic digestion and composting. Opponents of sewage sludge reuse reject this term as a public relations term.

==Treatment process==
Sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater. Sewage sludge is produced from the treatment of wastewater in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms — raw primary sludge and secondary sludge, also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process.

Sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps: lime stabilization, thickening, dewatering, drying, anaerobic digestion or composting. Some treatment processes, such as composting and alkaline stabilization, that involve significant amendments may affect contaminant strength and concentration: depending on the process and the contaminant in question, treatment may decrease or in some cases increase the bioavailability and/or solubility of contaminants. Regarding sludge stabilization processes, anaerobic and aerobic digestion seem to be the most common used methods in EU-27.

When fresh sewage or wastewater enters a primary settling tank, approximately 50% of the suspended solid matter will settle out in an hour and a half. This collection of solids is known as raw sludge or primary solids and is said to be &quot;fresh&quot; before anaerobic processes become active. The sludge will become putrescent in a short time once anaerobic bacteria take over, and must be removed from the sedimentation tank before this happens.

This is accomplished in one of two ways. Most commonly, the fresh sludge is continuously extracted from the bottom of a hopper-shaped tank by mechanical scrapers and passed to separate sludge-digestion tanks. In some treatment plants an Imhoff tank is used: sludge settles through a slot into the lower story or digestion chamber, where it is decomposed by anaerobic bacteria, resulting in liquefaction and reduced volume of the sludge. The secondary treatment process also generates a sludge largely composed of bacteria and protozoa with entrained fine solids, and this is removed by settlement in secondary settlement tanks. Both sludge streams are typically combined and are processed by anaerobic or aerobic treatment process at either elevated or ambient temperatures. After digesting for an extended period, the result is called &quot;digested&quot; sludge and may be disposed of by drying and then landfilling.

Following treatment, sewage sludge is either landfilled, dumped in the ocean, incinerated, applied on agricultural land or, in some cases, retailed or given away for free to the general public. According to a review article published in 2012, sludge reuse (including direct agricultural application and composting) was the predominant choice for sludge management in EU-15 (53% of produced sludge), following by incineration (21% of produced sludge). On the other hand, the most common disposal method in EU-12 countries was landfilling.
== Quantities produced ==
The amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks (if they are part of the process configuration) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110–170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70–100 kg/ML of waste activated sludge, and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60–100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180–270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge.

United States municipal wastewater treatment plants in 1997 produced about 7.7 million dry tons of sewage sludge, and about 6.8 million dry tons in 1998 according to EPA estimates. As of 2004, about 60% of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops. In a review article published in 2012, it was reported that a total amount of 10.1 million tn DS/year were produced in EU-27 countries. As of 2023, the EU produced 2 to 3 million tons of sludge each year. Worldwide it is estimated that as much as 75 Million Mg of dry sewage sludge per year.

Production of sewage sludge can be reduced by conversion from flush toilets to dry toilets such as urine-diverting dry toilets and composting toilets.

== Disposal ==

===Landfill===
Sewage sludge deposition in landfills can circulate human-virulent species of &quot;Cryptosporidium and Giardia&quot; pathogens. Sonication and quicklime stabilization are most effective in inactivation of these pathogens; microwave energy disintegration and top-soil stabilization were less effective.
A Texas county has launched a first-of-its-kind criminal investigation into waste management giant Synagro over PFAS-contaminated sewage sludge it is selling to Texas farmers as a cheap alternative to fertilizer.

As of 2023, 11% of sludge produced in the EU was disposed of in landfills. The EU is attempting to phase out the disposal of sludge in landfills.

===Ocean dumping===
It used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean, however, this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties. Ronald Reagan signed the law that prohibited ocean dumping as a means of disposal of sewage sludge in the US in 1988.

=== Incineration ===
Sludge can also be incinerated in sludge incineration plants which comes with its own set of environmental concerns (air pollution, disposal of the ash). Pyrolysis of the sludge to create syngas and potentially biochar is possible, as is combustion of biofuel produced from drying sewage sludge or incineration in a waste-to-energy facility for direct production of electricity and steam for district heating or industrial uses.

Thermal processes can greatly reduce the volume of the sludge, as well as achieve remediation of all or some of the biological concerns. Direct waste-to-energy incineration and complete combustion systems (such as the Gate 5 Energy System) will require multi-step cleaning of the exhaust gas, to ensure no hazardous substances are released. In addition, the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes (such as fluidized-bed dryers) may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content; solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals or in the case of ash produced in a complete-combustion process, or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process, the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a LEEDs preferred additive to concrete or asphalt.
Examples of other ways to use dried sewage sludge as an energy resource include the Gate 5 Energy System, an innovative process to power a steam turbine using heat from burning milled and dried sewage sludge, or combining dried sewage sludge with coal in coal-fired power stations. In both cases this allows for production of electricity with less carbon-dioxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power stations. 

As of 2023, 27% of sludge produced in the EU was incinerated.

== Use ==

=== Land application ===
Biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage and wastewater treatment that is to be used in agriculture. National regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g. in the US there are widespread disputes about this practice.
Depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content, biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non-food agriculture, food agriculture, or distribution for unlimited use. Treated biosolids can be produced in cake, granular, pellet, or liquid form and are spread over land before being incorporated into the soil or injected directly into the soil by specialist contractors. Such use was pioneered by the production of Milorganite in 1926.

Use of sewage sludge has shown an increase in level of soil available phosphorus and soil salinity.

The findings of a 20-year field study of air, land, and water in Arizona, concluded that use of biosolids is sustainable and improves the soil and crops. Other studies report that plants uptake large quantities of heavy metals and toxic pollutants that are retained by produce, which is then consumed by humans.

A PhD thesis studying the addition of sludge to neutralize soil acidity concluded that the practice was not recommended if large amounts are used because the sludge produces acids when it oxidizes.

Studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment, can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application. Some of these chemicals, including potential endocrine disruptor triclosan, can also travel through the soil column and leach into agricultural tile drainage at detectable levels. Other studies, however, have shown that these chemicals remain adsorbed to surface soil particles, making them more susceptible to surface erosion than infiltration. These studies are also mixed in their findings regarding the persistence of chemicals such as triclosan, triclocarban, and other pharmaceuticals. The impact of this persistence in soils is unknown, but the link to human and land animal health is likely tied to the capacity for plants to absorb and accumulate these chemicals in their consumed tissues. Studies of this kind are in early stages, but evidence of root uptake and translocation to leaves did occur for both triclosan and triclocarban in soybeans. This effect was not present in corn when tested in a different study.

A cautionary approach to land application of biosolids has been advocated by some for regions where soils have lower capacities for toxics absorption or due to the presence of unknowns in sewage biosolids. In 2007 the Northeast Regional Multi-State Research Committee (NEC 1001) issued conservative guidelines tailored to the soils and conditions typical of the northeastern US.

Use of sewage sludge is prohibited for produce to be labeled USDA-certified organic. In 2014 the United States grocery chain Whole Foods banned produce grown in sewage sludge.

Treated sewage sludge has been used in the UK, Europe and China agriculturally for more than 80 years, though there is increasing pressure in some countries to stop the practice of land application due to farm land contamination and negative public opinion. In the 1990s, there was pressure in some European countries to ban the use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer. Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, and others introduced a ban. Still, the dominant method for disposal of sewage sludge in the EU is via application to agricultural lands. As of 2023, 40% of sludge produced in the EU was used on agricultural land. Since the 1960s there has been cooperative activity with industry to reduce the inputs of persistent substances from factories. This has been very successful and, for example, the content of cadmium in sewage sludge in major European cities is now only 1% of what it was in 1970.

=== Transformation into products ===
Sewage sludge is an agglomeration of concentrated wastes, and therefore it contains many potentially extractable and useable components. These can include using sludge to produce energy, create carbon-based components, extract phosphorus and nitrogen, or make bricks or other construction materials.

Recycling of phosphate is regarded as especially important because the phosphate industry predicts that at the current rate of extraction the economic reserves will be exhausted in 100 or at most 250 years. Phosphate can be recovered with minimal capital expenditure as technology currently exists, but municipalities have little political will to attempt nutrient extraction, instead opting for a &quot;take all the other stuff&quot; mentality.

One potential drawback of extracting products from sludge — as opposed to land application — is that only some of the sludge is used and the rest still needs disposal. It can also be very expensive to develop and use appropriate technologies for extracting resources.
==Contaminants==
The specific content of sewage sludge is affected by what enters the sewage stream, and how the sewage is treated and processed. As wastewater treatment policies are passed or amended to allow or regulate potential contaminants into the sewage stream, the content of the sewage sludge reflects those changes. For example, the EU&#x27;s Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive shapes the types of contaminants that enter the EU&#x27;s sewage treatment stream.

=== Pathogens ===
Bacteria in treated sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions. Pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge. Pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site-specific management practices are followed.

=== Heavy metals ===
One of the main concerns in the treated sludge is the concentrated metals content (lead, arsenic, cadmium, thallium, etc.); certain metals are regulated while others are not. Leaching methods can be used to reduce the metal content and meet the regulatory limit.

In 2009, the EPA released the Targeted National Sewage Sludge Study, which reports on the level of metals, chemicals, hormones, and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges. Some highlights include:
* Lead, arsenic, chromium, and cadmium are estimated by the EPA to be present in detectable quantities in 100% of national sewage sludges in the US, while thallium is only estimated to be present in 94.1% of sludges.
* Silver is present to the degree of 20 mg/kg of sludge, on average, while some sludges have up to 200 milligrams of silver per kilogram of sludge; one outlier demonstrated a silver lode of 800–900 mg per kg of sludge.
* Barium is present at the rate of 500 mg/kg, while manganese is present at the rate of 1 g/kg sludge.
===Micro-pollutants===
Micro-pollutants are compounds which are normally found at concentrations up to microgram per liter and milligram per kilogram in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, respectively, and they are considered to be potential threats to environmental ecosystems. They can become concentrated in sewage sludge. Each of these disposal options comes with myriad potential—and in some cases proven—human health and environment impacts.
Several organic micro-pollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds, pharmaceuticals and per-fluorinated compounds have been detected in sewage sludge samples around the world at concentrations ranging up to some hundreds mg/kg of dried sludge. 
Sterols and other hormones have also been detected.

=== Other hazardous substances ===
Sewage treatment plants receive various forms of hazardous waste from hospitals, nursing homes, industry and households. Low levels of constituents such as PCBs, dioxin, and brominated flame retardants, may remain in treated sludge. There are potentially thousands of other components of sludge that remain untested/undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge (pharmaceuticals, nano particles, etc.) which have been proven to be hazardous to both human and ecological health.

In 2013, in South Carolina PCBs were discovered in very high levels in wastewater sludge. The problem was not discovered until thousands of acres of farm land in South Carolina were discovered to be contaminated by this hazardous material. SCDHEC issued emergency regulatory order banning all PCB laden sewage sludge from being land applied on farm fields or deposited into landfills in South Carolina.

Also in 2013, after DHEC request, the city of Charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in South Carolina while authorities investigated the source of PCB contamination. In February 2014, the city of Charlotte admitted PCBs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well.

Contaminants of concern in sewage sludge are plasticizers, PDBEs, PFASs (&quot;forever chemicals&quot;), 
and others generated by human activities, including personal care products and medicines. Synthetic fibers from fabrics persist in treated sewage sludge as well as in biosolids-treated soils and may thus serve as an indicator of past biosolids application.

=== Pollutant ceiling concentration ===
The term &quot;pollutant&quot; is defined as part of the EPA 503 rule. The components of sludge have pollutant limits defined by the EPA. &quot;A Pollutant is an organic substance, an inorganic substance, a combination of organic and inorganic substances, or a pathogenic organism that, after discharge and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into an organism either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain, could, on the basis of information available to the Administrator of EPA, cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological malfunctions (including malfunction in reproduction), or physical deformations in either organisms or offspring of the organisms.&quot;
The maximum component pollutant limits by the US EPA are:

== Health risks ==
In 2011, the EPA commissioned a study at the United States National Research Council (NRC) to determine the health risks of sludge. In this document the NRC pointed out that many of the dangers of sludge are unknown and unassessed.

The NRC published &quot;Biosolids Applied to Land: Advancing Standards and Practices&quot; in July 2002. The NRC concluded that while there is no documented scientific evidence that sewage sludge regulations have failed to protect public health, there is persistent uncertainty on possible adverse health effects. The NRC noted that further research is needed and made about 60 recommendations for addressing public health concerns, scientific uncertainties, and data gaps in the science underlying the sewage sludge standards. The EPA responded with a commitment to conduct research addressing the NRC recommendations.

Residents living near Class B sludge processing sites may experience asthma or pulmonary distress due to bioaerosols released from sludge fields.

A 2004 survey of 48 individuals near affected sites found that most reported irritation symptoms, about half reported an infection within a month of the application, and about a fourth were affected by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, including two deaths. The number of reported S. aureus infections was 25 times as high as in hospitalized patients, a high-risk group. The authors point out that regulations call for protective gear when handling Class B biosolids and that similar protections could be considered for residents in nearby areas given the wind conditions.

In 2007, a health survey of persons living in close proximity to Class B sludged land was conducted. A sample of 437 people exposed to Class B sludge (living within of sludged land) - and using a control group of 176 people not exposed to sludge (not living within of sludged land) reported the following: Although correlation does not imply causation, such extensive correlations may lead reasonable people to conclude that precaution is necessary in dealing with sludge and sludged farmlands.

Harrison and Oakes suggest that, in particular, &quot;until investigations are carried out that answer these questions (...about the safety of Class B sludge...), land application of Class B sludges should be viewed as a practice that subjects neighbors and workers to substantial risk of disease.&quot; They further suggest that even Class A treated sludge may have chemical contaminants (including heavy metals, such as lead) or endotoxins present, and a precautionary approach may be justified on this basis, though the vast majority of incidents reported by Lewis, et al. have been correlated with exposure to Class B untreated sludge and not Class A treated sludge.

A 2005 report by the state of North Carolina concluded that &quot;a surveillance program of humans living near application sites should be developed to determine if there are adverse health effects in humans and animals as a result of biosolids application.&quot;

Studies of the potential uses of sewage sludge around homes, such as covering lead-contaminated soil in Baltimore, have created debates over whether participants should have been informed about potential risks, when there remains uncertainty about those risks.

The chain of sewage sledge to biosolids to fertilizers has resulted in PFASs (&quot;forever chemicals&quot;) contamination of farm produce in Maine in 2021 and beef raised in Michigan in 2022. The EPA PFAS Strategic Roadmap initiative, running from 2021 to 2024, will consider the full lifecycle of PFAS including health risks of PFAS in wastewater sludge.

== Regulation and guidelines ==

=== European Union ===
The EC encourages the use of sewage sludge in agriculture because it conserves organic matter and completes nutrient cycles. 

European countries that joined the EU after 2004 favor landfills as a means of disposal for sewage sludge. In 2006, the predicted sewage sludge growth rate was 10 million tons of sewage sludge per year. This increase in the amount of sewage sludge accumulation in the EU can be due to the increase in the number of households that are connected to the sewage system. The EU has directives in place to encourage the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, in a way that the soil, humans, and the environment are not harmed. A guideline the EU has put into place it that sewage sludge should not be added to fruit and vegetable crops that are in season. In Austria, in order to dispose of the sewage sludge in a landfill, it must first be treated in a way that reduces its biological reactivity. Sweden no longer allows sewage sludge to be disposed in the land fills. In the EU, regulations regarding sewage sludge disposal differ because legislation regarding landfill disposal in not in the national regulations for the EU. 

==== Sewage Sludge Directive ====
The EU&#x27;s Sewage Sludge Directive (86/278/EEC) sets out regulations to pursue the dual purpose of promoting the use of sewage sludge as an agricultural fertilizer, while ensuring environmental protections and human health. These rules include sludge treatment requirements, as well as limits on the time and place of sewage sludge applications, depending on the type of food crop. This is intended to protect human health while maintaining the ecological health of the soil and water. The directive explicitly regulates the allowable levels of seven heavy metals (cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc, mercury, and chromium) in soil and sludge, and regulates any application of sewage sludge that would cause levels of these heavy metals in soil to exceed those limits.

EU member states are tasked with implementing and enforcing the Directive within their borders, as well as monitoring and reporting on sludge production, treatment, characteristics, and use. Member states are allowed to set more stringent limits for heavy metals than set out in the Sewage Sludge Directive, and can set limits for other pollutants. As of 2021, more than half of the EU member states had stricter limits for mercury and cadmium than required under the Directive.

Member states are also allowed to limit or promote the use of sewage sludge for agriculture as they choose, meaning that some countries prohibit the use of sludge in agriculture, while some use up to 50% of the sludge they generate in agriculture. Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom (while it was still part of the EU) have particularly promoted the use of sludge in agriculture. Each of Austria&#x27;s federal states has its own regulations for the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, including different limits for heavy metals. For example, Tyrol has banned the use of sludge on agricultural lands, while in Salzburg it is only allowed under certain conditions.

Since the Directive&#x27;s passage, there has been the substantial decrease in heavy metal residues in agricultural soils over time (well below the limits set), though it is not possible to determine what proportion of the decrease is due to the Directive itself, as opposed to other national and EU legislation.

The Sewage Sludge Directive has been evaluated several times under EU proposals to build a circular economy through the reduction and reuse of wastes. In 2014, a European Commission evaluation of the Sewage Sludge Directive suggested it was appropriate for its goals, and did not need revision. In 2023, as part of the European Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan, the EU re-evaluated the Sewage Sludge Directive, and found that it should be maintained – as the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer aligns with circular economy goals and potentially reduces the EU carbon emissions – but that the potential pollutants and contaminants regulated under the Directive should be reviewed and potentially revised. This evaluation noted that, as of 2023, the original Directive had not been seriously updated since its original passage in 1986, even though in the intervening decades there had been many developments in both environmental policy, expectations, and research, as well as member states&#x27; national policies around sewage sludge. The evaluation particularly emphasized concerns about methane emissions, microplastic contamination, and antibiotic resistances.

The Sewage Sludge Directive has not yet set limits for other contaminants, such as organic pollutants, pathogens, microplastics, pharmaceutical residues, and personal care product residues. With the identification of these new contaminants in sludge since the Sewage Sludge Directive originally passed, several researchers have suggested that the EU should consider revising the Directive to address their potential risks to health and environment.

=== United States ===
After the 1991 Congressional ban on ocean dumping, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) instituted a policy of digested sludge reuse on agricultural land. The US EPA promulgated regulations – 40 CFR Part 503 – that continued to allow the use of biosolids on land as fertilizers and soil amendments which had been previously allowed under Part 257. The EPA promoted biosolids recycling throughout the 1990s. The EPA&#x27;s Part 503 regulations were developed with input from university, EPA, and USDA researchers from around the country and involved an extensive review of the scientific literature and the largest risk assessment the agency had conducted to that time. The Part 503 regulations became effective in 1993.

According to the EPA, biosolids that meet treatment and pollutant content criteria of Part 503.13 &quot;can be safely recycled and applied as fertilizer to sustainably improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth.&quot; However, they can not be disposed of in a sludge only landfill under Part 503.23 because of high chromium levels and boundary restrictions.

Under the Obama Administration, the Biosolids Center of Excellence (headquartered in EPA Region 7) was created to monitor and enforce compliance with biosolids regulation. The Center receives and reviews annual reports from the major producers of biosolids.

Eight U.S. states oversee their own biosolids programs: Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin; other states&#x27; programs are overseen by the EPA.

==== Classes of sewage sludge in the United States ====
In the United States, two classes of sewage sludge are defined by the amount of pathogens (i.e. bacteria, viruses) remaining in the sludge, and therefore the types of uses allowed by law. Both classes of sludge may still contain radioactive or pharmaceutical wastes.

Class A sludge must be treated so that specific pathogens (like Salmonella) are no longer detected. This class of sludge can be used for all land applications, including where the public may come into contact with it (i.e. agricultural land, home use, for public sale). Biosolids that meet Class A pathogen reduction requirements or equivalent treatment by a &quot;Process to Further Reduce Pathogens&quot; (PFRP) have the least restrictions on use. PFRPs include pasteurization, heat drying, thermophilic composting (aerobic digestion, most common method), and beta or gamma ray irradiation.

Class B sludge also requires treatment to reduce pathogens, but pathogens are still detectable in the sludge (such as some parasitic worm eggs). This class of sludge has much stricter restrictions on its use. Biosolids that meet the Class B pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria, in accordance with the EPA &quot;Standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge&quot; (40 CFR Part 503), can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping.

==== Evaluation of the U.S. sewage sludge program ====
The EPA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed two assessments in 2000 and 2002 of the EPA sewage sludge program. The follow-up report in 2002 documented that &quot;the EPA cannot assure the public that current land application practices are protective of human health and the environment.&quot; The report also documented that there had been an almost 100% reduction in EPA enforcement resources since the earlier assessment. This is probably the greatest issue with the practice: under both the federal program operated by the EPA and those of the several states, there is limited inspection and oversight by agencies charged with regulating these practices. To some degree, this lack of oversight is a function of the perceived (by the regulatory agencies) benign nature of the practice. However, a greater underlying issue is funding. Few states and the US EPA have the discretionary funds necessary to establish and implement a full enforcement program for biosolids.

As detailed in the 1995 &quot;Plain English Guide to the Part 503 Risk Assessment&quot;, the EPA&#x27;s most comprehensive risk assessment was completed for biosolids.

==== Court cases in the United States ====
*In 2009, James Rosendall of Grand Rapids, MI was sentenced by United States District Judge Avern Cohn to 11 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release for conspiring to commit bribery. Rosendall was the former president of Synagro of Michigan, a subsidiary of Synagro Technologies. His duties included obtaining the approval of the City of Detroit to process and dispose of the city&#x27;s wastewater.
* In 2011, Travis County Commissioners declared that Synagro&#x27;s solid waste disposal activities would be inappropriate and prohibited land use according to the towns already established ordinances.
* A battle between the home rule of local government and states rights/commerce rights has been waged between the small town of Kern County, California, and Los Angeles, California. Kern county passed an ordinance &quot;Keep Kern Clean&quot; ballot initiative which banned sludge from being applied in Kern County. Los Angeles sued and after a protracted verdict, won the case in 2016.
* In 2012, two families won a $225,000 tort lawsuit against a sludge company that contaminated their properties.
* In 2013 in Pennsylvania, the case &quot;Gilbert vs. Synagro&quot;, a judge barred a nuisance, negligence and trespass lawsuit under Pennsylvania&#x27;s Right to Farm Act.

== History of sewage sludge disposal in New York City ==
Since 1884 when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology (secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment). In the case of New York City, at first the sludge was discharged directly along the banks of rivers surrounding the city, then later piped further into the rivers, and then further still out into the harbor. In 1924, to relieve a dismal condition in New York Harbor, New York City began dumping sludge at sea at a location in the New York Bight called the 12-Mile Site. This was deemed a successful public health measure and not until the late 1960s was there any examination of its consequences to marine life or to humans. There was accumulation of sludge particles on the seafloor and consequent changes in the numbers and types of benthic organisms. In 1970 a large area around the site was closed to shellfishing. From then until 1986, the practice of dumping at the 12-Mile Site came under increasing pressure stemming from a series of untoward environmental crises in the New York Bight that were attributed partly to sludge dumping. In 1986, sludge dumping was moved still further seaward to a site over the deep ocean called the 106-Mile Site. Then, again in response to political pressure arising from events unrelated to ocean dumping, the practice ended entirely in 1992. Since 1992, New York City sludge has been applied to land (outside of New York state). The wider question is whether or not changes on the sea floor caused by the portion of sludge that settles are severe enough to justify the added operational cost and human health concerns of applying sludge to land.

<text>Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed annually on November 11, for honoring military veterans of the United States Armed Forces. It coincides with holidays in several countries, including Armistice Day and Remembrance Day, which also occur on the anniversary of the end of World War I. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.

Veterans Day is distinct from Memorial Day, a U.S. public holiday in May: Veterans Day commemorates the service of all U.S. veterans, while the older Memorial Day, which grew out of Civil War commemorations, specifically honors those who have died while in military service. Another military holiday that also occurs in May, Armed Forces Day, honors those currently serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, Women Veterans Day is recognized by a growing number of U.S. states that specifically honor women who have served in the U.S. military.

==History==
On November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans:

The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President Calvin Coolidge issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies. A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: &quot;a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as &#x27;Armistice Day.
In 1945, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, Alabama, had the idea of a national holiday that would honor all war veterans, living and dead, to be celebrated on Armistice Day. Weeks led a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first national celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at the White House with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the &quot;Father of Veterans Day&quot;.

US Representative Ed Rees from Emporia, Kansas, presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, also from Kansas, signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954. It had been eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans.

Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing &quot;Armistice&quot; with &quot;Veterans,&quot; and it has been known as Veterans Day since.

The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama, for his support in offering legislation to make Veterans Day a federal holiday.

Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (October 25, 1971; October 23, 1972; October 22, 1973; October 28, 1974; October 27, 1975; October 25, 1976, and October 24, 1977). In 1978, it was moved back to its original celebration on November 11. While the legal holiday remains on November 11, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then federal government employees and a number of organizations will instead take the day off on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively.

==Observance==
Because it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employees can choose some other day. A Society for Human Resource Management poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011. 

Legally, two minutes of silence is recommended to be observed at 2:11pm Eastern Standard Time. 

Non-essential federal government offices are closed. No mail is delivered. All federal workers are paid for the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive holiday pay for that day in addition to their wages.

===Armistice Day===
In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: &quot;Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness,&quot; he remarked. As Veterans Day and the birthday of the United States Marine Corps (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period.

Election Day is a regular working day, while Veterans Day, which typically falls the following week, is a federal holiday. The National Commission on Federal Election Reform called for the holidays to be merged, so citizens can have a day off to vote. They state this as a way to honor voting by exercising democratic rights.

===Spelling of Veterans Day===
While the holiday is commonly printed as &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Day&quot; or &quot;Veterans&#x27; Day&quot; in calendars and advertisements, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than the possessive case is the official spelling &quot;because it is not a day that &#x27;belongs&#x27; to veterans, it is a day for honoring all veterans.&quot;

<doc id="168344" wikidata="Q861660" url="?curid=168344" title="Songwriters Hall of Fame">
<text>The Songwriters Hall of Fame (SHOF) is an American institution founded in 1969 by songwriter Johnny Mercer, music publisher/songwriter Abe Olman, and publisher/executive Howie Richmond to honor those whose work represent and maintain the heritage and legacy of a spectrum of the most beloved English language songs from the world&#x27;s popular music songbook. It not only celebrates these established songwriters, but is also involved in the development of new English language songwriting talent through workshops, showcases, and scholarships. There are many programs designed to teach and discover new English language songwriters. Nile Rodgers serves as the organization&#x27;s chairman.

The Hall of Fame was formed in 1969, and in 2010, an exhibit was put on display online inside the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The Hall has no permanent place of residence, and because the awards are not televised, there would be no other digital recording of the event for posterity.

There are numerous examples of collaborating songwriters being inducted in unison, with each person being considered a separate entrant. The inaugural year featured 120 inductees, many of whom had a professional partnership, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein. Burt Bacharach and Hal David followed in 1972. Betty Comden and Adolph Green were selected in 1980, and Leiber and Stoller were inducted in 1985. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were inducted in 1987. In the same year, Gerry Goffin, Carole King, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil were inducted into the SHOF. Motown&#x27;s Holland-Dozier-Holland team were honored the following year. Elton John and Bernie Taupin were among those chosen in 1992, and the pop music group the Bee Gees had all three brothers inducted in 1994. In 1995, Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe as well as Gamble and Huff were inducted. John Denver was inducted in 1996. The Eagles&#x27; Glenn Frey and Don Henley were co-inductees in 2000. Queen was the first rock band to have all their band members inducted in 2003. Five members of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire were in the class of 2010. Four members of Kool and the Gang were honored in 2018. Through 2019, 461 individuals were inducted into the SHOF.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony was postponed until 2022. The Songwriters Hall of Fame president and CEO, Linda Moran, chose to move the event so that a proper celebration could take place.
New 2020 inductees would include Mariah Carey, Chad Hugo, the Isley Brothers, Annie Lennox, Steve Miller, Rick Nowels, William “Mickey” Stevenson, Dave Stewart and Pharrell Williams. Additionally, Jody Gerson of Universal Music Group will be given the Abe Olman Publisher Award and Paul Williams is set to receive the Johnny Mercer Award. On March 8, 2022, the ceremony was officially announced to take place on June 16, 2022, at its longtime location, the Marriott Marquis New York’s Times Square.

<text>The Imhoff tank, named for German engineer Karl Imhoff (1876–1965), is a chamber suitable for the reception and processing of sewage. It may be used for the clarification of sewage by simple settling and sedimentation, along with anaerobic digestion of the settled sludge. It consists of an upper chamber in which sedimentation takes place, from which settled solids slide down on the inclined bottom slopes towards a lower chamber in which the sludge accumulates. The two chambers are otherwise unconnected, with the more liquid sewage flowing only through the upper sedimentation chamber and only a slow flow of sludge in the lower digestion chamber. The lower chamber requires separate biogas vents and pipes for the removal of digested sludge, typically after 6–9 months of digestion. The Imhoff tank is in effect a two-story septic tank and retains the septic tank&#x27;s simplicity while eliminating many of its drawbacks, which largely result from the mixing of fresh sewage and septic sludge in the same chamber.

Typically, well-designed and operated Imhoff tanks are expected to remove suspended solids with an efficiency between 50-70%. Effluent coming out from Imhoff tanks can be either discharged in the environment, sent to a centralized wastewater treatment facility, or sent to constructed wetlands for disinfection and nutrient removal.

As a result of anaerobic digestion of settled sludge, methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide are typically formed. While in the past this gas mix used to be exploited for energy production given the relatively high methane content, nowadays gas from Imhoff tanks is typically vented out in the environment. This wastes the energy potential recovery of the technology and increases its carbon footprint, given the high content of methane which has a global warming potential about 25 times larger than the one of carbon dioxide.
Imhoff tanks are being superseded in sewage treatment by plain sedimentation tanks using mechanical methods for continuously collecting the sludge, which is moved to separate digestion tanks. This arrangement permits both improved sedimentation results and better temperature control in the digestion process, leading to a more rapid and complete digestion of the sludge.

A test for settleable solids in water, wastewater and stormwater uses an Imhoff cone, with or without stopcock. The volume of solids is measured after a specified time period at the bottom of a one-liter cone using graduated markings.

<doc id="168362" wikidata="Q312332" url="?curid=168362" title="Alessandro Cagliostro">
<text>Giuseppe Balsamo (; 2 June 1743 – 26 August 1795), known by the alias Count Alessandro di Cagliostro ( , ), was an Italian occultist.

Cagliostro was an Italian adventurer and self-styled magician. He became a glamorous figure associated with the royal courts of Europe where he pursued various occult arts, including psychic healing, alchemy, and scrying. His reputation lingered for many decades after his death but continued to deteriorate, as he came to be regarded as a charlatan and impostor, this view fortified by the savage attack of Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) in 1833, who pronounced him the &quot;Quack of Quacks&quot;. Later works—such as that of W. R. H. Trowbridge (1866–1938) in his &quot;Cagliostro: the Splendour and Misery of a Master of Magic&quot; (1910), attempted a rehabilitation.

==Biography==
===Origin===
The history of Cagliostro is shrouded in rumour, propaganda, and mysticism. Some effort was expended to ascertain his true identity when he was arrested because of possible participation in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe relates in his &quot;Italian Journey&quot; that the identification of Cagliostro with Giuseppe Balsamo was ascertained by a lawyer from Palermo who, upon official request, had sent a dossier with copies of the pertinent documents to France. Goethe met the lawyer in April 1787 and saw the documents and Balsamo&#x27;s pedigree: Balsamo&#x27;s great-grandfather Matteo Martello had two daughters: Maria, who married Giuseppe Bracconeri; and Vincenza, who married Giuseppe Cagliostro. Maria and Giuseppe Bracconeri had three children: Matteo; Antonia; and Felicità, who married Pietro Balsamo (the son of a bookseller, Antonino Balsamo, who had declared bankruptcy before dying at age 44). The son of Felicità and Pietro Balsamo was Giuseppe, who was christened with the name of his great-uncle and eventually adopted his surname, too. Felicità Balsamo was still alive in Palermo at the time of Goethe&#x27;s travels in Italy, and he visited her and her daughter. Goethe wrote that Cagliostro was of Jewish origin, and it may be that the name &quot;Balsamo&quot; comes from the hebrew Baal Shem (Cagliostro himself publicly asserted that he was a disciple of Haĩm Falk, the Baal Shem of London).

Cagliostro himself stated during the trial following the Affair of the Diamond Necklace that he had been born of Christians of noble birth but abandoned as an orphan upon the island of Malta. He claimed to have travelled as a child to Medina, Mecca, and Cairo and upon return to Malta to have been admitted to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, with whom he studied alchemy, the Kabbalah, and magic.

===Early life===
Giuseppe Balsamo was born to a poor family in Albergheria, which was once the old Jewish Quarter of Palermo, Sicily. Despite his family&#x27;s precarious financial situation, his grandfather and uncles made sure the young Giuseppe received a solid education: he was taught by a tutor and later became a novice in the Catholic Order of St. John of God, from which he was eventually expelled. During his period as a novice in the order, Balsamo learned chemistry as well as a series of spiritual rites. In 1764, when he was twenty-one, he convinced Vincenzo Marano—a wealthy goldsmith—of the existence of a hidden treasure buried several hundred years previously at Mount Pellegrino. The young man&#x27;s knowledge of the occult, Marano reasoned, would be valuable in preventing the duo from being attacked by magical creatures guarding the treasure. In preparation for the expedition to Mount Pellegrino, however, Balsamo requested seventy pieces of silver from Marano.

When the time came for the two to dig up the supposed treasure, Balsamo attacked Marano, who was left bleeding and wondering what had happened to the boy—in his mind, the beating he had been subjected to had been the work of djinns. The next day, Marano paid a visit to Balsamo&#x27;s house in via Perciata (since then renamed via Conte di Cagliostro), where he learned the young man had left the city. Balsamo (accompanied by two accomplices) had fled to the city of Messina. By 1765–66, Balsamo found himself on the island of Malta, where he became an auxiliary (&quot;donato&quot;) for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and a skilled pharmacist. 

===Travels===
In early 1768 Balsamo left for Rome, where he managed to land himself a job as a secretary to Cardinal Orsini. The job proved boring to Balsamo and he soon started leading a double life, selling magical &quot;Egyptian&quot; amulets and engravings pasted on boards and painted over to look like paintings. Of the many Sicilian expatriates and ex-convicts he met during this period, one introduced him to a fourteen-year-old girl named Lorenza Seraphina Feliciani (ca. 8 April 1751 – 1794), known as &quot;Serafina&quot;, whom he married 1768.

The couple moved in with Lorenza&#x27;s parents and her brother in the vicolo delle Cripte, adjacent to the strada dei Pellegrini. Balsamo&#x27;s coarse language and the way he incited Lorenza to display her body contrasted deeply with her parents&#x27; deep-rooted religious beliefs. After a heated discussion, the young couple left. At this point, Balsamo befriended Agliata, a forger and swindler, who proposed to teach Balsamo how to forge letters, diplomas and myriad other official documents. In return, Agliata sought sexual intercourse with Balsamo&#x27;s young wife, a request to which Balsamo acquiesced.

The couple traveled together to London, where Balsamo, now styling himself with one of several pseudonyms and self-conferred titles before settling on &quot;Count Alessandro di Cagliostro&quot;, allegedly met the Comte de Saint-Germain. Cagliostro traveled throughout Europe, especially to Courland, Russia, Poland, Germany, and later France. His fame grew to the point that he was even recommended as a physician to Benjamin Franklin during a stay in Paris.

On 12 April 1777, &quot;Joseph Cagliostro&quot; was admitted as a Freemason of the Espérance Lodge No. 289 in Gerrard Street, Soho, London. In December 1777 Cagliostro and Serafina left London for the mainland, after which they travelled through various German states, visiting lodges of the Rite of Strict Observance looking for converts to Cagliostro&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian Freemasonry&quot;. In February 1779 Cagliostro traveled to Mitau, (nowadays Latvia), where he met the poet Elisa von der Recke. In September 1780, after failing in Saint Petersburg to win the patronage of Russian Tsaritsa Catherine the Great, the Cagliostros made their way to Strasbourg, at that time in France. In October 1784, the Cagliostros travelled to Lyon. On 24 December 1784 they founded the co-Masonic mother lodge &quot;La Sagesse Triomphante&quot; of his rite of Egyptian Freemasonry at Lyon. In January 1785 Cagliostro and his wife went to Paris in response to the entreaties of Cardinal Rohan. 

===Affair of the diamond necklace===

Cagliostro was prosecuted in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace which involved Marie Antoinette and Cardinal Prince Louis de Rohan, and was held in the Bastille for nine months but finally acquitted, when no evidence could be found connecting him to the affair. Nonetheless, he was banished from France by order of Louis XVI, and departed for England. There he was accused by French expatriate Theveneau de Morande of being Giuseppe Balsamo, which he denied in his published &quot;Open Letter to the English People&quot;, forcing a retraction and apology from Morande.

===Betrayal, imprisonment, and death===
Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he met two people who proved to be spies of the Inquisition. Some accounts hold that his wife was the one who initially betrayed him to the Inquisition. On 27 December 1789, he was arrested for attempting to found a Masonic lodge in Rome, and was imprisoned in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. He was tried and originally sentenced to death but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment at the Forte di San Leo, where he would die on 26 August 1795.

==Legacy==
Portuguese author Camilo Castelo Branco credits to Balsamo the creation of the Egyptian Rite of the Freemasons and intensive work in the diffusion of Freemasonry, by opening lodges all over Europe and by introducing the acceptance of women into the community. The idea of an &quot;Egyptian freemasonry&quot; was maintained in Italy by the Rite of Misraim, founded in 1813 by the three Jewish Bédarride brothers and in France, the Rite of Memphis founded in 1838 by Jacques Etienne Marconis de Nègre; these unified under Giuseppe Garibaldi as the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Misraïm in 1881.

Cagliostro was an extraordinary forger. Giacomo Casanova, in his autobiography, narrated an encounter in which Cagliostro was able to forge a letter by Casanova, despite being unable to understand it. Occult historian Lewis Spence comments in his entry on Cagliostro that the swindler put his wealth to good use by starting and funding a chain of maternity hospitals and orphanages around the continent. He carried an alchemistic manuscript &quot;The Most Holy Trinosophia&quot; amongst others with him on his ill-fated journey to Rome, and it is alleged that he wrote it. Occultist Aleister Crowley believed Cagliostro was one of his previous incarnations.

==In popular culture==
=== Drama ===
* Catherine the Great wrote two skits lampooning Cagliostro in the guise of characters loosely based upon him.
* Johann Wolfgang Goethe wrote a comedy based on Cagliostro&#x27;s life, also in reference to the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, &quot;The Great Cophta&quot; (&quot;Der Groß-Coptha&quot;) which was published in 1791.
* Latvian playwright Mārtiņš Zīverts wrote the play &quot;Kaļostro Vilcē&quot; (Cagliostro in Vilce) in 1967.

===Literature===
* Alexandre Dumas, père used Cagliostro in several of his novels (especially in &quot;Joseph Balsamo&quot; and in &quot;Le Collier de la Reine&quot; where he claims to be over 3,000 years old and to have known Helen of Troy).
* George Sand includes Cagliostro as a minor character in her historical novel, &quot;The Countess of Rudolstadt&quot; (1843).
* Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy wrote the supernatural love story &quot;Count Cagliostro&quot;, in which the Count brings to life a long dead Russian princess by materializing her from her portrait. The story was made into a 1984 Soviet TV movie &quot;Formula of Love&quot;.
* Cagliostro is featured in three stories by Rafael Sabatini, namely &quot;The Lord of Time&quot;, &quot;The Death Mask&quot; and &quot;The Alchemical Egg&quot;, which are included in Sabatini&#x27;s collection &quot;Turbulent Tales&quot;.

<doc id="168365" wikidata="Q57275" url="?curid=168365" title="Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari">
<text>Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari (born Ermanno Wolf) (January 12, 1876 – January 21, 1948) was an Italian composer and teacher. He is best known for his comic operas such as &quot;Il segreto di Susanna&quot; (1909). A number of his works were based on plays by Carlo Goldoni, including &quot;Le donne curiose&quot; (1903), &quot;I quatro rusteghi&quot; (1906) and &quot;Il campiello&quot; (1936).

==Life==
Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari was born in Venice in 1876, the son of German painter August Wolf and Emilia Ferrari, from Venice. He added his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Ferrari, to his surname in 1895. Although he studied piano from an early age, music was not the primary passion of his young life. As a teenager Wolf-Ferrari wanted to be a painter like his father; he studied intensively in Venice and Rome and traveled abroad to study in Munich. It was there that he decided to concentrate instead on music, taking lessons from Josef Rheinberger. He enrolled at the Munich conservatory and began taking counterpoint and composition classes. These initially casual music classes eventually completely eclipsed his art studies, and music took over Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s life. He wrote his first works in the 1890s.

At age 19, Wolf-Ferrari left the conservatory and traveled home to Venice. There he worked as a choral conductor, married, had a son called Federico Wolf-Ferrari, and met both Arrigo Boito and Verdi. In 1900, having failed to have two previous efforts published, Wolf-Ferrari saw the first performance of one of his operas, &quot;Cenerentola&quot;, based on the story of Cinderella. The opera was a failure in Italy, and the humiliated young composer moved back to Munich. German audiences would prove more appreciative of his work; a revised version of &quot;Cenerentola&quot; was a hit in Bremen in 1902, while the cantata &quot;La vita nuova&quot; brought the young composer international fame.

Wolf-Ferrari now began transforming the wild and witty farces of the 18th-century Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni into comic operas. The resulting works were musically eclectic, melodic, and utterly hilarious; every single one became an international success. In fact, until the outbreak of World War I, Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s operas were among the most performed in the world. In 1902 he became professor of composition and director of the Liceo Benedetto Marcello.

In 1911 Wolf-Ferrari tried his hand at full-blooded Verismo with &quot;I gioielli della Madonna&quot;; a story of passion, sacrilege and madness. It was quite popular in its day and for a period after, especially in Chicago, where the great Polish soprano Rosa Raisa made it a celebrated vehicle. Maria Jeritza (and, later, Florence Easton) triumphed in it at the Metropolitan Opera, in an all-out spectacular production in 1926.

World War I, however, was a nightmare for Wolf-Ferrari. The young composer, who had been dividing his time between Munich and Venice, suddenly found his two countries at war with each other. With the outbreak of the War, he moved to Zürich and composed much less, though he still wrote another comedy, &quot;Gli amanti sposi&quot; (1916). A new melancholy vein appeared in his post-war work; his operas grew darker and more emotionally complex.

He did not really pick up his rate of output until the 1920s, when he wrote &quot;Das Himmelskleid&quot; (1925) and &quot;Sly&quot; (1927), the latter based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. In 1939 he became professor of composition at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1946 he moved again to Zürich before returning to his home city of Venice. He died in Venice at Palazzo Malipiero and is buried in the San Michele cemetery on Island of San Michele.

==Music==
As well as his operas, Wolf-Ferrari wrote a number of instrumental works, mainly at the very beginning and very end of his career. Only his violin concerto has ever been performed with anything approaching regularity, though he also wrote &quot;Idillio-concertino&quot; (essentially a chamber symphony), various pieces of chamber music including a piano quintet and two piano trios, three violin sonatas and a number of works for the organ amongst others. In recent years, a recovery of his instrumental music has been underway by the pianist Costantino Catena, who has recorded his piano works, sonatas for violin and piano, sonata for cello and piano and piano quintet for the Brilliant Classics label.

Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s work is not performed very widely (with the exception of several of his overtures and his &quot;Jewels of the Madonna&quot; intermezzo) although he is generally thought of as probably the finest writer of Italian comic opera of his time. His works often recall the opera buffa of the 18th century, although he also wrote more ambitious works in the manner of Pietro Mascagni, which are thought of less well.

<text>The Tongass National Forest () in Southeast Alaska is the largest U.S. National Forest at , an expanse larger than 10 U.S. states and 75 U.N. member nations. Most of its area is temperate rain forest and is remote enough to be home to many species of endangered and rare flora and fauna. The Tongass, which is managed by the United States Forest Service, encompasses islands of the Alexander Archipelago, fjords and glaciers, and peaks of the Coast Mountains. An international border with Canada (British Columbia) runs along the crest of the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains. The forest is administered from Forest Service headquarters offices in Ketchikan. There are local ranger district offices located in Craig, Hoonah, Juneau, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Thorne Bay, Wrangell, and Yakutat.

==History==
The Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve was established by Theodore Roosevelt in a presidential proclamation of 20 August 1902. Another presidential proclamation made by Roosevelt, on 10 September 1907, created the Tongass National Forest. On 1 July 1908, the two forests were joined, and the combined forest area encompassed most of Southeast Alaska. Further presidential proclamations of 16 February 1909 (in the last months of the Roosevelt administration) and 10 June, and in 1925 (by Calvin Coolidge) expanded the Tongass. An early supervisor of the forest was William Alexander Langille.

On September 4th, 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866 crashed in the Tongass National Forest, killing all 111 people on board.

===Aboriginal title===
After the creation of the Tongass National Forest, the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska formed to challenge the federal government&#x27;s rights to the land in 1935. In &quot;Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska v. United States&quot;, the court found Alaskan natives held established aboriginal title by their &quot;exclusive use and occupancy of that territory from time immemorial&quot;. The court found the Alaska Treaty of Cessation between Russia and the United States did not extinguish aboriginal title to the land, and that the creation of the Tongass National Forest constituted a taking of land from the Tlingit and Haida. The case was finally settled in 1968 with a $7.5 million payment that valued the Tongass at about 43 cents an acre. The value was based on land value at the time of the taking in 1902, without the inflation or interest accrued in the past 66 years.

===Logging===

Timber harvest in Southeast Alaska consisted of individual handlogging operations up until the 1950s, focusing on lowlying areas and beach fringe areas. In the 1950s, in part to aid in Japanese recovery from World War II, the Forest Service set up long-term contracts with two pulp mills: the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) and the Alaska Pulp Company. These contracts were scheduled to last 50 years, and originally intended to complement independent sawlog operations in the region. However, the two companies conspired to drive log prices down, put smaller logging operations out of business, and were major and recalcitrant polluters in their local areas. Ultimately, virtually all timber sales in the Tongass were purchased by one of these two companies.

In 1974, the exclusive KPC contract for 800,000 acres of old growth forest on Prince of Wales Island was challenged by the Point Baker Association led by Alan Stein, Chuck Zieske and Herb Zieske. Federal District Court judge James von der Heydt ruled in their favor in December 1975 and March 1976, enjoining clearcutting of over of the north end of Prince of Wales Island. The suit threatened to halt clearcutting in the United States. In 1976, Congress removed the Zieske injunction in passing the National Forest Management Act. Over half the old growth timber was removed there by the mid 1990s.

The battle for buffer strips, to protect salmon streams from logging, which began in the &quot;Zieske v Butz&quot; lawsuit, continued through comments submitted to the major US Forest Service Environmental Impact Statements issued in subsequent five-year intervals starting in 1979, and continuing in the 1988 EIS.

In 1990, a Federal District Court in Alaska, in a case called &quot;Stein v Barton&quot;, held the US Forest Service had to protect all salmon streams in the Tongass with buffer strips. One of the claims in &quot;Stein v Barton&quot; for protection of the Salmon Bay Watershed was partially enacted into law when Congress Passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act; environmental lobbyists had compromised with Senator Ted Stevens leaving the most valuable forest available to logging in the headwaters of the salmon streams therein.

Much of the power of these companies lay in the long-term contracts. The contracts guaranteed low prices to the pulp companies—in some cases resulting in trees being given away for &quot;less than the price of a hamburger&quot;.

The Tongass Timber Reform Act, enacted in 1990, significantly reshaped the logging industry&#x27;s relationship with the Tongass National Forest. The law&#x27;s provisions cancelled a $40 million annual subsidy for timber harvest; established several new wilderness areas and closed others to logging; and required that future cutting under the 50-year pulp contracts be subject to environmental review and limitations on old-growth harvest. Alaska Pulp Corporation and Ketchikan Pulp Corporation claimed that the new restrictions made them uncompetitive and closed down their mills in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the Forest Service then cancelled the remainders of the two 50-year timber contracts.

In 2003, an appropriations bill rider required that all timber sales in the Tongass must be positive sales, meaning no sales could be sold that undervalued the &quot;stumpage&quot; rate, or the value of the trees as established by the marketplace (2008 Appropriations Bill P.L. 110–161, H. Rept. 110–497, Sec. 411). However, the Forest Service also conducts NEPA analyses, layout, and administrative operations to support these sales, and as such, the government does not make a profit overall. Given the guaranteed low prices during contract days and the continued high cost of logging in Southeast Alaska today, one analysis concludes that, since 1980, the Forest Service has lost over one billion dollars in Tongass timber sales. Logging operations are not the only deficit-run programs, however. The Forest Service likens the overall deficit of the timber harvest program to the many other programs the agency operates at a deficit, including trail, cabin, and campground maintenance and subsistence programs.

High-grading (preferentially targeting for logging the most profitable forest types) has been prevalent in the Tongass throughout the era of industrial-scale logging there. For example, the forest type with the largest concentration of big trees—volume class 7—originally comprised only 4% of the forested portion of the Tongass, and over two-thirds of it has been logged. Other high-grading has concentrated on stands of Alaska cedar and red cedar. The karst terrain often produces large trees and has fewer muskeg bogs, and has also been preferentially logged.

In a move that reverses a Trump administration decision to lift restrictions on logging and road-building, the Biden administration announced on 15 July 2021 that it would end large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the Tongass National Forest. Forest restoration, recreation and other non-commercial uses will instead be the focus. The new rules would still allow for smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, for cultural uses by local communities.

===Roadless controversy===
The most contested logging in the Tongass has involved the roadless areas. Southeast Alaska is an extensive landscape, with communities scattered across the archipelago on different islands, isolated from each other and the mainland road system. The road system that exists in the region is in place because of the resource extraction history in the region, primarily established by the Forest Service to enable timber harvest. Once in place, these roads serve to connect local communities and visitors to recreation, hunting, fishing, and subsistence opportunities long into the future. Installing roads in the vast wilderness areas of the Tongass has been opposed by the roadless area conservation movement, which claims that it would promote habitat fragmentation, diminish wildlife populations and damage salmon spawning streams. They argue that existing roads are sufficient.

The Tongass National Forest was included in the Roadless Initiative passed on 5 January 2001, during the last days of the Bill Clinton Administration, and the initiative prevented the construction of new roads in roadless areas of United States national forests.

In September 2006, a landmark court decision overturned Bush&#x27;s repeal of the Roadless Rule, reverting to the 2001 roadless area protections established under president Clinton. The Tongass remained exempt from that ruling. In June 2007, U.S. House members added an amendment to the appropriations bill to block federally funded road building in Tongass National Forest. Proponents of the amendment said that the federal timber program in Tongass is a dead loss for taxpayers, costing some $30 million annually, and noted that the Forest Service faces an estimated $900 million road maintenance backlog in the forest. Supporters of the bipartisan amendment included the Republicans for Environmental Protection. Representative Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican who sponsored the amendment, said, &quot;I am not opposed to logging when it&#x27;s done on the timber company&#x27;s dime… But in this case, they are using the American taxpayer to subsidize these 200 jobs at the tune of $200,000 per job. That just makes no sense.&quot;

In July 2009, the Obama Administration approved clearcut logging on in the remaining old growth forests of a Tongass National Forest roadless area. The timber sale was permanently stopped by a lawsuit.

In March 2011, Judge John Sedwick from the Anchorage federal district court, in his ruling, reinstated the Roadless Rule on roadless areas in the Tongass, but with three of the Forest Service&#x27;s recent timber projects excluded from that ruling &quot;without prejudice.&quot; Those projects were Iyouktug Timber Sales ROD (record of decision), Scratchings Timber Sale ROD II, and Kuiu Timber Sale Area ROD. The Order concluded in part:

In October 2019, the Trump administration instructed federal officials to reverse the limits of tree cutting at the request of Alaska&#x27;s top elected officials, including Senator Lisa Murkowski and Governor Michael J. Dunleavy. In a statement, Forest Service officials said the new plan would be subject to public comment for 60 days.

The Forest Service removed most of the Tongass National Forest from roadless area designation in October 2020, allowing road construction and logging in more than 9.3 million acres of rainforest. Clear-cut lands lose the carbon sink of old-growth forest, habitat for wildlife, and soil stability, causing landslides.

In June 2021, the Joe Biden administration revealed its intent to &quot;repeal or replace&quot; Trump&#x27;s removal of roadless designation. According to Matt Herrick, spokesman for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under Biden, &quot;We [the USDA] recognize the vital role the forest and its inventoried roadless areas play in communities, and in the economy and culture of southeast Alaska, as well as for climate resilience.&quot; The Biden administration planned to formally publish its intent to revise the Trump-era rule by August 2021, with details of the plan being finalized in the following two years. In November 2021, the administration officially published a rule to restore roadless protections in the Tongass National Forest; The rule took effect in January 2023, restoring the 2001 roadless rule.

==Description==
Known by the U.S. Forest Service as the &quot;crown jewel&quot;, the Tongass stretches across 17 million acres of land and is Alaska&#x27;s largest National Forest. Alaska Wilderness League describes the Tongass as &quot;one of the last remaining intact temperate rainforests in the world&quot;. 70,000 people inhabit the region. While the timber industry dominated the economy for a long time, the region has transitioned into &quot;non-timber... [sources of revenue] such as recreation, subsistence food, salmon, scientific use, and carbon sequestration [which] contributes more than $2 billion&quot; annually. Tourism supports over 10,000 jobs in the Tongass National Forest, with about 10% being related to fishing activities.

Three Alaska Native nations live in Southeast Alaska: the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. Thirty-one communities are located within the forest; the largest is Juneau, the state capital, with a population of 31,000. The forest is named for the Tongass group of the Tlingit people, who inhabited the southernmost areas of Southeast Alaska, near what is now the city of Ketchikan.

==Ecology==

The Tongass includes parts of the Northern Pacific coastal forests and Pacific Coastal Mountain icefields and tundra ecoregions. Along with the Central and North Coast regions of British Columbia designated as the Great Bear Rainforest, the Tongass is part of the &quot;perhumid rainforest zone&quot;, and the forest is primarily made up of western red cedar, sitka spruce, and western hemlock. The Tongass is Earth&#x27;s largest remaining temperate rainforest. The terrain underlying the forest is divided between karst (limestone rock, well-drained soil, and many caves) and granite (poorly drained soil).

Unique and protected creatures seldom found anywhere else in North America inhabit the thousands of islands along the Alaska coast. Five species of salmon, brown and black bears, and bald eagles abound throughout the forest. Other terrestrial animals include wolves, mountain goats, ravens, and sitka black-tailed deer. Many migratory birds spend summer months nesting among the archipelago, notably the Arctic tern. Orca and humpback whales, sea lions, seals, sea otters, river otters, and porpoises swim offshore. The Tongass is also home to steelhead and salmon. The Tongass is also the only place in the United States where the Haida ermine, a rare and endangered species of weasel, can be found; aside from here, the only other place on Earth where it is found is the Haida Gwaii archipelago in Canada. Of the three subspecies of the Haida ermine, one is found on Prince of Wales Island and the other is found on Suemez Island (both located within the Tongass), with the third being found on Haida Gwaii.

Though its land area is huge, about 40% of the Tongass is composed of wetlands, snow, ice, rock, and non-forest vegetation, while the remaining are forested. About are considered &quot;productive old-growth&quot;, and of those are preserved as wilderness areas.

Historically, logging operations tended to concentrate on lower-elevation, bigger-tree ecosystems for harvesting; at present, approximately 78% of the land remains intact, i.e. out of original big-tree, low-elevation forest area. Given the high value of these areas for wildlife species, close to 70% of this old growth forest is protected in reserves and will never be eligible for harvest.

Major disturbances in the Tongass National Forest include windfall and landslides. Local winter windstorms referred to as the &quot;Takus&quot; can affect the structure of some stands and often cause single-tree blow-downs.

Of all the old growth in the forest, no more than 11% of the remaining area will ever be harvested. Of the of &quot;productive old-growth&quot; in the forest, , or 12% of the total old-growth, are slated for harvest over the next 10 years. Current harvesting plans call for a phase-out of old-growth harvesting, to be replaced by rotation harvesting of managed second-growth forests.

The World Wildlife Fund locates it in their Pacific temperate rain forest &#x27;WWF ecoregion&#x27;, a geographical area.

===Wilderness areas===
There are 19 designated wilderness areas within the Tongass National Forest, more than in any other national forest. They contain over of territory, also more than any other. From largest to smallest, they are:
* Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness
* Kootznoowoo Wilderness
* Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness
* Stikine-LeConte Wilderness
* Russell Fjord Wilderness
* South Baranof Wilderness
* West Chichagof-Yakobi Wilderness
* Endicott River Wilderness
* South Prince of Wales Wilderness
* South Etolin Wilderness
* Chuck River Wilderness
* Tebenkof Bay Wilderness
* Kuiu Wilderness
* Petersburg Creek-Duncan Salt Chuck Wilderness
* Karta River Wilderness
* Pleasant/Lemesurier/Inian Islands Wilderness
* Coronation Island Wilderness
* Warren Island Wilderness
* Maurille Islands Wilderness
There are three other wilderness areas within the Alaska Panhandle region that are not part of the Tongass National Forest, but are administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. From largest to smallest they are the Forrester Island Wilderness, the Saint Lazaria Wilderness, and the Hazy Islands Wilderness. Also in Southeast Alaska, but not in the Tongass National Forest, are the Glacier Bay Wilderness and a small part of the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness, which are both administered by the National Park Service.

==Recreation==
The Tongass National Forest offers recreation opportunities, some of which are found only in Alaska. The forest has close to one million visitors each year. Most come by cruise ships arriving through the Inside Passage of Southeast Alaska. The Forest Service provides visitor programs at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center in Juneau and the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center in Ketchikan. The Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, built in 1962, was the first Forest Service visitor center in the nation. The forest interpretive program on the state ferries began in the summer of 1968, and was the longest-running naturalist program in the agency until ending in 2013.

==Native inholdings==
Native corporation lands are those designated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA). This Act conveyed approximately of federal land in Alaska to private native corporations which were created under the ANCSA. of those lands were hand-picked old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest and are still surrounded by public National Forest land. These lands are now privately held and under the management of Sealaska Corporation, one of the native regional corporations created under the ANCSA.Transference of public National Forest land to a privately owned corporation removes it from protection by Federal law and allows the owners to use the land in whatever way they see fit without regard to the effects of the use on surrounding lands and ecosystems. This fact has caused much controversy involving the business interests of Native Regional Corporations and the personal interests of local Native and non-Native residents of Southeastern Alaska.

Currently Sealaska, a native regional corporation created under the ANCSA is asking for an amendment to the Act that would distribute additional land to Alaskan Natives. When Sealaska was created, it was promised additional land that was unavailable at the time due to contracts with pulp mills; much of this original land is now under water or in a watershed, and consequently Sealaska has requested different land. On 23 April 2009, Senator Murkowski and U.S. Rep. Don Young introduced a revised Sealaska bill (S. 881 and H.R 2099) that requests public lands that are both economically valuable and environmentally delicate. Starting with the next session of Congress in 2011, Senator Murkowski reintroduced a slightly modified version of the Sealaska Bill and Representative Don Young introduced a companion bill (S 730 and HR 1408). While HR 1408 was passed out of the Natural Resources Committee, S 730 remains in the Natural Resources Committee of the Senate.

Known as the Sealaska Lands Bill, the removal of 91,000 acres from the regulatory protections of the USFS and transfer of the land to Sealaska, a for profit corporation, created a huge controversy in South East Alaska.

A study released by Audubon Alaska on 22 February 2012 showed that the Sealaska selection of the largest trees in areas designated in S 730 and HR 1408 is 1200 percent greater than the occurrence of these trees in the Tongass as a whole.

There is strong opposition to passage of S 881 coming from seven communities in the Tongass, most on Prince of Wales Island. In addition, there are fears expressed by the Territorial Sportsmen that the northern goshawk will be listed as endangered if the bill is passed. Similar concerns were expressed by the Alaska Outdoor Council in letters to Senators Murkowski and Begich and Governor Parnell.

<doc id="168367" wikidata="Q311112" url="?curid=168367" title="Antiochus VIII Grypus">
<text>Antiochus VIII Epiphanes/Callinicus/Philometor, nicknamed Grypus (, &quot;hook-nose&quot;), was the ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire from 125 to 96 BC. He was the younger son of Demetrius II and Cleopatra Thea. He may have spent his early life in Athens and returned to Syria after the deaths of his father and brother Seleucus V. At first he was joint ruler with his mother. Fearing her influence, Antiochus VIII had Cleopatra Thea poisoned in 121 BC.

Political instability affected most of Antiochus VIII&#x27;s reign. From 116 BC he fought a civil war against his half-brother Antiochus IX. Antiochus VIII&#x27;s wife, the Ptolemaic Egyptian princess Tryphaena, had her sister and the wife of Antiochus IX, the former Cleopatra IV of Egypt, murdered in 112 BC; Antiochus IX killed Tryphaena in revenge. In 102 BC, Antiochus VIII&#x27;s aunt Cleopatra III of Egypt, the mother of the two rival queens, gave him the hand of her daughter Cleopatra Selene in marriage. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC.

==Biography==
===Family background and childhood===
In 193 BC Cleopatra I, a Seleucid princess, married King Ptolemy V of Egypt. Their granddaughter Cleopatra Thea of the Ptolemaic dynasty married the claimant Alexander Balas half a century later in 150 BC. She later married Demetrius II of Syria, and they had two sons. Demetrius II was captured and held as a prisoner by the Parthian Empire. Antiochus VIII&#x27;s uncle Antiochus VII took the throne and married Cleopatra Thea, but died in 129 BC while fighting against the Parthians; Demetrius II then returned to the throne, and died in 125 BC while waging a war for the Syrian throne against the claimant Alexander II. Demetrius II&#x27;s eldest son Seleucus V became king after his death, but was soon killed by Cleopatra Thea. She made Antiochus VIII king, ruling as his co-regent.

===Rise to power===
Shortly after taking the throne, Antiochus VIII married his cousin, the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena. Silver and bronze coins issued during the co-regency (125–121BC) of Antiochus VIII and Cleopatra Thea show the head of the queen appearing at front with her son&#x27;s head behind hers. Her name is also the first listed on the coinage. These facts signify that she was the senior co-ruler. He defeated usurper Alexander II Zabinas in 123 BC. In 121 BC, Antiochus decided to rid himself of his influential mother. According to Justin, his mother tried to poison him with wine, but the suspicious king forced her to drink the cup herself. However, it was Grypus himself who would become famous for his interest in toxicology. Some poems about poisonous herbs believed to have been written by him are quoted by the famous physician Galen.

===Reign as King of Syria===
Despite political shortcomings, Grypus was a popular king. His ugly, lazy appearance on coins (common among the last Seleucids), together with stories of his lavish banquets, made posterity believe his dynasty was degenerate and decadent. This was, however, a conscious image invoking the Hellenistic concept of &quot;Tryphe&quot; - meaning good life, which the last Seleucids strove to be associated with, as opposed to the exhausting civil wars and feuds which troubled their reigns in reality.

A story of his luxurious parties claims he sent food home with guests who attended banquets, complete with a camel as beast of burden, as well as an attendant to carry the guest himself. This should certainly have caused some strain on the already depleted treasury.

===Civil War===
In 116 BC his half-brother and cousin Antiochus IX Cyzicenus returned from exile and a civil war began. Cyzicenus&#x27; wife, also named Cleopatra, was a sister of Tryphaena and was eventually killed in a dramatic fashion in the temple of Daphne outside Antioch, on the order of Tryphaena. Cyzicenus eventually killed Tryphaena as revenge. The two brothers then divided Syria between them until Grypus was killed by his minister Heracleon in 96 BC.

==Family==
He married the Ptolemaic princess Tryphaena ca. 125, and had six children by her: 
* Seleucus VI Epiphanes
* Antiochus XI Epiphanes Philadelphus
* Philip I Philadelphus
* Demetrius III Eucaerus
* Antiochus XII Dionysus
* Laodice VII Thea, married to king Mithridates I Callinicus of Commagene as part of a settlement by Mithridates&#x27; father Sames II Theosebes Dikaios to ensure peace between the Kingdom of Commagene and the Seleucid Empire. Laodice and Mithridates&#x27; son was King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene, grandson to Grypus.

In 102, Cleopatra III of Egypt gave him her daughter Cleopatra Selene I in marriage, but she gave him no children. Afterwards, she went to marry Antiochus IX Cyzicenus.

He is best known as a Tin Pan Alley lyricist, but he also composed music and was a popular singer who recorded his own as well as others&#x27; songs from the mid-1930s through the mid-1950s. Mercer&#x27;s songs were among the most successful hits of the time, including &quot;Moon River&quot;, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, and &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;. He wrote the lyrics to more than 1,500 songs, including compositions for movies and Broadway shows. He received nineteen Oscar nominations, and won four Best Original Song Oscars.

==Early life ==

Mercer was born in Savannah, Georgia, where one of his first jobs, aged 10, was sweeping floors at the original 1919 location of Leopold&#x27;s Ice Cream. Mercer lived on Lincoln Street, a block away from the store&#x27;s East Gwinnett and Habersham location.

Mercer&#x27;s father, George Anderson Mercer, was a prominent attorney and real-estate developer. Mercer&#x27;s mother, Lillian Elizabeth (née Ciucevich), was the daughter of a Croatian immigrant father and a mother with Irish ancestry. Lillian was the senior Mercer&#x27;s secretary and second wife. Lillian&#x27;s father, born in Lastovo, in 1834 to Ivana Cucevic and Marijo Dundovic, was a merchant seaman who ran the Union blockade during the Civil War. Mercer was George&#x27;s fourth son, and his first son by Lillian. His great-grandfather was Confederate General Hugh Weedon Mercer and he was a direct descendant of American Revolutionary War General Hugh Mercer, a Scottish soldier-physician who died at the Battle of Princeton. Mercer was also a distant cousin of General George S. Patton.

Mercer liked music as a small child and attributed his musical talent to his mother, who would sing sentimental ballads. Mercer&#x27;s father also sang, mostly old Scottish songs. His aunt told him he was humming music when he was six months old and later she took him to see minstrel and vaudeville shows where he heard &quot;coon songs&quot; and ragtime. The family&#x27;s summer home, &quot;Vernon View&quot;, was on the tidal waters and Mercer&#x27;s long summers there among mossy trees, saltwater marshes, and soft, starry nights inspired him years later.

Mercer&#x27;s exposure to black music was perhaps unique among the white songwriters of his generation. As a child, Mercer had African-American playmates and servants, and he listened to the fishermen and vendors about him, who spoke and sang in the Gullah language (also known as &quot;Geechee&quot;). He was also attracted to Black church services. Mercer later stated, &quot;Songs always fascinated me more than anything.&quot; He had no formal musical training but was singing in a choir by six and at 11 or 12 he had memorized almost all of the songs he had heard and became curious about who wrote them. He once asked his brother who the best Tin Pan Alley songwriter was, and his brother said Irving Berlin.

Despite Mercer&#x27;s early exposure to music, his talent was clearly in creating the words and singing, not in playing music, though early on he had hoped to become a composer. In addition to the lyrics that Mercer memorized, he was an avid reader and wrote adventure stories. His attempts to play the trumpet and piano were not successful, and he never could read musical scores with any facility, relying instead on his own notation system.

As a teenager in the Jazz Era, he searched for records by early black blues/jazz figures including Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Louis Armstrong. His father owned the first car in town, and Mercer&#x27;s teenage social life was enhanced by his driving privilege, which sometimes verged on recklessness. The family would motor to the mountains near Asheville, North Carolina, to escape the Savannah heat and there Mercer learned to dance (from Arthur Murray himself) and to flirt with Southern belles, his natural sense of rhythm helping him on both accounts. (Later, Mercer wrote a humorous song called &quot;Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing in a Hurry&quot;.)

Mercer attended the exclusive Woodberry Forest School in Virginia until 1927. Although not a top student, he was active in literary and poetry societies and as a humor writer for the school&#x27;s publications. In addition, his exposure to classic literature augmented his already rich store of vocabulary and phraseology. He began to scribble ingenious, sometimes strained, rhymed phrases for later use. Mercer was also the class clown and a prankster, and member of the &quot;hop&quot; committee that booked musical entertainment on campus.

Mercer was already somewhat of an authority on jazz at an early age. His yearbook stated: &quot;No orchestra or new production can be authoritatively termed &#x27;good&#x27; until Johnny&#x27;s stamp of approval has been placed upon it. His ability to &#x27;get hot&#x27; under all conditions and at all times is uncanny.&quot; Mercer began to write songs, an early effort being &quot;Sister Susie, Strut Your Stuff&quot;.

Given his family&#x27;s long association with Princeton, New Jersey, and Princeton University, Mercer was groomed to go to school there, but those ambitions were dashed by his father&#x27;s financial setbacks in the late 1920s. He went to work in his father&#x27;s recovering business, collecting rent and running errands, but soon grew bored with the routine and with Savannah.

==Career==
===Starting out===
Mercer moved to New York in 1928, when he was 19. The music he loved, jazz and blues, was booming in Harlem and Broadway was bursting with musicals and revues from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin. Vaudeville, though beginning to fade, was still a strong musical presence. Mercer&#x27;s first few jobs were as a bit actor (billed as John Mercer). Holed up in a Greenwich Village apartment with plenty of time on his hands and a beat-up piano to play, Mercer soon returned to singing and lyric writing. He secured a day job at a brokerage house and sang at night. Pooling his meager income with that of his roommates, Mercer managed to keep going, sometimes on little more than oatmeal. One night he dropped in on Eddie Cantor backstage to offer a comic song, but although Cantor didn&#x27;t use the song, he began encouraging Mercer&#x27;s career. Mercer&#x27;s first lyric, for the song &quot;Out of Breath (and Scared to Death of You)&quot; (1930), composed by friend Everett Miller, appeared in a musical revue &quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot; in 1930. Mercer met his future wife at the show, chorus girl Ginger Meehan. She had earlier been one of the many chorus girls pursued by the young crooner Bing Crosby. Through Miller&#x27;s father, an executive at the prominent music publisher T. B. Harms, Mercer&#x27;s first song was published. It was recorded by Joe Venuti and his New Yorkers.

The 20-year-old Mercer began to frequent the company of other songwriters and to learn the trade. He traveled to California to undertake a lyric writing assignment for the musical &quot;Paris in the Spring&quot; and met his idols Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong. Mercer found the experience sobering and realized that he much preferred free-standing lyric writing to writing on demand for musicals. Upon his return, he got a job as staff lyricist for Miller Music for a $25-a-week draw, which give him a base income and enough prospects to win over and marry Ginger in 1931. The new Mrs. Mercer quit the chorus line and became a seamstress, and to save money the newlyweds moved in with Ginger&#x27;s mother in Brooklyn. Johnny did not inform his own parents of his marriage until after the fact, perhaps in part because he knew that Ginger being Jewish would not sit comfortably with some members of his family, and he worried they would try to talk him out of marrying her.
In 1932, Mercer won a contest to sing with the Paul Whiteman orchestra, but singing with the band did not help his situation significantly. He made his recording debut, singing with Frank Trumbauer&#x27;s Orchestra, on April 5 of that year. Mercer then apprenticed with Yip Harburg on the score for &quot;Americana,&quot; a Depression-flavored revue famous for &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; (not a Mercer composition), which gave Mercer invaluable training. While with Whiteman, he recorded two duets with fellow band member Jack Teagarden, &quot;Fare Thee Well to Harlem&quot; and &quot;Christmas Night in Harlem&quot;. Both are talk songs in a heavy Black accent. The latter was a best-selling record. After several songs which didn&#x27;t catch fire during his time with Whiteman, he wrote and sang &quot;Pardon My Southern Accent&quot; (1934). Mercer&#x27;s fortunes improved dramatically with a chance pairing with Indiana-born Hoagy Carmichael, already famous for the standard &quot;Stardust&quot;, who was intrigued by the &quot;young, bouncy butterball of a man from Georgia.&quot; Mercer, later well known for rapidly writing lyrics, spent a year laboring over the ones for &quot;Lazybones&quot;, which became a hit one week after its first radio broadcast, and each received a large royalty check of $1250. A regional song in pseudo-black dialect, it captured the mood of the times, especially in rural America. Mercer became a member of ASCAP and a recognized &quot;brother&quot; in the Tin Pan Alley fraternity, receiving congratulations from Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Cole Porter among others. Whiteman lured Mercer back to his orchestra (to sing, write comic skits and compose songs), temporarily breaking up the working team with Carmichael.

During the golden age of sophisticated popular song of the late 1920s and early &#x27;30s, songs were put into revues with minimal regard for plot integration. The 1930s saw a shift from revues to stage and movie musicals using song to further the plot. Demand diminished accordingly for the pure stand-alone songs that Mercer preferred. Thus, although he had established himself in the New York music world, when he was offered a job in Hollywood to compose songs and perform in low-budget musicals for RKO, he accepted and followed idol Bing Crosby west.

===Hollywood years===
Mercer moved to Hollywood in 1935, and began writing music for films. His first Hollywood assignment was a B-movie college musical, &quot;Old Man Rhythm&quot;, to which he contributed two songs and appeared in a small role. His next project, &quot;To Beat the Band&quot;, was a commercial flop, but it led to a meeting and a collaboration with Fred Astaire on the moderately successful song &quot;I&#x27;m Building Up to an Awful Let-Down&quot;.

Mercer landed into a hard-drinking circle, and began to drink more at parties and was prone to vicious outbursts when under the influence of alcohol, contrasting sharply with his ordinarily genial and gentlemanly behavior. Often he would assuage the guilt he felt for this behavior by sending roses the following day to the friend or acquaintance he had treated unkindly while drunk. Ironically, he would later say that he found the Hollywood nightlife lacking: &quot;Hollywood was never much of a night town. Everybody had to get up too early ... the movie people were in bed with the chickens (or each other).&quot;

Mercer&#x27;s first big Hollywood song, the satirical &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande&quot;, was inspired by a road trip through Texas (he wrote both the music and the lyrics). It was performed by Crosby in the film &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; in 1936, and from then on the demand for Mercer as a lyricist took off. His second hit that year was &quot;Goody Goody&quot;, music by Matty Malneck. In 1937, Mercer began working for Warner Bros., working with the composer Richard Whiting, soon producing his standard, &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;, followed by &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;, the opening number in the film &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; (1937). After Whiting&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack, Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren and wrote &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, which earned Mercer his first Oscar nomination for Best Song (1938). Another hit with Warren in 1938 was &quot;You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby&quot;. The pair also created &quot;Hooray for Spinach&quot;, a comic song produced for the film &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot; in 1939.

During a lull at Warners, Mercer revived his singing career. He joined Crosby&#x27;s informal minstrel shows put on by the &quot;Westwood Marching and Chowder Club&quot;, which included many Hollywood luminaries. Mercer worked on numerous duets for himself and Crosby to perform: several were recorded, and two, &quot;Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean&quot; (1938) a reworking of an old vaudville song, and &quot;Mister Meadowlark&quot; (1940), became hits.

In 1939, Mercer wrote the lyrics to a melody by Ziggy Elman, a trumpet player with Benny Goodman. The song was &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; and, although recorded by Crosby and Count Basie, it was the Goodman version with vocal by Martha Tilton and klezmer style trumpet solo by Elman that became a major hit. Years later, the title was inscribed on Mercer&#x27;s tombstone.

Mercer was invited to the &quot;Camel Caravan&quot; radio show in New York to sing his hits and create satirical songs, like &quot;You Ought to be in Pittsburgh&quot;, a parody of &quot;You Ought to be in Pictures&quot;, with the Benny Goodman orchestra, then becoming the emcee of the nationally broadcast show for several months. Two more hits followed shortly, &quot;Day In, Day Out&quot; and &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (both with music by Rube Bloom), and Mercer in short order had five of the top ten songs on the popular radio show &quot;Your Hit Parade.&quot; Mercer also started a short-lived publishing company during his stay in New York. Mercer undertook a musical, &quot;Walk with Music&quot; (originally called &quot;Three After Three&quot;), with Hoagy Carmichael, but it was critically panned and commercially unsuccessful.

Shortly thereafter, Mercer began working with Harold Arlen, who wrote jazz and blues-influenced compositions while Mercer wrote lyrics. Their first hit was &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; (1941), which Arthur Schwartz called &quot;probably the greatest blues song ever written.&quot;

They went on to compose &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot; (1941), &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot; (1944), &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; (1942), and &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; (1946), among others.

&quot;Come Rain&quot; was Mercer&#x27;s only Broadway hit, composed for the show &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot; with Pearl Bailey. &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; with music by Harry Warren, was a big smash for Judy Garland in the 1946 film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, and earned Mercer the first of his four Academy Awards for Best Song, after eight unsuccessful nominations.

Mercer re-united with Hoagy Carmichael with &quot;Skylark&quot; (1941), and, ten years later, the Oscar-winning &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening&quot; (1951). With Jerome Kern, Mercer created &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot; for Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth in the movie of the same name, as well as &quot;I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;.

Mercer founded Capitol Records in Hollywood in 1942, with the help of producer Buddy DeSylva and record store owner Glen Wallichs. He also co-founded Cowboy Records. As the founder active in the management of Capitol during the 40s, he signed many of its important recording artists, including Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole. It also gave him an outlet for his own recordings. His hit &quot;Strip Polka&quot; was its third release. But Mercer recorded not only his own songs but ones by others as well. His four million-sellers were his own &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot; and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe&quot;, and two by other composers, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Personality&quot;. One recording of a song that has lived on is his recording of &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot;, written by Allie Wrubel and Ray Gailbert for Disney&#x27;s 1946 movie, &quot;Song of the South&quot;. Mercer&#x27;s recording was a top hit for eight weeks in December 1947 and January 1948, reaching number 8. Today it continues to be the version most played on Sirius&#x27;s 40s satellite channel.

Mercer by the mid-1940s enjoyed a reputation as one of the premier Hollywood lyricists. He was adaptable, listening carefully and absorbing a tune and then transforming it into his own style. Like Irving Berlin, he was a close follower of cultural fashion and changing language, which in part accounted for the long tenure of his success. He loved many words (&quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;), including puns (&quot;Strip Polka&quot;), and current terms (&quot;G. I. Jive&quot;). He employed sound effects, as well, such as the train whistle sounds in &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe&quot;.

Mercer preferred to have the music first, taking it home and working on it. He claimed composers had no problem with this method provided that he returned with the lyrics.

Mercer was often asked to write new lyrics to already popular songs. The lyrics to &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, and &quot;Satin Doll&quot; were all written after the melodies had become hits. He was also asked to compose English lyrics to foreign songs, the most famous example being &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, based on the French song &quot;Les Feuilles Mortes&quot;.

===Radio programs===
In 1943, &quot;Johnny Mercer&#x27;s Music Shop&quot; was a summer replacement for &quot;The Pepsodent Show&quot; on NBC. Mercer was the star, and singers Ella Mae Morse and Jo Stafford were regulars on the program, with musical support from The Pied Pipers and Paul Weston and his orchestra. &quot;The Chesterfield Music Shop&quot;, a similar program in a 15-minute version, was broadcast in 1944.

===1950s–1970s===
In the 1950s, the advent of rock and roll cut deeply into Mercer&#x27;s natural audience, and dramatically reduced venues for his songs. Mercer wrote for several MGM films, including &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954) and &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (1958). He collaborated on three Broadway musicals in the 1950s—&quot;Top Banana&quot; (1951), &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1956), and &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1959).

His more successful songs of the 1950s include &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot; (sung by the Mills Brothers) and &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;. In 1961, he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Moon River&quot; for Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and for &quot;Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; both with music by Henry Mancini, and Mercer received his third and fourth Oscars for Best Song. The back-to-back Oscars were the first time a songwriting team had achieved that feat. Mercer, also with Mancini, wrote &quot;Charade&quot; for the 1963 romantic thriller of the same name. The Tony Bennett classic &quot;I Wanna Be Around&quot; was written by Mercer in 1962, as was the Frank Sinatra hit &quot;Summer Wind&quot; in 1965.

An indication of the high esteem in which Mercer was held can be observed in that he was the only lyricist to have his work recorded as a volume of Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s series of Song book albums. &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Song Book&quot; was released by Verve Records in 1964.

Mercer was humble about his work, attributing much of his success to luck and timing. He was fond of telling the story of how he was offered the job of doing the lyrics for Johnny Mandel&#x27;s music on &quot;The Sandpiper,&quot; only to have the producer turn his lyrics down. The producer offered the commission to Paul Francis Webster and the result was &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;, which became a huge hit, winning the 1965 Oscar for Best Original Song. However, Mercer and Mandel did collaborate on the 1964 song &quot;Emily&quot; from the film &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; starring Julie Andrews.

In 1969, Mercer helped publishers Abe Olman and Howie Richmond found the National Academy of Popular Music&#x27;s Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1971, Mercer presented a retrospective of his career for the &quot;Lyrics and Lyricists Series&quot; in New York, including an omnibus of his &quot;greatest hits&quot; and a performance by Margaret Whiting. It was recorded live as &quot;An Evening with Johnny Mercer&quot;. In 1974, he collaborated on the West End production &quot;The Good Companions&quot;. He also recorded two albums of his songs in London in 1974, with the Pete Moore Orchestra and with the Harry Roche Constellation, later compiled into a single album and released as &quot;...My Huckleberry Friend: Johnny Mercer Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer&quot;.

Late in his life, Mercer became friends with pianist Emma Kelly. He gave her the nickname &quot;The Lady of Six-Thousand Songs&quot; after challenging her, over several years, to play numerous songs he named. He kept track of the requests, and estimated she knew 6,000 songs from memory.

===Posthumous success===

In the last year of his life, Mercer became fond of pop singer Barry Manilow, in part because Manilow&#x27;s first hit record was &quot;Mandy&quot;, which was also the name of Mercer&#x27;s daughter Amanda. After Mercer&#x27;s death, his widow, Ginger Mehan Mercer, arranged to give some unfinished lyrics he had written to Manilow to possibly develop into complete songs. Among these was a piece titled &quot;When October Goes&quot;, a melancholy remembrance of lost love. Manilow applied his own melody to the lyric and issued it as a single in 1984, when it became a top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the United States. The song has since become a jazz standard, with notable recordings by Rosemary Clooney, Nancy Wilson, and Megon McDonough, among other performers.

==Singing style==
Well regarded also as a singer, with a folksy quality, Mercer was a natural for his own songs such as &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot;, &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot;, &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;, and &quot;Lazybones&quot;. He was considered a first-rate performer of his own work.

It has been said that he penned &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;—one of the great torch laments of all times—on a napkin while sitting at the bar at P. J. Clarke&#x27;s when Tommy Joyce was the bartender. The next day Mercer called Joyce to apologize for the line &quot;So, set &#x27;em up, Joe,&quot; explaining &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get your name to rhyme.&quot;

ATCO Records issued &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; in 1961, a duet album by Bobby Darin and Johnny Mercer with Billy May and his Orchestra, produced by Ahmet Ertegun.

==Personal life==
In 1931, Mercer married Ginger Meltzer, a chorus girl, later a seamstress; and in 1940, when he was 30, the Mercers adopted a daughter, Amanda (&quot;Mandy&quot;). In 1960, Mandy married Bob Corwin, who was a pianist for Peggy Lee, Anita O&#x27;Day, and Carmen McRae, and also Mercer&#x27;s long-time accompanist. They had a son, Jim Corwin, in 1961.

In 1941, Mercer began an affair with 19-year-old Judy Garland, while she was engaged to composer David Rose. Garland ended her involvement when she married Rose. In later years, Garland and Mercer rekindled their affair. Mercer stated that his song &quot;I Remember You&quot; was the most direct expression of his feelings for Garland.

Mercer died aged 66 on June 25, 1976, from an inoperable brain tumor, in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He was buried in Savannah&#x27;s historic Bonaventure Cemetery. The line-drawing caricature adorning his memorial bench is a reproduction of a self-portrait.

==Awards and legacy==
===Academy Awards===
Mercer won four Academy Awards on eighteen nominations for Best Original Song:
*1946: &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; (music by Harry Warren) for &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;
*1951: &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening&quot; (music by Hoagy Carmichael) for &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot;

*1962: &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (music by Henry Mancini) for &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;

Mercer was also nominated for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 Mancini collaboration &quot;Darling Lili&quot;.

===Other===
In 1980, the Songwriters Hall of Fame established the annual Johnny Mercer Award as its highest honor, for songwriters with a history of outstanding creative works. Mercer was honored by the United States Postal Service with his portrait placed on a stamp in 1996. Mercer&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1628 Vine Street is a block away from the Capitol Records building at 1750 Vine Street.

In 1983, Mercer earned a posthumous nomination for a Tony Award for Best Original Score for his original lyrics and for Gene de Paul&#x27;s original music and score with new songs by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn for the stage musical &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; at the 37th Tony Awards, but lost to Andrew Lloyd Webber and T. S. Eliot for &quot;Cats&quot;.

Mercer was given tribute in John Berendt&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. The 1997 film adaptation directed by Clint Eastwood features prominently Hoagy Carmichael/Johnny Mercer song &quot;Skylark&quot;, sung by k.d. lang. The movie soundtrack contains 14 Mercer songs performed by artists such as Alison Krauss, Paula Cole, and Cassandra Wilson; the film&#x27;s star, Kevin Spacey, sang Mercer&#x27;s 1942 hit &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;.

For the occasion of Mercer&#x27;s 100th birthday in 2009, Eastwood produced a documentary film about Mercer&#x27;s life and work called &quot;The Dream&#x27;s on Me&quot; (Turner Classic Movies). The film was nominated for a Primetime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Nonfiction Special.

&quot;The Complete Lyrics of Johnny Mercer&quot; was published by Knopf in October 2009. &quot;The Complete Lyrics&quot; contains the texts to nearly 1,500 of his lyrics, several hundred of them appearing in print for the first time.

In November 2009, a bronze statue of Mercer was unveiled in Ellis Square in Savannah, Georgia, his hometown and birthplace. It was commissioned by the Friends of Johnny Mercer.

The Johnny Mercer Collections, including his papers and memorabilia, are preserved in the library of Georgia State University in Atlanta. GSU occasionally holds events showcasing Mercer&#x27;s works.

On March 25, 2015, it was announced that Mercer&#x27;s version of the popular song &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot; would be inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry for the song&#x27;s &quot;cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation&#x27;s audio legacy&quot;. The music was written by Harold Arlen and the lyrics by Mercer. The song was nominated for the &quot;Academy Award for Best Original Song&quot; at the 18th Academy Awards in 1945 after being used in the film &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot;. In describing his inspiration for the lyrics, Mercer told the &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; radio documentary &quot;[my] publicity agent ... went to hear Father Divine and he had a sermon and his subject was &#x27;you got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Wow, that&#x27;s a colorful phrase!&#x27;&quot;

<text>Membrane proteins are common proteins that are part of, or interact with, biological membranes. Membrane proteins fall into several broad categories depending on their location. Integral membrane proteins are a permanent part of a cell membrane and can either penetrate the membrane (transmembrane) or associate with one or the other side of a membrane (integral monotopic). Peripheral membrane proteins are transiently associated with the cell membrane.

Membrane proteins are common, and medically important—about a third of all human proteins are membrane proteins, and these are targets for more than half of all drugs. Nonetheless, compared to other classes of proteins, determining membrane protein structures remains a challenge in large part due to the difficulty in establishing experimental conditions that can preserve the correct (native) conformation of the protein in isolation from its native environment.

== Function ==
Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions vital to the survival of organisms:
* Membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the cell&#x27;s internal and external environments.
* Transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane. They can be categorized according to the Transporter Classification database.
* Membrane enzymes may have many activities, such as oxidoreductase, transferase or hydrolase.
* Cell adhesion molecules allow cells to identify each other and interact. For example, proteins involved in immune response

The localization of proteins in membranes can be predicted reliably using hydrophobicity analyses of protein sequences, i.e. the localization of hydrophobic amino acid sequences.

===Integral membrane proteins===

Integral membrane proteins are permanently attached to the membrane. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents. They can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer:

* Integral polytopic proteins are transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane more than once. These proteins may have different transmembrane topology. These proteins have one of two structural architectures:
**Helix bundle proteins, which are present in all types of biological membranes;
** Beta barrel proteins, which are found only in outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, and outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
* Bitopic proteins are transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane only once. Transmembrane helices from these proteins have significantly different amino acid distributions to transmembrane helices from polytopic proteins.
* Integral monotopic proteins are integral membrane proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane and do not span the whole way across.

===Peripheral membrane proteins===

Peripheral membrane proteins are temporarily attached either to the lipid bilayer or to integral proteins by a combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic, and other non-covalent interactions. Peripheral proteins dissociate following treatment with a polar reagent, such as a solution with an elevated pH or high salt concentrations.

Integral and peripheral proteins may be post-translationally modified, with added fatty acid, diacylglycerol or prenyl chains, or GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol), which may be anchored in the lipid bilayer.

===Polypeptide toxins===

Polypeptide toxins and many antibacterial peptides, such as colicins or hemolysins, and certain proteins involved in apoptosis, are sometimes considered a separate category. These proteins are water-soluble but can undergo significant conformational changes, form oligomeric complexes and associate irreversibly or reversibly with the lipid bilayer.

== In genomes ==
Membrane proteins, like soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins, are common. It is estimated that 20–30% of all genes in most genomes encode for membrane proteins. For instance, about 1000 of the ~4200 proteins of &quot;E. coli&quot; are thought to be membrane proteins, 600 of which have been experimentally verified to be membrane resident. In humans, current thinking suggests that fully 30% of the genome encodes membrane proteins.

== In disease ==
Membrane proteins are the targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. Among the human diseases in which membrane proteins have been implicated are heart disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s and cystic fibrosis.

== Purification of membrane proteins ==
Although membrane proteins play an important role in all organisms, their purification has historically, and continues to be, a huge challenge for protein scientists. In 2008, 150 unique structures of membrane proteins were available, and by 2019 only 50 human membrane proteins had had their structures elucidated. In contrast, approximately 25% of all proteins are membrane proteins. Their hydrophobic surfaces make structural and especially functional characterization difficult. Detergents can be used to render membrane proteins water-soluble, but these can also alter protein structure and function. Making membrane proteins water-soluble can also be achieved through engineering the protein sequence, replacing selected hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic ones, taking great care to maintain secondary structure while revising overall charge.

Affinity chromatography is one of the best solutions for purification of membrane proteins. The polyhistidine-tag is a commonly used tag for membrane protein purification, and the alternative rho1D4 tag has also been successfully used.

<doc id="168370" wikidata="Q424204" url="?curid=168370" title="Transmembrane protein">
<text>A transmembrane protein is a type of integral membrane protein that spans the entirety of the cell membrane. Many transmembrane proteins function as gateways to permit the transport of specific substances across the membrane. They frequently undergo significant conformational changes to move a substance through the membrane. They are usually highly hydrophobic and aggregate and precipitate in water. They require detergents or nonpolar solvents for extraction, although some of them (beta-barrels) can be also extracted using denaturing agents.

The peptide sequence that spans the membrane, or the transmembrane segment, is largely hydrophobic and can be visualized using the hydropathy plot. Depending on the number of transmembrane segments, transmembrane proteins can be classified as single-pass membrane proteins, or as multipass membrane proteins. Some other integral membrane proteins are called monotopic, meaning that they are also permanently attached to the membrane, but do not pass through it.

==Types==

===Classification by structure===
There are two basic types of transmembrane proteins: alpha-helical and beta barrels. Alpha-helical proteins are present in the inner membranes of bacterial cells or the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, and sometimes in the bacterial outer membrane. This is the major category of transmembrane proteins. In humans, 27% of all proteins have been estimated to be alpha-helical membrane proteins.
Beta-barrel proteins are so far found only in outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, cell walls of gram-positive bacteria, outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts, or can be secreted as pore-forming toxins. All beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have simplest up-and-down topology, which may reflect their common evolutionary origin and similar folding mechanism.

In addition to the protein domains, there are unusual transmembrane elements formed by peptides. A typical example is gramicidin A, a peptide that forms a dimeric transmembrane β-helix. This peptide is secreted by gram-positive bacteria as an antibiotic. A transmembrane polyproline-II helix has not been reported in natural proteins. Nonetheless, this structure was experimentally observed in specifically designed artificial peptides.

===Classification by topology===

This classification refers to the position of the protein N- and C-termini on the different sides of the lipid bilayer. Types I, II, III and IV are single-pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on cell membranes). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen. The implications for the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.
==3D structure==

Membrane protein structures can be determined by X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy or NMR spectroscopy. The most common tertiary structures of these proteins are transmembrane helix bundle and beta barrel. The portion of the membrane proteins that are attached to the lipid bilayer (see annular lipid shell) consist mostly of hydrophobic amino acids.

Membrane proteins which have hydrophobic surfaces, are relatively flexible and are expressed at relatively low levels. This creates difficulties in obtaining enough protein and then growing crystals. Hence, despite the significant functional importance of membrane proteins, determining atomic resolution structures for these proteins is more difficult than globular proteins. As of January 2013 less than 0.1% of protein structures determined were membrane proteins despite being 20–30% of the total proteome. Due to this difficulty and the importance of this class of proteins methods of protein structure prediction based on hydropathy plots, the positive inside rule and other methods have been developed.

==Thermodynamic stability and folding==
===Stability of alpha-helical transmembrane proteins===
Transmembrane alpha-helical (α-helical) proteins are unusually stable judging from thermal denaturation studies, because they do not unfold completely within the membranes (the complete unfolding would require breaking down too many α-helical H-bonds in the nonpolar media). On the other hand, these proteins easily &quot;misfold&quot;, due to non-native aggregation in membranes, transition to the molten globule states, formation of non-native disulfide bonds, or unfolding of peripheral regions and nonregular loops that are locally less stable.

It is also important to properly define the &quot;unfolded state&quot;. The &quot;unfolded state&quot; of membrane proteins in detergent micelles is different from that in the thermal denaturation experiments. This state represents a combination of folded hydrophobic α-helices and partially unfolded segments covered by the detergent. For example, the &quot;unfolded&quot; bacteriorhodopsin in SDS micelles has four transmembrane α-helices folded, while the rest of the protein is situated at the micelle-water interface and can adopt different types of non-native amphiphilic structures. Free energy differences between such detergent-denatured and native states are similar to stabilities of water-soluble proteins (&lt; 10 kcal/mol).

===Folding of α-helical transmembrane proteins===
Refolding of α-helical transmembrane proteins &quot;in vitro&quot; is technically difficult. There are relatively few examples of the successful refolding experiments, as for bacteriorhodopsin. &quot;In vivo&quot;, all such proteins are normally folded co-translationally within the large transmembrane translocon. The translocon channel provides a highly heterogeneous environment for the nascent transmembrane α-helices. A relatively polar amphiphilic α-helix can adopt a transmembrane orientation in the translocon (although it would be at the membrane surface or unfolded &quot;in vitro&quot;), because its polar residues can face the central water-filled channel of the translocon. Such mechanism is necessary for incorporation of polar α-helices into structures of transmembrane proteins. The amphiphilic helices remain attached to the translocon until the protein is completely synthesized and folded. If the protein remains unfolded and attached to the translocon for too long, it is degraded by specific &quot;quality control&quot; cellular systems.

===Stability and folding of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins===
Stability of beta barrel (β-barrel) transmembrane proteins is similar to stability of water-soluble proteins, based on chemical denaturation studies. Some of them are very stable even in chaotropic agents and high temperature. Their folding &quot;in vivo&quot; is facilitated by water-soluble chaperones, such as protein Skp. It is thought that β-barrel membrane proteins come from one ancestor even having different number of sheets which could be added or doubled during evolution. Some studies show a huge sequence conservation among different organisms and also conserved amino acids which hold the structure and help with folding.

<text>Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus (, &quot;Antiochus the Pious, the Cyzicene&quot;) was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom. He was the son of Antiochus VII and Cleopatra Thea. He left the kingdom in 129 BC and went to the city of Cyzicus, but he returned in 116 BC to challenge his half-brother Antiochus VIII for power.

The siblings fought a twenty-year civil war. In 112 BC, Antiochus IX&#x27;s wife, Cleopatra IV, was killed by her sister Tryphaena, the wife of Antiochus VIII. Tryphaena herself died shortly afterwards. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; he was succeeded by his sons Seleucus VI and Demetrius III. Antiochus IX then took the capital Antioch and married his deceased wife&#x27;s sister Cleopatra Selene, who was herself the widow of Antiochus VIII. Seleucus VI continued the war against his uncle. Antiochus IX Eusebes Cyzicenus was killed in battle in 95 B.C.

==Biography==

The son of Antiochus VII and Cleopatra Thea, upon the death of his father in Parthia and his uncle Demetrius II&#x27;s return to power (129 BC), his mother sent him to Cyzicus on the Bosporus, thus giving him his nickname.

Following the death of his mother c. 121 BC, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus challenged his half-brother, Antiochus VIII, for power over Syria.

He returned to Syria in 116 BC to claim the Seleucid throne from Antiochus VIII, with whom he eventually divided Syria, that same year.

Antiochus IX was first married to Cleopatra IV, who was said to have been killed in 112 BC by her sister and rival Tryphaena, wife of Antiochus VIII. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC. Antiochus IX then captured Antioch and married his brother&#x27;s widow, Cleopatra Selene, who was the sister of Cleopatra IV.

Antiochus IX was subsequently killed in battle against Antiochus VIII&#x27;s son Seleucus VI later in 96 BC.

==Legacy==
Antiochus IX probably created the Iturean tetrarchy as an ally against Antiochus VIII.

<doc id="168372" wikidata="Q417736" url="?curid=168372" title="Peripheral membrane protein">
<text>Peripheral membrane proteins, or extrinsic membrane proteins, are membrane proteins that adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane with which they are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins.

The reversible attachment of proteins to biological membranes has shown to regulate cell signaling and many other important cellular events, through a variety of mechanisms. For example, the close association between many enzymes and biological membranes may bring them into close proximity with their lipid substrate(s). Membrane binding may also promote rearrangement, dissociation, or conformational changes within many protein structural domains, resulting in an activation of their biological activity. Additionally, the positioning of many proteins are localized to either the inner or outer surfaces or leaflets of their resident membrane.
This facilitates the assembly of multi-protein complexes by increasing the probability of any appropriate protein–protein interactions.

==Binding to the lipid bilayer==

Peripheral membrane proteins may interact with other proteins or directly with the lipid bilayer. In the latter case, they are then known as &quot;amphitropic&quot; proteins.
Some proteins, such as G-proteins and certain protein kinases, interact with transmembrane proteins and the lipid bilayer simultaneously. Some polypeptide hormones, antimicrobial peptides, and neurotoxins accumulate at the membrane surface prior to locating and interacting with their cell surface receptor targets, which may themselves be peripheral membrane proteins. 

The phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity, one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane (see lipid bilayer article for a more detailed structural description of the cell membrane). The inner and outer surfaces, or interfacial regions, of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 Å, although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides.
The hydrophobic inner core region of typical biological membranes may have a thickness of around 27 to 32 Å, as estimated by Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).
The boundary region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow, at around 3 Å, (see lipid bilayer article for a description of its component chemical groups). Moving outwards away from the hydrophobic core region and into the interfacial hydrophilic region, the effective concentration of water rapidly changes across this boundary layer, from nearly zero to a concentration of around 2 M.
The phosphate groups within phospholipid bilayers are fully hydrated or saturated with water and are situated around 5 Å outside the boundary of the hydrophobic core region.

Some water-soluble proteins associate with lipid bilayers &quot;irreversibly&quot; and can form transmembrane alpha-helical or beta-barrel channels. Such transformations occur in pore forming toxins such as colicin A, alpha-hemolysin, and others. They may also occur in BcL-2 like protein , in some amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides , and in certain annexins . These proteins are usually described as peripheral as one of their conformational states is water-soluble or only loosely associated with a membrane.

==Membrane binding mechanisms==

The association of a protein with a lipid bilayer may involve significant changes within tertiary structure of a protein. These may include the folding of regions of protein structure that were previously unfolded or a re-arrangement in the folding or a refolding of the membrane-associated part of the proteins. It also may involve the formation or dissociation of protein quaternary structures or oligomeric complexes, and specific binding of ions, ligands, or regulatory lipids. 

Typical amphitropic proteins must interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in order to perform their biological functions. These include the enzymatic processing of lipids and other hydrophobic substances, membrane anchoring, and the binding and transfer of small nonpolar compounds between different cellular membranes. These proteins may be anchored to the bilayer as a result of hydrophobic interactions between the bilayer and exposed nonpolar residues at the surface of a protein, by specific non-covalent binding interactions with regulatory lipids , or through their attachment to covalently bound lipid anchors. 

It has been shown that the membrane binding affinities of many peripheral proteins depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane with which they are associated.
===Non-specific hydrophobic association===
Amphitropic proteins associate with lipid bilayers via various hydrophobic anchor structures. Such as amphiphilic α-helixes, exposed nonpolar loops, post-translationally acylated or lipidated amino acid residues, or acyl chains of specifically bound regulatory lipids such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates. Hydrophobic interactions have been shown to be important even for highly cationic peptides and proteins, such as the polybasic domain of the MARCKS protein or histactophilin, when their natural hydrophobic anchors are present. 

===Covalently bound lipid anchors===
Lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to different fatty acid acyl chains on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane via palmitoylation, myristoylation, or prenylation. On the exoplasmic face of the cell membrane, lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and cholesterol. Protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process, as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein&#x27;s hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane. This process occurs within the beta-subunits of G-proteins. Perhaps because of this additional need for structural flexibility, lipid anchors are usually bound to the highly flexible segments of proteins tertiary structure that are not well resolved by protein crystallographic studies.

===Specific protein–lipid binding===

Some cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes by recognizing certain types of lipid found within a given membrane. Binding of a protein to a specific lipid occurs via specific membrane-targeting structural domains that occur within the protein and have specific binding pockets for the lipid head groups of the lipids to which they bind. This is a typical biochemical protein–ligand interaction, and is stabilized by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic interactions between the protein and lipid ligand. Such complexes are also stabilized by the formation of ionic bridges between the aspartate or glutamate residues of the protein and lipid phosphates via intervening calcium ions (Ca2+). Such ionic bridges can occur and are stable when ions (such as Ca2+) are already bound to a protein in solution, prior to lipid binding. The formation of ionic bridges is seen in the protein–lipid interaction between both protein C2 type domains and annexins..

===Protein–lipid electrostatic interactions===
Any positively charged protein will be attracted to a negatively charged membrane by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. However, not all peripheral peptides and proteins are cationic, and only certain sides of membrane are negatively charged. These include the cytoplasmic side of plasma membranes, the outer leaflet of bacterial outer membranes and mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, electrostatic interactions play an important role in membrane targeting of electron carriers such as cytochrome c, cationic toxins such as charybdotoxin, and specific membrane-targeting domains such as some PH domains, C1 domains, and C2 domains.

Electrostatic interactions are strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the solution. These interactions are relatively weak at the physiological ionic strength (0.14M NaCl): ~3 to 4 kcal/mol for small cationic proteins, such as cytochrome c, charybdotoxin or hisactophilin.

==Spatial position in membrane==
Orientations and penetration depths of many amphitropic proteins and peptides in membranes are studied using site-directed spin labeling, chemical labeling, measurement of membrane binding affinities of protein mutants, fluorescence spectroscopy, solution or solid-state NMR spectroscopy,
ATR FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray or neutron diffraction, and computational methods.

Two distinct membrane-association modes of proteins have been identified. Typical water-soluble proteins have no exposed nonpolar residues or any other hydrophobic anchors. Therefore, they remain completely in aqueous solution and do not penetrate into the lipid bilayer, which would be energetically costly. Such proteins interact with bilayers only electrostatically, for example, ribonuclease and poly-lysine interact with membranes in this mode. However, typical amphitropic proteins have various hydrophobic anchors that penetrate the interfacial region and reach the hydrocarbon interior of the membrane. Such proteins &quot;deform&quot; the lipid bilayer, decreasing the temperature of lipid fluid-gel transition. The binding is usually a strongly exothermic reaction. Association of amphiphilic α-helices with membranes occurs similarly. Intrinsically unstructured or unfolded peptides with nonpolar residues or lipid anchors can also penetrate the interfacial region of the membrane and reach the hydrocarbon core, especially when such peptides are cationic and interact with negatively charged membranes.

==Categories==

===Enzymes===
Peripheral enzymes participate in metabolism of different membrane components, such as lipids (phospholipases and cholesterol oxidases), cell wall oligosaccharides (glycosyltransferase and transglycosidases), or proteins (signal peptidase and palmitoyl protein thioesterases). Lipases can also digest lipids that form micelles or nonpolar droplets in water.

===Membrane-targeting domains (“lipid clamps&quot;)===

Membrane-targeting domains associate specifically with head groups of their lipid ligands embedded into the membrane. These lipid ligands are present in different concentrations in distinct types of biological membranes (for example, PtdIns3P can be found mostly in membranes of early endosomes, PtdIns(3,5)P2 in late endosomes, and PtdIns4P in the Golgi). Hence, each domain is targeted to a specific membrane.
*C1 domains and phorbol esters.
*C2 domains bind phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine or PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2.
*Pleckstrin homology domains, PX domains, and Tubby domains bind different phosphoinositides
*FYVE domains are more specific for PtdIns3P.
*ENTH domains bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2.
*ANTH domain binds PtdIns(4,5)P2.
*Proteins from ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family bind PtdIns(4,5)P2.
*Other phosphoinositide-binding proteins include phosphotyrosine-binding domain and certain PDZ domains. They bind PtdIns(4,5)P2.
*Discoidin domains of blood coagulation factors
*ENTH, VHS and ANTH domains

===Structural domains===
Structural domains mediate attachment of other proteins to membranes. Their binding to membranes can be mediated by calcium ions (Ca2+) that form bridges between the acidic protein residues and phosphate groups of lipids, as in annexins or GLA domains.

===Transporters of small hydrophobic molecules===
These peripheral proteins function as carriers of non-polar compounds between different types of cell membranes or between membranes and cytosolic protein complexes. The transported substances are phosphatidylinositol, tocopherol, gangliosides, glycolipids, sterol derivatives, retinol, fatty acids, water, macromolecules, red blood cells, phospholipids, and nucleotides.
*Glycolipid transfer proteins
*Lipocalins including retinol binding proteins and fatty acid-binding proteins
*Polyisoprenoid-binding protein, such as YceI protein domain
*Ganglioside GM2 activator proteins
*CRAL-TRIO domain (α-Tocopherol and phosphatidylinositol sec14p transfer proteins)
*Sterol carrier proteins
*Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins and STAR domains
*Oxysterol-binding protein

===Electron carriers===
These proteins are involved in electron transport chains. They include cytochrome c, cupredoxins, high potential iron protein, adrenodoxin reductase, some flavoproteins, and others.

===Polypeptide hormones, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides===
Many hormones, toxins, inhibitors, or antimicrobial peptides interact specifically with transmembrane protein complexes. They can also accumulate at the lipid bilayer surface, prior to binding their protein targets. Such polypeptide ligands are often positively charged and interact electrostatically with anionic membranes.

Some water-soluble proteins and peptides can also form transmembrane channels. They usually undergo oligomerization, significant conformational changes, and associate with membranes irreversibly. 3D structure of one such transmembrane channel, α-hemolysin, has been determined. In other cases, the experimental structure represents a water-soluble conformation that interacts with the lipid bilayer peripherally, although some of the channel-forming peptides are rather hydrophobic and therefore were studied by NMR spectroscopy in organic solvents or in the presence of micelles.

<text>The Seleucid king Seleucus V Philometor (Greek: Σέλευκος Ε΄ ὁ Φιλομήτωρ; 126/125 BC), ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom, was the eldest son of Demetrius II Nicator and Cleopatra Thea. The epithet &quot;Philometor&quot; means &quot;mother-loving&quot; and in the Hellenistic world usually indicated that the mother acted as co-regent for the prince.

==Biography==
Just before Antiochus VII Sidetes died fighting the Parthian Empire in late 129, the Parthian king Phraates II had released Demetrius II, who entered Syria in ca. September 129. This forced Seleucus V&#x27;s half-brother Antiochus IX to flee to Cyzicus. Cleopatra Thea remarried Demetrius and reunited him with his two sons, Seleucus V and Antiochus VIII.

The Parthians captured Antiochus VII&#x27;s son, also named Seleucus, and Laodice, Seleucus V&#x27;s sister, who had accompanied the fallen king on campaign. Phraates married Laodice, and showed great favor to Seleucus, son of Antiochus VII. While Demetrius II was preoccupied fighting the usurper Alexander II Zabinas, the Parthians sent this Seleucus back to Syria, hoping he could take the throne as their puppet king. The attempt failed, and he spent the rest of his life in Parthia.

Instead, after his father was murdered outside of Tyre in 125, Seleucus V claimed the throne as the eldest son of Demetrius II; however, he was soon killed by his own mother. According to Appian, Cleopatra Thea had aided in the death of Demetrius and feared that Seleucus V might avenge his father. This encouraged her to remove Seleucus in favor of his younger brother, Antiochus VIII.

<doc id="168377" wikidata="Q186472" url="?curid=168377" title="Folk rock">
<text>Folk rock is a fusion genre of rock music with heavy influences from pop, English and American folk music. It typically combines elements of folk and rock music together, it arose in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s. In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the folk music revival. Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds—several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles—attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire, adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was initially used in the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds&#x27; music.

The commercial success of the Byrds&#x27; cover version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and their debut album of the same name, along with Dylan&#x27;s own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; (1965), &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (1965), and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as Simon &amp; Garfunkel, to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as Buffalo Springfield, to form. Dylan&#x27;s controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.

During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock.
==Definition and etymology==
&quot;Folk rock&quot; refers to the blending of elements of folk and rock music, which arose in the U.S. and UK in the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands. Dylan also contributed to the creation of the genre, with his recordings utilizing rock instrumentation on the albums &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.

The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was coined by the journalist Eliot Siegel, who used it in an article in the June12, 1965, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. In his article, &quot;Folkswinging Wave On – Courtesy of Rock Groups&quot;, Siegel used the term principally to describe the music of the Byrds, who issued their debut album in the U.S. later that month. In the same article, he wrote that Billy J. Kramer, Jackie DeShannon and Sonny &amp; Cher had all started incorporating &quot;folk-oriented material on singles&quot;, and he listed Rising Sons, Joe and Eddie and the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful as new folk-rock acts.

===Folk revival===

The American folk-music revival began during the 1940s; building on the interest in protest folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, it reached a peak in popularity in the mid-1960s with artists such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. In 1948, Seeger formed the Weavers, whose mainstream popularity set the stage for the folk revival of the 1950s and early 1960s and also served to bridge the gap between folk, popular music, and topical song. The Weavers&#x27; sound and repertoire of traditional folk material and topical songs directly inspired the Kingston Trio, a three-piece folk group who came to prominence in 1958 with their hit recording of &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;. The Kingston Trio provided the template for a flood of &quot;collegiate folk&quot; groups between 1958 and 1962.

At roughly the same time as these &quot;collegiate folk&quot; vocal groups came to national prominence, a second group of urban folk revivalists, influenced by the music and guitar picking styles of folk and blues artist such as Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Brownie McGhee, and Josh White, also came to the fore. Many of these urban revivalists were influenced by recordings of traditional American music from the 1920s and 1930s, which had been reissued by Folkways Records; Harry Smith&#x27;s &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot; was particularly influential. While this urban folk revival flourished in many cities, New York City, with its burgeoning Greenwich Village coffeehouse scene and population of topical folk singers, was widely regarded as the centre of the movement. Out of this fertile environment came such folk-protest luminaries as Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, and Peter, Paul and Mary, many of whom would transition into folk rock performers as the 1960s progressed.
The vast majority of the urban folk revivalists shared a disdain for the values of mainstream American mass culture and led many folk singers to begin composing their own &quot;protest&quot; material. The influence of this folk-protest movement would later manifest itself in the sociopolitical lyrics and mildly anti-establishment sentiments of many folk rock songs, including hit singles such as &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Live for Today&quot;.

During the 1950s and early 1960s in the UK, a parallel folk revival referred to as the second British folk revival, was led by folk singers Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd. Both viewed British folk music as a vehicle for leftist political concepts and an antidote to the American-dominated popular music of the time. However, it was not until 1956 and the advent of the skiffle craze that the British folk revival crossed over into the mainstream and connected with British youth culture. Skiffle renewed popularity of folk music forms in Britain and led directly to the progressive folk movement and the attendant British folk club scene. Among the leading lights of the progressive folk movement were Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who would later form the folk rock band Pentangle in the late 1960s. Other notable folk rock artists with roots in the progressive folk scene were Donovan, Al Stewart, John Martyn and Paul Simon.

===The Beatles and the British Invasion===

Beginning in 1964 and lasting until roughly 1966, a wave of British beat groups, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, the Kinks, and Herman&#x27;s Hermits amongst others, dominated the U.S. music charts. These groups were all heavily influenced by American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, blues, and R&amp;B—musical genres they had been introduced to via homegrown British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singers, imported American records, and the music of the skiffle craze. These UK groups, known collectively as the British Invasion, reintroduced American youth culture to the broad potential of rock and pop music as a creative medium and to the wealth of musical culture to be found within the United States.

Of particular importance to the development of folk rock by the British Invasion were the subtle folk influences evident in such Beatles&#x27; compositions as &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot;, with the latter song being directly inspired by folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the opinion of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, writers who attempt to define the origins of folk rock &quot;don&#x27;t realise that the Beatles were responsible as far back as 1963&quot;. He cites &quot;She Loves You&quot; as one of the first examples where the Beatles introduced folk chord changes into rock music and so initiated the new genre. These songs were all influential in providing a template for successfully assimilating folk-based chord progressions and melodies into pop music. This melding of folk and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in the Beatles&#x27; music became even more explicit during 1965, with the release of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, a folk-derived song with introspective lyrics, again influenced by Dylan. Although the Beatles themselves utilized folk as just one of many styles evident in their music, the underlying folk influences in a number of their songs would prove to be important to folk rock musicians attempting to blend their own folk influences with beat music.

The effect that the music of these British bands, and the Beatles in particular, had on young Americans was immediate; almost overnight, folk—along with many other forms of homegrown music—became passé for a large proportion of America&#x27;s youth, who instead turned their attention to the influx of British acts. The influence of these acts also impacted on the collegiate folk and urban folk communities, with many young musicians quickly losing interest in folk music and instead embracing the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll derived repertoire of the British Invasion. Future members of many folk rock acts, including the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and Buffalo Springfield, all turned their backs on traditional folk music during 1964 and 1965 as a direct result of the influence of the Beatles and the other British Invasion bands. Author and music historian Richie Unterberger has noted that the Beatles&#x27; impact on American popular culture effectively sounded the death knell for the American folk music revival.

In addition to The Beatles, the two British groups that were arguably the most influential on the development of folk rock were the Animals and the Searchers. The Animals released a rock interpretation of the traditional folk song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; in the U.S. in August 1964. The song reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and stayed there for three weeks, selling over a million copies in just five weeks in the U.S. The band&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, which transmuted the song from an acoustic folk lament to a full-bore electric rock song, would go on to influence many folk rock acts but none more so than Dylan himself, who cited it as a key factor in his decision to record and perform with an electric rock band in 1965.

====Electric Twelve-String Guitar in Folk Music====
The Searchers were influential in popularizing the jangly sound of the electric twelve-string guitar. Many musicians in the collegiate and urban folk movements were already familiar with acoustic twelve-string guitars via the music of folk and blues singer Lead Belly. However, the Searchers&#x27; use of amplified twelve-strings provided another example of how conventional folk elements could be incorporated into rock music to produce new and exciting sounds. The Beatles&#x27; lead guitarist, George Harrison, also influenced this trend towards jangly guitars in folk rock with his use of a Rickenbacker twelve-string guitar on the Beatles&#x27; mid-1960s recordings. This relatively clean, jangly sound—without distortion or other guitar effects—became a cornerstone of folk rock instrumentation and was used in many American folk rock records made during 1965 and 1966.

===Other precursors===

Although folk rock mainly grew out of a mix of American folk revival and British Invasion influences, there were also a few examples of proto-folk rock that were important in the development of the genre. Of these secondary influences, Unterberger has cited the self-penned, folk-influenced material of San Francisco&#x27;s the Beau Brummels as arguably the most important. Despite their Beatlesque image, the band&#x27;s use of minor chords, haunting harmonies, and folky acoustic guitar playing—as heard on their debut single &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot;—was stylistically very similar to the later folk rock of the Byrds. Released in December 1964, &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1965, while its similarly folk-flavored follow-up, &quot;Just a Little&quot;, did even better, reaching number 8 on the U.S. singles chart. The high-profile success of the Beau Brummels&#x27; music was important in demonstrating that a hybrid of folk and rock could potentially be translated into mainstream commercial success.

Pre-dating the Beau Brummels&#x27; commercial breakthrough by almost two years, singer-songwriter Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s April 1963 single &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; marked, according to Unterberger, the earliest appearance of the ringing guitar sound that would become a mainstay of early folk rock. This use of cyclical, chiming guitar riffs was repeated on DeShannon&#x27;s late 1963 recording of her own composition &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;. The following year, both songs would become hits for the Liverpudlian band the Searchers, who chose to place even greater emphasis on the jangly guitar playing in the songs. In addition, a number of DeShannon&#x27;s songs from the period, including &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, displayed a greater degree of lyrical maturity and sensuality than was usual for pop songs of the time. This heightened degree of emotional introspection was inspired by her love of Bob Dylan&#x27;s folk songwriting and represents one of the first attempts by an American artist to absorb folk sensibilities into rock music.

In the UK, the folk group the Springfields (featuring Dusty Springfield) had been releasing folk-oriented material featuring full band arrangements since the early 1960s, including renditions of &quot;Lonesome Traveler&quot;, &quot;Allentown Jail&quot;, and &quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot;. Although these records owed more to orchestral pop than rock, they were nonetheless influential on up-and-coming folk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic. In mid-1965, folk singer-songwriter Donovan was also experimenting with adding electrified instrumentation to some of his folk and blues-styled material, as evidenced by songs such as &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond&quot; and &quot;Sunny Goodge Street&quot;. In spite of his folky persona and repertoire, Donovan himself had always considered himself a pop star, rather than a folk singer. As a result, he had been thinking of a way in which to introduce folk styled acoustic guitars and socially conscious lyrics into pop music for several years prior to his 1965 breakthrough as a recording artist. By January 1966, he had recorded the self-penned hit &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; with a full electric backing band.

Other bands and solo artists who were blurring the boundaries between folk and rock in the early 1960s include Judy Henske, Richard and Mimi Fariña, and the Mugwumps, the latter of which were a New York band featuring future members of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Also of note are the Australian band the Seekers, who had relocated to England in 1964 and reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; in February 1965. Unterberger has noted that, although it was not strictly a folk song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; was heavily influenced by Peter, Paul and Mary and featured a cyclical, twelve-string guitar part that sounded similar to the guitar style that Jim McGuinn of the Byrds would popularize later that same year.

There are also a few antecedents to folk rock present in pre-British Invasion American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, including Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1954 cover of the Bill Monroe bluegrass standard &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;; Buddy Holly&#x27;s self-penned material, which strongly influenced both Dylan and the Byrds; Ritchie Valens&#x27; recording of the Mexican folk song &quot;La Bamba&quot;; Lloyd Price&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll adaptation of the African-American folk song &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; (originally recorded by Mississippi John Hurt in 1928); Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll flavored renditions of traditional folk songs; and the folk and country-influenced recordings featured on the Everly Brothers&#x27; 1959 album &quot;Songs Our Daddy Taught Us&quot;.

==1960s==

===The Byrds===

The moment when all of the separate influences that served to make up folk rock finally coalesced into an identifiable whole was with the release of the Byrds&#x27; recording of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The term &quot;folk rock&quot; was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the band&#x27;s sound in June 1965, at roughly the same time as &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Within three months it had become the first folk rock smash hit, reaching number 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. The single&#x27;s success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a profusion of Byrds-influenced acts flooded the American and British charts. In particular, the Byrds&#x27; influence can be discerned in mid-1960s recordings by acts such as the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Barry McGuire, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane, the Turtles, We Five, Love, and Sonny &amp; Cher.

It was during the rehearsals at World Pacific that the band began to develop the blend of folk music and Beatles-style pop that would characterize their sound. However, this hybrid was not deliberately created; it evolved organically out of some of the band members&#x27; own folk music roots and their desire to emulate the Beatles. The band&#x27;s folk influences, lack of experience with rock music forms, and Beatleseque instrumentation all combined to color both their self-penned material and their folk derived repertoire. The band themselves soon realized that there was something unique about their music and, with Dickson&#x27;s encouragement, they began to actively attempt to bridge the gap between folk and rock.

Mr. Tambourine Man&#x27;s blend of abstract lyrics, folk-influenced melody, complex harmonies, jangly 12-string Rickenbacker guitar playing, and Beatles-influenced beat, resulted in a synthesis that effectively created the subgenre of folk rock. The song&#x27;s lyrics alone took rock and pop songwriting to new heights; never before had such intellectual and literary lyrics been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group.

Dylan&#x27;s material would provide much of the original grist for the folk rock mill, not only in the U.S. but in the UK as well, with many pop and rock acts covering his material in a style reminiscent of the Byrds. Their reworking of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, along with the Animals&#x27; rock interpretation of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; (itself based on Dylan&#x27;s earlier cover), helped to give Dylan the impetus to start recording with an electric backing band.

As the 1970s dawned, folk rock evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by the Byrds, but their influence could still be heard in the music of bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle. The Byrds themselves continued to enjoy commercial success with their brand of folk rock throughout 1965, most notably with their number 1 single &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;. By the start of 1966, however, the group had begun to move away from folk rock and into the new musical frontier of psychedelic rock. The folk rock sound of the Byrds has continued to influence many bands over the years, including Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Long Ryders, the Smiths, the Bangles, the Stone Roses, and Teenage Fanclub, among others.

===Bob Dylan===
Five days before the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record his song &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, Bob Dylan completed the recording sessions for his fifth album, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. Of the eleven tracks on the album, seven featured Dylan backed by a full electric rock band, in stark contrast to his earlier acoustic folk albums. Dylan&#x27;s decision to record with an electric backing band had been influenced by a number of factors, including the Beatles&#x27; coupling of folk derived chord progressions and beat music, the Byrds&#x27; rock adaptation of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; (which Dylan had heard at a Byrds&#x27; rehearsal in late 1964), and the Animals hit cover of &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;.

&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; was released on 22 March 1965, peaking at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and #1 on the UK Album Chart. The album&#x27;s blend of rhythm and blues-derived rock and abstract, poetic lyrics was immediately influential in demonstrating that intelligent lyrical content could be wedded with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. The songs on the album saw Dylan leaving folk music far behind. Even with this folkier, acoustic material, Dylan&#x27;s biting, apocalyptical, and often humorous lyrics went far beyond those of contemporary folk music, particularly the folk-protest music with which he had been previously associated.

On 20 July 1965, Dylan released the groundbreaking &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, a six-minute-long scathing put-down, directed at a down-and-out society girl, which again featured Dylan backed by an electric rock band. Released just as the Byrds&#x27; cover of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; topped the charts in the United States, the song was instrumental in defining the burgeoning folk rock scene and in establishing Dylan as a bona fide rock star, rather than a folksinger. &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; managed to reach the Top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic. Five days after the release of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, on 25 July 1965, Dylan made a controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, performing three songs with a full band. He was met with derisive booing and jeering from the festival&#x27;s purist folk music crowd, but in the years since the incident, Dylan&#x27;s 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the synthesis of folk and rock.

Dylan followed &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; with the wholly electric album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and the non-album single &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, which itself has been widely interpreted as a rebuke to the folk purists who had rejected his new electric music. Throughout 1965 and 1966, hit singles like &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, and &quot;I Want You&quot; among others, along with the &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; albums, proved to be hugely influential on the development and popularity of folk rock. Although Dylan&#x27;s move away from acoustic folk music served to outrage and alienate much of his original fanbase, his new folk rock sound gained him legions of new fans during the mid-1960s. The popularity and commercial success of the Byrds and Bob Dylan&#x27;s blend of folk and rock music influenced a wave of imitators and emulators that retroactively became known as the folk rock boom.

===Tom Wilson===
Although he started out as a jazz musician, the young, African-American Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson became known as the &quot;mid-wife of folk-rock&quot; for his seminal work behind the scenes. As Bob Dylan&#x27;s producer during the key transitional albums &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&quot;, &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, and &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, he was a key architect of Dylan&#x27;s electric sound. He is perhaps even better known, however, for first discovering Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the tail end of the folk movement and then transforming them into folk-rock superstars with the unauthorized rock remix that made a number one hit out of their previously underappreciated song, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;.

===Other musicians===
Music critic Richie Unterberger has noted that the commercial success of the Byrds&#x27; cover version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, along with Dylan&#x27;s own contributions to the genre on the albums &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, initiated an explosion of emulators and imitators. Their success led record producer Tom Wilson to add electric guitar, bass, and drums overdubs to &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;, a song which had been recorded by the folk duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel in 1964 and first released on their album &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;. The reissued single rose to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart in late 1965, became a hit around the world, and set the duo on one of the most successful careers in pop and rock music. Simon and Garfunkel have been described as &quot;folk-rock&#x27;s greatest duo, and one whose fame and influence would persist well beyond folk-rock&#x27;s heyday.&quot;

One of the first bands to craft a distinctly American sound in response to the British Invasion was the Beach Boys; while not a folk rock band themselves, they directly influenced the genre and at the height of the folk rock boom in 1966 had a hit with a cover of the 1920s West Indian folk song &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, which they had learned from the Kingston Trio, who had learned it from the Weavers.

Much of the early folk-rock music emerged during a time of general global upheaval, the Vietnam War, and new concerns for the world by young people. In the United States, the heyday of folk rock was arguably between the mid-sixties and the mid-seventies, when it aligned itself with the hippie movement and became an important medium for expressing radical ideas. Cities such as San Francisco, Denver, New York City and Phoenix became centers for the folk rock culture, playing on their central locations among the original folk circuits. The &quot;unplugged&quot; and simplified sound of the music reflected the genre&#x27;s connection to a critical view of a technological and consumerist society. Unlike pop music&#x27;s escapist lyrics, arguably a fantasy distraction from the problems in life, folk artists attempted to communicate concerns for peace, global awareness, and other touchstones of the era. Bands whose music was significantly folk rock in sound during the mid-to-late 1960s included Donovan, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, the Youngbloods, Love, and, in their early years, Jefferson Airplane.

In the mid-1960s, singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot began moving his folk songs into a folk-rock direction with recordings such as the percussion-driven &quot;Black Day in July&quot; about the 1967 Detroit riot. He would rise to top the charts in the 1970s with a number of his folk-rock recordings such as &quot;Sundown&quot; and &quot;Carefree Highway&quot; and eventually become known as a folk-rock legend. Some artists who originally produced with a harder edged rock sound found the ability to communicate more easily and felt more genuine in this method of delivery. In this category was Cat Stevens, who began in London much like the Byrds did in the United States but toned down the sound more frequently with acoustic instruments. He performed songs that contained concern for the environment, war, and the future of the world in general. The Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell won many Grammy Awards with her folk rock/pop songs.

==Related movements==
===British folk rock===

British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle. It uses traditional British music and self-penned compositions in a traditional style, and is played on a combination of traditional and rock instruments. This incorporation of traditional British folk music influences gives British folk rock its distinctly British character and flavour. It evolved out of the psychedelia-influenced folk rock of British acts such as Donovan, the Incredible String Band, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, but was also heavily influenced by such American folk rock bands as the Byrds, Love, and Buffalo Springfield. British folk rock was at its most significant and popular during the late 1960s and 1970s, when, in addition to Fairport and Pentangle, it was taken up by groups such as Steeleye Span and the Albion Band.

Steeleye Span, founded by Fairport Convention bass player Ashley Hutchings, was made up of traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate electrical amplification, and later overt rock elements, into their music. This, in turn, spawned the conspicuously English folk rock music of the Albion Band, a group that also included Hutchings. In Brittany folk rock was developed by Alan Stivell (who began to mix his Breton, Irish, and Scottish roots with rock music) and later by French bands like Malicorne. During this same period, folk rock was adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Cornwall, to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives.

===Country folk===

A subgenre originally arising from the early 1960s folk and country-influenced music of singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Bare, as well as from folk revivalist vocal groups like the Kingston Trio. During the late 1960s, many folk rock artists including Dylan, Ian and Sylvia, and the Byrds began to incorporate a strong country influence into their music, drawing heavily on Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens amongst others, resulting in the concurrent offshoot of country rock. This successful blending of country, folk and rock styles led to pioneering country folk records by folk-influenced singer-songwriters such as John Denver and Neil Young during the 1970s. Country folk music usually displays a softer, more &quot;laid-back&quot; feel than the majority of country music and is often complemented by introspective lyrics, thus preserving its folk singer-songwriter roots. Since the 1970s, the country folk subgenre has been perpetuated by artists including John Prine, Nanci Griffith, Kathy Mattea, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Iris DeMent.

===Celtic rock===

A subgenre of folk rock that combines traditional Celtic instrumentation with rock rhythms, often influenced by a wide variety of pop and rock music styles. It emerged from the electric folk music of the late 1960s and was pioneered by bands such as Horslips, who blended Gaelic mythology, traditional Irish music and rock. The British singer-songwriter Donovan was also influential in developing Celtic rock during the late 1960s, with his albums &quot;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;, &quot;Barabajagal&quot;, and &quot;Open Road&quot;, the latter of which actually featured a song entitled &quot;Celtic Rock&quot;.

The subgenre was further popularised in 1973 by Thin Lizzy, who had a hit with &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;, a traditional Irish song performed entirely in the rock idiom. Throughout the 1970s, Celtic rock held close to its folk roots, drawing heavily on traditional Celtic fiddle, pipe, and harp tunes, as well as traditional vocal styles, but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion. In the 1980s and beyond, Celtic rock was perpetuated by bands such as the Pogues, the Waterboys, Runrig, Black 47, and the Prodigals. A more recent folk rock band based in England is the BibleCode Sundays. Celtic rock is also popular in Spain where bands such as Celtas Cortos have had a large following since the early 1990s.

===Medieval folk rock===
Medieval folk rock developed as a subgenre of electric folk from about 1970 as performers, particularly in England, Germany and Brittany, adopted medieval and renaissance music as a basis for their music, in contrast to the early modern and nineteenth century ballads that dominated the output of Fairport Convention. This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span, and exemplified by their 1972 album &quot;Below the Salt&quot;. Acts in this area included Gryphon, Gentle Giant and Third Ear Band. In Germany Ougenweide, originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German electric folk. In Brittany, as part of the Celtic rock movement, medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from 1977 and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from 1979. However, by the end of the 1970s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved, like Gentle Giant and Gryphon, into the developing area of progressive rock. In the 1990s, as part of the wider resurgence of folk music in general, new medieval folk rock acts began to appear, including the Ritchie Blackmore project Blackmore&#x27;s Night, German bands such as In Extremo, Subway to Sally or Schandmaul and English bands like Circulus.

===Progressive folk rock===

In Britain the tendency to electrify brought several progressive folk acts into rock. This includes the acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, who became the electric combo T. Rex. Others, probably influenced by the electric folk pioneered by Fairport Convention from 1969, moved towards more traditional material, a category including Dando Shaft, Amazing Blondel, and Jack the Lad, an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne, who were one of the most successful UK bands of the early 1970s. Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived (but later reunited) Comus and, more successfully, Renaissance, who combined folk and rock with elements of classical music.

===Folk metal===

Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.

The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England, Cruachan from Ireland and Mago de Oz from Spain. Skyclad&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth&quot; was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan&#x27;s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.

The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music. A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups. A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments. Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy, mythology, paganism, history and nature.

<doc id="168387" wikidata="Q3353185" url="?curid=168387" title="Business intelligence">
<text>Business intelligence (BI) consists of strategies, methodologies, and technologies used by enterprises for data analysis and management of business information. Common functions of BI technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, dashboard development, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. 

BI tools can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help organizations identify, develop, and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights is assumed to potentially provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability, and help them take strategic decisions.

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals, and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is believed to be most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an &quot;intelligence&quot; that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.

Among their many uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.

BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as &quot;BI/DW&quot;
or as &quot;BIDW&quot;. A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitates decision support.

==History==
The earliest known use of the term &quot;business intelligence&quot; is in Richard Millar Devens&#x27; &quot;Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes&quot; (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker Sir Henry Furnese gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:
The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.

When Hans Peter Luhn, a researcher at IBM, used the term &quot;business intelligence&quot; in an article published in 1958, he employed the &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; definition of intelligence: &quot;the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal.&quot; 

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner analyst) proposed &quot;business intelligence&quot; as an umbrella term to describe &quot;concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems.&quot; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.

==Definition==

According to Solomon Negash and Paul Gray, business intelligence (BI) can be defined as systems that combine:
*Data gathering
*Data storage
*Knowledge management

with analysis to evaluate complex corporate and competitive information for presentation to planners and decision makers, with the objective of improving the timeliness and the quality of the input to the decision process.&quot;

According to Forrester Research, business intelligence is &quot;a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making.&quot; Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses information management (data integration, data quality, data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to &quot;data preparation&quot; and &quot;data usage&quot; as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.

Some elements of business intelligence are:

* Multidimensional aggregation and allocation
* Denormalization, tagging, and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with unstructured data sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting, and rolling forecasts
* Statistical inference and probabilistic simulation
* Key performance indicators optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

Forrester distinguishes this from the &quot;business-intelligence market&quot;, which is &quot;just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as reporting, analytics, and dashboards.&quot;

===Compared with competitive intelligence===
Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence (because they both support decision making), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes, and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, competitive intelligence can be considered as a subset of business intelligence.

===Compared with business analytics===
Business intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing (OLAP), an &quot;alerts&quot; tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.

==Unstructured data==
Business operations can generate a very large amount of data in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to Merrill Lynch, more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time. Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either unstructured or semi-structured.

The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry. According to projections from Gartner (2003), white-collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision-making. Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding, and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task, or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision-making.

Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.

===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===

There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon &amp; Nesavich, some of those are:

* Physically accessing unstructured textual data – unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.
* Terminology – Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop standardized terminology.
* Volume of data – As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.
* Searchability of unstructured textual data – A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon &amp; Nesavich, 2008) gives an example: &quot;a search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies&quot;.

===Metadata===
To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of metadata. Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content – e.g. summaries, topics, people, or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction.

== Generative AI ==
Generative business intelligence is the application of generative AI techniques, such as large language models, in business intelligence. This combination facilitates data analysis and enables users to interact with data more intuitively, generating actionable insights through natural language queries. Microsoft Copilot was for example integrated into the business analytics tool Power BI.

==Applications==
Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:

* Performance metrics and benchmarking inform business leaders of progress towards business goals. (Business process management).
* Analytics quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve data mining, process mining, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, predictive modeling, business process modeling, data lineage, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics. For example within banking industry, academic research has explored potential for BI based analytics in credit evaluation, customer churn management for managerial adoption 
* Reporting, dashboards and data visualization, executive information system, and/or OLAP
* BI can facilitate collaboration both inside and outside the business by enabling data sharing and electronic data interchange
* Knowledge management is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to learning management and regulatory compliance.

== Roles ==
Some common technical roles for business intelligence developers are:

* Business analyst
* Data analyst
* Data engineer
* Data scientist
* Database administrator
* Financial analyst

==Risk== 
In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent &quot;pure-play&quot; vendor or a consolidated &quot;mega-vendor&quot;. In 2019, the BI market was shaken within Europe for the new legislation of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) which puts the responsibility of data collection and storage onto the data user with strict laws in place to make sure the data is compliant. Growth within Europe has steadily increased since May 2019 when GDPR was brought. The legislation refocused companies to look at their own data from a compliance perspective but also revealed future opportunities using personalization and external BI providers to increase market share.

<doc id="168389" wikidata="Q170008" url="?curid=168389" title="Arithmetic progression">
<text>An arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference from any succeeding term to its preceding term remains constant throughout the sequence. The constant difference is called common difference of that arithmetic progression. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.

If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is formula_1 and the common difference of successive members is formula_2, then the formula_3-th term of the sequence (formula_4) is given by
:formula_5
A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series.

== History ==
According to an anecdote of uncertain reliability, in primary school Carl Friedrich Gauss reinvented the formula formula_6 for summing the integers from 1 through formula_3, for the case formula_8, by grouping the numbers from both ends of the sequence into pairs summing to 101 and multiplying by the number of pairs. Regardless of the truth of this story, Gauss was not the first to discover this formula. Similar rules were known in antiquity to Archimedes, Hypsicles and Diophantus; in China to Zhang Qiujian; in India to Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and Bhaskara II; and in medieval Europe to Alcuin, Dicuil, Fibonacci, Sacrobosco, and anonymous commentators of Talmud known as Tosafists. Some find it likely that its origin goes back to the Pythagoreans in the 5th century BC.

==Sum==

Computation of the sum 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14. When the sequence is reversed and added to itself term by term, the resulting sequence has a single repeated value in it, equal to the sum of the first and last numbers (2 + 14 = 16). Thus 16 × 5 = 80 is twice the sum.

The sum of the members of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series. For example, consider the sum:

:formula_9

This sum can be found quickly by taking the number &quot;n&quot; of terms being added (here 5), multiplying by the sum of the first and last number in the progression (here 2 + 14 = 16), and dividing by 2:

:formula_10

In the case above, this gives the equation:

:formula_11

This formula works for any arithmetic progression of real numbers beginning with formula_1 and ending with formula_4. For example,

:formula_14

=== Derivation ===

To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:
:formula_15
:formula_16
Rewriting the terms in reverse order:
:formula_17

Adding the corresponding terms of both sides of the two equations and halving both sides:
:formula_18
This formula can be simplified as:
:formula_19
Furthermore, the mean value of the series can be calculated via: formula_20:
:formula_21

The formula is essentially the same as the formula for the mean of a discrete uniform distribution, interpreting the arithmetic progression as a set of equally probable outcomes.

==Product==
The product of the members of a finite arithmetic progression with an initial element &quot;a&quot;1, common differences &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; elements in total is determined in a closed expression

:formula_22

where formula_23 denotes the Gamma function. The formula is not valid when formula_24 is negative or zero.

This is a generalization of the facts that the product of the progression formula_25 is given by the factorial formula_26 and that the product

:formula_27

for positive integers formula_28 and formula_3 is given by

:formula_30

===Derivation===

:formula_31
where formula_32 denotes the rising factorial.

By the recurrence formula formula_33, valid for a complex number formula_34,

:formula_35,

:formula_36,

so that

:formula_37

for formula_28 a positive integer and formula_39 a positive complex number.

Thus, if formula_40,

:formula_41,

and, finally,

:formula_42

===Examples===

;Example 1
Taking the example formula_43, the product of the terms of the arithmetic progression given by formula_44 up to the 50th term is
:formula_45

; Example 2
The product of the first 10 odd numbers formula_46 is given by
:formula_47 = 

==Standard deviation==

The standard deviation of any arithmetic progression is

:formula_48

where formula_49 is the number of terms in the progression and formula_50 is the common difference between terms. The formula is essentially the same as the formula for the standard deviation of a discrete uniform distribution, interpreting the arithmetic progression as a set of equally probable outcomes.

==Intersections==
The intersection of any two doubly infinite arithmetic progressions is either empty or another arithmetic progression, which can be found using the Chinese remainder theorem. If each pair of progressions in a family of doubly infinite arithmetic progressions have a non-empty intersection, then there exists a number common to all of them; that is, infinite arithmetic progressions form a Helly family. However, the intersection of infinitely many infinite arithmetic progressions might be a single number rather than itself being an infinite progression.

==Amount of arithmetic subsets of length &quot;k&quot; of the set {1...,n}==
Let formula_51 denote the number of arithmetic subsets of length formula_52 one can make from the set formula_53 and let formula_54 be defined as:

formula_55

Then:

formula_56

As an example, if formula_57 one expects formula_58 arithmetic subsets and, counting directly, one sees that there are 9; these are formula_59

<text>Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic polymer made from monomers of the aromatic hydrocarbon styrene. Polystyrene can be solid or foamed. General-purpose polystyrene is clear, hard, and brittle. It is an inexpensive resin per unit weight. It is a poor barrier to air and water vapor and has a relatively low melting point. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, with the scale of its production being several million tonnes per year. Polystyrene is naturally transparent, but can be colored with colorants. Uses include protective packaging (such as packing peanuts and optical disc jewel cases), containers, lids, bottles, trays, tumblers, disposable cutlery, in the making of models, and as an alternative material for phonograph records.

As a thermoplastic polymer, polystyrene is in a solid (glassy) state at room temperature but flows if heated above about 100 °C, its glass transition temperature. It becomes rigid again when cooled. This temperature behaviour is exploited for extrusion (as in Styrofoam) and also for molding and vacuum forming, since it can be cast into molds with fine detail. The temperatures behavior can be controlled by photocrosslinking.

Under ASTM standards, polystyrene is regarded as not biodegradable. It is accumulating as a form of litter in the outside environment, particularly along shores and waterways, especially in its foam form, and in the Pacific Ocean.

==History==
Polystyrene was discovered in 1839 by Eduard Simon, an apothecary from Berlin. From storax, the resin of the Oriental sweetgum tree &quot;Liquidambar orientalis&quot;, he distilled an oily substance, that he named styrol, now called styrene. Several days later, Simon found that it had thickened into a jelly, now known to have been a polymer, that he dubbed styrol oxide (&quot;Styroloxyd&quot;) because he presumed that it had resulted from oxidation (styrene oxide is a distinct compound). By 1845 Jamaican-born chemist John Buddle Blyth and German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann showed that the same transformation of styrol took place in the absence of oxygen. They called the product &quot;meta styrol&quot;; analysis showed that it was chemically identical to Simon&#x27;s Styroloxyd. In 1866 Marcellin Berthelot correctly identified the formation of meta styrol/Styroloxyd from styrol as a polymerisation process. About 80 years later it was realized that heating of styrol starts a chain reaction that produces macromolecules, following the thesis of German organic chemist Hermann Staudinger (1881–1965). This eventually led to the substance receiving its present name, polystyrene.

The company I. G. Farben began manufacturing polystyrene in Ludwigshafen, about 1931, hoping it would be a suitable replacement for die-cast zinc in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor vessel that extruded polystyrene through a heated tube and cutter, producing polystyrene in pellet form.

Ray McIntire (1918–1996), a chemical engineer of Dow Chemical, rediscovered a process first patented in early 1930s by Swedish inventor Carl Munters. According to the Science History Institute, &quot;Dow bought the rights to Munters&#x27;s method and began producing a lightweight, water-resistant, and buoyant material that seemed perfectly suited for building docks and watercraft and for insulating homes, offices, and chicken sheds.&quot; In 1944, Styrofoam was patented.

Before 1949, chemical engineer Fritz Stastny (1908–1985) developed pre-expanded PS beads by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane. These beads are the raw material for molding parts or extruding sheets. BASF and Stastny applied for a patent that was issued in 1949. The molding process was demonstrated at the Kunststoff Messe 1952 in Düsseldorf. Products were named Styropor.

The crystal structure of isotactic polystyrene was reported by Giulio Natta.

In 1954, the Koppers Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, developed expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam under the trade name Dylite. In 1960, Dart Container, the largest manufacturer of foam cups, shipped their first order.

== Structure and production ==
In chemical terms, polystyrene is a long chain hydrocarbon wherein alternating carbon centers are attached to phenyl groups (a derivative of benzene). Polystyrene&#x27;s chemical formula is ; it contains the chemical elements carbon and hydrogen.

The material&#x27;s properties are determined by short-range van der Waals attractions between polymer chains. Since the molecules consist of thousands of atoms, the cumulative attractive force between the molecules is large. When heated (or deformed at a rapid rate, due to a combination of viscoelastic and thermal insulation properties), the chains can take on a higher degree of confirmation and slide past each other. This intermolecular weakness (versus the high &quot;intramolecular&quot; strength due to the hydrocarbon backbone) confers flexibility and elasticity. The ability of the system to be readily deformed above its glass transition temperature allows polystyrene (and thermoplastic polymers in general) to be readily softened and molded upon heating. Extruded polystyrene is about as strong as an unalloyed aluminium but much more flexible and much less dense (1.05 g/cm3 for polystyrene vs. 2.70 g/cm3 for aluminium).

=== Production ===
Polystyrene is an addition polymer that results when styrene monomers polymerize (interconnect). In the polymerization, the carbon-carbon π bond of the vinyl group is broken and a new carbon-carbon σ bond is formed, attaching to the carbon of another styrene monomer to the chain. Since only one kind of monomer is used in its preparation, it is a homopolymer. The newly formed σ bond is stronger than the π bond that was broken, thus it is difficult to depolymerize polystyrene. About a few thousand monomers typically comprise a chain of polystyrene, giving a molar mass of 100,000–400,000 g/mol.

Each carbon of the backbone has tetrahedral geometry, and those carbons that have a phenyl group (benzene ring) attached are stereogenic. If the backbone were to be laid as a flat elongated zig-zag chain, each phenyl group would be tilted forward or backward compared to the plane of the chain.

The relative stereochemical relationship of consecutive phenyl groups determines the tacticity, which affects various physical properties of the material.

===Tacticity===

In polystyrene, tacticity describes the extent to which the phenyl group is uniformly aligned (arranged at one side) in the polymer chain. Tacticity has a strong effect on the properties of the plastic. Standard polystyrene is atactic. The diastereomer where all of the phenyl groups are on the same side is called &quot;isotactic&quot; polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.

====Atactic polystyrene====
The only commercially important form of polystyrene is &quot;atactic&quot;, in which the phenyl groups are randomly distributed on both sides of the polymer chain. This random positioning prevents the chains from aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any crystallinity. The plastic has a glass transition temperature &quot;T&quot;g of ≈90 °C. Polymerization is initiated with free radicals.

==== Syndiotactic polystyrene ====
Ziegler–Natta polymerization can produce an ordered &quot;syndiotactic&quot; polystyrene with the phenyl groups positioned on alternating sides of the hydrocarbon backbone. This form is highly crystalline with a &quot;T&quot;m (melting point) of . Syndiotactic polystyrene resin is currently produced under the trade name XAREC by Idemitsu corporation, who use a metallocene catalyst for the polymerisation reaction.

==Degradation==
Polystyrene is relatively chemically inert. While it is waterproof and resistant to breakdown by many acids and bases, it is easily attacked by many organic solvents (e.g. it dissolves quickly when exposed to acetone), chlorinated solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. Because of its resilience and inertness, it is used for fabricating many objects of commerce. Like other organic compounds, polystyrene burns to give carbon dioxide and water vapor, in addition to other thermal degradation by-products. Polystyrene, being an aromatic hydrocarbon, typically combusts incompletely as indicated by the sooty flame.

The process of depolymerizing polystyrene into its monomer, styrene, is called pyrolysis. This involves using high heat and pressure to break down the chemical bonds between each styrene compound. Pyrolysis usually goes up to 430 °C. The high energy cost of doing this has made commercial recycling of polystyrene back into styrene monomer difficult.

===Organisms===
Polystyrene is generally considered to be non-biodegradable. However, certain organisms are able to degrade it, albeit very slowly.

In 2015, researchers discovered that mealworms, the larvae form of the darkling beetle &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;, could digest and subsist healthily on a diet of EPS. About 100 mealworms could consume between 34 and 39 milligrams of this white foam in a day. The droppings of mealworm were found to be safe for use as soil for crops.

In 2016, it was also reported that superworms (&quot;Zophobas morio&quot;) may eat expanded polystyrene (EPS). A group of high school students in Ateneo de Manila University found that compared to &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot; larvae, &quot;Zophobas morio&quot; larvae may consume greater amounts of EPS over longer periods of time.

In 2022 scientists identified several bacterial genera, including &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Rhodococcus&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, in the gut of superworms that contain encoded enzymes associated with the degradation of polystyrene and the breakdown product styrene.

The bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; is capable of converting styrene oil into the biodegradable plastic PHA. This may someday be of use in the effective disposing of polystyrene foam. It is worthy to note the polystyrene must undergo pyrolysis to turn into styrene oil.

==Forms produced==
Polystyrene is commonly injection molded, vacuum formed, or extruded, while expanded polystyrene is either extruded or molded in a special process.
Polystyrene copolymers are also produced; these contain one or more other monomers in addition to styrene. In recent years the expanded polystyrene composites with cellulose and starch have also been produced. Polystyrene is used in some polymer-bonded explosives (PBX).

===Sheet or molded polystyrene===
Polystyrene (PS) is used for producing disposable plastic cutlery and dinnerware, CD &quot;jewel&quot; cases, smoke detector housings, license plate frames, plastic model assembly kits, and many other objects where a rigid, economical plastic is desired. Production methods include thermoforming (vacuum forming) and injection molding.

Polystyrene Petri dishes and other laboratory containers such as test tubes and microplates play an important role in biomedical research and science. For these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often sterilized post-molding, either by irradiation or by treatment with ethylene oxide. Post-mold surface modification, usually with oxygen-rich plasmas, is often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research relies on the use of such products; they, therefore, play a critical role in pharmaceutical research.

Thin sheets of polystyrene are used in polystyrene film capacitors as it forms a very stable dielectric, but has largely fallen out of use in favor of polyester.

===Foams===

Polystyrene foams are 95–98% air. Polystyrene foams are good thermal insulators and are therefore often used as building insulation materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated panel building systems. Grey polystyrene foam, incorporating graphite, has superior insulation properties.

Carl Munters and John Gudbrand Tandberg of Sweden received a US patent for polystyrene foam as an insulation product in 1935 (USA patent number 2,023,204).

PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark Styrofoam by Dow Chemical Company is informally used (mainly US &amp; Canada) for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for &quot;extruded closed-cell&quot; polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals.

Foams are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures (such as ornamental pillars).

====Expanded polystyrene (EPS)====


Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a rigid and tough, closed-cell foam with a normal density range of 11 to 32 kg/m3. It is usually white and made of pre-expanded polystyrene beads. The manufacturing process for EPS conventionally begins with the creation of small polystyrene beads. Styrene monomers (and potentially other additives) are suspended in water, where they undergo free-radical addition polymerization. The polystyrene beads formed by this mechanism may have an average diameter of around 200 μm. The beads are then permeated with a &quot;blowing agent&quot;, a material that enables the beads to be expanded. Pentane is commonly used as the blowing agent. The beads are added to a continuously agitated reactor with the blowing agent, among other additives, and the blowing agent seeps into pores within each bead. The beads are then expanded using steam.

EPS is used for food containers, molded sheets for building insulation, and packing material either as solid blocks formed to accommodate the item being protected or as loose-fill &quot;peanuts&quot; cushioning fragile items inside boxes. EPS also has been widely used in automotive and road safety applications such as motorcycle helmets and road barriers on automobile race tracks.

A significant portion of all EPS products are manufactured through injection molding. Mold tools tend to be manufactured from steels (which can be hardened and plated), and aluminum alloys. The molds are controlled through a split via a channel system of gates and runners. EPS is colloquially called &quot;styrofoam&quot; in the Anglosphere, an genericization of Dow Chemical&#x27;s brand of extruded polystyrene.

====EPS in building construction====
Sheets of EPS are commonly packaged as rigid panels (common in Europe is a size of 100 cm x 50 cm, usually depending on an intended type of connection and glue techniques, it is, in fact, 99.5 cm x 49.5 cm or 98 cm x 48 cm; less common is 120 x 60 cm; size or in the United States). Common thicknesses are from 10 mm to 500 mm. Many customizations, additives, and thin additional external layers on one or both sides are often added to help with various properties. An example of this is lamination with cement board to form a structural insulated panel.

Thermal conductivity is measured according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m⋅K) depending on the density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 W/(m⋅K) was obtained at 15 kg/m3 while the value of 0.032 W/(m⋅K) was obtained at 40 kg/m3 according to the datasheet of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers (graphites, aluminum, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030–0.034 W/(m⋅K) (as low as 0.029 W/(m⋅K)) and as such has a grey/black color which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK and EU.

Water vapor diffusion resistance (&quot;μ&quot;) of EPS is around 30–70.

ICC-ES (International Code Council Evaluation Service) requires EPS boards used in building construction meet ASTM C578 requirements. One of these requirements is that the limiting oxygen index of EPS as measured by ASTM D2863 be greater than 24 volume %. Typical EPS has an oxygen index of around 18 volume %; thus, a flame retardant is added to styrene or polystyrene during the formation of EPS.

The boards containing a flame retardant when tested in a tunnel using test method UL 723 or ASTM E84 will have a flame spread index of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450. ICC-ES requires the use of a 15-minute thermal barrier when EPS boards are used inside of a building.

According to the EPS-IA ICF organization, the typical density of EPS used for insulated concrete forms (expanded polystyrene concrete) is . This is either Type II or Type IX EPS according to ASTM C578. EPS blocks or boards used in building construction are commonly cut using hot wires.

==== Extruded polystyrene (XPS) ====
Extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) consists of closed cells. It offers improved surface roughness, higher stiffness and reduced thermal conductivity. The density range is about 28–34 kg/m3.

Extruded polystyrene material is also used in crafts and model building, in particular architectural models. Because of the extrusion manufacturing process, XPS does not require facers to maintain its thermal or physical property performance. Thus, it makes a more uniform substitute for corrugated cardboard. Thermal conductivity varies between 0.029 and 0.039 W/(m·K) depending on bearing strength/density and the average value is ≈0.035 W/(m·K).

Water vapor diffusion resistance (μ) of XPS is around 80–250.

Commonly extruded polystyrene foam materials include:
* Styrofoam, also known as Blue Board, produced by DuPont
* Depron, a thin insulation sheet also used for model building

==== Water absorption of polystyrene foams ====
Although it is a closed-cell foam, both expanded and extruded polystyrene are not entirely waterproof or vapor proof. In expanded polystyrene there are interstitial gaps between the expanded closed-cell pellets that form an open network of channels between the bonded pellets, and this network of gaps can become filled with liquid water. If the water freezes into ice, it expands and can cause polystyrene pellets to break off from the foam. Extruded polystyrene is also permeable by water molecules and can not be considered a vapor barrier.

Water-logging commonly occurs over a long period in polystyrene foams that are constantly exposed to high humidity or are continuously immersed in water, such as in hot tub covers, in floating docks, as supplemental flotation under boat seats, and for below-grade exterior building insulation constantly exposed to groundwater. Typically an exterior vapor barrier such as impermeable plastic sheeting or a sprayed-on coating is necessary to prevent saturation.

===Oriented polystyrene===
Oriented polystyrene (OPS) is produced by stretching extruded PS film, improving visibility through the material by reducing haziness and increasing stiffness. This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product. Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other clear plastics such as polypropylene (PP), (PET), and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage of OPS is that it is brittle, and will crack or tear easily.

==Co-polymers==
Ordinary (homopolymeric) polystyrene has an excellent property profile about transparency, surface quality and stiffness. Its range of applications is further extended by copolymerization and other modifications (blends e.g. with PC and syndiotactic polystyrene). Several copolymers are used based on styrene: The brittleness of homopolymeric polystyrene is overcome by elastomer-modified styrene-butadiene copolymers. Copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile (SAN) are more resistant to thermal stress, heat and chemicals than homopolymers and are also transparent. Copolymers called ABS have similar properties and can be used at low temperatures, but they are opaque.

=== Styrene-butane co-polymers ===
Styrene-butane co-polymers can be produced with a low butene content. Styrene-butane co-polymers include PS-I and SBC (see below), both co-polymers are impact resistant. PS-I is prepared by graft co-polymerization, SBC by anionic block co-polymerization, which makes it transparent in case of appropriate block size.

If styrene-butane co-polymer has a high butylene content, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is formed.

The impact strength of styrene-butadiene co-polymers is based on phase separation, polystyrene and poly-butane are not soluble in each other (see Flory–Huggins solution theory). Co-polymerization creates a boundary layer without complete mixing. The butadiene fractions (the &quot;rubber phase&quot;) assemble to form particles embedded in a polystyrene matrix. A decisive factor for the improved impact strength of styrene-butadiene copolymers is their higher absorption capacity for deformation work. Without applied force, the rubber phase initially behaves like a filler. Under tensile stress, crazes (microcracks) are formed, which spread to the rubber particles. The energy of the propagating crack is then transferred to the rubber particles along its path. A large number of cracks give the originally rigid material a laminated structure. The formation of each lamella contributes to the consumption of energy and thus to an increase in elongation at break. Polystyrene homo-polymers deform when a force is applied until they break. Styrene-butane co-polymers do not break at this point, but begin to flow, solidify to tensile strength and only break at much higher elongation.

With a high proportion of polybutadiene, the effect of the two phases is reversed. Styrene-butadiene rubber behaves like an elastomer but can be processed like a thermoplastic.

==== Impact-resistant polystyrene (PS-I) ====
PS-I (&quot;impact resistant polystyrene&quot;) consists of a continuous polystyrene matrix and a rubber phase dispersed therein. It is produced by polymerization of styrene in the presence of polybutadiene dissolved (in styrene). Polymerization takes place simultaneously in two ways:

* Graft copolymerization: The growing polystyrene chain reacts with a double bond of the polybutadiene. As a result, several polystyrene chains are attached to one polybutadiene. 
** S represents in the figure the styrene repeat unit
** B the butadiene repeat unit. However, the middle block often does not consist of such depicted butane homo-polymer but of a styrene-butadiene co-polymer:

:::SSSSSS­SSSSSSS­SSSSSSBBSBBSB­SBBBBSB­SSBBBSBSSSSSSS­SSSSSSS­SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

By using a statistical copolymer at this position, the polymer becomes less susceptible to cross-linking and flows better in the melt. For the production of SBS, the first styrene is homopolymerized via anionic copolymerization. Typically, an organometallic compound such as butyllithium is used as a catalyst. Butadiene is then added and after styrene again its polymerization. The catalyst remains active during the whole process (for which the used chemicals must be of high purity). The molecular weight distribution of the polymers is very low (polydispersity in the range of 1.05, the individual chains have thus very similar lengths). The length of the individual blocks can be adjusted by the ratio of catalyst to monomer. The size of the rubber sections, in turn, depends on the block length. The production of small structures (smaller than the wavelength of the light) ensure transparency. In contrast to PS-I, however, the block copolymer does not form any particles but has a lamellar structure.

==== Styrene-butadiene rubber ====
Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is produced like PS-I by graft copolymerization, but with a lower styrene content. Styrene-butadiene rubber thus consists of a rubber matrix with a polystyrene phase dispersed therein. Unlike PS-I and SBC, it is not a thermoplastic, but an elastomer. Within the rubber phase, the polystyrene phase is assembled into domains. This causes physical cross-linking on a microscopic level. When the material is heated above the glass transition point, the domains disintegrate, the cross-linking is temporarily suspended and the material can be processed like a thermoplastic.

=== Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ===

Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is a material that is stronger than pure polystyrene.

===Others===
SMA is a copolymer with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene can be used for cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in solid phase peptide synthesis. Styrene-acrylonitrile resin (SAN) has a greater thermal resistance than pure styrene.

==Environmental issues==

===Production===
Polystyrene foams are produced using blowing agents that form bubbles and expand the foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane, which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact. Extruded polystyrene is usually made with hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-134a), which have global warming potentials of approximately 1000–1300 times that of carbon dioxide. Packaging, particularly expanded polystyrene, is a contributor of microplastics from both land and maritime activities.

===Environmental degradation===
Polystyrene is not biodegradeable but it is susceptible to photo-oxidation. For this reason commercial products contain light stabilizers.

===Litter===

Animals do not recognize polystyrene foam as an artificial material and may even mistake it for food.
Polystyrene foam blows in the wind and floats on water due to its low specific gravity. It can have serious effects on the health of birds and marine animals that swallow significant quantities. Juvenile rainbow trout exposed to polystyrene fragments show toxic effects in the form of substantial histomorphometrical changes.

===Reducing===

Restricting the use of foamed polystyrene takeout food packaging is a priority of many solid waste environmental organisations. Efforts have been made to find alternatives to polystyrene, especially foam in restaurant settings. The original impetus was to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), which was a former component of foam.

====United States====
In 1987, Berkeley, California, banned CFC food containers. The following year, Suffolk County, New York, became the first U.S. jurisdiction to ban polystyrene in general. However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry kept the ban from going into effect until at last it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties gained the majority of the county legislature. In the meantime, Berkeley became the first city to ban all foam food containers. As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States, including Portland, Oregon, and San Francisco had some sort of ban on polystyrene foam in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California, required restaurants to switch to disposable food containers that would biodegrade if added to food compost. In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban polystyrene foam food containers. Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine, which did so in 1990. In 1988, the first U.S. ban of general polystyrene foam was enacted in Berkeley, California.

On 1 July 2015, New York City became the largest city in the United States to attempt to prohibit the sale, possession, and distribution of single-use polystyrene foam (the initial decision was overturned on appeal). In San Francisco, supervisors approved the toughest ban on &quot;Styrofoam&quot; (EPS) in the US which went into effect 1 January 2017. The city&#x27;s Department of the Environment can make exceptions for certain uses like shipping medicines at prescribed temperatures.

The U.S. Green Restaurant Association does not allow polystyrene foam to be used as part of its certification standard. Several green leaders, including the Dutch Ministry of the Environment, advise people to reduce their environmental harm by using reusable coffee cups.

In March 2019, Maryland banned polystyrene foam food containers and became the first state in the country to pass a food container foam ban through the state legislature. Maine was the first state to officially get a foam food container ban onto the books. In May 2019, Maryland Governor Hogan allowed the foam ban (House Bill 109) to become law without a signature making Maryland the second state to have a food container foam ban on the books, but is the first one to take effect on 1 July 2020.

In September 2020, the New Jersey state legislature voted to ban disposable foam food containers and cups made of polystyrene foam.

====Outside the United States====

China banned expanded polystyrene takeout/takeaway containers and tableware around 1999. However, compliance has been a problem and, in 2013, the Chinese plastics industry was lobbying for the ban&#x27;s repeal.

India and Taiwan also banned polystyrene-foam food-service ware before 2007.

The government of Zimbabwe, through its Environmental Management Agency (EMA), banned polystyrene containers (popularly called &#x27;kaylite&#x27; in the country), under Statutory Instrument 84 of 2012 (Plastic Packaging and Plastic Bottles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2012 (No 1.)

The city of Vancouver, Canada, has announced its Zero Waste 2040 plan in 2018. The city will introduce bylaw amendments to prohibit business license holders from serving prepared food in polystyrene foam cups and take-out containers, beginning 1 June 2019.

In 2019, the European Union voted to ban expanded polystyrene food packaging and cups, with the law officially going into effect in 2021.

Fiji passed the Environmental Management Bill in December 2020. Imports of polystyrene products were banned in January 2021.

===Recycling===
In general, polystyrene is not accepted in curbside collection recycling programs and is not separated and recycled where it is accepted. In Germany, polystyrene is collected as a consequence of the packaging law (Verpackungsverordnung) that requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling or disposing of any packaging material they sell.

Most polystyrene products are currently not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30 kg/m3 to 330 kg/m3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications; many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. As of 2016, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK.

Recycled EPS is also used in many metal casting operations. Rastra is made from EPS that is combined with cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete foundations and walls. American manufacturers have produced insulating concrete forms made with approximately 80% recycled EPS since 1993.

=== Upcycling ===
A March 2022 joint study by scientists Sewon Oh and Erin Stache at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York found a new processing method of upcycling polystyrene to benzoic acid. The process involved irradiation of polystyrene with iron chloride and acetone under white light and oxygen for 20 hours. The scientists also demonstrated a similar scalable commercial process of upcycling polystyrene into valuable small-molecules (like benzoic acid) taking just a few hours.

===Incineration===
If polystyrene is properly incinerated at high temperatures (up to 1000 °C) and with plenty of air (14 m3/kg), the chemicals generated are water, carbon dioxide, and possibly small amounts of residual halogen-compounds from flame-retardants. If only incomplete incineration is done, there will also be leftover carbon soot and a complex mixture of volatile compounds. According to the American Chemistry Council, when polystyrene is incinerated in modern facilities, the final volume is 1% of the starting volume; most of the polystyrene is converted into carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat. Because of the amount of heat released, it is sometimes used as a power source for steam or electricity generation.

When polystyrene was burned at temperatures of 800–900 °C (the typical range of a modern incinerator), the products of combustion consisted of &quot;a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from alkyl benzenes to benzoperylene. Over 90 different compounds were identified in combustion effluents from polystyrene.&quot; The American National Bureau of Standards Center for Fire Research found 57 chemical by-products released during the combustion of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam.

==Safety==

===Health===
The American Chemistry Council, formerly known as the Chemical Manufacturers&#x27; Association, wrote in 2011:
From 1999 to 2002, a comprehensive review of the potential health risks associated with exposure to styrene was conducted by a 12-member international expert panel selected by the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment. The scientists had expertise in toxicology, epidemiology, medicine, risk analysis, pharmacokinetics, and exposure assessment. The Harvard study reported that styrene is naturally present in trace quantities in foods such as strawberries, beef, and spices, and is naturally produced in the processing of foods such as wine and cheese. The study also reviewed all the published data on the quantity of styrene contributing to the diet due to migration of food packaging and disposable food contact articles, and concluded that risk to the general public from exposure to styrene from foods or food-contact applications (such as polystyrene packaging and foodservice containers) was at levels too low to produce adverse effects.

Polystyrene is commonly used in containers for food and drinks. The styrene monomer (from which polystyrene is made) is a cancer suspect agent. Styrene is &quot;generally found in such low levels in consumer products that risks aren&#x27;t substantial&quot;. Polystyrene which is used for food contact may not contain more than 1% (0.5% for fatty foods) of styrene by weight. Styrene oligomers in polystyrene containers used for food packaging have been found to migrate into the food. Another Japanese study conducted on wild-type and AhR-null mice found that the styrene trimer, which the authors detected in cooked polystyrene container-packed instant foods, may increase thyroid hormone levels.

Whether polystyrene can be microwaved with food is controversial. Some containers may be safely used in a microwave, but only if labeled as such. Some sources suggest that foods containing carotene (vitamin A) or cooking oils must be avoided.

Because of the pervasive use of polystyrene, these serious health related issues remain topical.

===Fire hazards===
Like other organic compounds, polystyrene is flammable. Polystyrene is classified according to DIN4102 as a &quot;B3&quot; product, meaning highly flammable or &quot;Easily Ignited&quot;. As a consequence, although it is an efficient insulator at low temperatures, its use is prohibited in any exposed installations in building construction if the material is not flame-retardant. It must be concealed behind drywall, sheet metal, or concrete. Foamed polystyrene plastic materials have been accidentally ignited and caused huge fires and losses of life, for example at the Düsseldorf International Airport and in the Channel Tunnel (where polystyrene was inside a railway carriage that caught fire).

<text>Styrene is an organic compound with the chemical formula C6H5CH=CH2. Its structure consists of a vinyl group as substituent on benzene. Styrene is a colorless, oily liquid, although aged samples can appear yellowish. The compound evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations have a less pleasant odor. Styrene is the precursor to polystyrene and several copolymers, and is typically made from benzene for this purpose. Approximately 25 million tonnes of styrene were produced in 2010, increasing to around 35 million tonnes by 2018.
==Natural occurrence==
Styrene is named after storax balsam (often commercially sold as &quot;styrax&quot;), the resin of Liquidambar trees of the Altingiaceae plant family. Styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods (cinnamon, coffee beans, balsam trees and peanuts) and is also found in coal tar.

==History==
In 1839, the German apothecary Eduard Simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin (called &quot;storax&quot; or &quot;styrax&quot; (Latin)) of the American sweetgum tree (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;). He called the liquid &quot;styrol&quot; (now called styrene). He also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air, light, or heat, it gradually transformed into a hard, rubber-like substance, which he called &quot;styrol oxide&quot;.

By 1845, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann and his student John Buddle Blyth had determined styrene&#x27;s empirical formula: C8H8. They had also determined that Simon&#x27;s &quot;styrol oxide&quot; – which they renamed &quot;metastyrol&quot; – had the same empirical formula as styrene. Furthermore, they could obtain styrene by dry-distilling &quot;metastyrol&quot;. 

In 1865, the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer found that styrene could form a dimer, and in 1866 the French chemist Marcelin Berthelot stated that &quot;metastyrol&quot; was a polymer of styrene (i.e. polystyrene). Meanwhile, other chemists had been investigating another component of storax, namely, cinnamic acid. They had found that cinnamic acid could be decarboxylated to form &quot;cinnamene&quot; (or &quot;cinnamol&quot;), which appeared to be styrene. 

In 1845, French chemist Emil Kopp suggested that the two compounds were identical, and in 1866, Erlenmeyer suggested that both &quot;cinnamol&quot; and styrene might be vinylbenzene. However, the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin: the latter was optically active. Eventually, in 1876, the Dutch chemist van &#x27;t Hoff resolved the ambiguity: the optical activity of the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin was due to a contaminant.

==Industrial production==
===From ethylbenzene===
The vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene, and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production. As such, the two production processes are often highly integrated. Ethylbenzene is produced via a Friedel–Crafts reaction between benzene and ethene; originally this used aluminum chloride as a catalyst, but in modern production this has been replaced by zeolites.

====By dehydrogenation====
Around 80% of styrene is produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. This is achieved using superheated steam (up to 600 °C) over an iron(III) oxide catalyst. The reaction is highly endothermic and reversible, with a typical yield of 88–94%.

The crude ethylbenzene/styrene product is then purified by distillation. As the difference in boiling points between the two compounds is only 9 °C at ambient pressure this necessitates the use of a series of distillation columns. This is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene, requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system.

====Via ethylbenzene hydroperoxide====
Styrene is also co-produced commercially in a process known as POSM (Lyondell Chemical Company) or SM/PO (Shell) for styrene monomer / propylene oxide. In this process, ethylbenzene is treated with oxygen to form the ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. This hydroperoxide is then used to oxidize propylene to propylene oxide, which is also recovered as a co-product. The remaining 1-phenylethanol is dehydrated to give styrene:

===Other industrial routes===
==== Pyrolysis gasoline extraction ====
Extraction from pyrolysis gasoline is performed on a limited scale.

==== From toluene and methanol ====
Styrene can be produced from toluene and methanol, which are cheaper raw materials than those in the conventional process. This process has suffered from low selectivity associated with the competing decomposition of methanol. Exelus Inc. claims to have developed this process with commercially viable selectivities, at 400–425 °C and atmospheric pressure, by forcing these components through a proprietary zeolitic catalyst. It is reported that an approximately 9:1 mixture of styrene and ethylbenzene is obtained, with a total styrene yield of over 60%.

====From benzene and ethane====
Another route to styrene involves the reaction of benzene and ethane. This process is being developed by Snamprogetti and Dow. Ethane, along with ethylbenzene, is fed to a dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene. The dehydrogenation effluent is cooled and separated and the ethylene stream is recycled to the alkylation unit. The process attempts to overcome previous shortcomings in earlier attempts to develop production of styrene from ethane and benzene, such as inefficient recovery of aromatics, production of high levels of heavies and tars, and inefficient separation of hydrogen and ethane. Development of the process is ongoing.

== Laboratory synthesis ==
A laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid: 

Styrene was first prepared by this method.

==Polymerization==
The presence of the vinyl group allows styrene to polymerize. Commercially significant products include polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-butadiene latex, SIS (styrene-isoprene-styrene), S-EB-S (styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene), styrene-divinylbenzene (S-DVB), styrene-acrylonitrile resin (SAN), and unsaturated polyesters used in resins and thermosetting compounds. These materials are used in rubber, plastic, insulation, fiberglass, pipes, automobile and boat parts, food containers, and carpet backing.

==Hazards==
=== Autopolymerisation ===
As a liquid or a gas, pure styrene will polymerise spontaneously to polystyrene, without the need of external initiators. This is known as &quot;autopolymerisation&quot;. At 100 °C it will autopolymerise at a rate of ~2% per hour, and more rapidly than this at higher temperatures. As the autopolymerisation reaction is exothermic it can be self-accelerating, with a real risk of a thermal runaway, potentially leading to an explosion. Examples include the 2019 explosion of the tanker &quot;Stolt Groenland&quot;, explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company in 1999 and 2000 and overheating styrene tanks leading to the 2020 Visakhapatnam gas leak, which killed several people. The autopolymerisation reaction can only be kept in check by the continuous addition of polymerisation inhibitors.

=== Health effects ===
Styrene is regarded as a &quot;known carcinogen&quot;, especially in case of eye contact, but also in case of skin contact, of ingestion and of inhalation, according to several sources. Styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans, resulting from oxidation by cytochrome P450. Styrene oxide is considered toxic, mutagenic, and possibly carcinogenic. Styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed &quot;in vivo&quot; to styrene glycol by the enzyme epoxide hydrolase. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has described styrene to be &quot;a suspected toxin to the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and respiratory system, among others&quot;. 

On 10 June 2011, the US National Toxicology Program has described styrene as &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen&quot;. However, a STATS author describes a review that was done on scientific literature and concluded that &quot;The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between styrene exposure and any type of human cancer&quot;. Despite this claim, work has been done by Danish researchers to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and cancer. They concluded, &quot;The findings have to be interpreted with caution, due to the company based exposure assessment, but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry, mainly styrene, and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer, deserves attention&quot;. In 2012, the Danish EPA concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene. The US EPA does not have a cancer classification for styrene, but it has been the subject of their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. 

The National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services has determined that styrene is &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen&quot;. Various regulatory bodies refer to styrene, in various contexts, as a possible or potential human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers styrene to be &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;.

The neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision (although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study) and on hearing functions. Studies on rats have yielded contradictory results, but epidemiologic studies have observed a synergistic interaction with noise in causing hearing difficulties.

<doc id="168395" wikidata="Q281056" url="?curid=168395" title="Champions (role-playing game)">
<text>Champions is a role-playing game published by Hero Games designed to simulate a superhero comic book world. It was originally created by George MacDonald and Steve Peterson in collaboration with Rob Bell, Bruce Harlick and Ray Greer. The latest edition of the game uses the sixth edition of the Hero System, as revised by Steve Long, and was written by Aaron Allston. It was released in early 2010.

==Description==
&quot;Champions&quot;, first published in 1981, was inspired by &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Fantasy Trip&quot; as one of the first published role-playing games in which character generation was based on a point-buy system instead of random dice rolls. A player decides what kind of character to play, and designs the character using a set number of &quot;character points,&quot; often abbreviated as &quot;CP.&quot; The limited number of character points generally defines how powerful the character will be. Points can be used in many ways: to increase personal characteristics, such as strength or intelligence; to buy special skills, such as martial arts or computer programming; or to build superpowers, such as supersonic flight or telepathy. This point system was praised by reviewers for the balance it gave character generation over random dice rolls. The stats in &quot;Champions&quot; are Strength, Constitution, Body, Dexterity, Intelligence, Ego, and Presence.

Players are required not only to design a hero&#x27;s powers, but also the hero&#x27;s skills, disadvantages, and other traits. Thus, &quot;Champions&quot; characters are built with friends, enemies, and weaknesses, along with powers and abilities with varying scales of character point value for each. This design approach intends to make all the facets of &quot;Champions&quot; characters balanced in relation to each other regardless of the specific abilities and character features. Characters are rewarded with more character points after each adventure, which are then used to buy more abilities, or eliminate disadvantages.

== The system ==

Players can design custom superpowers using the &quot;Champions&quot; rules system. Rather than offering a menu of specific powers, &quot;Champions&quot; powers are defined by their effects. For instance, an energy blast is the same power regardless of whether it represents a laser beam, ice powers, or magic. The &quot;Champions&quot; rulebook includes rules governing many different types of generic powers which can then be modified to fit a player&#x27;s idea.

This allows players to simulate situations found in superhero stories. Like most comic book heroes, characters and villains are frequently knocked out of the fight but seldom killed. There are special rules for throwing heavy objects like aircraft carriers.

== History and other genres ==
The &quot;Champions&quot; system was adapted to a fantasy genre under the title &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; (the first playtest edition of &quot;Fantasy Hero&quot; appeared before &quot;Champions&quot; was published), with similar advantages and disadvantages to the original &quot;Champions&quot; game. In 1984, the rules for &quot;Champions&quot; began being adapted into generic role-playing game system called the Hero System, although no formal and separate generic release of this as a standalone system would occur until 1990; instead the &quot;Champions&quot; rules would be edited down, expanded, and otherwise adapted on an individual basis for a variety of different genre treatments, such as pulp and modern espionage. &quot;Champions&quot; now exists as a genre sourcebook for the Hero System. Books for other genres have also appeared over the years, including &quot;Star Hero&quot;, &quot;Dark Champions&quot;, &quot;Pulp Hero&quot;, and &quot;Ninja Hero&quot;.

==Character archetypes and designs==

===Archetypes===
While &quot;Champions&quot; does not use &quot;character classes&quot; as some RPGs do, it defines common superhero archetypes as found in comic books. These are based variably on how they use their powers in combat, motivation, or the powers&#x27; origin. As listed in the &quot;Champions&quot; genre book, they are:

*&quot;Brick&quot; – slower hand-to-hand fighter who relies more on raw strength and tougher defenses (Hulk / Colossus)
*&quot;Energy Projector&quot; – primary combat ability is a ranged attack, which, despite the name, is not necessarily energy-based (Cyclops / Starfire)
*&quot;Gadgeteer&quot; – abilities based on technological devices (Brainiac 5 / Forge)
*&quot;Martial Artist&quot; (or &quot;martist&quot; for short) – lightly armored hand-to-hand combatant who fights with skill, quickness, and agility (Daredevil / Wolverine / Batman)
*&quot;Mentalist&quot; – abilities target the mind, not the physical foe (Professor X / Jean Grey)
*&quot;Metamorph&quot; – abilities involving changes in shape and/or size (Plastic Man / Mystique)
*&quot;Mystic&quot; – trained in the use of magic, or with abilities or items with magical properties (Doctor Fate / Doctor Strange)
*&quot;Patriot&quot; – an embodiment of his or her nation (Captain America / Captain Britain)
*&quot;Powered Armor&quot; – a variant of a Gadgeteer, who uses an &quot;all-in-one&quot; gadget worn as armor (Iron Man / Cyborg)
*&quot;Sink&quot; – with primary abilities being drains or transfers, a &quot;Sink&quot; can diminish, nullify or steal another characters powers, abilities or stats, either temporarily or permanently. (Rogue / Parasite)
*&quot;Speedster&quot; – with abilities based around movement (The Flash / Quicksilver)
*&quot;Weaponmaster&quot; – with expertise at using a particular type of weapon (Green Arrow / Swordsman)
It is possible for a character to fall into multiple categories, such as Superman (brick/energy projector/speedster/patriot), Batman (martial artist/gadgeteer), or Spider-Man (martial artist/speedster/gadgeteer). It is also common for characters not to fall into any easily defined category—these categories are simply to provide easy definition and have no impact on gameplay.

===The Champions Team===
The Champions superhero team is presented as an example of how to build a well-balanced team in terms of game mechanics, including the hero Flare. Their enemies include Foxbat and Doctor Destroyer.

==MMORPG==

A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the license was announced by Cryptic Studios, who had developed the popular &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and then reinvented Marvel Universe Online to &quot;Marvel Heroes&quot;. The game was released in September 2009. The game takes place in the established &quot;Champions&quot; universe and features classic &quot;Champions&quot; heroes and villains as NPCs.

==Flextiles game supplement==
&quot;Flextiles&quot; is a 1983 role-playing supplement for Champions. It is published by Hero. Craig Sheeley for &quot;Space Gamer&quot;. commented in a review that &quot;...the &quot;Flextile&quot; concept is a good idea, but not at the price &quot;Flextiles&quot; sell for now. Cut the cost [...] and they&#x27;d be much better.&quot;

==Reception==
In the January 1982 edition of &quot;Ares&quot;, Eric Goldberg noted the &quot;sketchy&quot; design of the first edition, and yet believed that &quot;in many ways, it is sufficient... What enables the designers to get away with this minimalist approach is an unswerving devotion to the philosophy and to the spirit of the superhero comic, which itself has never pretended to be terribly complex.&quot;

In the April–May 1982 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, Dave Morris liked the first edition combat system, calling it &quot;a good simulation of comic-book battles&quot;. But Morris questioned whether players would enjoy playing superheroes rather than more ordinary characters found in most other role-playing games. He gave the game an average rating of 7 out of 10, saying, &quot;All the same, the occasional bout of world-saving might be enjoyable, and &quot;Champions&quot; is worth buying on this basis alone.&quot;

Reviews for two editions of the game appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot;:
* In the January 1982 edition, Scott Bennie liked the well-written and concise text of the first edition, but noticed many gaps and holes in the rules, including a lack of any system for buying equipment. Nevertheless, Bennie gave the game a thumbs up, saying, &quot;Despite these flaws, I heartily recommend &quot;Champions&quot;. The more serious gamer will undoubtedly be put off by the silliness, and not everyone has a comic-book mind. But if you like this sort of thing, &quot;Champions&quot; is for you!&quot; 
* In the October 1990 edition, Allen Varney disliked the slow pace of the 4th edition combat system. But he concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;Fans of previous editions will delight in the new consistency and versatility. Experienced players of other games, discontent with the arbitrary restrictions of their current system, should also find the HERO SYSTEM rules a superb investment. Lastly, for comic-book fans who want to simulate every maneuver they see in their favorite stories, the &quot;Champions&quot; game remains, after almost 10 years, the system to beat.&quot;

Reviews for various editions of the game appeared in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;: 
*In the September 1981 edition, Aaron Allston recommended the first edition of the game for those interested in the superhero theme, saying &quot;If the subject matter interests you, I&#x27;d wholeheartedly recommend this product.&quot;
* In the September–October 1983 edition, Russell Grant Collins wasn&#x27;t sure if readers should buy the second edition: &quot;Should you buy this material? I think so, if you are interested in superhero RPGs. If you hated the original &quot;Champions&quot; rules for more than their slight omissions and loopholes, don&#x27;t bother. The changes aren&#x27;t all that significant. If you&#x27;re happy with the old version, weigh your decision carefully.&quot;
* In the March–April 1985 edition, Allen Varney recommended the third edition for everyone, saying, &quot;&quot;Champions&quot; is the only superhero RPG I would recommend; and this edition of &quot;Champions&quot; is the one to buy.&quot;
* In the October–November 1989 edition, Dave Rogers reviewed the fourth edition of &quot;Champions&quot; and recommended it, saying, &quot;even if you have all the Hero Games products ever printed, it still has something new to offer. Now, it&#x27;s the only role-playing game you&#x27;ll ever need.&quot;

Ken Cliffe reviewed the 4th edition of &quot;Champions&quot; for &quot;White Wolf&quot;, rating it 3 out of 5 overall, and stated that &quot;I recommend this book to anyone already familiar with the hero system, and suggest the Champions game to anyone who enjoys exact, complicated role-playing. To those looking for slick, fun role-playing, I say look to other SHRPGs and other game systems.&quot;

In February 1989&#x27;s issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, John Woods reviewed the 4th edition of the game and called the rules &quot;a model of clarity&quot;, although he criticized the lack of an index. He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;One of the best aspects of this type of game is that you don’t need anything more than the rulebook and a little imagination to start playing a fast moving game where the future of the world lies in your hands!&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan commented, &quot;In addition to being one of the oldest superhero RPGs, &quot;Champions&quot; is easily the biggest and arguably the best.&quot; Swan noted that the character generation system &quot;gives players near-total freedom in assembling the superhero of their dreams.&quot; However, he found that the combat system &quot;is the game&#x27;s weakest features, a seemingly endless array of numbers, formulas and tables that&#x27;s all but certain to discourage first-timers.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;Of all the superhero RPGs, &quot;Champions&quot; remains the connoisseur&#x27;s choice.&quot; 

In a 1996 reader poll taken by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Champions&quot; was ranked 27th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the first superhero RPG and it never had licensed links to any big-name comics – but it&#x27;s still the classic of the genre. It popularised the now-commonplace &#x27;points-design&#x27; approach to character creation; in fact, it&#x27;s probably the most flexible, detailed points-based system ever, which makes it rather overwhelming for some new players, and combat can be a little slow. But once you&#x27;ve learned how to use it, no other game catches the feeling of superhero action in quite the same way.&quot;

&quot;Champions&quot; was included in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Game designer Bill Bridges described &quot;Champions&quot; as &quot;&quot;the&quot; superhero roleplaying game. While it wasn&#x27;t the first game on the market that let you play superheroes and duke it out with supervillains, using earth-shattering powers, it was the most innovative. The major roleplaying games of the time involved characters stalking monsters in dungeons; the heroes in &quot;Champions&quot; delivered knockout blows to archnemeses—all while speaking the requisite inspiring soliloquies.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted that &quot;Champions&quot; was a pioneer in two respects. It &quot;is the first entirely new game to embrace the idea of non-random character generation through a point-buy system, and it marks a significant expansion of the concept.&quot; The second new concept was &quot;the idea of disadvantages.&quot;

== In other media ==
=== Comics ===
Starting in June 1986, a comic book limited series was published by Eclipse Comics based on characters from the first &quot;Champions&quot; campaign. The Eclipse series included character sheets that allowed readers to incorporate characters used in the comic books into their own &quot;Champions&quot; campaigns; this practice was also used in the &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; comic book limited series (also published by Eclipse in 1986–1987).

Soon after Eclipse&#x27;s initial limited series, an ongoing &quot;Champions&quot; series was published by Hero Comics (later Hero Graphics, later still Heroic Publishing) from 1987 to 1993.

As of 2024, Heroic Publishing was still publishing comics about some of the Champions characters (under the title &quot;League of Champions&quot;), although the publisher had long since parted ways with the makers of the game.
