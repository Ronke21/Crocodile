<text>Stanley Kirk Burrell (born March 30, 1962), better known by his stage name MC Hammer (or simply Hammer), is an American rapper known for hit songs such as &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;, &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; and &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot;, flashy dance movements, extravagant choreography and his eponymous Hammer pants. Remembered for a rapid rise to fame, Hammer has also been an entrepreneur and celebrity spokesperson. A multi-award winner, Hammer is considered a &quot;forefather&quot; and pioneering innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music).

Born and raised in Oakland, California, Hammer served three years in the United States Navy before independently releasing his debut album &quot;Feel My Power&quot; in 1986. After signing a contract with Capitol Records, Hammer released his second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; in 1988, which became his first multi-platinum hit. Hammer became the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status with his next album &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot; (1990), helping him become one of the most prominent media celebrities of the early 1990s. After being labeled a sellout by the changing landscape of hip hop music which led to declining record sales for his fourth album, &quot;Too Legit To Quit&quot; (1992), Hammer unsuccessfully attempted to appeal to the rise of gangsta rap with his next album, &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot; (1994). However, due to commercial overexposure, Hammer&#x27;s popularity waned by the mid-1990s, which led to a highly publicized bankruptcy beginning in 1996. He has since released five more albums.

Along with a Mattel doll and other merchandise, Hammer starred in a Saturday-morning cartoon called &quot;Hammerman&quot; in 1991. He became an ordained preacher during the late 1990s and hosted &quot;MC Hammer and Friends&quot;, a Christian ministry program on TBN. Hammer was also a dance judge on &quot;Dance Fever&quot; in 2003, was the co-creator of the dance website DanceJam.com, and was executive producer of his own reality show titled &quot;Hammertime&quot; (which aired on the A&amp;E Network during the summer of 2009).

Throughout his career, Hammer has managed his own recording business as a record label CEO. As a result, Hammer has created and produced his own acts/music including Ho Frat Hoo!, Oaktown&#x27;s 3.5.7, Special Generation, Analise, DRS, B Angie B, Gentry Kozia and Oakland Fight Club. A part of additional record labels, he has associated, collaborated and recorded with Psy, VMF, Tupac Shakur, Teddy Riley, Felton Pilate, Tha Dogg Pound, The Whole 9, The Hines Brother, Deion Sanders, Big Daddy Kane, BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans and Jon Gibson. Hammer signed with Suge Knight&#x27;s Death Row Records in 1995.

BET ranked Hammer as the No. 7 &quot;Best Dancer of All Time&quot;. &quot;Vibe&quot;″s &quot;The Best Rapper Ever Tournament&quot; declared him the 17th favorite of all-time during the first round. He continues to perform concerts at music venues and appears in television advertisements, along with participating in social media and ministry/outreach functions. Hammer is also active in community and sports activities, being interviewed locally and nationally.

== Early life and education ==
Stanley Kirk Burrell was born in Oakland, California, on March 30, 1962. His father was a professional poker player and gambling casino manager (at Oaks Card Club&#x27;s cardroom), as well as a warehouse supervisor. Hammer grew up poor with his mother (a secretary) and eight siblings in a small apartment in East Oakland. He recalled that six children were crammed into a three-bedroom housing project apartment. The Burrells would frequent thoroughbred horse races, eventually becoming owners and winners of several graded stakes.

In the Oakland Coliseum parking lot, the young Burrell would sell stray baseballs and dance accompanied by a beatboxer. Oakland Athletics team owner Charlie Finley saw the 11-year-old doing splits and hired Burrell as a clubhouse assistant and batboy as a result of his energy and flair. Burrell served as a &quot;batboy&quot; with the team from 1973 to 1980. In 2010, Hammer discussed his lifelong involvement with athletes on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot; as well as explained that his brother Louis Burrell Jr. (who would later become Hammer&#x27;s business manager) was actually the batboy while his job was to take calls and do &quot;play-by-plays&quot; for the A&#x27;s absentee owner during every summer game. The colorful Finley, who lived in Chicago, used the child as his &quot;eyes and ears&quot;. Reggie Jackson, in describing Burrell&#x27;s role for Finley, took credit for his nickname:

Team players, including Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Pedro García, also dubbed Burrell &quot;Little Hammer&quot; due to his resemblance to Aaron. Ron Bergman, at the time an &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; writer who covered the A&#x27;s, recalled that: He was an informant in the clubhouse, an informant for Charlie, and he got the nickname &quot;Pipeline&quot;. According to Hammer:
Burrell acquired the nickname &quot;MC&quot; for being a &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;, which he used when he began performing at various clubs while on the road with the A&#x27;s, and eventually in the military. Hammer, who played second base in high school, dreamed of being a professional baseball player but did not make the final cut at a San Francisco Giants tryout. However, he has been a participant and a player in the annual Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game, wearing an A&#x27;s cap to represent Oakland (American League).

Burrell went on to graduate from McClymonds High School in Oakland in 1980 and took undergraduate classes in communications. Discouraged by his studies at a local college and failing to win a place in a professional baseball organization, Burrell joined the United States Navy. He served with PATRON (Patrol Squadron) FOUR SEVEN (VP-47) of NAS Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, as a petty officer third class aviation storekeeper (AK3), until his honorable discharge after three years.

== Music and entertainment career ==
Before Hammer&#x27;s successful music career and &quot;rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga&quot;, Burrell formed a Christian rap group with singer and musician Jon Gibson known as the Holy Ghost Boy(s). Hammer and Tramaine Hawkins performed with Gibson&#x27;s band, in concerts at various venues such as the Beverly Theatre in Beverly Hills. Some early songs produced were &quot;Word&quot;, &quot;B-Boy Chill&quot; and &quot;Stupid Def Yal&quot; (1987). Hammer also produced &quot;Son of the King&quot; during this time, releasing it on his debut album &quot;Feel My Power&quot; (1986), as well as the re-released version &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; (1988). Additionally, &quot;The Wall&quot; featured Hammer (a song Burrell originally identified himself as MC Hammer), which was later released on Gibson&#x27;s album &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (1988). This was CCM&#x27;s first rap hit by a blue-eyed soul singer and/or duo.

In addition to later remixes of early releases, Hammer produced and recorded many rap songs that were never made public, yet are now available on the Internet. Through his record labels such as Bust It Records, Oaktown Records and Full Blast—Hammer has introduced, signed and/or produced new talent including: Oaktown&#x27;s 3.5.7, Ho Frat Hoo!, the vocal quintet Special Generation, Analise, James Greer, One Cause One Effect, B Angie B, The Stooge Playaz, DASIT as seen on &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s The (White) Rapper Show&quot;, Teabag, Common Unity, Geeman and Pleasure Ellis (all collaborating with him and/or producing music of their own during his career). At around age 12, Oakland native Keyshia Cole recorded with Hammer and sought career advice from him.

=== &quot;Feel My Power&quot; (1986) ===
In the mid-1980s, while rapping in small venues and after a record deal went sour, Hammer borrowed US$20,000 each from former Oakland A&#x27;s players Mike Davis and Dwayne Murphy to start an independent record label business. As the CEO of Bust It Productions, Hammer kept the company going by selling records from his basement and car. Bust It Records spawned Bustin&#x27; Records, and collectively the companies had more than 100 employees. Recording singles and selling them out of the trunk of his car, he marketed himself relentlessly. Coupled with his dance abilities, Hammer&#x27;s style was unique at the time.

Now billing himself as &quot;MC Hammer&quot;, he recorded songs for his debut album &quot;Feel My Power&quot; in 1986. It was originally released on Hammer&#x27;s independent label, Bustin&#x27; Records (via Oaktown Records), and produced by Felton Pilate of Con Funk Shun. It sold over 60,000 copies and was distributed by City Hall Records. Hammer released singles from the album, including &quot;Ring &#x27;Em&quot; in 1987. Largely on the strength of tireless street marketing by Hammer and his wife, in addition to continuous radio play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. In Spring 1988, Tony Valera (a 107.7 KSOL Radio DJ), played the track &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; in his mix-shows. The track also gained popularity in nightclubs. Hammer declared he was &quot;second to none from Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J or DJ Run&quot; within the song. He would continue to call out other East Coast rappers in future projects as well.

Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer&#x27;s stage show and his infectious stage presence that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an Oakland club. There, Hammer impressed a record executive who &quot;didn&#x27;t know who he was, but knew he was somebody&quot;, according to the &quot;New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Though Hammer had previously received and declined offers from major record labels before, he agreed to a multi-album contract with Capitol Records with a $1,750,000 advance. It did not take long for Capitol to recoup its investment.

=== &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; (1988) ===
Once signed to Capitol Records, Hammer re-issued his first record (a revised version of &quot;Feel My Power&quot;) with additional tracks added, which sold over two million copies. &quot;Pump It Up&quot; (also performed during &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; on September 16, 1989), &quot;Turn This Mutha Out&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; and &quot;They Put Me in the Mix&quot; were the most popular singles from this album (which all charted). Not entirely satisfied with this first multi-platinum success, Hammer&#x27;s music underwent a metamorphosis, shifting from the standard rap format. &quot;I decided the next album would be more musical,&quot; he said at the time. Purists chastised him for being more dancer than rapper. Sitting in a leopard-print bodysuit before a concert, he defended his style: &quot;People were ready for something different from the traditional rap style. The fact that the record has reached this level indicates the genre is growing.&quot;

Hammer was close friends with Arsenio Hall (as well as a then-unknown teen named Vanilla Ice, despite later rumors that there was a &quot;beef&quot; between the two rappers which was addressed during the height of both their careers on Hall&#x27;s show, and whom he would later reunite with in a 2009 concert in Salt Lake City, Utah), and as such, Hammer was first invited to perform the song &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;, prior to its release, on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in 1989. He also performed &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; which later appeared in the &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em: The Movie&quot; (1990).

Hammer used some of the proceeds from this album to install a rolling recording studio in the back of his tour bus, where Hammer recorded much of his second album. In 1989, Hammer was featured on &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Me Dancing&quot; with Glen Goldsmith, which appeared on Goldsmith&#x27;s album &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn This Groove Around&quot; via RCA Records. The track was Hammer&#x27;s first release in the UK. He also appeared in Glen Goldsmith&#x27;s music video for this song. The single failed to chart. During this period, Hammer formed the rap group Oaktown&#x27;s 3.5.7, releasing the No. 9 single &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!&quot; from the album &quot;Wild &amp; Loose&quot; (1989).

===&quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot; (1990)===
Hammer&#x27;s third album (and second major-label release), &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;, was released February 12, 1990 (with an original release date of January 1, 1990). It included the successful single &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; (which sampled Rick James&#x27; &quot;Super Freak&quot;). It was produced, recorded, and mixed by Felton Pilate and James Earley on a modified tour bus while on tour in 1989. Despite heavy airplay and a No. 27 chart debut, &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; stopped at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. However, the album was a No. 1 success for 21 weeks primarily due to this single, the first time ever for a recording on the pop charts. &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; has been and continues to be used in many films and television shows and also appears on soundtrack and compilation albums (such as &quot;Man of the House&quot; and &quot;Back 2 Back Hits&quot;).

Follow-up successes included a cover of the Chi-Lites&#x27; &quot;Have You Seen Her&quot; and &quot;Pray&quot; (a beat sampled from Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;), which was his biggest hit in the US, peaking at No. 2. &quot;Pray&quot; was also a major UK success, peaking at No. 8. The album went on to become the first hip-hop album to earn diamond status, selling more than 18 million units to date. During 1990, Hammer toured extensively in Europe which included a sold-out concert at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. With the sponsorship of PepsiCo International, Pepsi CEO Christopher A. Sinclair went on tour with him during 1991.

The album was notable for sampling other high-profile artists and gave some of these artists a new fan base. &quot;Dancin&#x27; Machine&quot; sampled The Jackson 5, &quot;Help the Children&quot; (also the name of an outreach foundation Hammer started) interpolates Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s Soft and Wet&quot; also sampled Prince&#x27;s &quot;Soft and Wet&quot;. All of the songs were complimented by the background vocals of his singing group, Special Generation: this combination of sound made this album to be successful on radio and video television, with &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This,&quot; &quot;Pray&quot; (most successful), &quot;Have You Seen Her&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Hammer&quot; and &quot;Yo!! Sweetness&quot; (UK only) all charting. The album increased the popularity of hip hop music. It remains the genre&#x27;s all-time best-selling album.

Music videos from this and previous albums began to receive much airplay on MTV and VH1. A movie also accompanied the album, and was produced in 1990, entitled &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em: The Movie&quot; (with portions of his music videos included within the movie). During this same time, Hammer also appeared in The West Coast Rap All-Stars posse cut &quot;We&#x27;re All in the Same Gang&quot;. Additionally, Hammer released the tracks &quot;This is What We Do&quot; on the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; movie soundtrack (1990), and &quot;That&#x27;s What I Said&quot; on the &quot;Rocky V&quot; soundtrack (1990).

A critical backlash began over the repetitive nature of his lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling entire hooks by others for the basis of his singles (criticisms also directed to his contemporary Vanilla Ice). He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their &quot;Sex Packets&quot; album, by placing Hammer&#x27;s picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q-Tip criticized him in &quot;Check the Rhime&quot;, saying: &quot;What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.&quot; LL Cool J dissed him in &quot;To da Break of Dawn&quot; (from his &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; album), calling Hammer an &quot;amateur, swinging a Hammer from a body bag [his pants]&quot; and stated: &quot;my old gym teacher ain&#x27;t supposed to rap.&quot; However, it could have been a response to Hammer calling him out in &quot;Let&#x27;s Get it Started&quot;, when he was mentioned along with Run-DMC and Doug E. Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer&#x27;s abilities/talents on VH-1&#x27;s&quot; 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;, which aired in 2008. Ice-T came to Hammer&#x27;s defense on his 1991 album &quot;O.G. Original Gangster&quot;: &quot;A special shout out to my man MC Hammer. A lot of people diss you man, but they just jealous.&quot; Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop rap from the start, but rather emcees who switch from being hardcore or &quot;dirty&quot; to pop rap, in order to sell more records. Despite the criticisms, Hammer&#x27;s career continued to be highly successful, including tours in Asia, Europe, Australia, and Russia. Soon after, M.C. Hammer Mattel dolls, lunchboxes and other merchandise were marketed. He was also given his own Saturday-morning cartoon, called &quot;Hammerman&quot;, which he hosted and voiced.

=== &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; (1991) ===
After publicly dropping the &quot;MC&quot; from his stage name, Hammer released &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; (also produced by Felton Pilate) in 1991. Hammer answered his critics within certain songs from the album. Sales were strong (over five million copies), with the title track being the biggest hit single from this record. The album peaked in the Top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Another hit came soon after, with &quot;Addams Groove&quot; (which appeared on both &quot;The Addams Family&quot; motion picture soundtrack and the vinyl and cassette versions of &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot;), reaching No. 7 in the US and No. 4 in the UK. His video for the song appeared after the movie.

Hammer set out on a high-profile tour promoting the album which included a stage show ⁠loaded with singers, dancers and backup musicians. In 1992, Boyz II Men joined the tour as an opening act. While traveling the country, their tour manager Khalil Roundtree was murdered in Chicago, and the group&#x27;s future performances of &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; were dedicated to him. As a result of this unfortunate experience, the song would help advance their success. Ultimately, however, the lavish show proved too expensive to support through album sales and it was cancelled partway through its scheduled run.

Music videos were produced for all four singles released from this album (including &quot;Do Not Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;This Is The Way We Roll&quot;), all which charted. The &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; video featured many celebrity appearances and has been ranked as one of the most expensive videos ever made. The hand motions used within the song and video also became very popular. &quot;2 Legit to Quit&quot; proved to be successful in the US, peaking in the Top 10 at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Despite the album&#x27;s multi-platinum certification, the sales were one-third of &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;.

At the end of the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; video, after James Brown enlists Hammer to get the famous glove of Michael Jackson, a silver-white sequined glove is shown on the hand of a Michael Jackson look-alike doing the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; hand gesture. In a related story, Hammer appeared on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; (July 27, 2009) and talked about his hit reality show &quot;Hammertime&quot; on A&amp;E, his marriage, his role as a dad and the reasons he eventually went bankrupt. He told an amusing story about a phone call he received from &quot;MJ&quot;, regarding the portion of the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; video that included a fake Jackson, giving his approval and inclusion of it. He explained how Michael had seen the video and liked it, and both expressed they were fans of one another. Hammer and Jackson would later appear, speak and/or perform at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006. In 1991, Hammer was featured on the single &quot;The Blood&quot; from the BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans album, &quot;Different Lifestyles&quot;. In 1992, the song peaked at No. 8 on the Christian charts.

=== New venture with Oaktown/Giant Records (1992–1993) ===
In 1992, after a four-year hiatus, Doug E. Fresh signed with Hammer&#x27;s label, Bust It Records and issued one album, &quot;Doin&#x27; What I Gotta Do&quot;, which (despite some minor acclaim for his single &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out (On Funk)&quot; which sampled the Rick James 1979 single &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot;) was a commercial failure. Prior to Hammer&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;, rumors from critics and fans began claiming Hammer had quit the music/entertainment business or had suffered a financial downfall (since a couple of years were passing between his two records), which Hammer denied. Hammer claimed rumors falsely heralded his downfall were most likely a result of the fact he turned over his &quot;trimmed-down&quot; Bust It Records to his brother and manager Louis Burrell Jr., and his horse racing interests to his brother Chris and their father, Louis Burrell Sr.

During his hiatus between albums, Hammer consequently signed a multi-million-dollar deal with a new record company. He said there were a lot of bidders, but &quot;not too many of them could afford Hammer&quot;. Therefore, Hammer parted ways with Felton Pilate (who had previously worked with the successful vocal group Con Funk Shun) and switched record labels to Giant Records, taking his Oaktown label with him. Hammer was eventually sued by Pilate. Hammer also launched a new enterprise, called Roll Wit It Entertainment &amp; Sports Management, with clients such as Evander Holyfield, Deion Sanders and Reggie Brooks. In 1993, his production company released the hit rap song &quot;Gangsta Lean&quot; by DRS (from their debut album &quot;Gangsta Lean&quot;).

By this time, Hammer also parted ways with his only female executive music business administration consultant and songwriter, Linda Lou McCall (who previously worked with the Delfonics and her husband Louis A. McCall, Sr.&#x27;s band Con Funk Shun). A music industry vet, McCall was hired by Hammer&#x27;s brother and manager Louis K. Burrell, in 1990. She helped set up his corporate operations and administration, at Bust It Management &amp; Productions Inc. in Oakland, California. McCall later became Vice President of Hammer&#x27;s talent management company, overseeing artists like Heavy D, B Angie B and Ralph Tresvant. While at Bust It, she and her husband brought their artist Keith Martin to Felton&#x27;s attention, who hired him as a backup musician and vocalist for Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; world tours.

With a new home and daughter, a new record soon to be released and his new business, Hammer claimed that he was happy and far from being broke during a tour of his mansion for &quot;Ebony&quot;. &quot;Today there is a more aggressive Hammer, because the &#x27;90s require you to be more aggressive,&quot; Hammer said of his music style. &quot;There is a harder edge, but I&#x27;m no &quot;gangsta&quot;. Hammer in the &#x27;90s is on the offense, on the move, on the attack. And it&#x27;s all good.&quot;

=== &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot; and &quot;Prime Time&quot; (1994) ===
In 1993, Hammer began recording his fifth official album. To adapt to the changing landscape of hip-hop, this album was a more aggressive sounding album entitled &quot;The Funky Headhunter.&quot; He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek. While Hammer&#x27;s appearance changed to keep up with the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor profanity. Yet, as with previous records, Hammer would continue to call out and disrespect other rappers on this album. As with some earlier songs such as &quot;Crime Story&quot; (from the album &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;), the content and reality about &quot;street life&quot; remained somewhat the same, but the sound was different, resulting in Hammer losing favor with fans. This album peaked at number two on the R&amp;B charts and remained in the Top 30 midway through the year. The album was eventually certified platinum.

Hammer debuted the video for &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot; during another appearance on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; during the mid-1990s. Host Arsenio Hall said to Hammer, &quot;Women in the audience want to know, what&#x27;s in your speedos in the &#x27;Pumps and a Bump&#x27; video?&quot; A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience. Hammer didn&#x27;t give a direct answer, but instead laughed. Arsenio then said, &quot;I guess that&#x27;s why they call you &#x27;Hammer.&#x27; It ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; to do with Hank Aaron.&quot;

The video to the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot;, was banned from heavy rotation on MTV with censors claiming that the depiction of Hammer in Speedos (and with what appeared to be an erection) was too graphic. This led to an alternative video being filmed (with Hammer fully clothed) that was directed by Bay Area native Craig S. Brooks. &quot;It&#x27;s All Good&quot; was the second single released from the album.

On December 20, 1994, Deion Sanders released &quot;Prime Time&quot;, a rap album on Hammer&#x27;s Bust It Records label which featured the minor hit &quot;Must Be the Money&quot;. &quot;Prime Time Keeps on Tickin&#x27;&quot; was also released as a single. Sanders, a friend of Hammer&#x27;s, had previously appeared in his &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; music video, and his alter-ego &quot;Prime Time&quot; is also used in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot; video. The song &quot;Help Lord (Won&#x27;t You Come)&quot; appeared in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;.

=== &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Death Row Records and &quot;Too Tight&quot; (1995–1996) ===
In 1995, Hammer released the album &quot;Inside Out&quot;. The album sold poorly compared to previous records (peaking at 119 on the Billboard Charts) and Giant Records dropped him and Oaktown Records from their roster. Songs &quot;Going Up Yonder&quot; and &quot;Sultry Funk&quot; managed to get moderate radio play (even charting on national radio station countdowns). Along with a fickle public, Hammer would go on to explain in this album that he felt many of his so-called friends (who he had helped) had used and betrayed him. Their abuse reportedly contributed to a majority of his financial loss (best explained in the song &quot;Keep On&quot; and the bio from this album). He would also hint about this again in interviews, including &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in 2009. 

In 1995, Hammer released &quot;Straight to My Feet&quot; (with Deion Sanders) from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted at No. 57 in the UK. Hammer&#x27;s relationship with Suge Knight dates back to 1988. Hammer signed with Death Row Records by 1995, then home to Snoop Dogg and his close friend, Tupac Shakur. The label did not release the album of Hammer&#x27;s music (titled &quot;Too Tight&quot;) while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album. However, Burrell did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song &quot;Too Late Playa&quot; (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy). After the death of Shakur in 1996, Burrell left the record company. He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on Trinity Broadcasting Network since he was in Las Vegas with Tupac the night of his death.

=== Return to EMI and &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1996–1998) ===
In October 1996, Burrell and Oaktown signed with EMI, which saw the release of a compilation album of Hammer&#x27;s hit singles prior to &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;. The album, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, featured twelve former hits. In 1998, another &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, called &quot;Back 2 Back Hits&quot;, was produced and released by CEMA. Another compilation version of &quot;Back 2 Back&quot; was later released by Capitol Records in 2006. As Hammer&#x27;s empire began to collapse when his last album failed to match the sales of its predecessors, and since he unsuccessfully attempted to recast himself in the &quot;streetwise/hardcore rap&quot; mold of the day, Hammer turned to a gospel-friendly audience.

In 1998, Hammer released his first album in his new deal with EMI, titled &quot;Family Affair&quot;, because it was to introduce the world to the artists he had signed to his Oaktown Records (Geeman, Teabag, and Common Unity) as they made their recording debut. Technically his seventh album since his debut EP, this record was highly promoted on Trinity Broadcasting Network (performing a more gospel version of &quot;Keep On&quot; from his album &quot;Inside Out V&quot;), yet featured no charting singles and selling about 1,000 copies worldwide. The album also features a song written for Hammer by Tupac called &quot;Unconditional Love&quot;. Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first &quot;VH1 Hip Hop Honors&quot; in 2004.

A double album mostly about faith and family values, additional tracks from &quot;Family Affair&quot; are: &quot;Put It Down&quot;, &quot;Put Some Stop in Your Game&quot;, &quot;Big Man&quot;, &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, &quot;Our God&quot;, &quot;Responsible Father Shout&quot;, &quot;He Brought Me Out&quot;, (Geeman Intro), &quot;Eye&#x27;s Like Mine&quot;, &quot;Never Without You&quot;, &quot;Praise Dance Theme Song&quot;, &quot;Shame of the Name&quot;, (Smoothout Intro), (Teabag Intro), &quot;Silly Heart&quot;, &quot;I Wish U Were Free&quot;, (Common Unity Intro), &quot;Someone to Hold to You&quot;, &quot;Pray&quot; (1998), &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; (1998), and with &quot;Hammer Music/Shouts/Tour Info&quot; announcements between songs. The compact discs are also &quot;PC Ready&quot; with interactive features. After this album, new projects were rumored to be in the works, including an album (&quot;War Chest: Turn of the Century&quot;) and a soundtrack to the film &quot;Return to Glory: The Powerful Stirring of the Black Man&quot;, but neither appeared.

=== &quot;The Hits&quot; and &quot;Active Duty&quot; (2000–2001) ===
In 2000, another compilation album was released, titled &quot;The Hits&quot;. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hammer released his album, &quot;Active Duty&quot;, on his own World Hit Music Group label (the musical enterprise under his Hammertime Holdings Inc. umbrella) to pay homage to the ones lost in the terrorist attacks. The album followed that theme, and featured two singles (with accompanying videos), &quot;No Stoppin&#x27; Us (USA)&quot; and &quot;Pop Yo Collar&quot; (featuring Wee Wee) which demonstrates &quot;The Phat Daddy Pop&quot;, &quot;In Pop Nito&quot;, &quot;River Pop&quot;, &quot;Deliver The Pop&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;n It Up&quot; dance moves. The album, like its predecessor, failed to chart and would not sell as many copies as previous projects. Hammer did however promote it on such shows as &quot;The View&quot; and produced a video for both singles.

This patriotic album, originally planned to be titled &quot;The Autobiography Of MC Hammer&quot;, donated portions of the proceeds to 9/11 charities. Hammer shot a video for the anthem &quot;No Stoppin&#x27; Us (USA)&quot; in Washington, D.C., with several members of the United States Congress, who sang in the song and danced in the video. Present members of the United States House of Representatives included J. C. Watts, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Thomas M. Davis, Earl Hilliard, Alcee Hastings, Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.), Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) and Jesse Jackson Jr.

=== &quot;Full Blast&quot; (2004) ===
After leaving Capitol Records and EMI for the second time in his career, Hammer decided to move his Oaktown imprint to an independent distributor and released his ninth studio album, &quot;Full Blast&quot; (which was completed in late 2003 and released as a complete album in early 2004). The album would feature no charting singles and was not certified by the RIAA. A video was produced for &quot;Full Blast&quot;, a song that attacks Eminem and Busta Rhymes for previous disrespect towards him. Some of the original songs didn&#x27;t end up making the final album release. Guest artists included The Stooge Playaz, Pleasure, Rain, JD Greer and DasIt.

=== &quot;Look Look Look&quot; and &quot;Platinum MC Hammer&quot; (2006–2008) ===
After going independent, Hammer decided to create a digital label to release his tenth studio album, &quot;Look Look Look.&quot; The album was released in February 2006 and featured production from Scott Storch. The album featured the title-track single (&quot;Look Look Look&quot;) and a music video. It would sell much better than his previous release (300,000 copies worldwide).

&quot;YAY&quot; was produced by Lil Jon. &quot;What Happened to Our Hood?&quot; (featuring Sam Logan) was originally from &quot;Active Duty&quot;. &quot;I Got It From The Town&quot; was used in the movie but is only present in one scene instead of the originally planned two on &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (soundtrack)&quot;.

Between 2006 and 2007, Hammer released a military-inspired rap song with a political message to President George W. Bush about sending American troops back home from war, called &quot;Bring Our Brothers Home&quot;. The video was filmed at the Santa Monica Pier.

In 2008, &quot;Platinum MC Hammer&quot; was released by EMI Records. The compilation consists of 12 tracks from Hammer&#x27;s previous albums, with a similar playlist as former &quot;greatest hits&quot; records (with the exception of including a remix of &quot;Hammer Hammer, They Put Me In A Mix&quot; which includes rap lyrics that &quot;They Put Me In A Mix&quot; originally did not). An import was released by Capitol Records.

=== &quot;DanceJamtheMusic&quot; (2008–2009) ===
Since his 2006 album, Hammer continued to produce music and released several other raps that appeared on his social websites (such as Myspace and Dancejam.com) or in commercials, with another album announced to be launched in late 2008 (via his own record label Fullblast Playhouse). Talks of the tour and a new album were expected in 2009.

&quot;Getting Back to Hetton&quot; was made public in 2008 as a digital single. It was a departure for Hammer, bringing in funky deep soul and mixing it with a more house style. Released through licence on Whippet Digital Recordings, media reviews were said to be &quot;disappointing&quot;. However, the song &quot;I Got Gigs&quot; from this album was used in a 2009 ESPN commercial and performed during &quot;Hammertime&quot; (as well as played while he danced just prior to introducing Soulja Boy during YouTube Live on November 22, 2008).

Other tracks and videos from the album included: &quot;I Go&quot; (produced by Lil Jon), &quot;Keep It In Vegas&quot;, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out The Window&quot;, &quot;Dem Jeans&quot; (by DASIT), &quot;Stooge Karma Sutra&quot; (by The Stooge Playaz) and &quot;Tried to Luv U&quot; (by DASIT featuring Pleasure Ellis).

In February 2009, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice had a one-off concert at the McKay Events Center in Orem, Utah. This concert aided in the promotion of Hammer&#x27;s new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of &quot;Hammertime&quot;), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since the time when they were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: &quot;Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, we are like long lost friends. I&#x27;ve known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract and before I had a record contract. It is a great reunion.&quot; Vanilla Ice said: &quot;It&#x27;s like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day ... I&#x27;m so happy right now, the magic is here.&quot;

=== Most recent releases (2010–present) ===

==== &quot;Better Run Run&quot; (2010) ====
MC Hammer promised to release a track (expected on October 31, 2010) responding to a song by Kanye West featuring Jay-Z which attacked him. On the &quot;So Appalled&quot; track, which features Swizz Beatz and RZA, Jay-Z raps a verse targeting Hammer about his financial dilemma in the 1990s. On it, Jay says: &#x27;Hammer went broke so you know I&#x27;m more focused / I lost 30 mil&#x27; so I spent another 30 / &#x27;Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can&#x27;t hurt me&#x27;. Hammer addressed his displeasure about the diss on Twitter, claiming he would react to Jay-Z on Halloween.

Hammer released a sample of his &quot;beef&quot; with Jay-Z in a brief teaser trailer called &quot;Better Run Run&quot; by &#x27;King Hammer&#x27;. At one point, it was uncertain if his reaction would be a film video, a music video or a combination of both. Regardless, he claimed he would show evidence that &#x27;Jigga worships the devil&#x27;. It is possible that Jay-Z was offended by an analogy Hammer was conveying in an earlier interview in response to &quot;D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)&quot; on AllHipHop.

On November 1, Hammer&#x27;s song with video called &quot;Better Run Run!&quot; hit the web in retaliation to Jay-Z&#x27;s September 2010 diss towards him. Hammer accuses Jigga of being in league (and in the studio) with Satan—and then Hammer defeats the devil and forces Jay to be baptized. Speaking on the video, Jacob O&#x27;Gara of &quot;Ethos Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;What&#x27;s more likely is that this feud is the last chapter in the tragic cautionary tale of MC Hammer, a tale that serves as a warning to all present and future kings of hip-hop. Keep your balance on the pedestal and wear the crown strong or you&#x27;ll have the Devil to pay.&quot;

In an interview with BBC&#x27;s DJ Semtex, Jay said he did not mean the verses as a personal attack. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that [Hammer&#x27;s financial status] wasn&#x27;t on the table for discussion!&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know I was the first person ever to say that...&quot; He continued, &quot;When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it&#x27;s, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [&quot;Decoded&quot;] — that wasn&#x27;t a cheap plug,&quot; he laughed. &quot;He&#x27;s gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people&#x27;s perception of him. But it is what it is, he took it that wrong way, and I didn&#x27;t know I said anything wrong!&quot;

==== &quot;See Her Face&quot; (2011) ====
On February 3, 2011, MC Hammer appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; premiering the track &quot;See Her Face&quot; via Flipboard. It was the first time Flipboard included music in the application.

==== &quot;Raider Nation&quot; and &quot;All in My Mind&quot; (2013–2014) ====
Among other songs, Hammer released &quot;Raider Nation (Oakland Raiders Anthem)&quot; along with a video in late 2013 and &quot;All in My Mind&quot; (which samples &quot;Summer Breeze&quot; by The Isley Brothers) in early 2014, with his newly formed group Oakland Fight Club (featuring Mistah F.A.B.).

==== &quot;Help the Children&quot; (2017) ====
Hammer released an updated version of his 1990 charting song with a short film video in late 2017.

== Additional business ventures ==
In 1991, Hammer established Oaktown Stable that would eventually have nineteen Thoroughbred racehorses. That year, his outstanding filly Lite Light won several Grade I stakes races including the prestigious Kentucky Oaks. His D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt Dance Floor won the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes and the Breeders&#x27; Futurity Stakes in 1991, then the following year won the Fountain of Youth Stakes and finished 3rd in the 1992 Kentucky Derby. He continues to attend shows as well as many sporting events alongside celebrities. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s, along with a new clothing line called J Slick, Hammer began creating and working on MC Hammer USA, an interactive online portal.

In 2002, Hammer signed a book contract with publishing company Simon &amp; Schuster which called for a release the following year. However, a manuscript for an inspirational book called &quot;Enemies of the Father: Messages from the Heart on Being a Family Man&quot; (addressing the situation of African American men), for which Hammer received advance money to write, was never submitted in 2003. This resulted in Hammer being sued by the book company over claims that he never finished the book as promised. The company&#x27;s March 2009 lawsuit sought return of the US$61,000 advance given to Hammer for the unwritten book about fatherhood.

Hammer was a popular web mogul and activist, becoming involved in several Internet projects (including TechCrunch40 conferences). In 2007, Hammer was co-founder and chief strategy officer of Menlo Park-based (Silicon Valley) DanceJam.com along with Geoffrey Arone. The community site (valued at $4.5 million) was exclusively dedicated to dancing video competitions, techniques and styles which Hammer sometimes judged or rated.

In July 2010, Hammer started a mixed martial arts management company to manage, market, promote and brand-build for fighters. Artists included Nate Marquardt, Tim F. Kennedy and Vladimir Matyushenko, among others. According to MMAWeekly.com and Bizjournals, his new company was Alchemist Management based in Los Angeles, managing at least ten fighters. That same month, Hammer also announced an apparel line called Alchemist Clothing. The brand described as colorful lifestyle clothing debuted during an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in Austin. Middleweight fighter Nate &quot;The Great&quot; Marquardt wore an Alchemist shirt as he walked out to the boxing ring. Hammer had shown an interest in boxing throughout his career. 

On September 28, 2010, Hammer headlined at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference for an official after-hours party. Hammer appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in February 2011 to discuss his tech-media-mogul status, as well as his creation, demonstration and consulting of social applications/sites/media (such as having an involvement with the Internet since 1994 including YouTube and Twitter), and devices such as iPad and ZAGGmate by Zagg. He also explained how employing/helping so many people in the past never really caused him to be broke in terms of the average person, as the media made it seem, nor would he have changed any experiences that has led him to where he is today. During the &quot;Whatever Happened to MC Hammer&quot; episode, he discussed his current home, family and work life as well.

In October 2011, Hammer announced a new internet venture called WireDoo, a &quot;deep search engine&quot; that planned to compete with the major search engines, Google and Bing. With the motto, &quot;Search once and see what&#x27;s related&quot;, Hammer&#x27;s team planned to eventually open up the site to a select number of beta testers. However, WireDoo never left beta mode.

=== Television and film career ===
Hammer produced and starred in his own movie, &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em: The Movie&quot; (1990). The film is about a rapper returning to his hometown who defeats a drug lord using kids to traffic his product. For this project, Hammer earned a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video at the 33rd Grammy Awards (having been nominated for two). He later produced &quot;MC Hammer: 2 Legit (The Videos)&quot;, which included many actors and athletes.

Hammer appeared in major marketing campaigns for companies such as Pepsi, KFC, Toshiba, British Knights and Taco Bell during the height of his career.

In 1991, Hammer hosted, sang/rapped and voiced a Saturday-morning cartoon called &quot;Hammerman&quot;. That same year, he and Bust It Productions (including B Angie B, Special Generation and Ho Frat Hoo!) appeared in concert from New Orleans on BET.

Hammer has made cameos and/or performed on many television shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (as host and musical guest), &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;Martin&quot;. He also made a cameo in the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. Hammer would also go on to appear as himself on &quot;The History of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll, Vol. 5&quot; (1995). Additionally, he has been involved in movies as an actor such as, &quot;One Tough Bastard&quot; (1996), &quot;Reggie&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1996), the Showtime film &quot;The Right Connections&quot; (1997), &quot;Deadly Rhapsody&quot; (2001), &quot;Finishing the Game&quot; (2007) and &quot;1040&quot; (2010), as well as a television and movie producer.

Despite his financial status being publicly attacked, after meeting at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas in April 2001, Hammer (credited as a producer) provided the much-needed funding to filmmaker Justin Lin for &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; (2002). In its first ever film acquisition, MTV Films eventually acquired &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; after it debuted at The Sundance Film Festival. The director said, &quot;Out of desperation, I called up MC Hammer because he had read the script and liked it. Two hours later, he wired the money we needed into a bank account and saved us.&quot;

Hammer appeared in two cable television movies. At the age of 39, he was one of the producers for the VH1 movie &quot;Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story&quot;, starring Romany Malco and Tangi Miller as his wife, which aired on December 19, 2001. The film is a biopic which chronicles the rise and fall of the artist. &quot;2 Legit To Quit: The Life Story of MC Hammer&quot; became the second highest-rated original movie in the history of VH1 and broadcast simultaneously on BET. &quot;The whole script came from me,&quot; says Hammer, &quot;I sat down with a writer and gave him all the information.&quot;

In 2003, Hammer appeared on The WB&#x27;s first season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, a reality show known for assembling an eclectic mix of celebrities to live together. He was also a dance judge on the 2003 ABC Family TV series &quot;Dance Fever&quot;. Additionally, he appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;And You Don&#x27;t Stop: 30 Years of Hip-Hop&quot; (2004) as well as in &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90s&quot; (2008), a countdown which he was also commentator on. His eldest child, A&#x27;Keiba Burrell, was a contestant on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Cradle&quot; in April 2008 (which Hammer also made appearances on).

Hammer had shown an interest in having his own reality show with specific television networks at one point. Already being a part of shows for VH1 and The WB (&quot;I Married... MC Hammer&quot; and &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;), it was later confirmed he would appear in &quot;Hammertime&quot; on A&amp;E in the summer of 2009. This reality show was about his personal, business and family life. The following year, Hammer appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; June 3, 2009, to promote his show which began June 14, 2009, at 10 p.m. Eastern Time Zone (EST).

In August 2008, a new ESPN ad featured Hammer in it, showcasing his single &quot;I Got Gigs&#x27;&quot; (from his &quot;DanceJamtheMusic&quot; album). The commercial was for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;&#x27;s upcoming football season. This is not the first commercial in more recent years that Hammer has been in, or his songs/raps/dancing was used for and included in such as Lay&#x27;s, Hallmark Cards, Purell, Lysol, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, and Citibank. On February 1, 2009, Hammer and Ed McMahon were featured in a Super Bowl XLIII commercial for Cash4Gold.

In addition to appearing in television commercials, Hammer&#x27;s music has also been used in television shows and movies, especially &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; during: &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1990), &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; (1990), &quot;The Super&quot; (1991), &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; (1992), &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; (1996), &quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot; (2002), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008), &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2009), &quot;Glee&quot; (2010) and many more. Additionally, &quot;This Is What We Do&quot; was a 1990 track by Hammer (featuring B Angie B) for the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; film and soundtrack. Tracks &quot;That&#x27;s What I Said&quot; and &quot;Feel My Power&quot; were used for the &quot;Rocky V&quot; film and soundtrack. Some examples of other raps by Hammer used in movies and television were: &quot;Addams Groove&quot; (&quot;The Addams Family&quot;), &quot;Pray&quot; (&quot;License to Wed&quot;), &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; (&quot;Hot Rod&quot;), &quot;I Got It From The Town&quot; (&quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;), &quot;Help Lord, Won&#x27;t You Come&quot; (&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;), &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Deeper&quot; (&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;) and &quot;Straight to My Feet&quot; (&quot;Street Fighter&quot;).

Along with Betty White, Hammer was a voice actor on the September 17, 2010, episode of &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot; called &quot;Step-Brother&quot;. In 2016, MC Hammer appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; on Cartoon Network. In June 2017, Hammer appeared during &quot;Beat Shazam&quot; on Fox. Hammer has most recently been a spokesman for 3M Command Strips and Starburst. In September 2020, Hammer appeared on &quot;The Greatest AtHome Videos&quot; via Zoom.

=== Dancer, choreographer and entertainer ===
Hammer&#x27;s dance style not only helped pave the way for the San Francisco Bay Area movement called hyphy, but also helped to bring hip-hop and rap to the Bay Area. With his popular trademark Hammer pants, one phenomenal difference from Hammer versus other performers during his heyday was that he was an entertainer, both during live shows and in music videos. His flamboyant dancing was as much a part of his performances as rapping and musical instruments were. With high-energy dance routines, he is often considered one of the greatest dancers. While adding his own techniques, Hammer adopted styles from James Brown and Nicholas Brothers such as the splits, as well as feverishly choreographed dance routines including leaps and slides. His creation of such dances as the &quot;Hammer dance&quot; (or the &quot;typewriter dance&quot;) and &quot;the bump&quot; from &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;, as well as the &quot;running man&quot; and the &quot;butterfly&quot;, made his flashy and creative dance skills unlike any others at the time.

Hammer&#x27;s showmanship and elaborate stage choreography (involving fifteen dancers, twelve backup singers, seven live musicians and two disc jockeys), gave him a powerful visual appeal. Hammer was the first rap artist to put together a choreographed show of this type, and his visual flair attracted heavy airplay for his videos on MTV, which at the time had a predominantly white viewership that had aired little rap music before Hammer.

During a 1990 visit from Hammer (accompanied by his friend Fab Five Freddy) on &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;, one of the dancers whom Hammer was holding auditions for was then-unknown Jennifer Lopez. At the height of his career, Hammer had his legs insured for a substantial amount of money (into the millions), as mentioned in an interview by Maria Shriver in 1990. He later suffered an injury to his knee that halted his dancing career for a period of time. Eventually, BET ranked Hammer as the 7th Best Dancer of All Time. Some of Hammer&#x27;s entourage, or &quot;posse&quot; as he called them, were also trained/skilled dancers (including Tiffany Patterson). They participated in videos and at concerts, yet too many dancers and band members eventually contributed to Hammer&#x27;s downfall, proving to be too much for him to finance.

Hammer stayed active in the dance media/genre, both on television shows and as co-founder of DanceJam.com (which showcased dance competitions and instructional videos on all the latest dance styles) until he and his partner Geoffrey Arone sold it to Grind Networks. Well known for bringing choreography to hip-hop, many of his dancing skills can still be seen on dance-focused and social networking sites. &quot;Dance is unlike any other social medium. It&#x27;s the core of our culture&quot;, Burrell told &quot;Wired&quot;.

In addition to his websites and Internet presence, Hammer has also appeared demonstrating much of his dancing abilities on talk shows such as &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; (performing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s famous &quot;string dance&quot; together as well), &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;. Hammer was also a dance judge on &quot;Dance Fever&quot;. On June 3, 2009, he performed his &quot;Hammer dance&quot; on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; with Will Ferrell as co-host.

While Hammer may have challenged and competed with Michael Jackson during the height of his career, they were friends, proven by a phone call Hammer had with Jackson about his &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; video which he shared on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; in July 2009. Hammer wanted to ensure he was not offended by the ending of the video where a purported Jackson (seen only from behind) does the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; hand gesture with his famous glove. They also appeared together at the funeral service for James Brown in 2006, where Hammer danced in honor of the &quot;Godfather of Soul&quot;. After Jackson&#x27;s death, Hammer posted his remembrance and sympathy of the superstar on Twitter. Michael&#x27;s friend and fellow pop culture icon Hammer told Spinner that, &quot;now that the &quot;King of Pop&quot; has passed, it&#x27;s the duty of his fans and loved ones to carry Jackson&#x27;s creative torch.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Michael Jackson lit the fuse that ignited the spirit of dance in us all. He gave us a song and a sweet melody that will never die. Now we all carry his legacy with joy and pride.&quot;

In 2022, Bobby Brown claimed he started wearing the &quot;diaper pants&quot; that Hammer altered and made famous, on his A&amp;E show &quot;Bobby Brown: Every Little Step&quot;. However, Brown wore a less sagging variation during some concerts and in music videos, such as &quot;My Prerogative&quot; (1988) and &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (1989).

== Personal life ==
At the time of his first album, Hammer opened his own music management firm. As a result of the success of his third album, &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;, Hammer had amassed approximately US$33 million. In 1997, Hammer sold his Fremont, California estate and mansion for US$5.3 million, after filing for bankruptcy in 1996. Hammer most recently resided in a large ranch-style adobe home, situated on a two-acre corner lot in Tracy, California, with his wife Stephanie. They met at a church revival meeting and married December 21, 1985. They have five children and also raised Hammer&#x27;s nephew. It was reported in July 2012 that Hammer was encouraged to marry Whitney Houston by her father at the Super Bowl in 1991.

Hammer frequently posted about his life and activities on his blog &quot;Look Look Look&quot;, as well as other social websites such as Facebook, Myspace and Twitter (being one of the earliest celebrities to contribute and join). A self-described &quot;super geek&quot; who consulted for or invested in eight technology companies, Hammer claimed to spend 10–12 hours daily working on his technology projects, and tweeted 30–40 times a day as of 2012. He has been noted as a popularizer and defender of philosophy in his social media posts. Hammer was an endorser of the SAFE California Act, which, if passed in November 2012, would have replaced the death penalty. However, the proposition was defeated.

=== Bankruptcy, lawsuits, and media reaction ===
Contrary to public rumor, Hammer claimed he was really never &quot;down-and-out&quot; as reported by the media (eventually expressed on &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot; and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in 2009). Originally having an estimated net worth of over $33 million according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, speculations about Hammer&#x27;s status first emerged during delays between albums &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; and &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;, with Hammer having spent much of his money on staff and personal luxuries. In addition to excessive spending while supporting friends and family, Hammer ultimately became over $13 million in debt—due to dwindling album sales, unpaid loans, a large payroll, and a lavish lifestyle. Therefore, Hammer eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Oakland, California, on April 1, 1996. The case was converted to Chapter 7 on September 23, 1998. However, Hammer was denied a bankruptcy discharge on April 23, 2002.

Hammer&#x27;s mansion was sold for a fraction of its former price. &quot;My priorities were out of order,&quot; he told &quot;Ebony&quot;. He said: &quot;My priorities should have always been God, family, community and then business. Instead they had been business, business and business.&quot; Along with Felton Pilate and other group members, Rick James sued Hammer for infringement of copyright on &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;, but the suit was settled out of court when Hammer agreed to credit James as co-composer, effectively cutting James in on the millions of dollars the record was earning. By the late 1990s, Hammer seemed to stabilize himself and made himself ready to undertake new projects.

In 1992, Hammer had admitted in depositions and court documents to getting the idea for the song &quot;Here Comes the Hammer&quot; from a Christian recording artist in Dallas named Kevin Christian. Christian had filed a $16 million lawsuit against Hammer for copyright infringement of his song entitled &quot;Oh-Oh, You Got the Shing&quot;. This fact, compounded with witness testimony from both Hammer&#x27;s and Christian&#x27;s entourages, and other evidence (including photos), brought about a settlement with Capitol Records in 1994. The terms of the settlement remain sealed. Hammer settled with Christian the following year.

In 1997, just prior to beginning his ministry, Hammer (who by that time had re-adopted &quot;MC&quot;) was the subject of an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and the VH1 series &quot;Behind the Music&quot; (music from his album &quot;Inside Out&quot; was featured in this documentary). In these appearances, Burrell admitted &quot;that [he] had already used up most of [his] fortune of over $20 million, proving that money is nothing if it doesn&#x27;t bring peace and if priorities are wrong&quot;. He would go on to express a similar point in other interviews as well.

During numerous interviews on radio stations and television channels throughout the years, Hammer was constantly questioned about his bankruptcy. During an interview by WKQI-FM (95.5) for the promotion of his &quot;Pioneers Of Hip Hop 2009&quot; gig at the Fox Theatre in Detroit (which featured 2 Live Crew, Naughty by Nature, Too Short, Biz Markie and Roxanne Shanté), Hammer was asked about his finances by the &quot;Mojo in the Morning&quot; host. Hammer responded on Twitter, saying that Mojo was a &quot;coward&quot; and threatened to cancel commercials for his upcoming show.

On November 21, 2011, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in California against Hammer to obtain a court judgment on his unpaid taxes for years 1996 and 1997. In December 2011, this litigation was reported in the media. Hammer owed $779,585 in back taxes from his earnings dating back to 1996–1997; during the years, Hammer was believed to be facing his worst financial problems. After years of public and media ridicule regarding his financial problem, Hammer tried to assure fans and &quot;naysayers&quot; via Twitter, saying that he had proof he had already taken care of his debt with the IRS. &quot;700k – Don&#x27;t get too excited .. I paid them already and kept my receipt. Stamped by a US Federal Judge&quot;, Hammer tweeted from his account @MCHammer. 

However, the District Court ruled against Hammer. He appealed, but, on December 17, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Hammer&#x27;s argument that because the government had not listed those taxes in the government&#x27;s proof of claim filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the government should be stopped from collecting the taxes. According to a 2017 episode of the Reelz TV series &quot;Broke &amp; Famous&quot;, the situation was eventually resolved. As of the making of the aforementioned &quot;Broke &amp; Famous&quot; episode, Hammer had a reported net worth of $1.5 million.

=== Obstruction charges ===
Hammer was arrested in 2013 in Dublin, California, for allegedly obstructing an officer in the performance of his duties and resisting an officer (according to &quot;stop and identify&quot; statutes). Hammer claims he was a victim of racial profiling by the police, stating an officer pulled out his gun and randomly asked him: &quot;Are you on parole or probation?&quot; Hammer stated that as he handed over his ID, the officer reached inside the car and tried to pull him out. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was &quot;blasting music&quot; in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. &quot;After asking Hammer who the registered owner was, he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer&#x27;s questions,&quot; police spokesman Herb Walters typed in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer was booked and released from Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. A court date was scheduled; however, all charges were dropped in early March. Hammer tweeted that he was not bitter and considered what happened &quot;a teachable moment&quot;.

=== Christian beliefs and ministry ===
In 1984, Burrell began attending Bible studies, joined a street ministry, and formed a gospel rap group with Jon Gibson known as the Holy Ghost Boy(s). In 1986, Burrell and Tramaine Hawkins performed with Gibson&#x27;s band in concerts at various venues, such as the Beverly Theatre in Beverly Hills. Several songs were recorded together, collaborating on &quot;The Wall&quot; from Gibson&#x27;s album &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (1988), prior to Hammer&#x27;s mainstream success. This was CCM&#x27;s first rap hit by a blue-eyed soul singer and/or duo. Burrell also produced &quot;Son of the King&quot; at that time, releasing it on his debut album &quot;Feel My Power&quot; (1986).

Raised Pentecostal, Hammer strayed from his Christian faith during his success, before returning to ministry. His awareness of this can be found in a film he wrote and starred in called &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em: The Movie&quot; (1990), in which he also plays the charismatic preacher character named &quot;Reverend Pressure&quot;. Nonetheless, as a tribute to his faith, Hammer vowed/promised to dedicate at least one song on each album to God.

During 1991, Hammer was featured on the single &quot;The Blood&quot; from the BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans album, &quot;Different Lifestyles&quot;. In 1992, the song peaked at No. 8 on the Christian charts. Hammer later reaffirmed his beliefs in October 1997, and began a television ministry called &quot;MC Hammer and Friends&quot; on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, as well as appearing on &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; programs where he went public about his devotion to ministry as an ordained minister. Hammer officiated at the celebrity weddings of actor Corey Feldman and Susie Sprague on October 30, 2002 (as seen on VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;), and also at Mötley Crüe&#x27;s Vince Neil and Lia Gerardini&#x27;s wedding in January 2005.

During an interview on TBN (between 1997 and 1998), Hammer claimed he adopted the &quot;MC&quot; back into his name which now stood for &#x27;Man of Christ&#x27;. Hammer continued to preach while still making music, running a social media business and television show, and devotes time to prison and youth ministries. From 2009 to 2010, Hammer joined Jaeson Ma at a crusade in Asia. Minister and mentor to Ma for more than a decade, Hammer assisted and co-starred in his documentary film &quot;1040&quot;, which explores the spread of Christianity throughout Asia.

== Legacy and pop culture fame ==
Because of his commercial success during early stages of hip hop music, BET named Hammer as the first &quot;mainstream&quot; rapper. Hammer became a fixture of the television airwaves and the big screen, with his music being used in many popular shows, movies and commercials still to this day. Hammer appeared in major marketing campaigns for companies to the point that he was criticized as a &quot;sellout&quot;, including commercials for British Knights during the height of his career. The shoe company signed him to a $138 million deal.

Hammer&#x27;s impression on the music industry appeared almost as instantaneously as Digital Underground&#x27;s rap &quot;The Humpty Dance,&quot; which was released when Hammer was still early in his career and included the lyrics &quot;People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty!&quot;, boasting about Hammer&#x27;s showmanship versus Humpty Hump (Shock G)&#x27;s inability to match it in dance. Additionally, Hammer had several costly videos, two in particular were &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot; or &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; (in which many celebrities appeared) and &quot;Here Comes the Hammer&quot;.

Hammer is well known for his fashion style during the late 80s and early 90s. Hammer would tour, perform and record with his hype man 2 Bigg MC or Too Big (releasing a song in which he claimed &quot;He&#x27;s the King of the Hype&quot;). This duo introduced the &quot;shiny suit&quot; and popularized Hammer pants to mainstream America, as seen in videos such as &quot;(Hammer Hammer) They Put Me In A Mix&quot;, in which Hammer also claimed Too Big was the &quot;King of Hype&quot; and in an unspoken competition with Flavor Flav (hype man for Public Enemy) during the height of their careers.

Hammer also established a children&#x27;s foundation, which first started in Hammer&#x27;s own community, called Help The Children (HTC was named after and based on his song by the same name which included a music video with a storyline from his film &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em: The Movie&quot;). A Sesame Street segment features Elmo taking on the persona of Hammer; nicknaming himself &quot;MC Elmo&quot; and along with two backup singers they rap a song about the number five called &quot;Five Jive&quot;.

In 1994, British TV presenter Mark Lamarr interrupted Hammer repeatedly with Hammer&#x27;s catch phrase (&quot;Stop! Hammer Time!&quot;) in an interview filmed for &quot;The Word&quot;, which he took in good humor. He claimed Hammer was a &quot;living legend&quot;. It was also within this interview that Hammer explained the truth about his relationship with &quot;gangsta rap&quot; and that he was merely changing with the times, not holding onto his old image nor becoming a &quot;hardcore gangsta&quot;. By some accounts, this change contributed to his decline in popularity.

In 2005, Hammer appeared in a commercial for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company which made a humorous reference to his career. First he is shown in his distinctive clothing with his dance troupe performing &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; in front of a mansion representative of his former house with a monogram H on the gable. Then there is silence and a screen card saying &quot;Fifteen Minutes Later&quot; appears with a view of Hammer sadly sitting on the curb in front of the same house as a crane removes the monogram H and tow trucks pull away sports cars that were parked in front. After a large &quot;Foreclosed&quot; sign appears, the voice-over said &quot;Life comes at you fast. Be ready with Nationwide!&quot;

In 2006, Hammer&#x27;s music catalog was sold to the music company Evergreen/BMG for nearly $3 million. Evergreen explained that the collection was &quot;some of the best-selling and most popular rap songs of all time&quot;. Speaking for Evergreen Copyrights, David Schulhof stated the songs &quot;will emerge as a perfect fit for licensing in movies, television shows, and corporate advertising&quot;. According to VH1, &quot;Hammer was on the money. Hit singles and videos like &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; and &quot;Too Legit To Quit&quot; created a template of lavish performance values that many rap artists still follow today&quot;.

In March 2009, Ellen DeGeneres made plans for Hammer to be on her show (&quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;) after he contacted her via Twitter. Hammer continued to give media interviews, such as being a guest on &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot; on June 16, 2009. There he discussed his relationship with Vanilla Ice, his stint on &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, his show &quot;Hammertime&quot;, his family, his mansion, about him being in shape, his positive financial status and other &quot;colorful topics&quot; (subliminal jokes) regarding his baggy pants.

In 2010, Rick Ross released &quot;MC Hammer&quot; from the &quot;Teflon Don&quot; album which samples Hammer&#x27;s &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot;. To celebrate Hammer&#x27;s 50th birthday, San Francisco game maker Zynga offered up some recent player&#x27;s &quot;Draw Something&quot; drawings from his fans. Other sources/services offered &quot;props&quot; on behalf of his special occasion and to show appreciation for his memorable persona/gimmicks used during the peak of his career.

In 2012, Slaughterhouse released a single called &quot;Hammer Dance&quot;, along with a video. &quot;Hammer Dance&quot; was the lead single from the &quot;Welcome to: Our House&quot; album. During the 2013 Oakland Athletics season, the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; music video played on the Diamond Vision in between innings, usually during the middle of the 8th inning. The video featured prominent players from the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s sports championships, such as former A&#x27;s players Jose Canseco and hall of fame inductee Rickey Henderson. Hammer appeared in a Cheetos commercial during the Super Bowl in 2020, the 30th anniversary of &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;.

In January 2024, a storage unit was sold at auction containing what the buyer of the storage unit reported as 30 master tapes containing at least 14 unreleased tracks recorded during Hammer&#x27;s time at Death Row Records. The former Death Row Records producer of these tapes, Craig Williams, stated that he believes the tapes are authentic. It is unclear what will become of these songs or who legally owns these recordings.

== Influences and effect ==
Hammer&#x27;s career in rap and entertainment has influenced and been influenced by such artists as: Kool Moe Dee; Big Daddy Kane; James Brown; Prince; Michael Jackson; Kurtis Blow; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Rick James; Doug E. Fresh, who joined Hammer&#x27;s Bust It Records label in 1992 and issued the album &quot;Doin&#x27; What I Gotta Do&quot; with the track &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out (On Funk)&quot; sampling the Rick James single &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot;; Run-DMC; and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Hammer was followed by related musicians such as Will Smith, DC Talk, BB Jay, Diddy (aka &quot;Puffy&quot; or &quot;Puff Daddy&quot;), Young MC, B Angie B, M.C. Brains, MC Breed, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, C+C Music Factory, Mystikal, Bell Biv DeVoe, Kris Kross, Ho Frat Hoo!, and Oaktown&#x27;s 357. Hammer also influenced the music industry with pop culture catchphrases and slang.

Some critics complained of a lack of originality in Hammer&#x27;s early productions. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; as &#x27;shamelessly copying its propulsive riff from Rick James (&quot;Super Freak&quot;). Hammer admits, &quot;When I look at Puffy with a choir, I say, &#x27;Sure that&#x27;s a take-off of what I do.&quot; Notable feuds and beefs Hammer had with other rappers included: LL Cool J, Vanilla Ice, Too Short, Redman, 3rd Bass, Jay-Z, Eminem, A Tribe Called Quest, and Run-DMC. Several diss tracks were featured on his albums, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot; and &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;.

He has also been a presenter/performer at Soul Train&#x27;s Music Awards several times, including The 5th Annual Soul Train Music Awards (1991), The 9th Annual Soul Train Music Awards (1995) and Soul Train&#x27;s 25th Anniversary (1995). Hammer appeared on gospel music&#x27;s Stellar Awards show in 1997 and spoke of his renewed commitment to God. In the same interview, he promised to unveil the &quot;second leg&quot; of his career.

With over 2.6 million Twitter followers in 2010, his contribution to social media and as a co-founder of his own Internet businesses (such as DanceJam.com), Hammer was announced as the recipient of the first Gravity Summit Social Media Marketer of the Year Award. The award was presented to him at the 3rd Annual Gravity Summit on February 22, 2011, at the UCLA Covel Commons.

<text>Runaway Train is a 1985 American action thriller film directed by Andrei Konchalovsky and starring Jon Voight, Eric Roberts, Rebecca De Mornay and John P. Ryan. The screenplay by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and Edward Bunker was based on an original 1960s screenplay by Akira Kurosawa, with uncredited contributions by frequent Kurosawa collaborators Hideo Oguni and Ryūzō Kikushima. The film was also the feature debut of both Danny Trejo and Tommy &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister, who both proceeded to successful careers as &quot;tough guy&quot; character actors.

The story concerns two escaped convicts and an assistant locomotive driver who are stuck on a runaway train as it barrels through snowy desolate Alaska. Voight and Roberts were both nominated for Academy Awards. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

Kurosawa intended the original screenplay to be his first color film following &quot;Red Beard&quot;, but difficulties with the American financial backers led to its being shelved.

==Plot==
Oscar &quot;Manny&quot; Manheim is a bank robber and hero to the convicts of Alaska&#x27;s Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, Manny is put in solitary confinement for three years. A court order compels Associate Warden Ranken to release him from solitary. Planning a third breakout, Manny is forced to advance his plan to mid-winter after he is stabbed in the hand. Manny recruits young prisoner Buck McGeehy to help in the plan. After escaping from the prison via a sewer tunnel that opens near a freezing river, and a cross-country hike, the two arrive at a switchyard. After stealing railroad clothing, they board a train, consisting only of four locomotives.

The elderly railroad engineer, Al, has a fatal heart attack after starting the train and falls off the lead locomotive. He applies the brakes, but the locomotives overpower them, resulting in the brake shoes burning off. As the unmanned train accelerates, dispatchers Dave Prince and Frank Barstow are alerted to the situation. Barstow allows the train to reach the mainline while trying to keep the tracks farther down the line clear. The runaway smashes the rear flatbed and caboose of another train pulling onto a siding. The collision damages the cab of the lead locomotive and jams the front door of the second engine, an old inoperable EMD F-unit, or &quot;&#x27;A&#x27; Unit&quot;. Barstow&#x27;s superior Eddie McDonald orders him to derail the train.

The train&#x27;s horn then blows, alerting the authorities (and the two fugitives) that someone else is aboard the train. Barstow has the maintainer cancel the derailment. Ranken concludes his two escaped convicts are fleeing by rail. Meanwhile, the fugitives are discovered by Sara, a locomotive hostler who explains she sounded the horn and the train is out of control. As jumping off the train at its current speed would be suicide, the only possible way to stop it would be to climb forward onto the lead engine and press its kill switch, a difficult feat due to the &#x27;A&#x27; Unit&#x27;s jammed front door and its obsolete rounded streamlined designs having no outside catwalk, unlike the first, third, and fourth locomotives. They shut down the third and fourth locomotives by disconnecting the multi-unit cables.

Further ahead the train&#x27;s present route is a tight curve near a chemical plant. Realising the fast-moving train would derail at the curve causing damage to the plant with a possibility of major environmental disaster, the dispatchers divert the runaway onto a dead-end branch line, thus condemning all three on board to death, rather than risking a chemical explosion. Ranken forces Barstow to help him reach the train via helicopter. Manny tries forcing Buck into a suicidal scramble around the second engine&#x27;s frozen nose. Sara&#x27;s intervention on Buck&#x27;s behalf results in an armed face-off between the convicts. Emotionally broken, all three slump into depression. Ranken&#x27;s accomplice is lowered from a helicopter to the lead engine, but falls through the second engine&#x27;s windscreen, and then under the train.
Spurred on by the appearance of his archenemy with a resolve to not be returned to prison, Manny makes a perilous leap to the lead engine. He falls off the train but grabs onto the coupling to prevent himself from slipping off it. While attempting to reboard, the knuckle shifts, crushing his hand. Ranken boards the locomotive from the helicopter; Manny handcuffs him inside the lead engine after brutally beating him. Realizing what Manny intends to do, the frightened Ranken furiously demands Manny to stop the train before it crashes; but Manny has chosen to die (and take Ranken to his death with him) rather than be recaptured. When reminded of Buck and Sara in the second engine, Manny uncouples the lead engine from the rest of the train, which makes the latter shut down and come to a stop. He waves goodbye (ignoring Buck&#x27;s screaming pleas to shut down the lead engine) and climbs onto the roof in the freezing snow, with his arms stretched out, accepting his inevitable fate. Buck and Manny&#x27;s fellow inmates mourn in their cells as the lone engine vanishes into the storm. A quote from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; is then shown:

==Production==
===Akira Kurosawa===
Akira Kurosawa read an article in a 1963 &quot;Life&quot; magazine by Warren Young about a runaway train. He thought it would make a good film and contacted Joseph E. Levine about doing an international co-production. In June 1966, Kurosawa announced he would make &quot;Runaway Train&quot; for Joseph E. Levine&#x27;s Embassy Pictures. The budget was to be $5.6 million. The script was written by Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni and Ryuzo Kikushima, about two escaped convicts who hide on board a stationary train, only for it to roll away, gradually picking up tremendous speed. Sidney Carroll was hired to adapt Kurosawa&#x27;s script into English. The film would be shot along tracks between Syracuse and Rochester in New York over 16 weeks in October 1966. Tetsuo Aoyagi would produce and the film would be shot in 70 mm.

Plans to shoot were cancelled at the last minute, only to be scheduled and cancelled yet again. In April 1967 the project had been &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot; and Kurosawa signed to make &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;.

===Development===
In 1982 the Nippon Herald company, which owned Kurosawa&#x27;s script, asked Francis Ford Coppola to recommend a director. Coppola and his producer, Tom Luddy, suggested Andrei Konchalovsky. The director succeeded in raising finance from Cannon Films.

&quot;The design is still Kurosawa&#x27;s&quot;, said Andrei Konchalovsky. &quot;The concentration of energy and passion, the existential point of view, and the image of the train as something – perhaps civilization – out of control... Manny, the character played by Voight, feels, &#x27;Win or lose, what&#x27;s the difference?&#x27; That&#x27;s not very familiar to the Western mind. We tend to love winners, and we don&#x27;t like losers.&quot;

Konchalovsky knew Jon Voight, who had helped get the director his visa to work in the US in 1979 (Voight wanted Konchalovsky to direct &quot;Rhinestone Heights&quot; which was ultimately never made.)

Karen Allen was announced as the female lead. The part ended up being played by Rebecca De Mornay, who said &quot;It&#x27;s my first real action-oriented picture. There are scenes where I&#x27;m walking across the top of a train – things like that. I really wanted to do something that called for a lot of physical acting, where I&#x27;m acting not as much with words as with my body.&quot;

The Alaska Railroad decided that their name and logo would not be shown. Several scenes referred to the railroad as &quot;A&amp;E Northern.&quot; The filming took place near Portage Glacier, Whittier, and Grandview.

===Shooting===
Principal photography began spring of 1985, at the Butte, Anaconda, &amp; Pacific Roundhouse in Anaconda, Montana. During filming, the crew realized they didn&#x27;t have any real snow, due to warm temperatures (a false spring) in the area. They used Christmas tree flocks for fake snow, and they had to keep it from melting on the tracks at the west yard. Cannon Films had to cut short its stay in Anaconda, and they moved onto Deer Lodge, Montana, to film the prison scenes at the Old Montana State Prison. Approximately 200 extras were hired to play prisoners in the scenes. They spent a week filming several scenes at the prison. Finally, the second unit team went to Whittier, Alaska, to film on the Alaska Railroad tracks. The Bridge sequence was filmed on the Seneca Bridge on Placer Creek, about 5 miles (8 km) from Whittier. The scene where the signal maintainer at Jordan makes the switch on the tracks was filmed at Portage, Alaska. The cast and crew went to the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, to film the interior of the train scenes and the prisoners&#x27; escape scene.

The runaway train&#x27;s lineup in the movie consisted of four Alaska Railroad locomotives, all built by EMD: GP40-2 #3010, F7 #1500, and #1801 and #1810, both GP7s. The latter two locomotives had previously been rebuilt by ARR with low short hoods as opposed to a GP7&#x27;s original high short hood but were fitted with mock-up high hoods made of plywood for the film, branded with fictional numbers 531 and 812, respectively. Because #1801&#x27;s cab had been reconstructed prior to filming, the &#x27;531&#x27; prosthetic hood stood slightly higher than the normal hood height of a GP7 to fit over the locomotive&#x27;s number board.

The locomotives used in the film have gone their separate ways:
* ARR GP40-2 #3010 is still active on the Alaska Railroad, painted in the new corporate scheme.
* ARR F7 #1500 was retired from service in 1992, and is now at the Museum of Alaska Transportation and Industry Museum in Wasilla, Alaska, as can be seen on the front page of their website MuseumOfAlaska.org.
* ARR GP7 #1810 was sold to the Oregon Pacific Railroad and operated as OP #1810. In 2008, the unit was sold to the Cimarron Valley Railroad and is now permanently coupled to former OP Slug #1010.
* ARR GP7 #1801 was sold to a locomotive leasing company in Kansas City, Missouri, then sold to the Missouri Central Railroad and operated as MOC #1800. The locomotive subsequently appeared in another motion picture, &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;, in 1995. MOC became the Central Midland Railroad in 2002. As Central Midland had its own leased power, MOC 1800 was returned to Midwest Locomotive In Kansas City. Shortly after, it was then sold to the Respondek Rail Corp of Granite City, Illinois, and is now used on Respondek&#x27;s Port Harbor Railroad subsidiary. The unit&#x27;s identification is RRC #1800. As of 2015, the locomotive has been stored, is out of service, needing wheelwork. A return to service on the Port Harbor Railroad is unlikely, as there is talk about sending the unit to another Respondek Operation.
* The train that was hit by the runaway was led by MRS-1 #1605. This unit had been retired in 1984, one year before filming started. The unit has since been cut up for scrap.
* Sequences set at the rail yard, shot on the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway in Anaconda, Montana, used local locomotives from the BA&amp;P fleet along with former Northern Pacific EMD F9 #7012A, leased from the Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad. The two GP7s and the F9 were fitted with plywood boxes to duplicate the distinctive &#x27;winterization hatches&#x27; carried on their Alaskan counterparts.
* BA&amp;P EMD GP38-2 #109, the BA&amp;P locomotive used in the yard scenes as the lead engine in place of ARR #3010, was subsequently sold to the Alaska Railroad and remains in service there as #2002, along with sister unit #2001 (ex-BA&amp;P #108).

Richard (Rick) Holley was killed prior to the start of principal photography when the helicopter he was piloting hit power lines while scouting for shoot locations in Alaska. The film is dedicated to him during the closing credits.

==Music==
USSR Academic Russian Chorus is credited for Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot;. The film was scored by composer Trevor Jones.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Runaway Train&quot; had its premiere in New York City on November 15, 1985, followed by its limited release in 965 theatres on December 6, 1985. It made $2,601,480 on that weekend. It was released nationwide on January 17, 1986, and was well received by critics, but failed to find an audience. It opened in 8th place on its premiere weekend and failed to make back its production cost. The film also had a premiere in Anaconda, Montana at the Washoe Theater on March 20, 1986. Invitations for the premiere were sent to people from the Department of Commerce, Rarus Railroad, and Cannon Films personnel, as well as Jon Voight, Eric Roberts, and Rebecca De Mornay. However, none of the actors could attend. The film made $7,936,012 worldwide.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Runaway Train&quot; received generally positive reviews, and has an 83% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Charging forward with the momentum of a locomotive, &quot;Runaway Train&quot; makes great use of its adrenaline-fueled premise and star presences of Jon Voight and Eric Roberts&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Janet Maslin, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, felt that much of the film was absurd but that Jon Voight&#x27;s performance was excellent, and she credits the film for &quot;crude energy and bravado&quot;. In 2010, movie critic Michael Phillips said on his show &quot;At the Movies&quot; that it was the most under-rated movie of the 1980s. Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars. Ebert wrote the opening prison scenes were well-made but routine, while the film&#x27;s genius showed in the train sequences with &quot;stunning&quot; action scenes and the contrast between Roberts&#x27; &quot;wild man&quot; persona and Voight&#x27;s &quot;intelligent&quot; convict; DeMornay&#x27;s &quot;role as an outsider gives them an audience and a mirror.&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;Runaway Train&quot; was listed at 64th place out of 100 on this list.

===Accolades===
The film was entered into the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.

==Influence==

&quot;Speed&quot;, a 1994 Hollywood film with a runaway bus, was inspired by &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. Screenwriter Graham Yost was told by his father, Canadian television host Elwy Yost, about &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, and that it was about a train that speeds out of control. Elwy mistakenly believed that the train&#x27;s situation was due to a bomb on board. Such a theme had in fact been used in &quot;The Bullet Train&quot;. After seeing the Voight film, Graham decided that it would have been better if there had been a bomb on board a bus with the bus being forced to travel at to prevent an actual explosion. A friend suggested that this be increased to .

<text>Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch was an American hip-hop group formed in 1991 by Mark Wahlberg (alias Marky Mark), Scott Gee, Hector the Booty Inspector, DJ-T, and Ashey Ace. The group&#x27;s best known song is &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, which made it to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1991, while their follow-up song &quot;Wildside&quot; peaked at number 10.
==History==
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch released their debut album, &quot;Music for the People&quot; on July 23, 1991. The album was a huge success for the group, making it to No. 1 on the Top Heatseekers chart and No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s success was fueled by two top-10 singles, both of which were certified gold, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, which went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Wildside&quot; which went to No. 10 on the Hot 100. The album itself first went gold on November 15, 1991, before being certified platinum on January 14, 1992.

At the height of the group&#x27;s success, they also had a video game released by Digital Pictures titled &quot;Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch: Make My Video&quot;, but the game was not a success and has been considered one of the worst video games ever made.

After the success of &quot;Music for the People&quot;, the group quickly recorded a follow-up titled &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; that was released on September 15, 1992. However, the album achieved little success, only making it as high as No. 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, as did the album&#x27;s lone charting single also titled &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; which went to 49 on the Hot 100. The group disbanded in 1993 with their last appearance being &quot;I Want You&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; movie soundtrack.

After the group disbanded, Mark continued his music career by teaming with reggae musician Prince Ital Joe. The duo released two albums in Europe and had a No. 1 hit in Germany with &quot;United&quot;. Mark continued to release music until retiring in 1998 and becoming a successful actor in the United States.

<doc id="168559" wikidata="Q2091430" url="?curid=168559" title="Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Slabodka)">
<text>Nosson Tzvi Finkel (, Sephardic/Israeli: &quot;Natan Tzvi&quot;; ; 1849–1927) was an influential Lithuanian Jewish leader of Orthodox Judaism in Eastern Europe and founder of the Slabodka yeshiva, in the town of Sloboda Vilyampolskaya (now Vilijampolė, a suburb of Kaunas). He is also known by the Yiddish appellation &quot;der Alter&quot; (&quot;the Elder&quot;) and as the Alter of Slabodka. Many of his pupils were to become major leaders of Orthodox Judaism in the USA and Israel.

==Early years==
Rabbi Finkel was born in 1849 to Reb Moshe Finkel and was orphaned at an early age, not much is known about his formative years. At a young age, he went to study at the Kelm Talmud Torah under Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv, &quot;the Alter of Kelm.&quot;

==Philosophical approach==

Despite his influence, he was an intensely private person. Yet, he personally oversaw the complete student body of the yeshiva.

His motto was summed up in the words &quot;Gadlus HaAdam&quot; (&quot;Greatness of Man&quot;). He stressed the need for &quot;mussar&quot; (ethics), using works such as those of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, polishing the character traits of his students so that they would aspire to become &quot;gedolim&quot; - &quot;great ones&quot; in all areas of both scholarship, and personal ethics.

He spent ten out of every twelve months with his students full-time, only returning to his wife for the Jewish holidays. He had special agents who would keep an eye out all over Europe for teenagers with an aptitude for both scholarship and leadership, recruiting them and bringing them back to Slobodka. He attained unusual success, and his students subsequently reflected that he was a master of the human psyche and knew just which psychological buttons to press to give direction to his students&#x27; lives.

He would monitor the extracurricular behavior of students, judging their character faults and strengths. He was responsible for deciding which boys would share rooms together, weighing the strengths of one against the other. Some were chosen to be his personal assistants. He stressed the importance of outer appearance and the need for neatness and cleanliness. He did not want the image of the poor, tattered, down-trodden &quot;yeshiva bochur&quot; (yeshiva student) to be associated with the alumni of his institution. The rabbinical and Talmudical graduates of the Slobodka Yeshiva tried to live up to a higher code of dress and deportment, to the point of being accused of being dandies.

He would send teams of his trained prized pupils to places that needed a boost in religious observance and learning of Torah. His own son, Eliezer Yehudah (&quot;Leizer Yudel&quot;) Finkel eventually became the head of the far older Mir yeshiva, eventually leading it all the way to Jerusalem where it is today the largest post-high school yeshiva in the world with thousands of students.

==Opposition==

His main opponents in the &quot;&quot;yeshiva&quot; world&quot; were first and foremost Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik and as a result the Brisk yeshivas, who were adamantly opposed to any changes in what they believed to be the time-tested ways of yeshiva education. To this day, the Brisk yeshivos, based mainly in Jerusalem today, do not teach &quot;mussar&quot; (ethics) as a separate curriculum, but focus on pure Talmud study.

Finkel&#x27;s opponents argued that the pure focus on the Talmud would automatically create greatness in both scholarship and ethics. But Finkel believed that, while this might have been true in previous generations, the modern age was different. In his view, too many new enticing secular ideologies, such as Socialism and Zionism and the very real lure of atheism in universities, were becoming a replacement for traditional Judaism for many young Jews. He was determined to prove that what he had to offer was more appealing than anything the outside world could offer.

==Land of Israel==

Finkel staged one of the most dramatic moves in the history of yeshivos. In the 1920s he decided to create a branch of his yeshiva in the Land of Israel, together with the dean Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein, setting it up in Hebron and sending waves of hand-picked students there, culminating with his own permanent &quot;aliyah&quot;, &quot;going up&quot;, to the Holy Land two years before his passing.
In the region of Palestine he founded his own institution in the town of Hebron called &quot;Knesses Yisroel&quot; - &quot;Gathering of Israel&quot;, which moved to Jerusalem following the massacre of Jews during the 1929 Palestine riots in which many of the yeshiva students were murdered. This yeshiva today, Yeshivas Chevron in Jerusalem, has about a thousand students and is one of the most prestigious Lithuanian yeshivos in Israel.

==Influence==

During his lifetime, he molded many who would eventually become the heads (&quot;roshei yeshiva&quot;) of most of the so-called Lithuanian-style yeshivas that were established in the United States and Israel during the 20th century, and which continue to grow dramatically in the 21st century. Some of the more famous students are:
* Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (son of the &quot;Alter&quot;) of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Mir and Jerusalem, Israel
* Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin of Brooklyn, New York
* Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in Brooklyn, New York
* Rabbi Avrohom Eliyahu Kaplan of Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin, Germany
* Rabbi Aharon Kotler, of Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, New Jersey
* Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim: Rabbinical Seminary of America in Queens
* Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, Maryland
* Rabbi Yechezkel Sarna, head of Chevron Yeshiva, Jerusalem, Israel
* Rabbi Isaac Sher, head of the Slabodka Yeshiva of Bnei Brak, Israel
* Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg of Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin, Germany

&quot;The Alter&quot; did not author any books or essays personally, but some of his ethical discourses were published under the name &quot;Ohr HaTzafun&quot; - &quot;The Hidden Light&quot; (also meaning &quot;The Light of the Hidden (One)&quot;). The word &quot;Ha-Tz[a]-F[u]-N&quot; also being the four initials of his name, but not in order (&quot;Hirsh-Tzvi-Finkel-Nota&quot;). The title alludes to the hidden and mysterious nature of its subject, as he used to sign his name as &quot;Hatzafun&quot;.

<doc id="168561" wikidata="Q470916" url="?curid=168561" title="The Color of Money">
<text>The Color of Money is a 1986 American sports drama film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is the sequel to the 1961 film &quot;The Hustler&quot;. Like the previous film, &quot;The Color of Money&quot; is based on the 1984 novel by Walter Tevis.

The film stars Paul Newman reprising his role as &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film also stars Tom Cruise playing a pool hustler, and features Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as the girlfriend of Cruise&#x27;s character. The plot follows the trio as they hustle pool halls and make their way to a nine-ball tournament in Atlantic City. The film received a generally positive critical response on its release, although some critics thought that the film was an inferior followup to &quot;The Hustler&quot;.

==Plot==
Former pro-pool player &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson has given up the game and is now a successful liquor salesman in Chicago. However, he partners with pool players, including a hustler named Julian, who is outmatched at nine-ball by the young and charismatic Vincent. Recognizing Vincent&#x27;s skill, and his girlfriend Carmen&#x27;s inexperience at luring players to lose money, Eddie tells the couple of their excellent potential for hustling.

Carmen visits Eddie alone to inquire about his interest in Vincent. Finding him working at Child World, Eddie invites Vincent to leave the next day for six weeks of hustling on the road, culminating in a nine-ball tournament in Atlantic City. Manipulating Vincent&#x27;s insecurities about Carmen and giving him a valuable Balabushka cue stick, Eddie persuades him to accept his offer. Eddie&#x27;s abrupt departure upsets Julian, as well as Eddie&#x27;s girlfriend, Janelle.

Vincent and Carmen hit the road with Eddie in his Cadillac, visiting a series of pool halls, with Eddie taking most of any winnings and absorbing losses. Eddie attempts to teach him the art of hustling, but Vincent balks at having to play below his ability. At a pool hall run by his old acquaintance, Orvis, Eddie becomes fed up with Vincent&#x27;s arrogance, and leaves him. In Vincent&#x27;s absence, Eddie reminds Carmen that they are partners with a mutual business interest in Vincent. Eddie returns to find Vincent grandstanding, beating the pool hall&#x27;s best player but scaring off a wealthier . Eddie and Vincent talk frankly, agreeing that Vincent must curb his ego if they are to succeed.

Eddie and Carmen struggle to rein in Vincent&#x27;s showboating. After a string of successful games, Vincent plays the famed Grady Seasons, but is directed by Eddie to the game to inflate the odds against Vincent in Atlantic City. Goaded by Grady, Vincent nearly fails to throw the game, and Eddie is inspired to play again. After some success, Eddie is beaten by Amos, a hustler. Humiliated, Eddie leaves Vincent and Carmen with enough money to make it to Atlantic City.

Eddie enters the Atlantic City tournament, in which he triumphs against Vincent. Vincent and Carmen surprise Eddie with $8,000; his &quot;cut&quot; of Vincent&#x27;s winnings. Vincent says that he intentionally lost their match.

In his semifinal match, Eddie forfeits the game and returns Vincent&#x27;s money. Determined to win legitimately, Eddie faces Vincent in a private match, declaring, &quot;I&#x27;m back!&quot;

==Production==
Paul Newman called Martin Scorsese in September 1984 and asked him if he was interested in directing a sequel to &quot;The Hustler&quot;. The original screenplay sent to Scorsese was written by Darryl Ponicsan and it &quot;incorporated the first twelve minutes of the original film&quot; according to Scorsese. Walter Tevis wrote a sequel to his novel &quot;The Hustler&quot;, called &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, and died the same day producer Irving Axelrad received galley proofs of the book.

Scorsese shot the film in 49 days at a cost of $14.5 million, $1.5 million under budget. Michael Ballhaus was the cinematographer for the film. &quot;The Color of Money&quot; was released by Touchstone Pictures, after both 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures declined. Richard Price adapted Tevis&#x27;s novel. Although it features some characters from the novel, it was not written to be a sequel. A screenplay was written by Tevis, but the filmmakers decided not to use it. Jean-Pierre Léaud was briefly considered for the role of Vincent. It was shot in and around Chicago, with much of the filming taking place in pool and billiard halls, rather than in built sets. The film was edited by Thelma Schoonmaker, who used closeup shots of pool balls being played, as well as wider visuals of the players, to get across the visual of a pool hall.

Scorsese considered shooting the film in black and white. He cited the influence of techniques and lighting in the 1947 Powell-Pressburger film, &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, when making &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. In particular, he stated that the extreme closeups of Tom Cruise around the pool table were inspired by those of the nuns in that film.

Newman said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to &quot;try not to be funny&quot;. Cruise performed most of his own pool shots. An exception was a over two balls to another. Scorsese believed that Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by professional player, Mike Sigel. Cruise mentioned that, to prepare for the role, he bought a pool table for his apartment and practiced for hours on end. Standing in for the valuable Balabushka cue in the movie is a Joss J-18 (which became the Joss 10-N7), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.

Sigel was a technical director, and he and fellow player, Ewa Mataya Laurance, served as technical consultants and shot performers in the film. Absent from the film is the character, Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason in &quot;The Hustler&quot;. Newman said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman&#x27;s opinion that Minnesota Fats was not essential to the film&#x27;s story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented with a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but after reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as &quot;an afterthought&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Color of Money&quot; had its world premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City October 8, 1986. The film went into wide release in the United States October 17, 1986. The American release was limited to select theaters throughout the country, with the film opening in more theaters during the next four weeks of its initial release. After its run, the film grossed $52,293,982 domestically. The film was released on DVD January 3, 2000, and on Blu-ray June 5, 2012.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;The Color of Money&quot; received a generally positive critical response on its release, although some critics thought that the film was an inferior followup to &quot;The Hustler&quot;. Based on 48 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 88% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 7.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;That it&#x27;s inferior to the original goes without saying, but Paul Newman and Tom Cruise are a joy to watch, and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s direction is typically superb.&quot; Review aggregator website Metacritic reported a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

The film was praised for the major cast. Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented on the &quot;three fully realized&quot; main characters, and that the journey with them throughout the film is &quot;most satisfying&quot;. Canby, however, also commented that it &quot;lacks in narrative shapeliness&quot;, before giving the film 9 out of 10.

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called these characters an &quot;electrifying unholy trio&quot;, and praised the metaphors between hustling and pool.

&quot;Miami Herald&quot; writer Bill Cosford, however, commented that &quot;whatever Scorsese and Price have to say about these marvelous characters, it is not anything interesting&quot;.

Tom Hutchingson of &quot;Radio Times&quot; said that Newman &quot;deserved&quot; to win an Oscar for his performance.

Reviewers compared &quot;The Color of Money&quot; with other Scorsese films. Jason Bailey, writing for &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, described the film as only &quot;mid-level&quot; for the director, but that it was so &quot;overpowering ... jazzy and boisterous&quot; that he could not help but enjoy.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Gene Siskel commented that the &quot;grit is gone&quot;, for Scorsese was not backed up by a veteran contributor, as in his other works.

&quot;People&quot; commented that the film benefited from the cast of characters, and Scorsese&#x27;s choice of actors.

===Accolades===
For &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, Newman received the Academy Award for Best Actor, his first Academy Award and his seventh nomination.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album of the motion picture was released by MCA Records in 1986. Robbie Robertson produced the score for the film.

<text>New Kids on the Block (also initialized as NKOTB) is an American boy band from Dorchester, Massachusetts. The band consists of brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg, and Danny Wood. New Kids on the Block had success in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have sold more than 80 million records worldwide, and are often credited for paving the way for future boy bands such as Take That, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. They won two American Music Awards in 1990 for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. 

Formed in 1984, New Kids on the Block achieved stardom in 1989, an achievement listed as number 16 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments&quot;. The group disbanded in 1994. In 2007, the group reunited to record an album and mount a concert tour in 2008. Since then the group has released two more studio albums and have continued to tour.

The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.

==History==
===1984–1985: Early career===
In the early 1980s, Maurice Starr discovered pop/R&amp;B quintet New Edition, and guided their early success. After he was fired by New Edition for embezzling funds, Starr and his business partner, Mary Alford, sought to create a white counterpart act. Fifteen-year-old Donnie Wahlberg impressed Starr and Alford with his rapping skills, becoming the group&#x27;s first member. He was initially joined by his younger brother Mark, who left the group after only a few months. Donnie then recruited his school friends Jamie Kelly, Jordan Knight and Danny Wood to join the group; Knight was followed into the group by his older brother Jonathan Knight, while Kelly left the group early on.

When a search was made to find a Michael Jackson-esque singer to replace Kelly, Starr recruited 12-year-old Joey McIntyre, who initially struggled to fit in with the group. With the final lineup in place, Starr rehearsed the boys after school and on weekends, and eventually secured the group a recording contract at Columbia Records.

Originally, the group was called Nynuk (pronounced &quot;na-nook&quot;). Nikki Van Noy, author of the group&#x27;s official biography, wrote in 2012 that the name Nynuk is &quot;meaningless&quot;, although a 1989 article by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested a possible connection to &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;. Columbia demanded Starr change the name of the group. Subsequently, they settled on New Kids on the Block, after a rap song that Donnie Wahlberg had written and arranged for their first album. The group was signed to Columbia&#x27;s black music division and originally marketed to black audiences.

===1986–1987: &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot; (debut album)===

In April 1986, Columbia Records released the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album. The album was almost exclusively written and produced by Maurice Starr, and featured mid-1980s bubblegum pop material. The first single, &quot;Be My Girl&quot;, received minor airplay around the group&#x27;s native Boston but failed to capture nationwide attention. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Stop It Girl&quot;, fared even worse. The New Kids went on tour around the New England states, singing wherever Starr could book them: in bars, school dances, and clubs. Nevertheless, Starr remained diligent and persuaded the label to allow the group to record a second album.

===1988–1989: &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot;===

After the failure of the first album, Starr had the group back in the studio for most of 1987 and 1988 recording their second album. Dissatisfied with the excessively bubblegum sound of their first album, the group wanted to have more input on their look, direction and song material. As a result, Wahlberg, Wood and Jordan Knight received associate producer credit on the final product. The album, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot;, was released to modest fanfare in September. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go Girl&quot;, a ballad released in the spring of 1988. Failure seemed destined a second time when the song became another that went unnoticed by the listening public, and Columbia Records made plans to drop the New Kids from the label. At the eleventh hour, however, a pop radio station in Florida began playing the song. Scoring listener approval, it soon became the most requested song on their play list. When Columbia caught wind of the positive response, they decided to keep the group on its roster and put more effort into promoting the single. Columbia decided to re-shoot a music video for &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go Girl&quot;, hiring director Doug Nichol, and sent the video to thousands of radio stations across the country to show the group&#x27;s visual appeal. National attention soon followed and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go Girl&quot; eventually climbed to No. 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 Singles Chart—becoming the group&#x27;s first hit.

In the meantime, the group began making national televised appearances on such music programs as &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; and &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Producer Maurice Starr then held auditions to secure a band of musicians suitable for touring with the New Kids, approving musical director and keyboardist Greg McPherson, bassist David Dyson, keyboardist Yasko Kubota, guitarist Nerida Rojas, and drummer Derrick Antunes. The New Kids later landed a spot as an opening act for fellow teen-pop act Tiffany on the U.S. leg of her concert tour. Sales of &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; steadily increased as the group&#x27;s national attention slowly rose. At year&#x27;s end, the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;You Got It (The Right Stuff)&quot;, was released. The song was given a huge boost when MTV took notice of the group and began playing the video in regular rotation, including an appearance on Club MTV. By early 1989, it cracked the top five. The New Kids hit pay dirt with their next single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Loving You (Forever)&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart in June. The group had been scheduled to open for Tiffany once again on a second tour, but their sudden popularity caused a reversal, and she wound up opening for them (although the two acts were technically billed as &quot;co-headliners&quot;).

More top five singles from &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; followed into the summer and fall, including the title track and &quot;Cover Girl&quot;. Columbia Records also released the single &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot; (a cover of The Delfonics&#x27; classic hit), from the group&#x27;s previously overlooked debut album. The song went No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles on the strength of the group&#x27;s popularity and effectively jump-started the sales of that album as well. By the end of 1989, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; had climbed to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums Chart and had gone eight-times platinum. They subsequently became the first &#x27;teen&#x27; act to garner five top ten hits from a single album.

Meanwhile, a top ten charting holiday album, &quot;Merry, Merry Christmas&quot;, was released in the fall—spawning another top 10 hit, &quot;This One&#x27;s for the Children&quot;, and going double platinum in the U.S. The proceeds were donated to United Cerebral Palsy, the New Kids&#x27; favorite charitable cause. &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; would go on to spend 132 weeks on the chart, and in January 1990, the album won two American Music Awards for &quot;Best Pop/Rock Album&quot; and &quot;Best Pop/Rock Group&quot;. With the success of &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind)&quot;, &quot;Cover Girl&quot;, and &quot;This One&#x27;s For the Children&quot;, the group pulled off a rare feat of having three singles on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, but each from a different album.

Columbia Music Video also released a home video, &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot;, a documentary on the band directed by Doug Nichol and produced by Bryan Johnson that included their four hit music videos and a live concert recorded during their 1989 tour. It achieved massive sales, earning a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video nomination, and was one of the biggest selling music videos of all time.

The then governor of Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis, declared April 24, 1989 to be &quot;New Kids on the Block Day&quot;.

===1990–1993: &quot;Step by Step&quot; and lip syncing allegations===

By early 1990, New Kids on the Block had become one of the most popular acts in the United States. That May, they followed up &quot;Hangin&#x27; Tough&quot; with &quot;Step by Step&quot;, for which just over half of the songs were cowritten and produced by the members themselves. The first single, the title track, hit number one on the Hot 100 Singles Chart and became their biggest-selling single. It was followed up with their ninth consecutive top-ten single, &quot;Tonight&quot;. The group was achieving significant international success, as well: &quot;Let&#x27;s Try It Again&quot; hit No. 8 on the UK singles chart, while &quot;Baby I Believe in You&quot; went to number one in Japan. The album was eventually certified triple platinum, selling close to 20 million copies worldwide. By late 1990, David Dyson assumed the role of musical director.

The group performed an estimated two hundred concerts a year, with an extravagant worldwide concert tour that summer called &quot;The Magic Summer Tour&quot;, sponsored by Coke. The tour ultimately grossed $74 million ($133 million adjusted for inflation), making them the top-grossing touring act in the country at the time and one of the highest-grossing concert tours of the decade, with overall attendance of 3.2 million people. Their 1990 pay-per-view special broke records at the time. During this time, NKOTB licensed merchandise flooded the market, including lunch boxes, buttons, t-shirts, comic books (published by Harvey Comics), and dolls. They inspired a Saturday morning cartoon, developed by the Pangea Corporation and animated by DIC Entertainment. In 1991, sales of the group&#x27;s merchandise was estimated at US$400 million.

New Kids on the Block&#x27;s official fan club had a membership of over 200,000 and was one of the largest in the United States. The official NKOTB hotline, 1-900-909-5KIDs, received approximately 100,000 calls per week. In 1991, the group topped &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of highest paid entertainers, ahead of Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince and Bill Cosby. At year&#x27;s end, Columbia released &quot;No More Games/The Remix Album&quot;, a compilation of remixes of the group&#x27;s biggest hits. It produced two singles, &quot;Call It What You Want (The C&amp;C Pump-It Mix)&quot; (UK #12) and &quot;Games (The New Kids Get Hard Mix)&quot; (UK #14), for which videos were also released.

The group released no new material in 1991, and instead toured throughout Europe and Asia. That summer, Wood and Wahlberg cowrote and produced the debut album from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, headed by Mark Wahlberg, Donnie&#x27;s brother and a former New Kid. Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s album, which would end up going platinum, scored a number-one hit with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.In 1991, they performed the halftime show at Super Bowl XXV, a first for a pop music group, however the performance was not broadcast on TV due to a preemption for a speech from President George H. W. Bush regarding the Gulf War.

In early 1992, the group released the stand-alone single &quot;If You Go Away&quot;, the only new track on the compilation &quot;H.I.T.S.&quot;. The song peaked at No. 16 on the US charts and No. 9 in the UK. Meanwhile, as the music industry was still reeling from the Milli Vanilli lip-syncing scandal, NKOTB found themselves accused of lip-syncing by Gregory McPherson. Credited as an associate producer and string arranger on the &quot;Step by Step&quot; album and a music teacher at Berklee College of Music, McPherson alleged that Maurice Starr sang the vocals while the group lip-synced to pre-recorded vocals during their live performances. McPherson also filed a breach of contract and creative infringement lawsuit against Starr.

The group immediately responded to the allegations and interrupted the Australian leg of their tour to fly to Los Angeles to perform live on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show.&quot; After performing a medley of their previous hits and their new single, the group (along with Starr) was interviewed by Hall. The group admitted to singing with a backing track during live performances and also admitted that Starr sang harmony on some background vocals.

On February 10, 1992, the New Kids filed a defamation lawsuit against McPherson regarding his lip-syncing allegations. In April 1992, McPherson dropped his suit against Starr and released a statement recanting his previous allegations stating, &quot;[The New Kids] did sing lead on their vocals&quot;.

By the time the lip-syncing allegations surfaced, the group was starting to experience a backlash. Despite their success, the group was regularly dismissed by critics for their attempts to promote themselves as an urban act and their practice of using backing vocals for live performances. The group&#x27;s record sales also began to decline due to a shift in musical tastes to gangsta rap and grunge music.

===1993–1995: &quot;Face the Music&quot; and split===

In 1993, after having split from Maurice Starr, the group shortened their name to the initialism NKOTB. In January 1994, their fourth studio album, &quot;Face the Music&quot;, was released. Their first studio album in close to four years, &quot;Face the Music&quot; was a musical departure from the group&#x27;s previous efforts. Nearly all the songs were written and/or co-produced by the group. In spite of some positive critical reception, the album failed to live up to commercial expectation. The album&#x27;s final single to chart was &quot;Dirty Dawg&quot; (which featured a rap cameo by Nice &amp; Smooth), peaking at No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;Never Let You Go&quot;, failed to chart in the U.S., but did reach No. 42 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 18 in the Canadian charts.

NKOTB went on tour to support the album, playing smaller venues such as clubs and theaters, as opposed to the arenas and stadiums they were once accustomed to. After experiencing increased panic attacks and anxiety, Jonathan Knight left the band. Shortly thereafter, the remaining four decided to officially disband the group.

After the group&#x27;s split, most of the group members started families and began to venture into other avenues. Jonathan Knight and Danny Wood maintained low profiles, while the other three continued their careers individually. Wahlberg, in particular, followed the lead of his younger brother, Mark Wahlberg, and started an acting career. McIntyre and Jordan Knight recorded solo albums in 1999. In 1999, MTV attempted to reunite the group and get them to perform on that year&#x27;s VMAs. All of the members were on board for the project, except Jonathan. Without him, the performance did not happen. In 2004, Aamer Haleem, host of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;, also attempted to convince each of the members of New Kids on the Block to reunite for a one-night performance for the show. This time Jonathan agreed. However, McIntyre, Wahlberg, and Wood all declined. While Wood and Wahlberg declined on-camera interviews, McIntyre cited that the only way he would perform with the band was if the group would make the decision to reunite permanently.

===2008–2012: Reunion, &quot;The Block&quot; and NKOTBSB===
In April 2008, after months of speculation, Wahlberg confirmed to CNN that the group had reunited with plans to record new material and to stage a tour. The following month, the group released their first single since reuniting, &quot;Summertime&quot;. The cover of the single featured the name &quot;New Kids on the Block&quot;, re-lengthened from the initials NKOTB.

On August 12, 2008, they released their second single, &quot;Single&quot;, featuring R&amp;B singer Ne-Yo, followed by the release of the group&#x27;s first studio album in fourteen years, &quot;The Block&quot;. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums Chart and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in September 2008. It was certified Gold in October 2008, in Canada.

The group&#x27;s reunion tour, New Kids on the Block: Live, began at Toronto&#x27;s Air Canada Centre on September 18, 2008. They toured the US with Natasha Bedingfield and Lady Gaga as supporting acts. There were 48 total concerts scheduled for Canada and the United States, nine in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, one in France, one in Amsterdam, Netherlands and two in Germany. A NKOTB-sponsored &quot;theme&quot; concert cruise (for their fans) departed from Miami, Florida and traveled to the Bahamas from May 15–18, 2009. The group also announced the Full Service Tour for 2009, featuring Jesse McCartney and Jabbawockeez.

Group member Jordan Knight announced a new concert cruise for 2010. After the tour, each member took a break on doing other endeavors. McIntyre recorded a few songs written and produced by fellow musicians such as himself, Drew Ryan Scott from boy band After Romeo, Brent Paschke, and Gabe Lopez. Wahlberg worked on his own music as well, releasing a single called &quot;I Got It&quot; featuring Aubrey O&#x27;Day (formerly from Danity Kane) and &quot;Rise and Grind&quot; featuring Roscoe Umali.

On Friday, August 13, 2010, tickets went on sale for the third annual NKOTB cruise which would take place aboard the Carnival &quot;Destiny&quot;, leaving from Miami, FL on Thursday, May 12, 2011, to Nassau and Half Moon Cay, Bahamas and returning to Miami, FL on Monday, May 16, 2011. Once again, the cruise sold out the same day it went on sale, with thousands of fans on a &#x27;waitlist&#x27; standing by for any openings on the boat due to cancellations.

On August 18, 2010, an &#x27;unofficial&#x27; announcement was made that NKOTB and the Backstreet Boys would be touring together in 2011 after the successful surprise collaboration performance at Radio City Music Hall on June 19, 2010. On October 8, 2010, Brian Littrell, a member of the Backstreet Boys, gave the tour a 78% chance of happening. He also stated that he and Wahlberg had been working on songs together.

On November 3, 2010, an official announcement was made that NKOTB and BSB would be touring together in the summer of 2011 along with Jordin Sparks and Ashlyne Huff. In May 2011, Matthew Morrison confirmed during an interview on talk show &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot; that he would also be joining the tour. The NKOTBSB Tour began on May 25, 2011, and ended in June 2012. They also released a compilation album &quot;NKOTBSB&quot; which included 2 new songs.

On June 22, 2012, NKOTB was among 24 celebrities selected by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for 2013.

McIntyre stated during Summer Mixtape Festival that they were making a new album and unlike their previous album &quot;The Block&quot;, there will be no collaboration on it.

===2013–2023: &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Thankful&quot;, and &quot;Battle of Boston with New Edition&quot;===
On January 22, 2013, the group appeared on &quot;The View&quot; and announced that they were going to release a new single titled &quot;Remix (I Like The)&quot; on January 28 and a new album titled &quot;10&quot; on April 2, 2013, via Kobalt Label Services. During the show, they also announced that they were going to tour North America with 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men as their opening acts in summer 2013. &quot;10&quot; was released on April 2, 2013, and received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. The group appeared on various television series to promote the album including &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, and an iHeartRadio concert release party. The album made its debut at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart marking their 5th top 10 studio album in the US. The group, along with Boyz II Men performed on the Boston Strong telethon on May 30, 2013.

On February 3, 2014, the band announced their European Tour 2014. The official website described the tour: &#x27;Kicking-off at the Annex in Stockholm on May 6 and culminating at Clyde Auditorium in Glasgow on June 1, the shows will take place at some of the most intimate venues across Europe, giving our fans a rare opportunity to get up-close-and-personal with the band.&#x27; Following the tour the group met up in New York to embark on the 6th annual NKOTB Cruise. Also, in the Spring of 2014 they announced a limited engagement in Las Vegas. The show entitled &quot;New Kids on the Block After Dark&quot; ran for 4 consecutive nights from July 10–13, 2014 at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood.

On October 9, 2014, the group received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In January 2015, the group announced they would be embarking on a summer tour called The Main Event, with TLC and Nelly. They also starred on Pop&#x27;s &quot;Rock This Boat: New Kids on the Block&quot;, a reality television series featuring the band on a cruise to Bermuda. The show was renewed for a second season the following year.

The group played themselves on an episode of the second season of &quot;Fuller House&quot; entitled, &quot;New Kids in the House&quot;, where they performed multiple songs including &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go Girl&quot; as well as singing Happy Birthday to DJ Tanner in the show. The episode was released on December 9, 2016.

In November 2016, the group announced a new tour called The Total Package Tour with Paula Abdul &amp; Boyz II Men. The 44-city North American tour spanned May 12 through July 16 and marked Abdul&#x27;s first tour in more than 20 years. In March 2017 during an appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; they performed the new single &quot;One More Night&quot; from the EP &quot;Thankful&quot;, which was released on May 12 to coincide with the start of the tour.

In December 2017, they released an expanded version of the EP entitled &quot;Thankful (Unwrapped)&quot;, now including the Target-only track &quot;We Were Here&quot; (featuring DMX) as well as three newly recorded holiday songs, their first new material of holiday music in 28 years. Additionally, they announced a short-film documentary filmed during their summer tour will be released on December 9.

In October 2018, New Kids announced their MixTape Tour, which would include 1980s and 1990s stars such as Salt-N-Pepa, Naughty by Nature, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany. It was to run from May 2, 2019, in Cincinnati, Ohio, through July 14 in Hollywood, Florida. On December 13, 2018, New Kids announced they would perform at Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 2019 in Times Square.

On March 2, 2019, New Kids released a new music video &quot;Boys in the Band (Boy Band Anthem)&quot;, which included cameos from Lance Bass, Debbie Gibson, Naughty by Nature, as well as Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe of New Edition. It also included shout outs and easter eggs to several boy bands throughout the years: The Osmonds, Jackson 5, New Edition, Boyz II Men, Bell Biv DeVoe, Backstreet Boys, B2K, 98°, LFO, Menudo, JLS, O-Town, BTS, NSYNC, One Direction, Take That, and Westlife, as well as New Kids themselves.

On May 2, 2019, the Mixtape Tour began in Cincinnati, Ohio, with New Kids as the headliners. Other performers on the tour include Salt-N-Pepa, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, and Naughty by Nature. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, NKOTB released the single &quot;House Party&quot; which peaked at number five on Billboard&#x27;s Digital Songs chart. The song featured Naughty by Nature, Boyz II Men, Big Freedia and Jordin Sparks. On August 6, 2021, New Kids on the Block played a concert at Fenway Park in Boston with special guest Bell Biv Devoe and surprise guest D-Nice, as well as Joey&#x27;s son Griffin McIntyre.

On March 3, 2022, NKOTB uploaded the music video &quot;Bring Back the Time&quot;, which features Salt-N-Pepa, Rick Astley, and En Vogue.

<doc id="168565" wikidata="Q118116" url="?curid=168565" title="Dexter Gordon">
<text>Dexter Gordon (February 27, 1923 – April 25, 1990) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist, composer, and bandleader. He was among the most influential early bebop musicians. Gordon&#x27;s height was , so he was also known as &quot;Long Tall Dexter&quot; and &quot;Sophisticated Giant&quot;. His studio and performance career spanned more than 40 years.

Gordon&#x27;s sound was commonly characterized as being &quot;large&quot; and spacious and he had a tendency to play behind the beat. He inserted musical quotes into his solos, with sources as diverse as &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and well-known melodies from the operas of Wagner. Quoting from various musical sources is not unusual in jazz improvisation, but Gordon did it frequently enough to make it a hallmark of his style. One of his major influences was Lester Young. Gordon, in turn, was an early influence on John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Rollins and Coltrane then influenced Gordon&#x27;s playing as he explored hard bop and modal playing during the 1960s.

Gordon had a genial and humorous stage presence. He was an advocate of playing to communicate with the audience, which was his musical approach as well. One of his idiosyncratic rituals was to recite lyrics from each ballad before playing it.

A photograph by Herman Leonard of Gordon taking a smoke break at the Royal Roost in 1948 is one of the iconic images in jazz photography. Cigarettes were a recurring theme on covers of Gordon&#x27;s albums.

Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in the Bertrand Tavernier film &quot;Round Midnight&quot; (Warner Bros, 1986), and he won a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist, for the soundtrack album &quot;The Other Side of Round Midnight&quot; (Blue Note Records, 1986). He also had a cameo role in the 1990 film &quot;Awakenings&quot;. In 2018, Gordon&#x27;s album &quot;Go&quot; (Blue Note, 1962) was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Dexter Keith Gordon was born on February 27, 1923, in Los Angeles, California. His father, Frank Gordon, one of the first African-American medical doctors in Los Angeles, arrived in 1918 after graduating from Howard University Medical School in Washington, D.C. Among his patients were Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton. Dexter&#x27;s mother, Gwendolyn Baker, was the daughter of Captain Edward Lee Baker, Jr. one of the five African-American Medal of Honor recipients in the Spanish–American War.

Gordon began his study of music with the clarinet at the age of 13, then switched to the alto saxophone at 15, and finally to the tenor saxophone at 17. He studied with multi-instrumentalist Lloyd Reese while attending Thomas Jefferson High School, and studied with the school’s band director, Sam Browne. While still at school, he played in bands with such contemporaries as Chico Hamilton and Buddy Collette.

Between December 1940 and 1943, Gordon was a member of Lionel Hampton&#x27;s band, playing in a saxophone section alongside Illinois Jacquet and Marshal Royal. During 1944, Gordon was featured in the Fletcher Henderson band, followed by the Louis Armstrong band, before joining Billy Eckstine. The 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike curtailed the recording of the Hampton, Henderson, and Armstrong bands; however, they were recorded on V-Discs produced by the Army for broadcast and distribution among overseas troops. In 1943, he was featured, alongside Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, in recordings under Nat Cole for a small label not affected by the strike.

===Bebop era recordings===
By late 1944, Gordon was resident in New York, a regular at bebop jam sessions, and a featured soloist in the Billy Eckstine big band (&quot;If That&#x27;s The Way You Feel&quot;, &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot;, &quot;Blowin&#x27; the Blues Away&quot;, &quot;Opus X&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait and Pray&quot;, &quot;The Real Thing Happened To Me&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Lover Blues&quot;, &quot;I Love the Rhythm in a Riff&quot;). During early 1945, he was featured on recordings by Dizzy Gillespie (&quot;Blue &#x27;n&#x27; Boogie&quot;, &quot;Groovin&#x27; High&quot;) and Charles Thompson (&quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot;, &quot;If I Had You&quot;, &quot;20th Century Blues&quot;, &quot;The Street Beat&quot;). In late 1945, Gordon was recording under his own name for the Savoy label. His Savoy recordings during 1945–46 included &quot;Blow Mr. Dexter&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Deck&quot;, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Minor Mad&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Dexter&quot;, &quot;Dexter Rides Again&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Escape From You,&quot;and &quot;Dexter Digs In&quot;.

He returned to Los Angeles in late 1946 and in 1947 was leading sessions for Ross Russell&#x27;s Dial label (&quot;Mischievous Lady, Lullaby in Rhythm, The Chase, Iridescence, It&#x27;s the Talk of the Town, Bikini, A Ghost of a Chance, Sweet and Lovely&quot;). After his return to Los Angeles, he became known for his saxophone duels with fellow tenorman Wardell Gray, which were a popular concert attraction documented in recordings made between 1947 and 1952 (&quot;The Hunt, Move, The Chase, The Steeplechase&quot;). &quot;The Hunt&quot; gained literary fame from its mention in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On The Road&quot;, which also contains descriptions of wild tenormen jamming in Los Angeles. &quot;Cherokee, Byas a Drink, &quot;and&quot; Disorder at the Border&quot; are other live recordings of the Gray/Gordon duo from the same concert (all issued on the album &quot;The Hunt&quot; in 1977). In December 1947, Gordon recorded again with the Savoy label (&quot;Settin&#x27; the Pace, So Easy, Dexter&#x27;s Riff, Dextrose, Dexter&#x27;s Mood, Index, Dextivity, Wee Dot, Lion Roars&quot;). Through the mid-to-late 1940s, he continued to work as a sideman on sessions led by Russell Jacquet, Benny Carter, Ben Webster, Ralph Burns, Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Gerry Mulligan, Wynonie Harris, Leo Parker, and Tadd Dameron.

===The 1950s===
During the 1950s, Gordon&#x27;s recorded output and live appearances declined as heroin addiction and legal troubles took their toll. Gordon made a concert appearance with Wardell Gray in February 1952 (&quot;The Chase, The Steeplechase, Take the A Train, Robbins Nest, Stardust&quot;) and appeared as a sideman in a session led by Gray in June 1952 (&quot;The Rubiyat, Jungle Jungle Jump, Citizen&#x27;s Bop, My Kinda Love&quot;). After an incarceration at Chino Prison from 1953 to 1955, he recorded the albums &quot;Daddy Plays the Horn&quot; and &quot;Dexter Blows Hot and Cool&quot; in 1955 and played as a sideman on the Stan Levey album, &quot;This Time the Drum&#x27;s on Me&quot;. The latter part of the decade saw him in and out of prison until his final release from Folsom Prison in 1959. He was one of the initial sax players for the Onzy Matthews big band in 1959, along with Curtis Amy. Gordon continued to champion Matthews&#x27; band after he left Los Angeles for New York, but left for Europe before getting a chance to record with that band. He recorded &quot;The Resurgence of Dexter Gordon&quot; in 1960. His recordings from the mid-1950s onward document a meander into a smooth West Coast style that lacked the impact of his bebop era recordings or his subsequent Blue Note recordings.

The decade saw Gordon&#x27;s first entry into the world of drama. He appeared as a member (uncredited) of Art Hazzard&#x27;s band in the film &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950). He appeared in an uncredited and overdubbed role as a member of a prison band in the movie &quot;Unchained&quot;, filmed inside Chino. Gordon was a saxophonist performing Freddie Redd&#x27;s music for the Los Angeles production of Jack Gelber&#x27;s play &quot;The Connection&quot; in 1960, replacing Jackie McLean. He contributed two compositions, &quot;Ernie&#x27;s Tune&quot; and &quot;I Want More&quot; to the score and later recorded them for his album &quot;Dexter Calling...&quot;.

===New York renaissance===
Gordon signed to Blue Note in 1961. He initially commuted from Los Angeles to New York to record, but took up residence when he regained the cabaret card that allowed him to perform where alcohol was served. The Jazz Gallery hosted his first New York performance in twelve years. The Blue Note association was to produce a steady flow of albums for several years, some of which gained iconic status. His New York renaissance was marked by &quot;Doin&#x27; Allright&quot;, &quot;Dexter Calling...&quot;, &quot;Go!&quot;, and &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Affair&quot;. The first two were recorded over three days in May 1961 with Freddie Hubbard, Horace Parlan, Kenny Drew, Paul Chambers, George Tucker, Al Harewood, and Philly Joe Jones. The last two were recorded in August 1962, with a rhythm section that featured Blue Note regulars Sonny Clark, Butch Warren and Billy Higgins. Of the two &quot;Go!&quot; was an expressed favorite. The albums showed his assimilation of the hard bop and modal styles that had developed during his years on the west coast, and the influence of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, whom he had influenced before. The stay in New York turned out to be shortlived, as Gordon got offers for engagements in England, then Europe, that resulted in a fourteen-year stay. Soon after recording &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Affair&quot;, he left the United States.

===Years in Europe===
Over the next 14 years in Europe, living mainly in Paris and Copenhagen, Gordon played regularly with fellow expatriates or visiting players, such as Bud Powell, Ben Webster, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Kenny Drew, Horace Parlan and Billy Higgins. Blue Note&#x27;s Francis Wolff supervised Gordon&#x27;s later sessions for the label on his visits to Europe. The pairing of Gordon with Drew turned out to be one of the classic matchups between a horn player and a pianist, much like Miles Davis with Red Garland or John Coltrane with McCoy Tyner.

From this period came &quot;Our Man in Paris&quot;, &quot;One Flight Up&quot;, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Around&quot;, and &quot;Clubhouse&quot;. &quot;Our Man in Paris&quot; was a Blue Note session recorded in Paris in 1963 with backup consisting of pianist Powell, drummer Kenny Clarke, and French bassist Pierre Michelot. &quot;One Flight Up&quot;, recorded in Paris in 1964 with trumpeter Donald Byrd, pianist Kenny Drew, drummer Art Taylor, and Danish bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, features an extended solo by Gordon on the track &quot;Tanya&quot;.

Gordon also visited the US occasionally for further recording dates. &quot;Gettin&#x27; Around&quot; was recorded for Blue Note during a visit in May 1965, as was the album &quot;Clubhouse&quot; which remained unreleased until 1979.

Gordon found Europe in the 1960s a much easier place to live, saying that he experienced less racism and greater respect for jazz musicians. He also stated that on his visits to the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he found the political and social strife disturbing. While in Copenhagen, Gordon and Drew&#x27;s trio appeared onscreen in Ole Ege&#x27;s theatrically released hardcore pornographic film &quot;Pornografi – en musical&quot; (1971), for which they composed and performed the score.

He switched from Blue Note to Prestige Records (1965–73). For the label, he recorded bop albums like &quot;The Tower of Power!&quot; and &quot;More Power!&quot; (1969) with James Moody, Barry Harris, Buster Williams, and Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath; &quot;The Panther!&quot; (1970) with Tommy Flanagan, Larry Ridley, and Alan Dawson; &quot;The Jumpin&#x27; Blues&quot; (1970) with Wynton Kelly, Sam Jones, and Roy Brooks; &quot;The Chase!&quot; (1970) with Gene Ammons, Jodie Christian, John Young, Cleveland Eaton, Rufus Reid, Wilbur Campbell, Steve McCall, and Vi Redd; and &quot;Tangerine&quot; (1972) with Thad Jones, Freddie Hubbard, and Hank Jones. Some of the Prestige albums were recorded during visits back to North America while he was still living in Europe; others were made in Europe, including live sets from the Montreux Jazz Festival.

In addition to the recordings Gordon did under his American label contracts, live recordings by European labels and live video from his European period have been released. In 1975, Dexter Gordon signed an exclusive recording contract with Danish label SteepleChase, for which he recorded some of his most inspired sessions including &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1974), &quot;More Than You Know&quot; (1975), &quot;Stable Mable&quot;, &quot;Swiss Nights Vol. 1, 2 and 3&quot;, &quot;Something Different&quot;, &quot;Lullaby for a Monster&quot;, and not least &quot;Biting the Apple&quot; (1976), recorded during his homecoming trip to New York, featuring Barry Harris, Sam Jones and Al Foster. The album received the Grand Prix De Jazz in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977. SteepleChase released live dates from his mid-1960s tenure at the Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen. The video was released in the &quot;Jazz Icons&quot; series.

===Homecoming===

Gordon returned to the United States for good in 1976. He recorded &quot;Biting The Apple&quot; for SteepleChase during his homecoming, an album featuring pianist Barry Harris, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Al Foster. In 1977 the album received the Grand Prix de Disques at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. He appeared with Woody Shaw, Ronnie Mathews, Stafford James, and Louis Hayes, for a gig at the Village Vanguard in New York that was dubbed his &quot;homecoming.&quot; It was recorded and released by Columbia Records under that title. He observed: &quot;There was &quot;so&quot; much love and elation; sometimes it was a little &quot;eerie&quot; at the Vanguard. After the last set they&#x27;d turn on the lights and &quot;nobody&quot; would move.&quot; In addition to the &quot;Homecoming&quot; album, a series of live albums was released by Blue Note from his stands at Keystone Korner in San Francisco during 1978 and 1979. They featured Gordon, George Cables, Rufus Reid, and Eddie Gladden. He recorded the studio albums &quot;Sophisticated Giant&quot; with an eleven piece big band in 1977 and &quot;Manhattan Symphonie&quot; with the &quot;Live at Keystone Corner&quot; crew in 1978. The sensation of Gordon&#x27;s return, and the continued efforts of Art Blakey through 1970s and early 1980s, have been credited with reviving interest in swinging, melodic, acoustically-based classic jazz sounds after the Fusion jazz era that saw an emphasis on electronic sounds and contemporary pop influences.

===Musician Emeritus===

In 1978 and 1980, Gordon was the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Musician of the Year, and in 1980 he was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame. The US Government honored him with a Congressional Commendation, a Dexter Gordon Day in Washington DC, and in 1986 the National Endowment for the Arts named him a NEA Jazz Master in recognition of hia Lifetime Achievement. In 1986, he was named a member and officer of the French Order of Arts and Letters (Officier des Arts et Lettres) by the Ministry of Culture in France.

During the 1980s, Gordon, a life-long smoker, was weakened by emphysema. He remained a popular attraction at concerts and festivals, although his live appearances and recording dates would soon become infrequent.

Gordon starred in the 1986 movie &quot;Round Midnight&quot; as &quot;Dale Turner&quot;, an expatriate jazz musician in Paris during the late 1950s based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell. That portrayal earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In addition, he had a non-speaking role as a piano-playing hospital inmate in the 1990 film &quot;Awakenings&quot;, which was posthumously released. Before that last film was released, he made a guest appearance on the Michael Mann series &quot;Crime Story&quot;.

Soundtrack performances from &quot;Round Midnight&quot; were released as the albums &quot;Round Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of Round Midnight&quot;, featuring original music by Herbie Hancock as well as playing by Gordon. The latter was the last recording released under Gordon&#x27;s name. He was a sideman on Tony Bennett&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;Berlin&quot;.

Gordon died of kidney failure and smoking-related cancer of the larynx in Philadelphia, on April 25, 1990, at the age of 67.

==Family==
Gordon&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Captain Edward L. Baker, who received the Medal of Honor during the Spanish–American War, while serving with the 10th Cavalry Regiment (also known as the Buffalo Soldiers).

Gordon&#x27;s father, Dr. Frank Gordon, M.D., was one of the first prominent African-American physicians and a graduate of Howard University.

Gordon&#x27;s uncle, Clifford Myota Gordon, was a charter member of the Alpha Delta chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, seated at the University of Southern California. 

When he lived in Denmark, Gordon became friends with the family of the future Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, and subsequently became Lars&#x27;s godfather.

Gordon was married three times and had six children: Robin, James, Deirdre, Mikael, Morten and Benjamin. .

==Instruments and mouthpieces==
The earliest photographs of Gordon as a player show him with a Conn 30M &quot;Connqueror&quot; and an Otto Link mouthpiece. Later he adopted the standard Conn tenor, the 10M. In a 1962 interview with the British journalist Les Tomkins, he did not refer to the specific model of mouthpiece but stated that it was made for him personally. He stated that it was stolen around 1952. In the Tomkins interview he referred to his mouthpiece as a small-chambered piece with a 5* (.085&quot; under the Otto Link system) tip opening. He bought a Selmer Mark VI from Ben Webster after he lost his 10M during the trip to Paris. In a &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine interview from 1977, he referred to his current mouthpiece as an Otto Link model with a #8 (.110&quot; under the Otto Link system) tip opening.

<doc id="168568" wikidata="Q24613" url="?curid=168568" title="Film speed">
<text>Film speed is the measure of a photographic film&#x27;s sensitivity to light, determined by sensitometry and measured on various numerical scales, the most recent being the ISO system introduced in 1974. A closely related system, also known as ISO, is used to describe the relationship between exposure and output image lightness in digital cameras. Prior to ISO, the most common systems were ASA in the United States and DIN in Europe.

The term &quot;speed&quot; comes from the early days of photography. Photographic emulsions that were more sensitive to light needed less time to generate an acceptable image and thus a complete exposure could be finished faster, with the subjects having to hold still for a shorter length of time. Emulsions that were less sensitive were deemed &quot;slower&quot; as the time to complete an exposure was much longer and often usable only for still life photography. Exposure times for photographic emulsions shortened from hours to fractions of a second by the late 19th century.

In both film and digital photography, choice of speed will almost always affect image quality. Higher sensitivities, which require shorter exposures, typically result in reduced image quality due to coarser film grain or increased digital image noise. Lower sensitivities, which require longer exposures, will retain more viable image data due to finer grain or less noise, and therefore more detail. Ultimately, sensitivity is limited by the quantum efficiency of the film or sensor.

To determine the exposure time needed for a given film, a light meter is typically used.

==Film speed measurement systems==

===Emulsion speed rating criteria===
Five criteria for the rating of emulsion speed have been used since the late 19th century, listed here by name and date, these criteria are: threshold (1880), inertia (1890), fixed density (1934), minimum useful gradient (1939) and fractional gradient (1939). 
====Threshold====

The threshold criterion is the point on the characteristic curve corresponding to just perceptible density above fog.

====Inertia====

The inertia speed point of an emulsion is determined on the Hurter and Driffield characteristic curve by the intercept between the gradient of the straight line part of the curve and the line representing the base + fog (B+F) on the density axis. 

====Fixed density====

The fixed density speed point is determined by defining a fixed minimum density as the basis the emulsion speed (e.g. 0.1 above B+F). 

====Minimum useful gradient====

The minimum useful gradient criterion places the speed point where the gradient first reaches an agreed value (e.g. tan 𝜃 = 0.2).

====Fractional gradient====
The fractional gradient is defined as the speed point at which the slope of the characteristic curve first reaches a fixed fraction (e.g. 0.3) of the average gradient over a range (e.g. 1.5) of the characteristic curve.

===Historical systems===

====Warnerke====

The first known practical sensitometer, which allowed measurements of the speed of photographic materials, was invented by the Polish engineer Leon Warnerke – pseudonym of (1837–1900) – in 1880, among the achievements for which he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Photographic Society of Great Britain in 1882. It was commercialized since 1881.

The Warnerke Standard Sensitometer consisted of a frame holding an opaque screen with an array of typically 25 numbered, gradually pigmented squares brought into contact with the photographic plate during a timed test exposure under a phosphorescent tablet excited before by the light of a burning magnesium ribbon. The speed of the emulsion was then expressed in &#x27;degrees&#x27; Warnerke (sometimes seen as Warn. or °W.) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation. Each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed, typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° Warnerke at the time.

His system saw some success but proved to be unreliable due to its spectral sensitivity to light, the fading intensity of the light emitted by the phosphorescent tablet after its excitation as well as high built-tolerances. The concept, however, was later built upon in 1900 by Henry Chapman Jones (1855–1932) in the development of his plate tester and modified speed system.

====Hurter &amp; Driffield====

Another early practical system for measuring the sensitivity of an emulsion was that of Hurter and Driffield (H&amp;D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born Ferdinand Hurter (1844–1898) and British Vero Charles Driffield (1848–1915). In their system, speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required. For example, an emulsion rated at 250 H&amp;D would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 H&amp;D.

The methods to determine the sensitivity were later modified in 1925 (in regard to the light source used) and in 1928 (regarding light source, developer and proportional factor)—this later variant was sometimes called &quot;H&amp;D 10&quot;. The H&amp;D system was officially accepted as a standard in the former Soviet Union from 1928 until September 1951, when it was superseded by GOST 2817–50.

====Scheiner====

The &quot;Scheinergrade&quot; (Sch.) system was devised by the German astronomer Julius Scheiner (1858–1913) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography. Scheiner&#x27;s system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development. Speed was expressed in degrees Scheiner, originally ranging from 1° to 20° Sch., with each increment of a degree corresponding to a &quot;multiplicative&quot; factor of increased light sensitivity. This multiplicative factor was determined by the constraint that an increment of 19° Sch. (from 1° to 20° Sch.) corresponded to a hundredfold increase in sensitivity. Thus emulsions that differed by 1° Sch. on the Scheiner scale were formula_1-fold more (or, less) sensitive to each other. An increment of 3° Sch. came close to a doubling of sensitivity formula_2.

The system was later extended to cover larger ranges and some of its practical shortcomings were addressed by the Austrian scientist Josef Maria Eder (1855–1944) and Flemish-born botanist (1896–1960), (who, in 1919/1920, jointly developed their &quot;Eder–Hecht neutral wedge sensitometer&quot; measuring emulsion speeds in &quot;Eder–Hecht&quot; grades). It remained difficult for manufacturers to reliably determine film speeds, often only by comparing with competing products, so that an increasing number of modified semi-Scheiner-based systems started to spread, which no longer followed Scheiner&#x27;s original procedures and thereby defeated the idea of comparability.

Scheiner&#x27;s system was eventually abandoned in Germany, when the standardized DIN system was introduced in 1934. In various forms, it continued to be in widespread use in other countries for some time.

====DIN====

The DIN system, officially DIN standard 4512 by the &#x27; (then known as the &#x27; (DNA)), was published in January 1934. It grew out of drafts for a standardized method of sensitometry put forward by the &#x27; as proposed by the committee for sensitometry of the &#x27; since 1930 and presented by (1868–1945) and Emanuel Goldberg (1881–1970) at the influential VIII. International Congress of Photography (German: &quot;&quot;) held in Dresden from 3 to 8 August 1931.

The DIN system was inspired by Scheiner&#x27;s system, but the sensitivities were represented as the base 10 logarithm of the sensitivity multiplied by 10, similar to decibels. Thus an increase of 20° (and not 19° as in Scheiner&#x27;s system) represented a hundredfold increase in sensitivity, and a difference of 3° was much closer to the base 10 logarithm of 2 (0.30103...):

:formula_3.

As in the Scheiner system, speeds were expressed in &#x27;degrees&#x27;. Originally the sensitivity was written as a fraction with &#x27;tenths&#x27; (for example &quot;18/10° DIN&quot;), where the resultant value 1.8 represented the relative base 10 logarithm of the speed. &#x27;Tenths&#x27; were later abandoned with DIN 4512:1957-11, and the example above would be written as &quot;18° DIN&quot;. The degree symbol was finally dropped with DIN 4512:1961-10. This revision also saw significant changes in the definition of film speeds in order to accommodate then-recent changes in the American ASA PH2.5-1960 standard, so that film speeds of black-and-white negative film effectively would become doubled, that is, a film previously marked as &quot;18° DIN&quot; would now be labeled as &quot;21 DIN&quot; without emulsion changes.

Originally only meant for black-and-white negative film, the system was later extended and regrouped into nine parts, including DIN 4512-1:1971-04 for black-and-white negative film, DIN 4512-4:1977-06 for color reversal film and DIN 4512-5:1977-10 for color negative film.

On an international level the German DIN 4512 system has been effectively superseded in the 1980s by ISO 6:1974, ISO 2240:1982, and ISO 5800:1979 where the same sensitivity is written in linear and logarithmic form as &quot;ISO 100/21°&quot; (now again with degree symbol). These ISO standards were subsequently adopted by DIN as well. Finally, the latest DIN 4512 revisions were replaced by corresponding ISO standards, DIN 4512-1:1993-05 by DIN ISO 6:1996-02 in September 2000, DIN 4512-4:1985-08 by DIN ISO 2240:1998-06 and DIN 4512-5:1990-11 by DIN ISO 5800:1998-06 both in July 2002.

====BSI====
When BS 935:1941 was published during World War II, specifying exposure tables for negative materials, it employed the same fixed-density speed criterion used in the German DIN 4512:1934 system. The British Standard also used &quot;logarithmic&quot; speed numbers, following the example of Scheiner and DIN. When the American ASA Z38.2.1:1943 standard was published, it used a fractional gradient speed criterion and &quot;arithmetic&quot; speed numbers, for compatibility with Weston and GE.

British standard BS 1380:1947 adopted the &quot;fractional gradient&quot; criterion of the American 1943 standard, and also included &quot;arithmetic&quot; speed numbers in addition to &quot;logarithmic&quot; numbers. The &quot;logarithmic&quot; speed number proposed in the later BS 1380:1957 standard was almost identical to the DIN 4512:1957 standard, except that the BS number was +9 degrees greater than the corresponding DIN number; in 1971, the BS and DIN standards changed this to +10 degrees.

Following an increasing effort to produce international standards, the British, American, and German standards became identical in ISO 6:1974, which corresponded to BS 1380:Part1:1973.

====Weston====

Before the advent of the ASA system, the system of &quot;Weston film speed ratings&quot; was introduced by Edward Faraday Weston (1878–1971) and his father Dr. Edward Weston (1850–1936), a British-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the US-based Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation, with the Weston model 617, one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters, in August 1932. The meter and film rating system were invented by William Nelson Goodwin, Jr., who worked for them and later received a Howard N. Potts Medal for his contributions to engineering.

The company tested and frequently published speed ratings for most films of the time. Weston film speed ratings could since be found on most Weston exposure meters and were sometimes referred to by film manufacturers and third parties in their exposure guidelines. Since manufacturers were sometimes creative about film speeds, the company went as far as to warn users about unauthorized uses of their film ratings in their &quot;Weston film ratings&quot; booklets.

The Weston Cadet (model 852 introduced in 1949), Direct Reading (model 853 introduced 1954) and Master III (models 737 and S141.3 introduced in 1956) were the first in their line of exposure meters to switch and utilize the meanwhile established ASA scale instead. Other models used the original Weston scale up until ca. 1955. The company continued to publish Weston film ratings after 1955, but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the ASA film speeds found on film boxes, these newer Weston values were based on the ASA system and had to be converted for use with older Weston meters by subtracting 1/3 exposure stop as per Weston&#x27;s recommendation. Vice versa, &quot;old&quot; Weston film speed ratings could be converted into &quot;new&quot; Westons and the ASA scale by adding the same amount, that is, a film rating of 100 Weston (up to 1955) corresponded with 125 ASA (as per ASA PH2.5-1954 and before). This conversion was not necessary on Weston meters manufactured and Weston film ratings published since 1956 due to their inherent use of the ASA system; however the changes of the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer ASA or ISO values.

====General Electric====

Prior to the establishment of the ASA scale and similar to Weston film speed ratings another manufacturer of photo-electric exposure meters, General Electric, developed its own rating system of so-called &quot;General Electric film values&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;G-E&quot; or &quot;GE&quot;) around 1937.

Film speed values for use with their meters were published in regularly updated &quot;General Electric Film Values&quot; leaflets and in the &quot;General Electric Photo Data Book&quot;.

General Electric switched to use the ASA scale in 1946. Meters manufactured since February 1946 are equipped with the ASA scale (labeled &quot;Exposure Index&quot;) already. For some of the older meters with scales in &quot;Film Speed&quot; or &quot;Film Value&quot; (e.g. models DW-48, DW-49 as well as early DW-58 and GW-68 variants), replaceable hoods with ASA scales were available from the manufacturer. The company continued to publish recommended film values after that date, however, they were then aligned to the ASA scale.

====ASA====

Based on earlier research work by Loyd Ancile Jones (1884–1954) of Kodak and inspired by the systems of Weston film speed ratings and General Electric film values, the American Standards Association (now named ANSI) defined a new method to determine and specify film speeds of black-and-white negative films in 1943. ASA Z38.2.1–1943 was revised in 1946 and 1947 before the standard grew into ASA PH2.5-1954. Originally, ASA values were frequently referred to as &quot;American standard speed numbers&quot; or &quot;ASA exposure-index numbers&quot;. (See also: Exposure Index (EI).)

The ASA scale is a linear scale, that is, a film denoted as having a film speed of 200 ASA is twice as fast as a film with 100 ASA.

The ASA standard underwent a major revision in 1960 with ASA PH2.5-1960, when the method to determine film speed was refined and previously applied safety factors against under-exposure were abandoned, effectively doubling the nominal speed of many black-and-white negative films. For example, an Ilford HP3 that had been rated at 200 ASA before 1960 was labeled 400 ASA afterwards without any change to the emulsion. Similar changes were applied to the DIN system with DIN 4512:1961-10 and the BS system with BS 1380:1963 in the following years.

In addition to the established arithmetic speed scale, ASA PH2.5-1960 also introduced logarithmic ASA grades (100 ASA = 5° ASA), where a difference of 1° ASA represented a full exposure stop and therefore the doubling of a film speed. For some while, ASA grades were also printed on film boxes, and they saw life in the form of the APEX speed value &quot;Sv&quot; (without degree symbol) as well.

ASA PH2.5-1960 was revised as ANSI PH2.5-1979, without the logarithmic speeds, and later replaced by NAPM IT2.5–1986 of the National Association of Photographic Manufacturers, which represented the US adoption of the international standard ISO 6. The latest issue of ANSI/NAPM IT2.5 was published in 1993.

The standard for color negative film was introduced as ASA PH2.27-1965 and saw a string of revisions in 1971, 1976, 1979, and 1981, before it finally became ANSI IT2.27–1988 prior to its withdrawal.

Color reversal film speeds were defined in ANSI PH2.21-1983, which was revised in 1989 before it became ANSI/NAPM IT2.21 in 1994, the US adoption of the ISO 2240 standard.

On an international level, the ASA system was superseded by the ISO film speed system between 1982 and 1987, however, the arithmetic ASA speed scale continued to live on as the linear speed value of the ISO system.

====GOST====
 (Cyrillic: ) was an arithmetic film speed scale defined in GOST 2817-45 and GOST 2817–50. It was used in the former Soviet Union since October 1951, replacing Hurter &amp; Driffield (H&amp;D, Cyrillic: ХиД) numbers, which had been used since 1928.

GOST 2817-50 was similar to the ASA standard, having been based on a speed point at a density 0.2 above base plus fog, as opposed to the ASA&#x27;s 0.1. GOST markings are only found on pre-1987 photographic equipment (film, cameras, lightmeters, etc.) of Soviet Union manufacture.

On 1 January 1987, the GOST scale was realigned to the ISO scale with GOST 10691–84,

This evolved into multiple parts including GOST 10691.6–88 and GOST 10691.5–88, which both became functional on 1 January 1991.

===Current system: ISO===

The ASA and DIN film speed standards have been combined into the ISO standards since 1974.

The current International Standard for measuring the speed of color negative film is ISO 5800:2001 (first published in 1979, revised in November 1987) from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Related standards ISO 6:1993 (first published in 1974) and ISO 2240:2003 (first published in July 1982, revised in September 1994 and corrected in October 2003) define scales for speeds of black-and-white negative film and color reversal film, respectively.

The determination of ISO speeds with digital still-cameras is described in ISO 12232:2019 (first published in August 1998, revised in April 2006, corrected in October 2006 and again revised in February 2019).

The ISO system defines both an arithmetic and a logarithmic scale. The arithmetic ISO scale corresponds to the arithmetic ASA system, where a doubling of film sensitivity is represented by a doubling of the numerical film speed value. In the logarithmic ISO scale, which corresponds to the DIN scale, adding 3° to the numerical value constitutes a doubling of sensitivity. For example, a film rated ISO 200/24° is twice as sensitive as one rated ISO 100/21°.

Commonly, the logarithmic speed is omitted; for example, &quot;ISO 100&quot; denotes &quot;ISO 100/21°&quot;, while logarithmic ISO speeds are written as &quot;ISO 21°&quot; as per the standard.

===Conversion between current scales===
Conversion from arithmetic speed &quot;S&quot; to logarithmic speed &quot;S&quot;° is given by

:formula_4

and rounding to the nearest integer; the log is base 10. Conversion from logarithmic speed to arithmetic speed is given by

:formula_5

and rounding to the nearest standard arithmetic speed in Table 1 below.

Table notes:
# Speeds shown in bold under APEX, ISO, and ASA are values actually assigned in speed standards from the respective agencies; other values are calculated extensions to assigned speeds using the same progressions as for the assigned speeds.
# APEX &quot;Sv&quot; values 1 to 10 correspond with logarithmic ASA grades 1° to 10° found in ASA PH2.5-1960.
# ASA arithmetic speeds from 4 to 5 are taken from ANSI PH2.21-1979 (Table 1, p. 8).
# ASA arithmetic speeds from 6 to 3200 are taken from ANSI PH2.5-1979 (Table 1, p. 5) and ANSI PH2.27-1979.
# ISO arithmetic speeds from 4 to 3200 are taken from ISO 5800:1987 (Table &quot;ISO speed scales&quot;, p. 4).
# ISO arithmetic speeds from 6 to 10000 are taken from ISO 12232:1998 (Table 1, p. 9).
# ISO 12232:1998 does not specify speeds greater than 10000. However, the upper limit for &quot;S&quot;noise 10000 was given as 12500, suggesting that ISO may have envisioned a progression of 12500, 25000, 50000, and 100000, similar to that from 1250 to 10000. This was consistent with ASA PH2.12-1961. For digital cameras, Nikon, Canon, Sony, Pentax, and Fujifilm chose to express the greater speeds in an exact power-of-2 progression from the highest previously realized speed (6400) rather than rounding to an extension of the existing progression. Speed ratings greater than 10000 have finally been defined in ISO 12232:2019.
# Most of the modern 35 mm film SLRs support an automatic film speed range from ISO 25/15° to 5000/38° with DX-coded films, or ISO 6/9° to 6400/39° manually (without utilizing exposure compensation). The film speed range with support for TTL flash is smaller, typically ISO 12/12° to 3200/36° or less.
# The Booster accessory for the Canon Pellix QL (1965) and Canon FT QL (1966) supported film speeds from 25 to 12800 ASA.
# The film speed dial of the Canon A-1 (1978) supported a speed range from 6 to 12800 ASA (but already called ISO film speeds in the manual). On this camera exposure compensation and extreme film speeds were mutually exclusive.
# The Leica R8 (1996) and R9 (2002) officially supported film speeds of 8000/40°, 10000/41° and 12800/42° (in the case of the R8) or 12500/42° (in the case of the R9), and utilizing its ±3 EV exposure compensation the range could be extended from ISO 0.8/0° to ISO 100000/51° in half exposure steps.
# Digital camera manufacturers&#x27; arithmetic speeds from 12800 to 409600 are from specifications by Nikon (12800, 25600, 51200, 102400 in 2009, 204800 in 2012, 409600 in 2014), Canon (12800, 25600, 51200, 102400 in 2009, 204800 in 2011, 4000000 in 2015), Sony (12800 in 2009, 25600 in 2010, 409600 in 2014), Pentax (12800, 25600, 51200 in 2010, 102400, 204800 in 2014), and Fujifilm (12800 in 2011).

===Historic ASA and DIN conversion ===

As discussed in the ASA and DIN sections, the definition of the ASA and DIN scales changed several times in the 1950s up into the early 1960s making it necessary to convert between the different scales. Since the ISO system combines the newer ASA and DIN definitions, this conversion is also necessary when comparing older ASA and DIN scales with the ISO scale.

The picture shows an ASA/DIN conversion in a 1952 photography book in which 21/10° DIN was converted to ASA 80 instead of ASA 100.

Some classic camera&#x27;s exposure guides show the old conversion as they were valid at the time of production, for example the exposure guide of the classic camera Tessina (since 1957), where 21/10° DIN is related to ASA 80, 18° DIN to ASA 40, etc. Users of classic cameras may become confused if they are not aware of the historic background of changing standards.

===Determining film speed===

Film speed is found from a plot of optical density vs. log of exposure for the film, known as the &quot;D&quot;–log &quot;H&quot; curve or Hurter–Driffield curve. There typically are five regions in the curve: the base + fog, the toe, the linear region, the shoulder, and the overexposed region. For black-and-white negative film, the &quot;speed point&quot; m is the point on the curve where density exceeds the base + fog density by 0.1 when the negative is developed so that a point n where the log of exposure is 1.3 units greater than the exposure at point m has a density 0.8 greater than the density at point m. The exposure &quot;H&quot;m, in lux-s, is that for point m when the specified contrast condition is satisfied. The ISO arithmetic speed is determined from:

:formula_6

This value is then rounded to the nearest standard speed in Table 1 of ISO 6:1993.

Determining speed for color negative film is similar in concept but more complex because it involves separate curves for blue, green, and red. The film is processed according to the film manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations rather than to a specified contrast. ISO speed for color reversal film is determined from the middle rather than the threshold of the curve; it again involves separate curves for blue, green, and red, and the film is processed according to the film manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations.

===Applying film speed===
Film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters. Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time). The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the APEX system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a &quot;stop&quot;. The effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to 2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc..

The ISO arithmetic speed has a useful property for photographers without the equipment for taking a metered light reading. Correct exposure will usually be achieved for a frontlighted scene in bright sun if the aperture of the lens is set to f/16 and the shutter speed is the reciprocal of the ISO film speed (e.g. 1/100 second for 100 ISO film). This known as the sunny 16 rule.

===Exposure index===

Exposure index, or EI, refers to speed rating assigned to a particular film and shooting situation in variance to the film&#x27;s actual speed. It is used to compensate for equipment calibration inaccuracies or process variables, or to achieve certain effects. The exposure index may simply be called the &quot;speed setting&quot;, as compared to the speed &quot;rating&quot;.

For example, a photographer may rate an ISO 400 film at EI 800 and then use push processing to obtain printable negatives in low-light conditions. The film has been exposed at EI 800.

Another example occurs where a camera&#x27;s shutter is miscalibrated and consistently overexposes or underexposes the film; similarly, a light meter may be inaccurate. One may adjust the EI setting accordingly in order to compensate for these defects and consistently produce correctly exposed negatives.

==Reciprocity==
Upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion. If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera&#x27;s shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds over a wide range of customary conditions. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000 second to 1/2 second. However, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure.

==Film sensitivity and grain==
The size of silver halide grains in the emulsion affects film sensitivity, which is related to granularity because larger grains give film greater sensitivity to light. Fine-grain film, such as film designed for portraiture or copying original camera negatives, is relatively insensitive, or &quot;slow&quot;, because it requires brighter light or a longer exposure than a &quot;fast&quot; film. Fast films, used for photographing in low light or capturing high-speed motion, produce comparatively grainy images.

Kodak has defined a &quot;Print Grain Index&quot; (PGI) to characterize film grain (color negative films only), based on perceptual just-noticeable difference of graininess in prints. They also define &quot;granularity&quot;, a measurement of grain using an RMS measurement of density fluctuations in uniformly exposed film, measured with a microdensitometer with 48 micrometre aperture. Granularity varies with exposure — underexposed film looks grainier than overexposed film.

===Marketing anomalies===

Some high-speed black-and-white films, such as Ilford Delta 3200, P3200 T-Max, and T-MAX P3200 are marketed with film speeds in excess of their true ISO speed as determined using the ISO testing method. According to the respective data sheets, the Ilford product is actually an ISO 1000 film, while the Kodak film&#x27;s speed is nominally 800 to 1000 ISO. The manufacturers do not indicate that the 3200 number is an ISO rating on their packaging. Kodak and Fuji also marketed E6 films designed for pushing (hence the &quot;P&quot; prefix), such as Ektachrome P800/1600 and Fujichrome P1600, both with a base speed of ISO 400. The DX codes on the film cartridges indicate the marketed film speed (i.e. 3200), not the ISO speed, in order to automate shooting and development.

==Digital camera ISO speed and exposure index==

In digital camera systems, an arbitrary relationship between exposure and sensor data values can be achieved by setting the signal gain of the sensor. The relationship between the sensor data values and the lightness of the finished image is also arbitrary, depending on the parameters chosen for the interpretation of the sensor data into an image color space such as sRGB.

For digital photo cameras (&quot;digital still cameras&quot;), an exposure index (EI) rating—commonly called &quot;ISO&quot; setting—is specified by the manufacturer such that the sRGB image files produced by the camera will have a lightness similar to what would be obtained with film of the same EI rating at the same exposure. The usual design is that the camera&#x27;s parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor&#x27;s signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor&#x27;s signal gain in the digital realm (&quot;expanded ISO&quot;). A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo.

Digital cameras have far surpassed film in terms of sensitivity to light, with ISO equivalent speeds of up to 4,560,000, a number that is unfathomable in the realm of conventional film photography. Faster microprocessors, as well as advances in software noise reduction techniques allow this type of processing to be executed the moment the photo is captured, allowing photographers to store images that have a higher level of refinement and would have been prohibitively time-consuming to process with earlier generations of digital camera hardware.

===The ISO (International Organization of Standards) 12232:2019 standard===
The ISO standard ISO 12232:2006 gave digital still camera manufacturers a choice of five different techniques for determining the exposure index rating at each sensitivity setting provided by a particular camera model. Three of the techniques in ISO 12232:2006 were carried over from the 1998 version of the standard, while two new techniques allowing for measurement of JPEG output files were introduced from CIPA DC-004. Depending on the technique selected, the exposure index rating could depend on the sensor sensitivity, the sensor noise, and the appearance of the resulting image. The standard specified the measurement of light sensitivity of the entire digital camera system and not of individual components such as digital sensors, although Kodak has reported using a variation to characterize the sensitivity of two of their sensors in 2001.

The &quot;Recommended Exposure Index&quot; (REI) technique, new in the 2006 version of the standard, allows the manufacturer to specify a camera model&#x27;s EI choices arbitrarily. The choices are based solely on the manufacturer&#x27;s opinion of what EI values produce well-exposed sRGB images at the various sensor sensitivity settings. This is the only technique available under the standard for output formats that are not in the sRGB color space. This is also the only technique available under the standard when multi-zone metering (also called &quot;pattern&quot; metering) is used.

The &quot;Standard Output Sensitivity&quot; (SOS) technique, also new in the 2006 version of the standard, effectively specifies that the average level in the sRGB image must be 18% gray plus or minus 1/3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an automatic exposure control system calibrated per ISO 2721 and set to the EI with no exposure compensation. Because the output level is measured in the sRGB output from the camera, it is only applicable to sRGB JPEG—and not to output files in raw image format. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.

The CIPA DC-004 standard requires that Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras use either the REI or SOS techniques, and DC-008 updates the Exif specification to differentiate between these values. Consequently, the three EI techniques carried over from ISO 12232:1998 are not widely used in recent camera models (approximately 2007 and later). As those earlier techniques did not allow for measurement from images produced with lossy compression, they cannot be used at all on cameras that produce images only in JPEG format.

The &quot;saturation-based&quot; (SAT or Ssat) technique is closely related to the SOS technique, with the sRGB output level being measured at 100% white rather than 18% gray. The SOS value is effectively 0.704 times the saturation-based value. Because the output level is measured in the sRGB output from the camera, it is only applicable to sRGB images—typically TIFF—and not to output files in raw image format. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.

The two &quot;noise-based&quot; techniques have rarely been used for consumer digital still cameras. These techniques specify the highest EI that can be used while still providing either an &quot;excellent&quot; picture or a &quot;usable&quot; picture depending on the technique chosen.

An update to this standard has been published as ISO 12232:2019, defining a wider range of ISO speeds.

===Measurements and calculations===
ISO speed ratings of a digital camera are based on the properties of the sensor and the image processing done in the camera, and are expressed in terms of the luminous exposure &quot;H&quot; (in lux seconds) arriving at the sensor. For a typical camera lens with an effective focal length &quot;f&quot; that is much smaller than the distance between the camera and the photographed scene, &quot;H&quot; is given by
:formula_7,
where &quot;L&quot; is the luminance of the scene (in candela per m²), &quot;t&quot; is the exposure time (in seconds), &quot;N&quot; is the aperture f-number, and
:formula_8
is a factor depending on the transmittance &quot;T&quot; of the lens, the vignetting factor &quot;v&quot;(&quot;θ&quot;), and the angle &quot;θ&quot; relative to the axis of the lens. A typical value is &quot;q&quot; = 0.65, based on &quot;θ&quot; = 10°, &quot;T&quot; = 0.9, and &quot;v&quot; = 0.98.

====Saturation-based speed====
The &quot;saturation-based speed&quot; is defined as
:formula_9,
where formula_10 is the maximum possible exposure that does not lead to a clipped or bloomed camera output. Typically, the lower limit of the saturation speed is determined by the sensor itself, but with the gain of the amplifier between the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter, the saturation speed can be increased. The factor 78 is chosen such that exposure settings based on a standard light meter and an 18-percent reflective surface will result in an image with a grey level of 18%/ = 12.7% of saturation. The factor indicates that there is half a stop of headroom to deal with specular reflections that would appear brighter than a 100% reflecting diffuse white surface.

====Noise-based speed====

The &quot;noise-based speed&quot; is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels. Two ratios are used, the 40:1 (&quot;excellent image quality&quot;) and the 10:1 (&quot;acceptable image quality&quot;) ratio. These ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm (178 DPI) when viewed at 25 cm (9.8 inch) distance. The noise is defined as the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels. The noise-based speed is mostly determined by the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and AD converter.

====Standard output sensitivity (SOS)====

In addition to the above speed ratings, the standard also defines the &quot;standard output sensitivity&quot; (SOS), how the exposure is related to the digital pixel values in the output image. It is defined as
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the exposure that will lead to values of 118 in 8-bit pixels, which is 18 percent of the saturation value in images encoded as sRGB or with gamma = 2.2.

====Discussion====
The standard specifies how speed ratings should be reported by the camera. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is &quot;higher&quot; than the saturation-based speed, the noise-based speed should be reported, rounded &quot;downwards&quot; to a standard value (e.g. 200, 250, 320, or 400). The rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better image. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is &quot;lower&quot; than the saturation-based speed, or undefined because of high noise, the saturation-based speed is specified, rounded upwards to a standard value, because using the noise-based speed would lead to overexposed images. The camera may also report the SOS-based speed (explicitly as being an SOS speed), rounded to the nearest standard speed rating.

For example, a camera sensor may have the following properties: formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15. According to the standard, the camera should report its sensitivity as
:&quot;ISO 100 (daylight)&quot;
:&quot;ISO speed latitude 50–1600&quot;
:&quot;ISO 100 (SOS, daylight)&quot;.
The SOS rating could be user controlled. For a different camera with a noisier sensor, the properties might be formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18. In this case, the camera should report
:&quot;ISO 200 (daylight)&quot;,
as well as a user-adjustable SOS value. In all cases, the camera should indicate for the white balance setting for which the speed rating applies, such as daylight or tungsten (incandescent light).

Despite these detailed standard definitions, cameras typically do not clearly indicate whether the user &quot;ISO&quot; setting refers to the noise-based speed, saturation-based speed, or the specified output sensitivity, or even some made-up number for marketing purposes. Because the 1998 version of ISO 12232 did not permit measurement of camera output that had lossy compression, it was not possible to correctly apply any of those measurements to cameras that did not produce sRGB files in an uncompressed format such as TIFF. Following the publication of CIPA DC-004 in 2006, Japanese manufacturers of digital still cameras are required to specify whether a sensitivity rating is REI or SOS.

A greater SOS setting for a given sensor comes with some loss of image quality, just like with analog film. However, this loss is visible as image noise rather than grain. APS- and 35 mm-sized digital image sensors, both CMOS and CCD based, do not produce significant noise until about &quot;ISO 1600&quot;.

<doc id="168570" wikidata="Q576371" url="?curid=168570" title="Round Midnight (film)">
<text>Round Midnight is a 1986 American musical drama film directed by Bertrand Tavernier and written by Tavernier and David Rayfiel. It stars Dexter Gordon, with a soundtrack by Herbie Hancock. The title comes from Thelonious Monk&#x27;s 1943 composition &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;, which is featured in this film in a Hancock arrangement.

The protagonist jazzman, Dale Turner, is based on a composite of real-life jazz legends Lester Young (tenor sax) and Bud Powell (piano). While the film is fictionalized, it is drawn directly from the memoir/biography &quot;Dance of the Infidels&quot; written by French author Francis Paudras, who had befriended Powell during his Paris expatriate days and on whom the character Francis was based.

Gordon was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a Grammy for the film&#x27;s soundtrack entitled &quot;The Other Side of Round Midnight&quot; in the category for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance, Soloist. Hancock won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The soundtrack was released in two parts: &quot;Round Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of Round Midnight&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1950s New York, Dale Turner is an accomplished saxophone player barely getting by playing at local jazz clubs and struggling with substance abuse, particularly of alcohol. After talking with a fellow musician who is currently disabled by illness, Dale decides to try to improve his life by traveling to Paris and making a living playing at jazz club until his luck gets better.

Turner arrives in Paris and is befriended by Francis, a struggling French graphic designer specializing in film posters and who lives with his daughter, his marriage having broken up. Francis idolizes the musician and tries desperately to help him escape alcohol abuse. With time, and after Francis allows Turner to move in with him and his daughter, Turner manages to put himself on his own feet again and starts to get by without a reliance on alcohol. He eventually decides it is time to go home to New York to see his old friends and to re-acquaint himself with his own daughter.

Francis accompanies Dale, and the music community in New York is ready to accept the musician back. He writes a song dedicated to his daughter in the hope of strengthening their relationship after much time apart. He invites her to the club to hear its debut, but manages to confuse her true age and tells the audience she has just turned 15; she is actually 14, and she makes note of this to Francis, who is seated next to her in the audience. Later in the week, when Dale tries to further his bond with her by sharing a meal at a local diner, an old drug dealer recognizes him there, re-introduces himself and implies his supplies are still available to Dale.

Francis tries to intervene a few times to keep Dale protected from his old suppliers, and attempts to keep up with all of them. After Francis eventually leaves and returns to Paris and his daughter, he receives a telegram from Dale&#x27;s music manager saying that the musician has died in a local hospital.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Round Midnight&quot; was filmed in Paris and New York City. It was produced by Irwin Winkler.

Tavernier defied the film studio by insisting that real-life jazz tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon play the role of Turner. Gordon, who himself played with Bud Powell in Paris in the early 1960s (and earlier in their careers), helped to revise and rewrite the script. The supporting cast is likewise composed of jazz musicians (mainly from the generation which followed Gordon and Powell) such as Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson, John McLaughlin, and Wayne Shorter, among others who perform the music throughout the film. The musicians are joined by actors François Cluzet, Gabrielle Haker, Sandra Reaves-Phillips, Lonette McKee, and Christine Pascal. Martin Scorsese and Philippe Noiret appear in cameos.

==Soundtrack==

The score for the film was by Herbie Hancock, featuring mostly existing Jazz standards owned by Warner Bros along with a handful of original pieces written by Hancock. The soundtrack was in two parts – &quot;Round Midnight&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of Round Midnight&quot; – released under Dexter Gordon&#x27;s name and featuring his last recordings, although he does not appear on all tracks. Both albums were produced and arranged by Hancock.

==Reception==
 It was ranked No. 2 in Roger Ebert&#x27;s top films of 1986, and No. 9 in Gene Siskel&#x27;s. In his review of the film for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert noted the film&#x27;s use of live jazz performances by real musicians and praised Gordon&#x27;s acting performance, writing, &quot;Gordon plays the central role with an eerie magnetism. He is a musician, not an actor, and yet no actor could have given this performance, with its dignity, wisdom and pain.&quot;. Additionally, &quot;IndieWire&quot; cited Gordon&#x27;s acting performance as one of the best of the 80s.

<doc id="168571" wikidata="Q574057" url="?curid=168571" title="Mona Lisa (film)">
<text>Mona Lisa is a 1986 British neo-noir crime drama film about an ex-convict who becomes entangled in the dangerous life of a high-class call girl. The film was written by Neil Jordan and David Leland, and directed by Jordan. It was produced by HandMade Films and stars Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson, and Michael Caine.

The film was nominated for multiple awards, and Bob Hoskins was nominated for several awards for his performance (including the Academy Award for Best Actor), winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film seems to take its title from the song &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; heard throughout the film.

==Plot==
George, a low-level working-class gangster recently released after seven years in prison, is given a job in London by his former boss, Denny Mortwell, as the driver and bodyguard for a high-priced prostitute named Simone. Mortwell also wants George to gather information on one of Simone&#x27;s wealthy customers for blackmail purposes. Simone, who has worked hard to develop high-class manners and an elite clientele, initially dislikes the uncouth and outspoken George, and he regards her as putting on airs. But as George and Simone find out more about each other, they form a friendship, and George begins to fall in love with her. George agrees, at the risk of his own life, to help Simone find her teenage friend Cathy, who has disappeared, and who Simone fears is being abused by her violent former pimp, Anderson.

George increasingly finds himself torn between his feelings for Simone, his obligations to his boss Mortwell, and his relationship with his teenage daughter Jeannie, a sweet normal girl who has matured while he was in prison and wants to have her father in her life.

When Anderson stalks Simone to her flat and tries to slash her, George takes her to the secluded garage where he lives with his friend Thomas and then finds the drug-addled Cathy. He takes the two girls to a hotel in Brighton and gives Simone a gun for protection, but then discovers that the pair are lovers. When Mortwell and Anderson arrive to take back control of the girls, Simone shoots them both dead and turns her gun towards George. He punches her, takes the gun and leaves. Freed of his underworld obligations, he returns to a more normal life, working in Thomas&#x27;s garage and spending time with Jeannie.

==Cast==
==Reception==
The film received positive critical reception when released in 1986. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote of the two main characters: &quot;The relationship of their characters in the film is interesting, because both people, for personal reasons, have developed a style that doesn&#x27;t reveal very much.&quot; &quot;Leslie Halliwell&quot;, referring to Bob Hoskins, stated: &quot;Only this actor could make a hit of this unsavoury yarn, with its highlights of sex and violence. But he did.&quot; Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, dismissed the film as &quot;classy kitsch... as smooth and distinctive (and, ultimately, as insubstantial) as the old Nat (King) Cole recording of the song, which gives the film its title and a lot of its mood&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;A wonderful achievement, a dark film with a generous heart in the shape of an extraordinarily touching performance from Hoskins.&quot; &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; declared: &quot;Hoskins and newcomer Tyson are terrific; Caine is wonderfully slimy in support.&quot; Pauline Kael praised the film: &quot;...Jordan shows a gift for making the emotional atmosphere visual, and vice versa. And the way he uses baroque touches and the clichés of old thrillers, they become part of a fluid, enjoyable texture, a melodramatic impasto with an expressive power of its own--a romanticism that pulls you along.&quot;

On Metacritic &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; has a score of 85 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 98% rating based on 40 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus: &quot;Bob Hoskins is outstanding in &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, giving this stylish neo-noir a riveting centerpiece that sets it apart from similar stories.&quot;

==Accolades==
Bob Hoskins was praised for his performance and was awarded the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Prix d&#x27;interprétation masculine at the Cannes Film Festival, and other awards. Despite this heavy acclaim, he lost the Academy Award for Best Actor to Paul Newman in &quot;The Color of Money&quot;.

<text>Percy Robert Miller (born April 29, 1970), better known by his stage name Master P, is an American rapper, record producer, record executive, dancer, actor and entrepreneur. He founded the record label No Limit Records in 1991, which was relaunched into the spin-off labels New No Limit Records and No Limit Forever Records. Miller gained fame in the mid-1990s as a member of the label&#x27;s hip hop group TRU, as well as his fifth solo album, &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; (1996), and its namesake lead single. His 1997 single, &quot;Make &#x27;Em Say Uhh!&quot; received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In total, Miller has released 15 studio albums.

== Early life ==
Percy Robert Miller was born and raised in the Third Ward of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in the Calliope Projects. He is the second oldest of five children. He has one sister, Germaine, and three brothers: Kevin, and platinum-selling rap artists Corey &quot;C-Murder&quot; and Vyshonne &quot;Silkk the Shocker&quot; Miller. He attended St. Augustine High School (New Orleans) Booker T. Washington High School and Warren Easton High School. Having played on the basketball team, Miller attended the University of Houston on an athletic scholarship, but dropped out months into his freshman year and transferred to Merritt College in Oakland, California, to major in business administration. He mentioned that he worked at two jobs in his lifetime, with Bellsouth Mobility and Remco. 

After the death of his grandfather, Miller inherited $10,000 as part of a malpractice settlement. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California, called No Limit Records And Tapes, which later became the foundation for No Limit Records. On February 15, 1990, Master P released the cassette tape &quot;Mind Of A Psychopath&quot;. His brother Kevin Miller was killed that same year in New Orleans. This increased his motivation to become a successful entrepreneur to change his life and save his family.

== Music career ==

Master P released his debut studio album &quot;Get Away Clean&quot; on February 12, 1991. This was followed by his second album &quot;Mama&#x27;s Bad Boy&quot;, which was released in April 1992. Both albums were released through In-A-Minute Records. Also in 1992, he released his first collaboration album with his group TRU titled &quot;Understanding the Criminal Mind&quot;, and in 1993 they released another album titled &quot;Who&#x27;s da Killer?&quot; Master P released his third studio album &quot;The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!&quot; on March 18, 1994; it was later re-released in 1997 as a limited edition under Priority.

The album reached number 25 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 14 on the Top Heatseekers. The album was known for its first single and one of Master P&#x27;s best known songs &quot;I&#x27;m Bout&#x27; It, Bout It&quot;. He also worked on the compilation album, &quot;Down South Hustlers: Bouncin&#x27; and Swingin&#x27;&quot;, during that year.

Master P said that when he used to open for Tupac Shakur in the early 1990s, the people responsible for introducing him would frequently call him &quot;Mr. P the country singer&quot;.

The first week sales of the album were the highest of any of Master P&#x27;s albums, selling more than 760,000 copies, and it went on to go certified triple platinum. It contained the hit single &quot;Make &#x27;Em Say Uhh!&quot;, Master P&#x27;s highest-charting single to date. The song earned him an MTV Video Music Award nomination the following year for &quot;Best Rap Video&quot;, but lost to Will Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy Wit It&quot;. On June 2, 1998, Master P released his seventh and best-selling album to date &quot;MP Da Last Don&quot;. Master P released a film of the same name earlier that year. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 charts selling more than 400,000 copies in its first week, and went on to sell in excess of four million copies. On October 26, 1999, Master P released his eighth studio album &quot;Only God Can Judge Me&quot;, which contained his single &quot;Step To Dis&quot;.

In 2002, The 504 Boyz released their second album Ballers. Both albums charted high on the Hip-Hop charts, but shortly after, No Limit began to decline in popularity. Record sales as well as roster changes and lawsuits caused No Limit Records to file for bankruptcy on December 17, 2003.

Awareness of the circumstances of Master P&#x27;s incarcerated brother, C-Murder, resurged after the series aired, prompting Percy to rally for his brother&#x27;s release. On August 17, 2020, Master P posted a video to his Instagram account of him and C-Murder&#x27;s lawyer speaking to a group of protesters, inciting momentum to work in favor of his brother&#x27;s liberation.

== Business career ==
Aside from being a rapper, Master P has enjoyed a successful career as an entrepreneur and investor. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California, called No Limit Records, which later became the foundation for his own record label of the same name.

Miller was one of the first rappers to notice and take advantage of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P was one of the first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a Foot Locker retail outlet, real estate, stocks, film, music, and television production, toy making, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations. His sports management agency No Limit Communications, a joint venture with marketing guru Djuan Edgerton, was a success. His conglomerate company, No Limit Enterprises became a financial powerhouse. His real estate investment and property management company, the New Orleans–based PM Properties controls over 100 properties across the United States. According to Black Enterprise magazine, No Limit Enterprises grossed $110 million in revenue in 1998 alone. This level of success inspired other rappers to branch out into other business ventures and investments. Miller also has his own line of beverages called &quot;Make &#x27;Em Say Ughh!&quot; energy drinks.

Rappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment, and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record&#x27;s sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution, which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues. Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition: &quot;Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele.&quot; Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and profit margins high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level guerrilla marketing technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high-volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist&#x27;s name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used pen and pixel graphics and Mafia-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into Marvel comic book-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on SoundScan every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller&#x27;s record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.

As founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, No Limit Records, Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P. M. Properties, and Advantage Travel. Miller represented former NFL running back Ricky Williams when he was drafted by the New Orleans Saints; however, the deal was rated the worst contract for a player in NFL History by ESPN. Miller manages the music, film, and television career of his son, Romeo Miller, as well as pop star Forrest Lipton and Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane. Miller was the executive television producer for his teenage daughter Cymphonique&#x27;s Nickelodeon Show, How To Rock, and the co-creator of Romeo!, the hit Nickelodeon television show that stars his son.

=== Income ===
In 1998, Miller ranked 10th on Forbes magazine&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s 40 highest paid entertainers, with an estimated income of $56.5 million. In 2013, Miller&#x27;s wealth is estimated to be $200 million, making him one of the wealthiest figures in the American hip hop scene.

== Professional basketball career ==
In 1998, Miller joined the Fort Wayne Fury of the CBA as a backup guard after a No Limit employee asked the Fury head coach to give his boss a tryout. According to the coach Miller was &quot;coachable [and] an eager learner&quot;, but not NBA material.

Miller was on the Charlotte Hornets training camp roster for 10 days in January 1999. He was invited to participate at the request of Hornet Ricky Davis&#x27;s father. He scored 7 points in intrasquad play and played eight minutes in two exhibition games before being released on February 1. Miller claimed he played well but was cut because his rap lyrics were too offensive.

That fall he was on the Toronto Raptors training camp roster. He scored eight points in one preseason game, but was dropped before the season began. He complained that the Raptors hadn&#x27;t given him a fair chance.

In November, he signed with the San Diego Stingrays of the short-lived IBL, a &quot;home for players without NBA skills and those who are developing them.&quot; His performance was disappointing and he played for less than a season.

In 2004, Miller played for the ABA&#x27;s Las Vegas Rattlers and Long Beach Jam. He earned try-outs for the Denver Nuggets at training camp for the summer league in 2004 and the same opportunity for the Sacramento Kings in 2005. He took part in the 2008 McDonald&#x27;s NBA All-Star Celebrity Game and scored 17 points. He also coached the AAU team the P. Miller Ballers with players such as Brandon Jennings, Lance Stephenson, and DeMar DeRozan who went on to achieve success in the NBA. DeRozan said of his time being coached by Miller: &quot;I am forever grateful for having him in my life. ... He taught us about life, how to understand business—the business of basketball. He was, in a sense, a father figure.&quot;

== Other ventures ==

He was also a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, replacing Romeo who dropped out due to an injury. He partnered with Ashly DelGrosso and received a total score of 8 out of 30 for his pasodoble, the lowest score in the show&#x27;s history. He was eliminated in Week 4.

In 1999, Miller starred alongside Eddie Griffin in the hit film &quot;Foolish&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Miller is known for his music and his business acumen, due to creating and branding No Limit Records, an independent record label. Its success led to other business ventures under the &quot;No Limit&quot; umbrella.

During an interview after meeting Miller, Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz stated, &quot;This is my first time meeting [him]. I just want to let him know how he influenced the whole South in Hip-Hop.&quot; 2 Chainz went on, &quot;We used to argue people like they ain&#x27;t understand why we appreciated Master P and his music. It was more than that. I felt like it was his grind, his hustle. He actually put music out like every week. I even heard stories about some of the songs never even being mixed before. It was just about giving the fans what they needed. And he the reason why a lot of us are here, including myself.&quot;

<text>The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (informally referred to as The Bosstones and often stylized as The Mighty Mighty BossToneS) were an American ska punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, formed in 1983. From the band&#x27;s inception, lead vocalist Dicky Barrett, bassist Joe Gittleman, tenor saxophonist Tim &quot;Johnny Vegas&quot; Burton and dancer (&quot;Bosstone&quot;) Ben Carr remained constant members. The band&#x27;s final line-up also included drummer Joe Sirois, saxophonist Leon Silva, guitarist Lawrence Katz, keyboardist John Goetchius, and trombonist Chris Rhodes.

The Bosstones are often credited as one of the progenitors of the genre of ska punk and the creators of its subgenre ska-core, which mixes elements of ska with hardcore punk. Starting with the release of their 1989 debut &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night Out&quot;, the band toured and recorded extensively throughout the 1990s, becoming influential in the development of the American third-wave ska scene and was one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream. They reached their commercial peak with their platinum-selling 1997 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; and its hit single &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;. The band was also notable for being featured in the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot; as the frat party house band. The band had released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a hiatus in December 2003. In 2007, the Bosstones reunited to resume recording and touring, and released four more studio albums between 2009 and 2021. From 1994 to 2002, and again from 2007 to 2019, they hosted the annual Hometown Throwdown music festival, held annually around Christmas time in Cambridge and later Boston.

On January 27, 2022, the band announced their disbandment.

==History==
===Early history (1983–1988)===
The band&#x27;s roots lie in the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s, along with a strong influence from the British 2 Tone ska scene of the 1970s. Bassist Joe Gittleman played with local hardcore band Gang Green, while vocalist Dicky Barrett was a member of Impact Unit and, later on, Cheapskates. The Cheapskates lineup went through frequent changes and would feature members of Gang Green on occasion. It was through Cheapskates that a core lineup coalesced around Barrett, Gittleman, Tim &quot;Johnny Vegas&quot; Burton (saxophone), Nate Albert (guitar), Josh Dalsimer (drums), Tim Bridwell (trumpet) and Ben Carr (a ubiquitous, dancing non-musician onstage presence, later credited as &quot;Bosstone&quot;). The group decided on the name, &quot;the Bosstones&quot; as a reference to the city near their hometowns. While some of the band members were influenced by bands such as AC/DC, Social Distortion, Motörhead, The Clash and Stiff Little Fingers, Barrett had become enthralled with 2 Tone ska, which was in the tail end of its prominence.

In 1987, the Bosstones made their recorded debut when they were featured on the &quot;Mash It Up&quot; ska compilation. The Bosstones&#x27; contribution was &quot;The Cave&quot;, and &quot;Ugly&quot;. Another early recording, &quot;Drums and Chickens,&quot; appeared on the 1989 ska compilation &quot;Mashin&#x27; Up The Nation&quot;. By the time &quot;Mashin&#x27; Up The Nation&quot; was released, the Bosstones had temporarily disbanded in order for Albert and Gittleman to finish high school. After their graduation, the band reunited. Around this time, it was brought to the band&#x27;s attention that an a cappella group, The Bosstones, had already used the name during the 1950s. A bartender friend arbitrarily suggested that they become the &quot;Mighty Mighty Bosstones&quot;, in order to avoid any possible legal hassles, to which the band agreed.

===Taang! years (1989–1992)===
Despite not consistently drawing large crowds at their live shows, the Taang! record label gave the band a recording contract which would result in the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night Out&quot; album, produced by Paul Q. Kolderie. The album was released to positive local and lukewarm national reaction during a time when ska was struggling to move out of the American underground. The band found resistance from ska purists who did not like that the band were not playing traditional ska while hardcore fans were against the ska and heavy metal elements in the music. Despite the initial reaction, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night Out&quot; has gone on to become one of the band&#x27;s most popular albums.

It was during this time that the band&#x27;s trademark plaid clothing came to be. After a show where Barrett wore plaid, fans started to show up wearing it as well. It was noticeable enough that the band was approached by the Converse sneaker company to promote their new line of Chuck Taylor sneakers. The band accepted the proposal and were seen in several television commercials promoting the sneakers.

By this time, Tim Bridewell had left the band, to be replaced by Dennis Brockenborough (trombone) and Kevin Lenear (saxophone). The band&#x27;s next release was an EP titled &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go?&quot;. The EP featured the title track as well as cover versions of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot; and a new version of &quot;Do Somethin&#x27; Crazy&quot;, originally featured on &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night Out.&quot;

In 1991, the band set out on their first full American tour. It was during the first leg of touring that drummer Josh Dalsimer would leave the band to pursue a college education. He would be replaced by Joe Sirois, who Barrett met at Bunker Hill Community College. Sirois would immediately join his new bandmates in the recording studio to start work on the band&#x27;s second album.

Once again produced by Paul Q. Kolderie, &quot;More Noise and Other Disturbances&quot; was released in June 1992. The band would film a video for the song &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go?&quot; which had previously been available on the EP of the same name (though the band had also recorded a video for &quot;Guns and the Young&quot;), the video was not finished until a few years after it was recorded.

During this era, the band published a newsletter for their fans titled &quot;737&quot;.

===Mainstream success and Big Rig Records (1993–2001)===
The band signed to their first major label when they joined the Mercury Records roster and soon recorded the &quot;Ska-Core, the Devil, and More&quot; EP. Released in March 1993, it was largely a collection of cover songs. Four of the seven tracks paid homage to the band&#x27;s influences: The Angry Samoans&#x27; &quot;Lights Out&quot;, Minor Threat&#x27;s &quot;Think Again&quot;, SSD&#x27;s &quot;Police Beat&quot; and The Wailers&#x27; &quot;Simmer Down&quot;. Three live tracks were included as well. The EP contained one new studio track &quot;Someday I Suppose,&quot; which would later appear on the band&#x27;s third full-length album.

Produced by Tony Platt, the band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Don&#x27;t Know How to Party&quot; contained a cover of Stiff Little Fingers&#x27; song &quot;Tin Soldiers&quot; as well as a vocal appearance by Daryl Jennifer of Bad Brains. A video was also filmed for &quot;Someday I Suppose&quot; and it received minor airplay on MTV. Though the footage was originally intended to serve as a promo for the Bosstones debut on Mercury, the label liked the footage and turned it into a single. The band would also appear on the 1994 &quot;Kiss My Ass&quot; tribute to Kiss album, covering &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. Mercury Records released it as a single, appearing on 7-inch green vinyl and backed by the original Kiss version of the song. Soon after, the band found themselves invited by fellow Bostonian Steven Tyler, to open up for Aerosmith at their New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Boston. While it was not the most successful show the Bosstones had played, it ensured that the Bosstones started 1994 on the road as they had intended.

The band released their fourth album, &quot;Question the Answers,&quot; in October 1994. The album featured production work by the Butcher Brothers, Paul Q. Kolderie and Ross Humphrey. It was at this time that the band decided it wanted to release their albums on vinyl, leading to a partnership with Mercury Records to form Big Rig Records, a vanity label that allowed the band to release their albums on vinyl. The Big Rig vinyl versions often contained a bonus track not seen on the cassette or CD versions. Besides touring, the band found itself making their network television debut on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; and hosting MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. They also contributed a new version of &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go?&quot; to the Alicia Silverstone movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. The band also made an appearance in the film, performing the songs &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go?&quot; and &quot;Someday I Suppose&quot; during a college fraternity party scene. On top of their TV and film appearances, the band was added to the main stage of the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Mercury set about repromoting &quot;Question the Answers&quot; by adding a second disc with five B-side tracks. The EP was titled &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; and it was compiled by Barrett at the request of Mercury.

After touring as part of the 1996 Warped Tour lineup (which they would repeat the following year), the Bosstones began work on their next studio album. Released in 1997, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot;, would prove to be the band&#x27;s biggest seller, mostly due to its first single &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was followed by &quot;Video Stew&quot;, a VHS compilation of the band&#x27;s twelve music videos. The mainstream exposure led to the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Elmopalooza&quot; television special and Grammy Award-winning soundtrack album, in which they performed the song &quot;The Zig Zag Dance&quot; with The Count. The band also made their &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; debut, performing &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;.

Capitalizing on the band&#x27;s popularity, Mercury released the band&#x27;s live album, &quot;Live From the Middle East&quot; in October 1998. The album was recorded live in Cambridge, Massachusetts at The Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub during the band&#x27;s annual end-of-the-year Hometown Throwdown from 1997. In 1999, the band contributed their cover version of the song, &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail,&quot; to the &quot;Burning London&quot; Clash tribute compilation. Shortly after all of these releases, Kevin Lenear quit the band to work on his own material and was replaced by Roman Fleysher.

In 2000, the band released &quot;Pay Attention&quot; which failed to meet expectations set by the previous album. &quot;So Sad to Say&quot;, was released as a single, but it never reached a position higher than No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Ultimately, the album did not sell as well as their previous release. This was to be the band&#x27;s last album with Mercury Records, who along with PolyGram, had become part of the Universal Music Group who subsequently merged Island Records and Def Jam Recordings forming the new Island Def Jam label. The band, unhappy with the way the newly formed label had been handling them, asked for a release from their contract, to which the label agreed. After the recording of &quot;Pay Attention&quot;, founding member Nate Albert left in order to obtain a degree in political theory from Brown University. His next musical venture would be as a member of Evan Dando’s re-formed Lemonheads before forming The Kickovers, which focused more on a 1970&#x27;s punk sound than ska. Albert eventually became involved in band management, handling bands such as Bayside and Lost City Angels. Albert&#x27;s replacement on guitar was Lawrence Katz who appeared in the band photo on the album&#x27;s reverse and in the music video for &quot;So Sad to Say&quot;. &quot;Pay Attention&quot; was also the last album for Dennis Brockenborough who had already formed his own band, Chubby, for which he sang and played guitar. Brockenborough&#x27;s replacement was former Spring Heeled Jack member Chris Rhodes. Spring Heeled Jack had dissolved in 2000, and Rhodes had recently taken a vacant trombone position with Bim Skala Bim when he received the invitation to join.

===SideOneDummy and hiatus (2002–2006)===
The band announced their return to an independent label when they signed with SideOneDummy Records. In July 2002, the band released &quot;A Jackknife to a Swan&quot; and from it the song &quot;You Gotta Go!&quot; was released as a single and video. The band continued to tour but in December 2003, they announced their decision to go on a hiatus and were forced to forgo that year&#x27;s Hometown Throwdown. One contributing factor was that several band members were reported to already be busy with other bands and side projects. Another factor was that the band had been touring, almost non-stop, since 1991, and some of the band members desired a break.

After the hiatus announcement, several members went on to work on other projects and bands. Barrett became the announcer on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; late night talk show. In 2005, he became the host of the &quot;Mighty Morning Show&quot; on Los Angeles radio&#x27;s Indie 103.1 FM. In March 2006, he was dismissed from the radio station.

Before the hiatus announcement, Gittleman had already formed a side project band named Avoid One Thing featuring members of Darkbuster, the Raging Teens and Spring Heeled Jack. The band released two albums for SideOneDummy before announcing their own hiatus in 2005.

Sirois recorded and toured with Nate Albert&#x27;s next band, Kickovers, and also played drums for the Street Dogs and Frank Black.

Rhodes went on to play with The Toasters until his departure in 2006. Rhodes had just joined Bim Skala Bim before the Bosstones&#x27; hiatus came to an end and left Bim Skala Bim as a result. He also performed with former Spring Heeled Jack bandmate Rick Omonte in The Mountain Movers and as a fill-in trombonist for Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, and NOFX.

Fleysher continued his pursuit of a professional pilot&#x27;s license. In 2005, after taking classes near his home in South Florida and working as a flight instructor in his spare time, he was hired as an airline pilot for CommutAir, a Continental Airlines regional affiliate based in Plattsburgh, New York. After a short stint with the company, he began flying as a charter pilot in Los Angeles, California.

Burton and his family moved to Los Angeles where he became active in the movie business. Besides working for a Hollywood agent, he wrote several scripts and developed projects for television. He also contributed saxophone for a Cypress Hill song. In 2007, he appeared in the film &quot;Crazy&quot;, which was inspired by the life of Hank Garland.

Katz formed a band named Resistant. Katz has also played guitar on several motion picture soundtracks including &quot;Aquamarine&quot;, &quot;The Good Night&quot; and &quot;London&quot;, the latter recorded in collaboration with The Crystal Method.

===Reunion and breakup (2007–2022)===

Because the band left the possibility of playing together again open, rumors and speculation frequently circulated that a reunion was inevitable. The hiatus of Joe Gittleman&#x27;s band, Avoid One Thing, fueled further speculation of such a reunion.

During an &quot;Alternative Press&quot; Acoustic Session, members of fellow Boston area ska band Big D and the Kids Table hinted that the Bosstones were in fact reuniting for another Hometown Throwdown. Jerry Mattes, the creator of the band&#x27;s bulldog mascot, also acknowledged the chances of a reunion and announced that he was designing a new logo for the band.

On October 11, 2007, on Boston Radio Station WBCN, Dicky Barrett confirmed what he called &quot;the worst kept secret in Boston&quot;: the announcement that the Bosstones would indeed play a tenth official Hometown Throwdown at Cambridge&#x27;s famed Middle East club on December 26–30, 2007. Barrett would not confirm any long-term plans for the band. Soon after Barrett&#x27;s announcement, Gittleman declared that the band intended to record three new songs to be included on an upcoming collection of unreleased material and vinyl B-sides. The album, titled &quot;Medium Rare&quot;, was released on December 18, 2007. The three new songs marked the first new material recorded since the 2002 release of &quot;A Jackknife to a Swan&quot;.

After the 2007 Throwdown, the Bosstones played a few shows every couple of months. At two of the March shows in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel served as a guest star on bass clarinet during &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;. Former saxophonist Lenear rejoined the band, replacing Fleysher, whose job prevented him from being able to play with the band. Despite the activity, the Bosstones remained non-committal on whether they would record and release a studio album. They did make it known that they would no longer tour at the frequency they were known for in the past.

On May 15, 2008, it was reported that the Bosstones would be embarking on a short United States tour in July with the Dropkick Murphys. During the tour, the Bosstones made three stops at Boston Red Sox minor league ballparks. On October 20, 2008, their website announced that they would return to the Middle East in Cambridge to play an eleventh Hometown Throwdown on December 26–29. In late 2008, the game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; was released and featured a re-recorded version of &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go?&quot; that the band had recorded earlier in the year. On November 4, 2008, a MySpace blog announced the recording of a new album, and streamed two new songs, &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; and &quot;Next to Nothing&quot;. On July 29, 2009, the band announced the completion of tracking for the album. On October 16, 2009, the album title was announced to be &quot;Pin Points and Gin Joints&quot; and a free download of the song &quot;Graffiti Worth Reading&quot; was made available. The release date was later stated as December 8, 2009.

The band continued to tour through the summer of 2009 with shows in Buffalo, New York, Providence, Rhode Island, Asbury Park, New Jersey, Seattle, Washington, San Francisco, California, Anaheim, California, Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, and Victoria, British Columbia where they performed at the Victoria Ska Fest with Voodoo Glow Skulls, The Slackers and Chris Murray. The band toured during the summer of 2010 with Teenage Bottlerocket and the Flatliners. They also hosted their annual Hometown Throwdown festival over three nights in December 2010.

In August 2011, Chris Rhodes posted a Facebook update stating that The Mighty Mighty Bosstones had begun work on their next album. The album, titled &quot;The Magic of Youth&quot;, was released on December 6, 2011.

March 2017 saw the release of their first recording in six years with a limited edition vinyl 7&quot; featuring a cover version of the Burt Bacharach song, &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot; backed with the track &quot;I Won’t Go Out Like That&quot;. In the time between releases, the lineup saw the addition of former Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies keyboard player, John Goetchius in 2008 and Leon Silva in 2016 to replace Kevin Lenear who had departed the band for a second time earlier that same year.

In September 2017, Tim Burton announced in a post Riot Fest interview that the band was working on a new album set for release in early 2018. According to guitarist Lawrence Katz and producer Ted Hutt&#x27;s Instagram accounts, recording started on Friday, November 17 at Kingsize Soundlabs in Los Angeles, California. The new album&#x27;s title was announced to be &quot;While We&#x27;re at It&quot;.

&quot;While We&#x27;re at It&quot;, the band&#x27;s tenth album, was released on June 15, 2018. It is the final part of a musical trilogy that began with &quot;Pin Points and Gin Joints&quot; in 2009 followed by &quot;The Magic of Youth&quot; in 2011. For the initial 2018 tour dates supporting the album, Silva could not participate due to his commitments performing with Justin Timberlake. To temporarily fill in for Silva, the band brought in Roman Fleysher and Peter &quot;JR&quot; Wasilewski of Less Than Jake to play saxophone on select dates.

On January 25, 2021, it was announced that the Mighty Mighty Bosstones had signed a new record contract with Hellcat Records. In conjunction with the announcement, the band released a new single titled, &quot;The Final Parade&quot; which features guest appearances by Jamaican singer Stranger Cole and members of Rancid, The Interrupters, Fishbone, Stiff Little Fingers, The Suicide Machines, Less Than Jake, Murphy&#x27;s Law, H2O, Goldfinger, Sonic Boom Six, The Toasters, Bim Skala Bim, Big D and the Kids Table, Doped Up Dollies, The Aggrolites, Dance Hall Crashers, The Aquabats, Buck-O-Nine, The Porkers, The Pietasters, Los Skanarles, Buster Shuffle, Kemuri, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and The Specials.

In March 2021, the band announced their first album since signing to Hellcat Records, &quot;When God Was Great&quot;, would be released on May 7, 2021, and released the album&#x27;s second single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe in Anything&quot;. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;The Killing of King Georgie (Part III)&quot;, a song about the murder of George Floyd, was released on April 21, 2021.

On January 27, 2022, the band announced that they had split up. The statement shared by the band reads: &quot;After decades of brotherhood, touring the world and making great records together we have decided not to continue on as a band. Above all, we want to express our sincere gratitude to every single one of you who have supported us. We could not have done any of it without you. Love Always, The Mighty Mighty BossToneS.&quot; Although the band chose to keep their reasoning for the split private, speculation suggested that it was over Barrett&#x27;s stance on COVID-19 vaccines and his participation in the production of a video promoting the &quot;Defeat the Mandates&quot; anti-vaccination mandate rally held by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In February 2022, Barrett was a guest on &quot;The Highwire with Del Bigtree&quot; podcast where he confirmed that it was his anti-vaccination views that had made the rest of the band uncomfortable.

==Big Rig Records==
Big Rig Records started as a vanity label in 1993 due to the band&#x27;s desire to release their records on vinyl. While the band wanted to release their albums on vinyl, the label had ceased pressing albums in that format. A partnership between Mercury and the band resulted in the label continuing to handle the conventional CD and cassette versions of the albums while allowing the band&#x27;s Big Rig label to focus on the vinyl editions. The new label immediately issued re-releases of &quot;Don&#x27;t Know How To Party&quot; and &quot;Ska-Core, The Devil, and More&quot; on colored vinyl.

Besides the band&#x27;s own albums, additional releases include the first CD release of Dicky Barrett&#x27;s previous band Impact Unit, as well as &quot;Vow Of Poverty&quot; by the Boston punk band Mung, and &quot;Half Hour Of Power&quot; by Sum 41. Additionally, the label also released a benefit compilation featuring various artists titled &quot;Safe And Sound: A Benefit In Response To The Brookline Clinic Violence&quot;, as well as, &quot;You Decide: Warped Tour 2000 Sampler&quot;, a sampler of bands featured on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour. The first new release under this partnership was &quot;Question the Answers&quot; and it continued through &quot;Pay Attention&quot;, the band&#x27;s final album with the Island Def Jam Music Group, the label formed after the merger of Mercury Records, Island Records, and Def Jam Recordings. After leaving Mercury, the vinyl release of &quot;A Jackknife to a Swan&quot; was handled directly by SideOneDummy, the band&#x27;s label at the time. Since the band&#x27;s return from hiatus, Big Rig has been run exclusively by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones as their own independent record label, handling all of their new releases up until 2021&#x27;s &quot;When God Was Great&quot;, which was released on Hellcat Records.

==Musical style==
The band has been typically aligned with ska punk. The &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, described their sound as &quot;blending the brassy after-beat groove of ska with the uncompromising intensity of hard-core punk&quot;. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; described it similarly as an &quot;eclectic swirl of good-time music fuses the perky pick-it-up sound of pre-reggae ska with monstrous hard-core guitars.&quot; AllMusic credited them as being &quot;one of the first bands to cross high-energy ska with hardcore punk and hard rock guitars&quot;, and &quot;[laying] a great deal of the groundwork for the mid- to late-&#x27;90s ska explosion, helping shift its tone toward party music.&quot; The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; said that they &quot;were one of the first bands to cross high-energy ska with hardcore punk and heavy metal.&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Woods was born on April 18, 1947, in Vernal, Utah, and had a brother ten years younger. His father, Gail Peyton Woods, was a United States Army intelligence officer who died in 1960 after routine surgery. His mother, Martha A. (), ran a pre-school after her husband&#x27;s death and later married Thomas E. Dixon. Woods grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, where he attended Pilgrim High School, from which he graduated in 1965. He is of part Irish descent and was raised Catholic, briefly serving as an altar boy.

Woods was an undergraduate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He stated on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; that he originally intended to become an eye surgeon. He pledged the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and was a member of the student theatre group Dramashop, acting in and directing a number of plays. He dropped out of MIT in 1969, one semester before graduating, to pursue an acting career. 

Woods has said that he owes his acting career to Tim Affleck, father of actors Ben and Casey Affleck. The senior Affleck was a stage manager at the Theatre Company of Boston, which Woods attended as a student.

==Career==
===1969–1976: Broadway debut and early work ===
Woods appeared in 36 plays before making his Broadway debut in the 1969 play &quot;The Penny Wars&quot;. The following year he acted in the first American production of Frank McMahon&#x27;s adaptation of Brendan Behan&#x27;s &quot;Borstal Boy&quot; (1970) at the Lyceum Theatre. He got the part by pretending he was British. He returned to Broadway the following year to portray David Darst in Daniel Berrigan&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of the Catonsville Nine&quot; also at the Lyceum Theatre. In 1971, he played Bob Rettie in the American premiere of Michael Weller&#x27;s &quot;Moonchildren&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. The following year the production moved to Broadway at the Royale Theatre where Woods starred alongside Edward Herrmann and Christopher Guest. In 1972, Woods won a Theatre World Award for his performance. He returned to Broadway in 1973 to portray Steven Cooper in the original production of Jean Kerr&#x27;s &quot;Finishing Touches&quot; at the Plymouth Theatre.

Woods has garnered a reputation as a prominent Hollywood character actor, having appeared in over 130 films and television series. By the early 1970s, he was getting small movie roles including his feature film debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;The Visitors&quot; which debuted at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. That same year he acted in the neo-noir crime film &quot;Hickey &amp; Boggs&quot; (1972) starring Robert Culp and Bill Cosby. The following year he had a supporting turn as Barbra Streisand&#x27;s college boyfriend before she meets Robert Redford in the Sydney Pollack directed romance drama &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973). He continued to act in films such as the crime drama &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974) starring James Caan, the neo-noir &quot;Night Moves&quot; (1975) with Gene Hackman and the comedy &quot;Alex &amp; the Gypsy&quot; (1976) with Jack Lemmon. He acted in the Robert Aldrich directed comedy-drama &quot;The Choirboys&quot; (1977) alongside Charles Durning, Louis Gossett Jr., Randy Quaid and Burt Young.

=== 1978–1989: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
Woods rose to prominence playing the husband of Meryl Streep in the critically acclaimed four episode miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot; (1978) which aired on NBC. The series focuses on the story of a Jewish family&#x27;s struggle to survive Nazi Germany&#x27;s campaign of genocide against the Jewish people. The series also starred Michael Moriarty and Rosemary Harris. &quot;Holocaust&quot; won the Outstanding Limited Series as well as seven other Primetime Emmy Awards. The following year Woods took a leading role starring in &quot;The Onion Field&quot; (1979) playing murderer Gregory Powell. Critic Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; praised Woods&#x27; performance writing, &quot;At the center of &quot;The Onion Field&quot; is a bunch of superior performances. James Woods (the persecuted artist in. &quot;The Holocaust&quot;) is a standout as Greg Powell, the ringleader of the crooks, a horrible creature with a scarred face and a quicksilver personality that ranges from murderous to fatherly to murderous in a matter of seconds.&quot; He also opined that &quot;Woods deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role.&quot; Woods received nominations for Best Actor from the Golden Globe Awards, the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York Film Critics Circle Association, but notably not from the Academy Awards.
At the start of the 1980s, Woods played an eccentric and unpredictable janitor in the Peter Yates directed thriller &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1981) co-starring Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Morgan Freeman and Christopher Plummer. 
He acted in the prison drama &quot;Fast-Walking&quot; (1982) with &quot;Variety&quot; giving the film a mixed review but praising him as &quot;always interesting to watch&quot;. That same year he acted in the psychological drama &quot;Split Image&quot; (1982). 

Woods took the starring role in the David Cronenberg written and directed science-fiction body horror film &quot;Videodrome&quot; (1983). Critic Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film and the leading performance writing, &quot;By far Mr. Cronenberg&#x27;s most inspired touch is the casting of Mr. Woods, who brings an almost backhanded heroism to the horror genre. In villainous or sinister roles...Mr. Woods has been startling, but that kind of casting is almost a redundancy. Here, his offhand wisecracking gives the performance a sharply authentic edge. And his jittery, insinuating manner even begins to look like a kind of innocence, in comparison with the calm, soothing attitudes of the video-crazed megalomaniacs he&#x27;s up against.&quot;

He then took on the role of Maximillian &quot;Max&quot; Bercovicz, a Jewish gangster, in Sergio Leone&#x27;s epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984) alongside Robert De Niro, Tuesday Weld, and Joe Pesci. Woods considers his role in the film as one of his favorites.
The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival and received a 15-minute standing ovation. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 86% approval rating with 51 reviews, the consensus reading, &quot;Sergio Leone&#x27;s epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting, and filled with great performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and James Woods.&quot; That same year, he also starred in &quot;Against All Odds&quot; as a nightclub owner who hires an aging football star, played by Jeff Bridges, to find his missing girlfriend.

In Oliver Stone&#x27;s drama &quot;Salvador&quot; (1986), Woods portrayed real-life journalist Richard Boyle as he chronicles events in El Salvador. Despite his criticism that &quot;&quot;Salvador&quot; is long and disjointed and tries to tell too many stories,&quot; Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;This is the sort of role Woods was born to play&quot;. He won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor. He also received his first Academy Award nomination for his performance. In 1987, Woods won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role as a disabled man in the made-for-television film &quot;Promise&quot; (1986). The film also starred James Garner and Piper Laurie. In 1989, Woods won his second Primetime Emmy Award, for his role as the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill W. in the made-for-television drama film, &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot; starring James Garner and Gary Sinise.

In 1988, Woods portrayed a man struggling with cocaine addiction in &quot;The Boost&quot;. While the film received mixed reviews Woods&#x27; was praised for his performance with Critic Roger Ebert declaring that it was &quot;one of the most convincing and horrifying portraits of drug addiction I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. He also added, &quot;Woods is one of the most intense, unpredictable actors in the movies today. You watch his characters because they seem capable of exploding – not out of anger, but out of hurt, shame and low self-esteem. They&#x27;re wounded, but they fight back by being smarter than anyone else and using jokes and sarcasm to keep people at arm&#x27;s length.&quot; On October 28, 1989, Woods hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Don Henley as the musical guest. In 1989, Woods acted in the courtroom drama &quot;True Believer&quot; with Robert Downey Jr. and Yuji Okumoto and family drama &quot;Immediate Family&quot; acting alongside Glenn Close, Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon. Of the latter, critic Roger Ebert noted of his performance &quot;Woods is toned down from his other recent performances. He is the best actor in Hollywood at playing manics, crazies, hyperactive schemers and intelligent con men, but here he simply plays a more or less normal husband with ordinary desires and passions. He and Close make a convincing couple.&quot;

===1990–1999: Established actor ===
Woods was offered a leading role in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s directorial debut, the low-budget film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), but his agent rejected the script without showing it to the actor. When Woods learned of this some time later, he fired his agents (CAA), replacing them with ICM. That year, he did portray Roy Cohn in the HBO television film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot; (1992) directed by Frank Pierson and featuring performances by Lee Grant, Frederic Forrest and Pat Hingle. Tony Scott of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film and Woods writing, &quot;It&#x27;s Cohn&#x27;s show and James Woods, in imaginative casting, is unnerving, ranging from the confused hospital-ridden patient to the smartly paced, homophobic gay prosecutor who knows every vicious trick to nail opponents. Woods&#x27;s interp, chock-full of nuances, is masterful.&quot;
For his performance he received nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie. He also took a supporting role as attorney Joseph Scott in the Richard Attenborough directed biographical epic film &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992) starring Robert Downey Jr. 

Woods played a supporting role of a hustler, Lester Diamond, in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), alongside Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci. When Woods had heard that Scorsese was interested in working with him, he called Scorsese&#x27;s office and left the following message: &quot;Any time, any place, any part, any fee.&quot; The film was well received by critics, earning a positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, &quot;Impressive ambition and bravura performances from an outstanding cast help &quot;Casino&quot; pay off in spite of a familiar narrative that may strike some viewers as a safe bet for director Martin Scorsese.&quot; Also in 1995, he starred as H.R. Haldeman in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot;, opposite Anthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon. Woods received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination along with the rest of the cast for its ensemble work. That same year he acted in the HBO television film &quot;&quot; acting opposite Mercedes Ruehl earning nominations for Golden Globe Award and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie. 
In Rob Reiner&#x27;s film &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), Woods appeared alongside Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg. He portrayed Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist who assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963. The film was not a box-office success and received mixed reviews, earning a critics&#x27; review of 43% on Rotten Tomatoes. However, some critics praised Woods&#x27; performance. Janet Maslin, in her &quot;New York Times&quot; review, states, &quot;Woods&#x27;s performance as the hateful old reprobate Beckwith is the film&#x27;s chief sign of life&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an article titled &quot;James Woods is So Good at Being Bad&quot;. In the articles it describes Woods having aggressively lobbied director Rob Reiner for the role, which Reiner originally intended for an actor in his 70s, like Paul Newman.
&quot;Beckwith&#x27;s Mississippi accent, which Woods perfected by watching tapes and working with an accent coach, helped him distance himself from the character. &#x27;I imagined I was speaking a foreign language&#x27;.&quot; Woods earned a Golden Globe nomination as well as his second Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. 

Woods would later voice Hades in the Disney Animated film, &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), where he received critical praise. Critic Roger Ebert described Woods&#x27; performance as full of &quot;diabolical glee&quot; and compared his performance of &quot;verbal inventiveness&quot; to that of Robin Williams in &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised Woods&#x27; performance remarking &quot;Woods shows off the full verve of an edgy Scarfe villain&quot;. He reprised the role of Hades again in the television series of the same name (where he won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2000 for his work in season 2), as well as in &quot;House of Mouse&quot; (2001–2003), the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, &quot;Disney Speedstorm&quot; (2023), and &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023). Woods appeared in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999) alongside Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartnett and Kathleen Turner. The film premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival to a largely positive critical reception.

===2000–present===
During the 2000s, Woods lent his voice to various films, video games, and television shows including another &quot;Disney&quot; film, &quot;&quot; (2001) as Dr. Phillium Benedict, the twisted former headmaster who attempts to abolish summer vacation. Woods would also voice Falcon in &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002). He appeared in the Denzel Washington thriller &quot;John Q.&quot; (2002) and had a cameo in &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005), featuring an all-star cast. In 2007, Woods voiced the role of Reggie Belafonte, a short-tempered sea otter, in the Sony Pictures Animation film, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. The character is a Don King-like promoter for the main character&#x27;s rival. The film went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature losing to Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Ratatouille&quot;. From 2005 to 2016, Woods has played a recurring role as himself in Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He has continued to voice Hades in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video games. Since 2016, he has also voiced the role of Lex Luthor in the animated series &quot;Justice League Action&quot;. From 2006 to 2008, Woods starred in the CBS legal drama series &quot;Shark&quot;. He played an infamous defense lawyer who, after growing disillusioned when his client commits a murder, becomes a successful prosecutor with the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office.

In 2011, Woods starred in the HBO television drama film &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; based on the 2009 book of the same name by Andrew Ross Sorkin. He acted alongside Paul Giamatti, William Hurt, Cynthia Nixon, Tony Shalhoub and Bill Pullman. Woods played Richard S. Fuld, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Lehman Brothers. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Woods&#x27; writing that he &quot;embodyed the role with macho aggression with snake-oil smoothness&quot;.
For his performance Woods earned nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. In 2012, Woods appeared in the limited series &quot;Coma&quot; alongside Geena Davis, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ellen Burstyn. The series was produced by Ridley Scott, and Tony Scott and premiered on A&amp;E. In 2013, Woods joined Showtime&#x27;s critically acclaimed series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; in a recurring role as Patrick &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan also starring Liev Schreiber, and Jon Voight.
He also appeared as a fictional version of himself in the episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Homer and Apu&quot; and in eight episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which is set in Woods&#x27; home state of Rhode Island. He is also the namesake for James Woods High School in &quot;Family Guy&quot;. The high school&#x27;s name was later changed to Adam West High School to reflect the death of Adam West, who was a character in the show. Woods has lent his voice to video games such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. In 2012, Woods attended an anniversary screening of a restored cut of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984) at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. The screening was made possible by Martin Scorsese and his Film Foundation which digitally restored the film as well as included 40 additional minutes of footage. Woods, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Connelly, and Elizabeth McGovern attended the premiere and introduced the film.

In 2014, Woods joined Robert De Niro for an anniversary screening of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984) at the 52nd New York Film Festival at Film Society at Lincoln Center. In 2017, Woods made a rare public appearance at the Writers Guild of America Awards to honor his friend Oliver Stone, with whom he had collaborated three times (&quot;Salvador&quot;, &quot;Nixon&quot;, and &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;), who was receiving the lifetime achievement award. During the ceremony, Woods bantered with host Patton Oswalt. Woods served as an executive producer on Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023). Woods and J. David Wargo were thanked when the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture by producer Charles Roven who credited them for giving him the book &quot;American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer&quot; which was the basis for the film.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
In 1980, Woods married costume designer Kathryn Morrison-Pahoa. They divorced in 1983. In 1989, he married 26-year-old equestrian and boutique owner Sarah Owen, but they divorced four months later. In 1992, Woods dated Heather Graham, his co-star in the film &quot;Diggstown&quot;.

Woods was raised as Roman Catholic and considers himself a practicing follower of the religion.

On December 14, 2015, while he was driving alone westbound through an ice storm on Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado, a speeding driver lost control and crashed into five other cars. Woods swerved his Jeep Grand Cherokee to avoid the accident and collided with a retaining wall, but slid backwards into a guard rail above the Colorado River. He suffered a minor concussion.

=== Interests ===

During a press interview for &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Woods said that he was an avid video game player. He is a dealer of antiques in Rhode Island. Woods is an avid poker player, playing in cash games and many tournaments. He played in the WPT&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Home Game&quot; series in 2004 for the American Stroke Association charity. , he has over 80 tournament successes to his credit, including seventh place at the 2015 World Series of Poker in the $3000 No Limit Shootout event and fifth place in the $1,500 Dealers Choice event at the 2018 WSOP, as well as a $12,000 poker win in 2022 at Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas.

===Legal issues=== 
In 1988, Woods sued actress Sean Young for $2 million, accusing her of stalking him after they appeared together in the film &quot;The Boost&quot;. Young later countered that Woods had overreacted when she had spurned his on-set advances. The suit was settled out of court in August 1989, including a payment of $227,000 to Young to cover her legal costs.

In 2006, Woods&#x27; younger brother Michael Jeffrey Woods died from cardiac arrest at the age of 49. Woods sued Kent Hospital in Warwick, Rhode Island, alleging negligence. The lawsuit was settled in 2009.

In July 2015, Woods sued an anonymous Twitter user known as Abe List, and ten other Twitter users, for $10 million over an allegedly libelous tweet accusing him of being a &quot;cocaine addict&quot;. Woods unsuccessfully sought to obtain the name of the Twitter user; the Los Angeles Superior Court denied his motion for discovery in October 2015, holding that he could not &quot;use legal process to pierce the anonymity of internet speakers unless [he] can make a prima facie case.&quot; However, in an unexpected later ruling, the user&#x27;s Anti-SLAPP motion was denied and Woods was permitted to pursue his lawsuit against List, with the ten other defendants being dropped from the lawsuit. In October 2016, the defendant&#x27;s appeal was dismissed; attorney Lisa Bloom, who represented the anonymous Twitter user, revealed that the user had suddenly died. The case was settled out of court soon afterwards, with Woods receiving a letter from Bloom saying that her client &quot;regretted making the tweet and further regrets any harm caused to Mr. Woods&#x27; reputation by the tweet.&quot;

In 2017, shortly before the Abe List litigation was resolved, Portia Boulger sued Woods for misidentifying her as a Nazi in an allegedly libelous tweet. The tweet included a photo of a different woman giving a Nazi salute while wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt at a campaign event. Boulger sought $3 million in damages. The court ruled in favor of Woods under the innocent construction rule. Boulger appealed, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the ruling.

===Political views and Twitter use===
Woods has stated that he was a member of the Democratic Party until the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1999, commenting that &quot;every single Democrat without exception stood behind a convicted perjurer. That was the end.&quot; Woods was a registered Independent during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama; he has since aligned himself with the Republican Party. When Carly Fiorina pulled out of the 2016 presidential race, he shifted his endorsement to Ted Cruz in November 2015. Woods has defended U.S. President Donald Trump in the media, and has been described as a &quot;staunch Trump supporter&quot;.

Woods&#x27; name was in an advertisement in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (August 17, 2006) that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Lebanon War. On July 4, 2018, The Gersh Agency, Woods&#x27; long-time talent agency, notified him by email that they would no longer represent him. Woods stated that the agency dropped him due to his political views. He has said that there were many conservative actors who did not share their thoughts because &quot;the blacklist against conservatives in Hollywood is very real.&quot; 

Woods has frequently expressed his conservative political views on Twitter and has been locked out of his account multiple times for violations of the platform&#x27;s terms of service. In 2017, a Twitter debate between Woods and Amber Tamblyn escalated after Tamblyn accused Woods of inviting her to Las Vegas when she was underage, which Woods dismissed as a lie.

In 2018, Woods turned his Twitter feed into a bulletin board for missing California wildfires&#x27; evacuees, and was credited with saving lives and helping to reunite missing loved ones and pets with their families. He provided aid to actresses Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, with the latter thanking him for his help saving her horses.

In 2022, analysis conducted by researchers with the University of Washington&#x27;s Center for an Informed Public and the Krebs Stamos Group found Woods was the top purveyor of election misinformation on Twitter during the late months of 2020. That same year, Woods announced his intentions to sue the Democratic National Committee following Elon Musk&#x27;s release of the Twitter Files. Journalist Matt Taibbi reported that the Democratic National Committee requested a tweet made by Woods, related to Hunter Biden, be removed from Twitter. Critics of Woods defended Twitter&#x27;s decision by pointing out that he posted images of Hunter Biden&#x27;s genitals to his account.

In the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Woods has strongly criticized Hamas for &quot;savage terrorism&quot;. On X he criticized Joe Biden for failing to do more to secure the release of the twelve American hostages abducted to the Gaza strip by Hamas amid the Israel–Hamas war hostage crisis. In November 2023 he advocated against a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas War, further calling for the killing of all Palestinian activists with the hashtag “#KillThemAll”. In February 2024, he criticized Rashida Tlaib for her lone &quot;present&quot; vote as the United States House of Representatives voted unanimously to condemn rape and sexual violence committed by Hamas in its war against Israel. He has condemned 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses for fomenting anti-semitism and showing support for Hamas.

===9/11 experience ===
On August 1, 2001, Woods alleged noticing four men near him acting suspiciously on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Woods reported his suspicions to the co-pilot in flight, and he claimed that those concerns were passed on to the FAA. On the evening of September 11, Woods called the FBI and repeated his concerns; they interviewed him at his home the next morning. Woods believed that he had encountered four of the nineteen terrorists/hijackers responsible for the September 11 attacks, who were on the flight to study it in preparation for the attacks. Woods was interviewed by FBI agents regarding this incident. He has confirmed that he looked at pictures of the hijackers and identified two terrorists as being among the men that he had seen on his flight.

<doc id="168580" wikidata="Q466141" url="?curid=168580" title="The Mooney Suzuki">
<text>The Mooney Suzuki is an American garage rock band that formed in New York City in 1996. Originally comprising vocalist and guitarist Sammy James Jr., guitarist Graham Tyler, bassist John Paul Ribas and drummer Will Rockwell-Scott, the band has released four studio albums – &quot;People Get Ready&quot; (2000), &quot;Electric Sweat&quot; (2003), &quot;Alive &amp; Amplified&quot; (2004) and &quot;Have Mercy&quot; (2007). The current lineup includes founding members James and Rockwell-Scott, guitarist Chris Isom, and bassist Reno Bo.

==History==
The band formed in 1996, after Graham Tyler responded to an ad that former 2 Skinnee J&#x27;s guitarist, Sammy James Jr., posted in a guitar store. They released their first two singles, &quot;Taking Me Apart&quot; and &quot;Love Is Everywhere&quot;, in 1998. The band takes its name from two lead singers for the band Can, Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki.

The band came out with their first EP in 1999, followed by their first album, &quot;People Get Ready&quot;, in 2000 on the Estruslabel. In early 2002, the band won the New York Regional Poll in The 1st Annual Independent Music Awards for &quot;My Dear Persephone&quot; They broke up shortly afterwards, but soon reunited at the behest of The Donnas. After shows with The White Stripes and The Greenhornes, the band decided to record another record with Jim Diamond. &quot;Electric Sweat&quot; came out in 2002 and the band toured with longtime friends the Strokes and Swedish garage rockers the Hives. This tour led to their signing with Columbia Records, followed by appearances on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. During this time, Sammy James Jr. penned the title track in the Jack Black movie &quot;School of Rock&quot;.
He also wrote the closing theme &quot;Tread Lightly Rosie Grier.&quot;

In 2003, at Lollapalooza, the band began playing new songs such as &quot;Primitive Condition&quot;, which would appear on the Matrix-produced album, &quot;Alive and Amplified&quot;. The title song became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, appearing in the &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;, &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot;, and &quot;ATV Offroad Fury 3&quot; video game soundtracks. &quot;Alive and Amplified&quot; broke into the UK Singles Chart at No. 38, and appeared in the 2005 remake of &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, as well as the 2006 film &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot;. They also contributed to the &quot;Burnout 3&quot; soundtrack with another single from that album, &quot;Shake that Bush Again&quot;. Soon the band toured with Kings of Leon.

The band traded labels for V2 Records in 2005. The band&#x27;s album &quot;Have Mercy&quot; was to have been released on V2 Records in summer 2007 (originally set for January 2007, and then spring, according to V2 marketing materials). Due to the reorganization of V2 announced in January 2007, the album was not released on that label, but instead came out on June 19 on indie label Elixia Records.

In 2007, the band recorded a cover version of Cher&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Jesse James&quot; for Engine Room Recordings&#x27; compilation album &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;, which appeared in September 2007. Around this time, they also recorded the &quot;spring soundtrack&quot; for DKNY jeans. In 2008 the band recorded their fifth album and made a cameo appearance in Ben Stiller&#x27;s film &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;, in addition to contributing covers of &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; and &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Sammy James Jr. mentored a young rocker for an episode of the award-winning MTV series &quot;Made&quot;.

In April 2019 it was announced the band would play the Mercury Lounge on July 19 as part of the venue&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations. The show sold out immediately. In May, a second show was added for July 20. 
==Side projects==
Guitarist Chris Isom formed a band, Loud Owls, while bassist Reno Bo played bass with Albert Hammond, Jr., putting his solo album on hold. Sammy James Jr. played New York City with bands such as The Pierces, Men Without Pants and Native Korean Rock, featuring Russell Simins of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. From April 2010 to February 2012, Will Rockwell-Scott was the drummer for Australian rock band Wolfmother. That same year, Mooney Suzuki&#x27;s song &quot;Do It&quot; was used for a commercial by SAP AG.

== Trivia ==

* A level (84-2) in version 1.4 of the video game &quot;N&quot; is named after the band.

* The band’s name combines the last names of the first two vocalists of the German band CAN, Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki.

Original member Graham Tyler left the band to become a graphic designer, as did Augie Wilson, drummer on &quot;Alive &amp; Amplified&quot;, upon graduating from Cooper Union. The current lineup includes guitarist Chris Isom, who has played with members of The Fiery Furnaces and The Negatones, as well as bass player Reno Bo, who contributes to Albert Hammond, Jr. and The Fame. Drummer Will Rockwell-Scott rejoined the band for their &quot;Have Mercy&quot; tour after leaving upon the completion of &quot;Electric Sweat.&quot; Rockwell-Scott has also played drums for New York City-based quintet Apes &amp; Androids.

<doc id="168583" wikidata="Q1348423" url="?curid=168583" title="Salvador (film)">
<text>Salvador is a 1986 American war drama film co-written and directed by Oliver Stone. It stars James Woods as Richard Boyle, alongside Jim Belushi, Michael Murphy and Elpidia Carrillo, with John Savage and Cynthia Gibb in supporting roles. Stone co-wrote the screenplay with Boyle.

The film tells the story of an American journalist covering the Salvadoran Civil War who becomes entangled with both the FMLN and the right-wing military dictatorship while trying to rescue his girlfriend and her children. The film is highly sympathetic toward the left-wing revolutionaries and strongly critical of the US-supported military dictatorship, focusing on the murder of four American Catholic missionaries, including Jean Donovan, and the assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero by death squads. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Woods) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Stone and Boyle).

==Plot==
Veteran photojournalist Richard Boyle has over 20 years of experience, and while he has good output, Boyle&#x27;s substance abuse problems and his arrogance have marred his reputation and left him practically unemployable. One morning, he finds that his wife has abandoned him and taken their child. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his close friend, Doctor Rock, an out-of-work disc jockey, head to El Salvador, where Boyle is convinced that he can do freelance work amidst the nation&#x27;s political turmoil. After arriving, Boyle asks to meet a general he met during the Football War, and he and Rock are taken to him in a school-turned-barracks where both discuss the situation and he learns that the Salvadoran Army is being supplied by the United States. Sensing that disaster is imminent in El Salvador, Boyle eventually decides to leave, but he is reunited with an old flame named María and her two children, and is motivated to help them escape the country.

In the meantime, Boyle and María go to a mass led by Archbishop Oscar Romero. During the mass, the Archbishop is assassinated by the far-right ARENA party while the army outside opens fire on the fleeing crowd with Boyle and Maria barely escaping. Afterwards, Boyle goes to the United States Embassy to convince the ambassador to cut aid for the Salvadoran government, but his suggestions are denied and he is told to leave the country for his own safety.

While attempting to get María out of the country, Boyle is harassed by military authorities, which eventually leads to the deaths of people either close to him or María. As rebels overrun the government forces in Santa Ana, Boyle witnesses them execute captured soldiers with the same cruelty the military had previously shown them, which greatly disgusts him. When the Salvadoran Army starts using American supplies to combat the rebels, Boyle&#x27;s friend and fellow photojournalist, John Cassady, is killed during the battle.

Boyle and María eventually leave the country for the United States. However, upon entering California, their bus is stopped by immigration officers and María allows herself to be deported alongside her children due to the guilt of leaving her home country behind while Boyle is arrested after desperately arguing with the officers.
An epilogue reveals that María and her children survived and were last rumored to be in a refugee camp in Guatemala; Doctor Rock eventually returned to San Francisco; Cassady&#x27;s photos were published; Boyle is still looking for María and her children; and that El Salvador continues to receive American military aid.

==Production==
Oliver Stone had originally intended to film &quot;Salvador&quot; directly within El Salvador itself. Having been disappointed with the lack of commercial success for his previous two films &quot;Seizure&quot; and &quot;The Hand&quot;, and with a newborn son to raise, Stone was contemplating ideas when a chance meeting with Richard Boyle, whom he considered an eccentric kindred spirit, inspired him to collaborate with Boyle and create &quot;Salvador&quot;. Stone himself was a Vietnam War veteran and frustrated with the war itself, thus allowing him to channel his political disdain for war into the story and characters of the film. The personalities of Richard Boyle and sidekick Doctor Rock were exaggerated for dramatic purposes, with Boyle being portrayed as obnoxious, arrogant, perverted, selfish and jaded, and Doctor Rock being portrayed as unemployed, overweight and neurotic. In reality the real-life Richard Boyle was a professor and published author who suffered from addiction issues, and the real-life Doctor Rock was a columnist, disc jockey for multiple San Francisco-based stations, an advocate for legalizing marijuana, and a collector of music memorabilia. Vulgarity and raunchy language were also exaggerated. During production a lawsuit arose, started by disc jockey Eric &quot;Dr. Rock&quot; Isralow, who sued Oliver Stone and Hemdale for breach of contract, arguing that he was denied a promised acting role in &quot;Salvador&quot;, as well as a job as the film&#x27;s music consultant. According to a 4 Feb 1988 DV article, Isralow claimed the filmmakers did not have permission to use his personality name, &quot;Dr. Rock&quot;, which he used when working as a disc jockey. In credits for the film, the character is listed as &quot;Doctor Rock&quot; instead. The outcome of the case is unknown and was never released publicly. Another legal case arose when Patsa Producciones and Banoro Bank filed a $13 million lawsuit against John Daly and Hemdale, alleging that the studio neglected to share profits from its distribution deal, and failed to make payments on its $3.5 million loan. Eleven days later, a 30 Sep 1986 DV column announced that the case was dismissed by a U.S. District Court Judge in California.

Due to safety and security concerns, with El Salvador still being in a state of conflict, Stone and Boyle elected to film &quot;Salvador&quot; in Mexico. Much of the film is fictional and heavily exaggerated, but Stone and Boyle often found themselves in direct connection with the source material; in March 1985, friend and government contact for the &quot;Salvador&quot; film, Lt. Col. Ricardo Cienfuegos, was assassinated by guerillas, and Stone made mention of this upset in his production notes, writing that he believed the country was entering into &quot;a new period... when the hardline Marxist element decided to engage in urban terrorism.&quot; The finished film was dedicated to &quot;Dad 1910-1985&quot; (Stone&#x27;s father, fellow actor and stockbroker Louis Stone).

==Release==
The film was released in the United States on March 5, 1986. In the Philippines, the film was released by Pioneer Films as Guns, Goons, Gold on March 26, 1992.

===Box office===
The film was not successful at the box office, grossing a total of $1,500,000 in the United States.

===Critical response===
As of September 2022, &quot;Salvador&quot; holds a rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews with an average score of 7.7/10 and the consensus: &quot;Despite its somewhat disjointed narrative, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Salvador&quot; is a vivid and powerful political drama that sets an early tone for the director&#x27;s similarly provocative future projects.&quot;

&quot;Salvador&quot; was popular among critics. Roger Ebert, a film critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the movie three stars out of four, and wrote: &quot;The movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, and it is not happy about the chaos that we are helping to subsidize. But basically it&#x27;s a character study — a portrait of a couple of burned-out free-lancers trying to keep their heads above water.&quot;

Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an unfavorable review, arguing that while &quot;as an adventure film, [it] has plenty of speed, grit and grime&quot;, it depicts &quot;improbable people doing implausible things&quot; and in some cases deviates from reality &quot;for the sake of heightening the drama and hammering in the political point&quot;. He also compared it to the work of Constantin Costa-Gavras, cinematically as well as politically.

Alex von Tunzelmann in &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s cartoonish characters and the mix of facts and fiction; for example, given that Boyle did not try to enter the US with Maria, and that no real reporter existed like Cassady whose photos Boyle published.
===Accolades===
The film garnered two Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (James Woods) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen at the 59th Academy Awards ceremony.

<text>Landscape Arch is a natural arch in Arches National Park, Utah, United States. It is among the longest natural rock arches in the world.

==Description==
The arch is among many in the Devils Garden area in the north of the park. Landscape Arch was named by Frank Beckwith who explored the area in the winter of 1933–1934 as the leader of an Arches National Monument scientific expedition. The arch can be reached by a graded gravel trail.

The Natural Arch and Bridge Society (NABS) considers Landscape Arch the fifth longest natural arch in the world, after four arches in China. In 2004, the span of Landscape Arch was measured at , ±, with a height of 77.5 ft (23.6 m). NABS measured the span of the slightly shorter Kolob Arch in Zion National Park at in 2006.

The most recent recorded rockfall events occurred in the 1990s when one large slab fell in 1991 and then two additional large rockfalls occurred in 1995. Since the rockfalls, the trail beneath the arch has been closed.

<text>Dark Eyes ( ; a transcription of ) is a 1987 Italian and Soviet romantic comedy-drama film directed by Nikita Mikhalkov. Set in Italy and Russia in the years before the First World War, it tells the story of a married Italian man who falls in love with a married Russian woman. Starring Marcello Mastroianni and Yelena Safonova, it received positive reviews from critics. The title of the film refers to a popular Russian song of the same name written by Yevhen Hrebinka in 1843.

== Plot ==
Romano is sitting at a table in the empty restaurant aboard an Italian ship, having a drink. When Pavel, a middle-aged Russian on his honeymoon cruise, enters the room, the two men strike up a conversation. Romano mentions that he once travelled to Russia because of a woman, and an intrigued Pavel asks to hear his story.

Born from a poor family, Romano graduated as an architect but he never had a chance to practice his profession following his marriage to a very wealthy woman called Elisa, who is busy running a bank she has just inherited. With little to do, Romano takes a solitary holiday at an expensive spa. There he meets Anna, a Russian woman vacationing on her own, who tells him about her poor background and her marriage to a rich man for security. After one night together, Anna leaves Romano a farewell letter and travels back to Russia.

Having decided that he wants to spend his life with her, Romano, on pretence of exploring business opportunities, travells to Russia to Anna&#x27;s remote town. While Anna&#x27;s husband is busy hosting a reception for a distinguished foreign guest, Romano follows Anna around and manages to secretly meet with her in an henhouse. Romano promises that if she will wait for him, he will travel to Italy and separate from his wife. 

Once back to Italy, he discovers that his Elisa&#x27;s bank had collapsed and bailiffs have put her palatial house up for sale. Elisa welcomes Romano holding the letter he has received from Anna, and asks him if he has a lover in Russia. Romano denies it, and the two somehow reconcile. Later Elisa unexpectedly inherits a legacy and as such the couple is able to resume their opulent lifestyle.

After hearing Romano&#x27;s story, Pavel mentions that his wife too has left a very unhappy marriage and how it took him a long time to persuade her to remarry. The conversation is abruptly interrupted by the ship&#x27;s cook, who comes in and tells Romano to start laying the tables for lunch. Pavel, having realized that Romano is employed on the ship, excuses himself and goes to look for his wife, who turns out to be Anna.

== Production ==

<text>Ironweed is a 1983 novel by American author William Kennedy. &quot;Ironweed&quot; received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and is the third book in Kennedy&#x27;s Albany Cycle. It is included in the Western Canon of the critic Harold Bloom. The novel was adapted into a 1987 film of the same name.

==Plot summary==
Set during the Great Depression, &quot;Ironweed&quot; tells the story of a bum named Francis Phelan. Phelan is a native of Albany, New York who left his family after accidentally killing his infant son. The novel focuses on Phelan&#x27;s return (after being gone twenty-two years) to Albany over the triduum of All Hallows Eve, All Saints&#x27; Day, and All Souls&#x27; Day. Moreover, a surreal element is added to the narrative, as Phelan sees and tries to interact with dead people from his troubled past. The novel features characters that are present in some of Kennedy&#x27;s other Albany Cycle books.

==Structure==
The structure of the novel resembles the structure of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The novel&#x27;s epigraph is a quotation from &quot;Purgatorio&quot;:To course o’er better waters&lt;br&gt;now hoists sail the little bark of my wit,&lt;br&gt;
leaving behind her a sea so cruel.

==Critical response==
&quot;Ironweed&quot; received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. It won Kennedy a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle Award.

==Adaptations==
Kennedy wrote the screenplay for the 1987 film version of &quot;Ironweed&quot;, which was directed by Héctor Babenco and starred Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. Major portions of the film were shot on location in Albany. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: The Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Nicholson) and the Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Streep).

<text>Individual rights, also known as natural rights, are rights held by individuals by virtue of being human. Some theists believe individual rights are bestowed by God. An individual right is a moral claim to freedom of action.

Group rights, also known as collective rights, are rights held by a group as a whole rather than individually by its members. In contrast, individual rights are rights held by individual people; even if they are group-differentiated, which most rights are, they remain individual rights if the right-holders are the individuals themselves.

Individual rights and group rights are often incompatible. An appeal to group rights is often used to promote violation of individual rights. Historically, group rights have been used both to infringe upon and to facilitate individual rights, and the concept remains controversial.

==Organizational group rights==
Besides the rights of groups based upon the immutable characteristics of their individual members, other group rights exercised and enshrined in law at different levels including those held by organizational persons, including nation-states, trade unions, corporations, trade associations, chambers of commerce, specific ethnic groups, and political parties. Such organizations are accorded rights that are particular to their specifically stated functions and their capacities to speak on behalf of their members, i.e. the capacity of the corporation to speak to the government on behalf of all individual customers or employees or the capacity of the trade union to negotiate for benefits with employers on behalf of all workers in a company.

==Philosophies==

In the political views of classical liberals and some right-libertarians, the role of the government is solely to identify, protect, and enforce the natural rights of the individual while attempting to assure just remedies for transgressions. Liberal governments that respect individual rights often provide for systemic controls that protect individual rights such as a system of due process in criminal justice. Certain collective rights, for example, the right of &quot;self-determination of &quot;peoples,&quot;&quot; enshrined in Chapter I Article I of the United Nations Charter, enable the establishment to assert these individual rights. If &quot;people&quot; are unable to determine their collective future, they are certainly unable to assert or ensure their individual rights, future and freedoms. Critics suggest that both are necessarily connected and intertwined, rejecting the assertion that they exist in a mutually exclusive relationship.

Adam Smith, in 1776 in his book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, describes the right of each successive generation, as a group, collectively, to the earth and all the earth possesses. The United States Declaration of Independence states several group, or collective, rights of the people as well as the states, for example the Right of the People: &quot;whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it&quot; and the right of the States: &quot;... as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.&quot;

Dutch legal philosopher Hugo Krabbe (1908) outlined the difference between the community and individual perspectives:
The Soviet Union argued in line with Marxism–Leninism that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights over-prioritized individual rights over group rights.

<doc id="168593" wikidata="Q741878" url="?curid=168593" title="Good Morning, Vietnam">
<text>Good Morning, Vietnam is a 1987 American war comedy film written by Mitch Markowitz and directed by Barry Levinson. Set in Saigon in 1965, during the Vietnam War, the film stars Robin Williams as an Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) DJ who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his &quot;irreverent tendency&quot;. The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS DJ Adrian Cronauer.

Most of Williams&#x27;s performances portraying Cronauer&#x27;s radio broadcasts were improvisations. The film was released by Buena Vista Pictures (under its Touchstone Pictures banner) to critical and commercial success; for his work in the film, Williams won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In 2000, the film ranked number 100 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Laughs&quot; list, containing 100 movies considered the funniest in American cinema.

==Plot==
In 1965, Airman First Class Adrian Cronauer arrives in Saigon to work as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Service. Private Edward Garlick takes him to the radio station, where his attitude and demeanor contrast sharply with those of many staff members. Cronauer&#x27;s show starts with his signature, &quot;Good morning, Vietnam!&quot;, and consists of reading strictly censored news and irreverent humor segments, mixed with rock and roll music, which is frowned on by his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson. Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines with humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor and the other DJs quickly grow to like Cronauer and his eccentric brand of comedy.

Cronauer follows Trinh, a Vietnamese girl, to an English class. After bribing the teacher to let him take over, Cronauer instructs the students in American slang and profanity. When the class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh, but is stopped by her brother, Tuan. Realizing the futility of pursuing her, Cronauer befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah&#x27;s, a local G.I. bar. Two racist soldiers, angered at Tuan&#x27;s presence, initiate a confrontation that escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for the incident, although his broadcasts continue as normal, gaining popularity from many listeners, in spite of Dickerson&#x27;s and Hauk&#x27;s dislike.

One afternoon, while relaxing in Jimmy Wah&#x27;s, Cronauer is pulled outside by Tuan, saying that Trinh wants to see him. Moments later, the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb. Dickerson declares the news censored, but Cronauer locks himself in the studio and reports it anyway, to Dickerson&#x27;s outrage. Dickerson cuts off the broadcast, and Cronauer is suspended, to the delight of Hauk and Dickerson. Hauk takes over the show, but his poor attempts at humor and choices of polka music lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be reinstated.

Demoralized, Cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing Trinh, only to be repeatedly rebuffed by her. At the radio station, Taylor intervenes, ordering Hauk to reinstate Cronauer, but he refuses to go back to work. Garlick and Cronauer&#x27;s vehicle is stopped in a congested street, amid a convoy of soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division heading for Nha Trang, where Garlick persuades him to do an impromptu &quot;broadcast&quot; before they go off to fight. The soldiers&#x27; appreciation reminds Cronauer why his job is important, and he returns to work.

Dickerson seizes an opportunity to be permanently rid of Cronauer by approving his request to interview soldiers in the field, and routing him through the Viet Cong-controlled highway to An Lộc. Cronauer and Garlick&#x27;s Jeep hits a mine, and they are forced to hide from VC patrols. In Saigon, Tuan learns of the trip after Cronauer fails to show up for English class, and steals a van to go after them. After he finds them, the van breaks down, and they flag down a Marine helicopter to take them back to the city.

Back at the base, Dickerson reveals to Cronauer that Tuan is a VC operative and the one responsible for the bombing at Jimmy Wah’s; Dickerson has arranged for Cronauer’s redeployment and honorable discharge. Taylor regretfully supports the decision, knowing the risk Cronauer’s friendship with Tuan would have on the Army’s reputation; however, aware that Dickerson’s actions were purely self-serving out of dislike for Cronauer, Taylor informs Dickerson that he is being transferred to Guam.

Cronauer chases down Tuan, decrying his actions against American soldiers. Emerging from the shadows, Tuan retorts that the U.S. Army devastated his village, thereby making the United States his enemy, but before disappearing again, he comments that he still chose to save Cronauer&#x27;s life at An Lộc, implying that he valued their friendship. On his way to the Tan Son Nhut Air Base with Garlick under military police escort, Cronauer sets up a quick softball game for the students in his English class, and says goodbye to Trinh. He gives a taped farewell message to Garlick and boards the plane; Garlick — taking Cronauer&#x27;s place as DJ the next morning — plays the tape on the air. It begins with Cronauer exclaiming, &quot;Goodbye, Vietnam!&quot;.

==Cast==

==Production==
The film was made on a budget of $13 million. Robin Williams was paid &quot;less than $2 million&quot;, plus gross participation points.

In 1979, Adrian Cronauer pitched a sitcom based on his experiences as an AFRS DJ. Although one of the most popular television programs of the era was the Korean War period piece, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, the networks were not interested, because they did not see war as comedy material. Cronauer revamped his sitcom into a script for a TV movie of the week, which eventually got the attention of Robin Williams. Very little of Cronauer&#x27;s original treatment remained after writer Mitch Markowitz was brought in.

Commenting on the accuracy of the film, the real-life Cronauer commented, &quot;I&#x27;m very happy with it. Of course, it was never intended to be an accurate point-by-point biography. It was intended as a piece of entertainment, and (Williams) was playing a character named Adrian Cronauer who shared a lot of my experiences. But actually, he was playing Robin Williams.&quot;

Williams stated that his portrayal of Cronauer in the film was only about 5% character, 95% himself. Commenting on his portrayal in the film, Cronauer said, &quot;Anybody who has been in the military will tell you that if I did half the things in that movie, I&#x27;d still be in Leavenworth right now. A lot of Hollywood imagination went into the movie. I was a disc jockey in Vietnam and I did teach English in my spare time. I was not thrown out of Vietnam; I stayed for my full one-year tour and I was honorably discharged.&quot;

None of the people in the film are based on actual people who Cronauer met, although he described them as stereotypes of military personnel who existed at the time. For the scenes in which Cronauer teaches his class to swear and use &quot;street slang&quot;, his pursuit of a Vietnamese woman, and his Jeep being blown up in the jungle, among others, are constructs for the plot and never happened to Cronauer. He did, however, witness the bombing of a restaurant that he had only recently left, and clash with Army censors when prevented from reporting it.

According to Cronauer, he and Williams were forbidden by Barry Levinson to meet each other because Levinson &quot;was afraid that if Robin and I met, that Robin would somehow start to do an unconscious imitation of me, which would change his characterization&quot;. Williams and Cronauer eventually met at the film&#x27;s New York premiere.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; a score of 90%, based on reviews from 48 critics, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;A well-calibrated blend of manic comedy and poignant drama, &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; offers a captivating look at a wide range of Robin Williams&#x27; cinematic gifts.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67%, based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of A−, on a scale of A+ to F.
&quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; was one of the most successful films of the year, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1987.

The film received acclaim from film critics. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; of the TV review show, &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;, awarded the film &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot;, with Ebert giving the film four stars out of four.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; called the film &quot;the best military comedy since &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;&quot;, and named it one of the best films of the year.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a cinematic &quot;tour de force&quot;, and described Williams&#x27;s performance as &quot;the work of an accomplished actor&quot;. Much of the acclaim went to Williams&#x27;s performance, a role that earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.

The film was not without detractors. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a negative review. While praising Williams, he felt that the film was &quot;compulsory and condescending&quot;, and that the film was merely &quot;a Robin Williams concert movie welded clumsily onto the plot from an old Danny Kaye picture&quot;.

===Accolades===
* AMC named &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; one of the 20 greatest war movies of all time.
* In 2000, American Film Institute included the film in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs (#100).

==Canceled sequel==
In 1992, Mark Frost wrote a sequel screenplay, &quot;Good Morning, Chicago&quot;. The film would have featured Williams, reprising his role as Cronauer, as a journalist at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The project was eventually scrapped, due to disagreements between Williams, Levinson and Disney, over the film&#x27;s direction.

<text>Balanced Rock is one of the most popular features of Arches National Park, situated in Grand County, Utah, United States. Balanced Rock is located next to the park&#x27;s main road, at about 9.2 miles (14.8 km) from the park entrance. It is one of only a few prominent features clearly visible from the road.
The total height of Balanced Rock is 128 feet (39 m), with the balancing rock rising 55 feet (16.75 m) above the base. This rock is the largest of its kind in the park, weighing approximately 3,577 tons. 
==Geology==
Balanced Rock is composed of the hard Slick Rock Member of the Entrada Sandstone formation. It sits on a pedestal of the softer Dewey Bridge Member, which erodes at a faster rate. As a result, it will eventually collapse. Balanced Rock had a smaller sibling named &quot;Chip Off the Old Block&quot; that collapsed in the winter of 1975–76 as a result of the same forces.

==Access==
The formation can be accessed by a 1/4 mile (400 meter) paved loop trail from the main road leading to the base of the formation.
==In popular culture==
Balanced Rock can be seen in the opening of the 1989 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;.

<doc id="168601" wikidata="Q338389" url="?curid=168601" title="Rodney King">
<text>Rodney Glen King (April 2, 1965June 17, 2012) was an African-American man who was a victim of police brutality. On March 3, 1991, he was severely beaten by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) during his arrest after a high speed pursuit for driving while intoxicated on the I-210. An uninvolved resident, George Holliday, saw and filmed the incident from his nearby balcony and sent the footage, which showed King on the ground being beaten after initially evading arrest, to local news station KTLA. The incident was covered by news media around the world and caused a public uproar.

At a press conference, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates announced that the four officers involved would be disciplined for use of excessive force and that three would face criminal charges. The LAPD initially charged King with &quot;felony evading&quot;, but later dropped the charge. On his release, King spoke to reporters from his wheelchair, with his injuries evident: a broken right leg in a cast, his face badly cut and swollen, bruises on his body, and a burn area to his chest where he had been jolted with a stun gun. King described how he had knelt, spread his hands out, then slowly tried to move so as not to make any &quot;stupid moves&quot;, before being hit across the face by a billy club, and shocked with a stun gun. King also said he was scared for his life when the officers drew their guns on him.

Four officers were eventually tried on charges of use of excessive force. Of these, three were acquitted; the jury failed to reach a verdict on one charge for the fourth. Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots started, sparked by outrage among racial minorities over the trial&#x27;s verdict and related, longstanding social issues, overlaid with tensions between the African American and Korean American communities. The rioting lasted six days and killed 63 people, with 2,383 more injured; it ended only after the California Army National Guard, the Army, and the Marine Corps provided reinforcements to re-establish control. King advocated for a peaceful end to the conflict.

The federal government prosecuted a separate civil rights case, obtaining grand jury indictments of the four officers for violations of King&#x27;s civil rights. Their trial in a federal district court ended in April 1993, with two of the officers being found guilty and sentenced to serve prison terms. The other two were acquitted of the charges. In a separate civil lawsuit in 1994, a jury found the City of Los Angeles liable and awarded King $3.8 million in damages.

==Early life==
King was born in Sacramento, California, in 1965, the son of Ronald and Odessa King. He and his four siblings grew up in Altadena, California. King attended John Muir High School and often talked about being inspired by his social science teacher, Robert E. Jones. King&#x27;s father died in 1984 at the age of 42.

On November 3, 1989, King robbed a store in Monterey Park, California. He threatened the Korean store owner with an iron bar. King then hit the store owner with a pole before fleeing the scene. King stole two hundred dollars in cash during the robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. He was released on December 27, 1990, after serving one year in prison.

==Marriage and family==
King had a daughter with his girlfriend, Carmen Simpson. He later married Denetta Lyles (cousin of hate crime victim James Byrd Jr. and also cousin of rapper Mack 10) and had a daughter. King and Lyles eventually divorced. He later remarried and had a daughter with Crystal Waters. This marriage also ended in divorce.

==1991 Police assault in Los Angeles==

Early in the morning of Sunday, March 3, 1991, King, with his friends Bryant Allen and Freddie Helms, were driving a 1987 Hyundai Excel west on the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. The three had spent the night watching basketball and drinking at a friend&#x27;s house in Los Angeles. At 12:30 a.m., officers Tim and Melanie Singer, husband and wife members of the California Highway Patrol, noticed King&#x27;s car speeding on the freeway. They pursued King with lights and sirens, and the pursuit reached 117 mph (188 km/h), while King refused to pull over. King would later say he fled the police hoping to avoid a driving under the influence charge and the parole violation that could follow.

King left the freeway near the Hansen Dam Recreation Area and the pursuit continued through residential streets at speeds ranging from , and through at least one red light. By this point, several police cars and a police helicopter had joined in the pursuit. After approximately , officers cornered King in his car. The first five Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers to arrive were Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseno and Rolando Solano.

===Beating===
Officer Tim Singer ordered King and his two passengers to exit the vehicle and to lie face down on the ground. Allen claims that he was manhandled, kicked, stomped, taunted and threatened. Helms was hit on the head while lying on the ground; he was treated for a laceration on the top of his head. His bloody baseball cap was turned over to police. King remained in the car. When he emerged, King was reported to have giggled, to have patted the ground and waved to the police helicopter overhead. King grabbed his buttocks, which Officer Melanie Singer took to mean King was reaching for a weapon, though he was later found to be unarmed. She drew her pistol and pointed it at King, ordering him to lie on the ground. Singer approached, gun drawn, preparing to arrest him. At this point, Koon, the ranking officer at the scene, told Singer that the LAPD was taking command and ordered all officers to holster their weapons.

According to the official report, LAPD Sergeant Koon ordered the four other LAPD officers at the scene—Briseno, Powell, Solano and Wind—to subdue and handcuff King using a technique called a &quot;swarm&quot;, where multiple officers grab a suspect with empty hands, to overcome potential resistance quickly. The four officers claim King resisted attempts to restrain him when he stood up to remove Officers Powell and Briseno from his back. Both King and witnesses dispute that claim. The officers would also testify later that they believed King was under the influence of phencyclidine (PCP), although King&#x27;s toxicology tested negative for the drug.

At this point, Holliday&#x27;s video recording shows King on the ground after being tasered by Koon. He rises and rushes toward Powell—as argued in court, either to attack Powell or to flee—and King and Powell collided in a rush. Taser wire can be seen on King&#x27;s body. Officer Powell strikes King with his baton, and King is knocked to the ground. Powell strikes King several more times with his baton. Briseno moves in, attempting to stop Powell from striking again, and Powell stands back. Koon reportedly said, &quot;Stop! Stop! That&#x27;s enough! That&#x27;s enough!&quot; King rises again, to his knees; Powell and Wind are seen hitting King with their batons.

Koon acknowledged ordering the continued use of batons, directing Powell and Wind to strike King with &quot;power strokes&quot;. According to Koon, Powell and Wind used &quot;bursts of power strokes, then backed off&quot;. The officers beat King. In the videotape, King continues to try to stand again. Koon orders the officers to &quot;hit his joints, hit the wrists, hit his elbows, hit his knees, hit his ankles&quot;. Officers Wind, Briseno, and Powell attempted numerous baton strikes on King, resulting in some misses but with 33 blows hitting King, plus seven kicks. The officers again &quot;swarm&quot; King, but this time a total of eight officers are involved in the swarm. King is placed in handcuffs and cord cuffs, restraining his arms and legs. King is dragged on his abdomen to the side of the road to await the arrival of emergency medical rescue.

===Holliday&#x27;s video===

Plumbing salesman and amateur videographer George Holliday&#x27;s videotape of the beating was shot on his camcorder from his apartment near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Osborne Street in Lake View Terrace. Two days later (March 5), Holliday called LAPD headquarters at Parker Center to let the police department know that he had a videotape of the incident. Still, he could not find anyone interested in seeing the video. He went to KTLA, a local television station, with his recording. KTLA&#x27;s Warren Wilson was the first reporter to take on the story, interviewing King inside his jail ward.
Holliday, whose video camera was in another part of his residence, was unable to retrieve it until the officers were already in the act of beating King. The footage as a whole became an instant media sensation. Portions were aired numerous times, and it &quot;turned what would otherwise have been a violent, but soon forgotten, encounter between the Los Angeles police and an uncooperative suspect into one of the most widely watched and discussed incidents of its kind&quot;.

Several &quot;copwatch&quot; organizations subsequently were started throughout the United States to safeguard against police abuse, including an umbrella group, October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality. In 1992, these clips were added in the opening credits of &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. On September 19, 2021, Holliday died from complications of COVID-19.

==Post-arrest events==

=== Aftermath ===
King was taken to Pacifica Hospital after his arrest, where he was found to have suffered a fractured facial bone, a broken right ankle, and multiple bruises and lacerations. In a negligence claim filed with the city, King alleged he had suffered &quot;11 skull fractures, permanent brain damage, broken [bones and teeth], kidney failure [and] emotional and physical trauma.&quot; Blood and urine samples were taken from King five hours after his arrest. At this time, King&#x27;s blood alcohol content was measured to be 0.075%. This indicated that King was intoxicated during the initial arrest as defined by California law, but with the samples taken after a five hour delay, were then below the legal limit of 0.08%. The tests also showed traces of marijuana (26 ng/ml). Pacifica Hospital nurses reported that the officers who accompanied King (including Wind) openly joked and bragged about the number of times they had hit King. Officers obtained King&#x27;s identification from his clothes pockets at that time. King later sued the city for damages, and a jury awarded him $3.8 million, as well as $1.7 million in attorney&#x27;s fees. The city did not pursue charges against King for driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. District Attorney Ira Reiner believed there was insufficient evidence for prosecution. His successor Gil Garcetti thought that by December 1992, too much time had passed to charge King with evading arrest; he also noted that the statute of limitations on drunk driving had passed.

===Charges against police officers and trial===
At a press conference, announcing the four officers involved would be disciplined, and three would face criminal charges, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates said: &quot;We believe the officers used excessive force taking him into custody. In our review, we find that officers struck him with batons between fifty-three and fifty-six times.&quot; The LAPD initially charged King with &quot;felony evading&quot;, but later dropped the charge.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney subsequently charged four police officers, including one sergeant, with assault and use of excessive force. Due to the extensive media coverage of the arrest, the trial received a change of venue from Los Angeles County to Simi Valley in neighboring Ventura County. The jury was composed of ten white jurors, one biracial male, one Latino, and one Asian American. The prosecutor, Terry L. White, was black. Mr. White was a Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County with eight years of experience. The District Attorney&#x27;s office denied that race was taken into account when selecting the prosecutor, and multiple trial attorneys from Los Angeles agreed that race likely played no role.

On April 29, 1992, the seventh day of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force. The jury could not agree on a verdict for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force. The verdicts were based in part on the first three seconds of a blurry, 13-second segment of the videotape that, according to journalist Lou Cannon, had not been aired by television news stations in their broadcasts.

The first two seconds of videotape, contrary to the claims made by the accused officers, show King attempting to flee past Laurence Powell. During the next one minute and 19 seconds, King is beaten continuously by the officers. The officers testified that they tried to physically restrain King before the starting point of the videotape, but King was able to throw them off physically.

Afterward, the prosecution suggested that the jurors may have acquitted the officers because of becoming desensitized to the violence of the beating, as the defense played the videotape repeatedly in slow motion, breaking it down until its emotional impact was lost.

Outside the Simi Valley courthouse where the acquittals were delivered, county sheriff&#x27;s deputies protected Stacey Koon from angry protesters on the way to his car. Movie director John Singleton, who was in the crowd at the courthouse, predicted, &quot;By having this verdict, what these people did, they lit the fuse to a bomb.&quot;

Following a hung jury in Officer Laurence Powell&#x27;s initial state court trial for assault, a retrial was postponed by Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg, pending the federal grand jury trial of Powell for violating King&#x27;s civil rights. Judge Weisberg stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s in anyone&#x27;s best interest, to have three trials on the same subject matter involving the same defendant.&quot; Subsequent to his trial by the federal grand jury, the assault charge against Officer Laurence Powell was dismissed in state court.

=== Christopher Commission ===
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley created the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, also known as the Christopher Commission, in April 1991. Led by attorney Warren Christopher, it was created to conduct &quot;a full and fair examination of the structure and operation of the LAPD&quot;, including its recruitment and training practices, internal disciplinary system, and citizen complaint system.

==Los Angeles riots and the aftermath==

Though few people at first considered race an essential factor in the case, including Rodney King&#x27;s attorney, Steven Lerman, the Holliday videotape was at the time stirring deep resentment among black people in Los Angeles and other major cities in the United States, where they had often complained of police abuse against their communities. The officers&#x27; jury consisted of Ventura County residents: ten white, one mestizo or indigenous, one Asian. Lead prosecutor Terry White was black. On April 29, 1992, the jury acquitted three of the officers but could not agree on one of the charges against Powell.

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said, &quot;The jury&#x27;s verdict will not blind us to what we saw on that videotape. The men who beat Rodney King do not deserve to wear the uniform of the LAPD.&quot; President George H. W. Bush said, &quot;Viewed from outside the trial, it was hard to understand how the verdict could possibly square with the video. Those civil rights leaders with whom I met were stunned. And so was I, and so was Barbara, and so were my kids.&quot;

Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots began, lasting six days. African-Americans were outraged by the verdicts and began rioting in the streets, by the time law enforcement, the California Army National Guard, the United States Army, and the United States Marine Corps restored order, the riots had resulted in 63 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. Smaller riots occurred in other U.S. cities such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle, and as far east as Atlanta and New York City. A civil disturbance occurred on Yonge Street in Toronto, Canada when Canadians gathered to protest the acquittal in Los Angeles as well as a local police killing of a Black man in Toronto two days prior.

During the riots, on May 1, 1992, King made a television appearance pleading for an end to the riots:

I just want to say – you know – can we, can we all get along? Can we, can we get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids? And ... I mean we&#x27;ve got enough smog in Los Angeles let alone to deal with setting these fires and things ... It&#x27;s just not right. It&#x27;s not right, and it&#x27;s not going to change anything. We&#x27;ll get our justice. They&#x27;ve won the battle, but they haven&#x27;t won the war. We&#x27;ll get our day in court, and that&#x27;s all we want. And, just, uh, I love – I&#x27;m neutral. I love every – I love people of color. I&#x27;m not like they&#x27;re making me out to be. We&#x27;ve got to quit. We&#x27;ve got to quit; I mean, after all, I could understand the first – upset for the first two hours after the verdict, but to go on, to keep going on like this and to see the security guard shot on the ground – it&#x27;s just not right. It&#x27;s just not right, because those people will never go home to their families again. And uh, I mean, please, we can, we can get along here. We all can get along. We just gotta. We gotta. I mean, we&#x27;re all stuck here for a while. Let&#x27;s, you know, let&#x27;s try to work it out. Let&#x27;s try to beat it, you know. Let&#x27;s try to work it out.

The widely quoted line has been often paraphrased as, &quot;Can we all &quot;just&quot; get along?&quot; or &quot;&quot;Can&#x27;t&quot; we all just get along?&quot;

==Federal civil rights trial of officers==
After the acquittals and the riots, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) sought indictments of the police officers for violations of King&#x27;s civil rights. On May 7, federal prosecutors began presenting evidence to the federal grand jury in Los Angeles. On August 4, the grand jury returned indictments against the three officers for &quot;willfully and intentionally using unreasonable force&quot; and against Sergeant Koon for &quot;willfully permitting and failing to take action to stop the unlawful assault&quot; on King. Based on these indictments, a trial of the four officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California began on February 25, 1993.

The federal trial focused more on the incident. On March 9 of the 1993 trial, King took the witness stand and described to the jury the events as he remembered them. The jury found Officer Laurence Powell and Sergeant Stacey Koon guilty, and they were subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison. Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno were acquitted of all charges, but both were soon dismissed by the LAPD for their roles in the beating.

During the three-hour sentencing hearing, US District Judge John G. Davies accepted much of the defense version of the beating. He strongly criticized King, who, he said, provoked the officers&#x27; initial actions. Davies said that only the final six or so baton blows by Powell were unlawful. The first 55 seconds of the videotaped portion of the incident, during which the vast majority of the blows were delivered, was within the law because the officers were attempting to subdue a suspect who was resisting efforts to take him into custody.

Davies found that King&#x27;s provocative behavior began with his &quot;remarkable consumption of alcoholic beverage&quot; and continued through a high-speed chase, refusal to submit to police orders and an aggressive charge toward Powell. Davies made several findings in support of the officers&#x27; version of events. He concluded that Officer Powell never intentionally struck King in the head, and &quot;Powell&#x27;s baton blow that broke King&#x27;s leg was not illegal because King was still resisting and rolling around on the ground, and breaking bones in resistant suspects is permissible under police policy.&quot;

Mitigation cited by the judge in determining the length of the prison sentence included the suffering the officers had undergone because of the extensive publicity their case had received, high legal bills that were still unpaid, the impending loss of their careers as police officers, their higher risks of abuse while in prison, and their undergoing two trials. The judge acknowledged that the two trials did not legally constitute double jeopardy, but raised &quot;the specter of unfairness&quot;.

These mitigations were critical to the validity of the sentences imposed because federal sentencing guidelines called for much longer prison terms in the range of 70 to 87 months. The low sentences were controversial and were appealed by the prosecution. In a 1994 ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected all the grounds cited by Judge Davies and extended the terms. The defense appealed the case to the US Supreme Court. Both Koon and Powell were released from prison while they appealed to the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling, having served their original 30-month sentences with time off for good behavior. On June 14, 1996, the high court partially reversed the lower court in a ruling, unanimous in its most important aspects, which gave a strong endorsement to judicial discretion, even under sentencing guidelines intended to produce uniformity.

==Later life==

Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered King $200,000 and a four-year college education funded by the city of Los Angeles. King refused and sued the city, and was subsequently awarded $3.8 million. Bryant Allen, one of the passengers in King&#x27;s car on the night of the incident, received $35,000 in his lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. The estate of Freddie Helms, the other passenger, settled for $20,000; Helms died in a car crash on June 29, 1991, age 20, in Pasadena. King invested a portion of his settlement in a record label, Straight Alta-Pazz Records, hoping to employ minority employees, but it went out of business. With help from a ghostwriter, he later wrote and published a memoir.

King was subject to further arrests and convictions for driving violations after the 1991 incident, as he struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. In May 1991, King was arrested on suspicion of having tried to run down an undercover vice officer in Hollywood, but no charges were filed. In 1992, he was arrested for injuring his wife, Crystal King. Crystal ultimately declined to file a complaint. On August 21, 1993, King crashed his car into a block wall in downtown Los Angeles. He was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, fined, and entered a rehabilitation program, after which he was placed on probation. In July 1995, King was arrested by Alhambra police after hitting Crystal with his car and knocking her to the ground during a fight. King had previously been arrested twice on suspicion of abusing her. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail after being convicted of hit and run.

On August 27, 2003, King was arrested again for speeding and running a red light while under the influence of alcohol. He failed to yield to police officers and slammed his vehicle into a house, breaking his pelvis. On November 29, 2007, while riding home on his bicycle, King was shot in the face, arms, and back with pellets from a shotgun. He reported that the attackers were a man and a woman who demanded his bicycle and shot King when he rode away. Police described the wounds as looking as if they came from birdshot.

In May 2008, King checked into the Pasadena Recovery Center in Pasadena, California, where he filmed as a cast member of Season 2 of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which premiered in October 2008. Dr. Drew Pinsky, who runs the facility, showed concern for King&#x27;s life and said he would die unless his addictions were treated. King also appeared on &quot;Sober House&quot;, a &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; spin-off focusing on a sober living environment. During his time on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; and &quot;Sober House&quot;, King worked on his addiction and what he said was lingering trauma of the beating. King and Pinsky physically retraced King&#x27;s path from the night of his beating, eventually reaching the spot where it happened, the site of the Children&#x27;s Museum of Los Angeles, which is now Discovery Cube Los Angeles.

In 2009, King and other &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; alumni appeared as panel speakers to a new group of addicts at the Pasadena Recovery Center, marking 11 months of sobriety for him. His appearance was aired in the third-season episode &quot;Triggers.&quot; King won a celebrity boxing match against Chester, Pennsylvania, police officer Simon Aouad on September 11, 2009, at the Ramada Philadelphia Airport in Essington.

On September 9, 2010, it was confirmed that King was going to marry Cynthia Kelley, who had been a juror in the civil suit he brought against the City of Los Angeles. On March 3, 2011, the 20th anniversary of the beating, the LAPD stopped King for driving erratically and issued him a citation for driving with an expired license. This arrest led to a February 2012 misdemeanor conviction for reckless driving.

The BBC quoted King commenting on his legacy. &quot;Some people feel like I&#x27;m some kind of hero. Others hate me. They say I deserved it. Other people, I can hear them mocking me for when I called for an end to the destruction like I&#x27;m a fool for believing in peace.&quot;

==Memoir==
In April 2012, King published his memoir, &quot;The Riot Within: My Journey from Rebellion to Redemption&quot;. Co-authored by Lawrence J. Spagnola, the book describes King&#x27;s turbulent youth as well as his personal account of the arrest, the trials, and the aftermath.

==Death==
On Father&#x27;s Day, June 17, 2012, King&#x27;s partner, Cynthia Kelley, found him dead underwater at the bottom of his swimming pool. King died 28 years to the day after his father, Ronald King, was found dead in his bathtub in 1984.

Police in Rialto received a 911 call from Kelley at about 5:25 a.m. PDT. Responding officers removed King from the pool and performed CPR on him. Still pulseless, King was then transferred to an advanced life support ambulance where paramedics attempted to revive him. King was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, California, and was pronounced dead on arrival at 6:11 a.m. at the age of 47. The Rialto Police Department began a standard drowning investigation and said there did not appear to be any foul play.

On August 23, 2012, King&#x27;s autopsy results were released, stating that he died of accidental drowning. The combination of alcohol, cocaine, and PCP found in his system were contributing factors, as were cardiomegaly and focal myocardial fibrosis. The conclusion of the report stated: &quot;The effects of the drugs and alcohol, combined with the subject&#x27;s heart condition, probably precipitated a cardiac arrhythmia, and the subject, incapacitated in the water, was unable to save himself.&quot;

Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy at King&#x27;s funeral. King is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

==Legacy==
King has become a symbol of police brutality, but his family remembers him as a &quot;human, not a symbol.&quot; King never advocated for hatred or violence against the police, pleading, &quot;Can we all get along?&quot; Since his death, his daughter, Lora King, has worked with the LAPD to build bridges between the police and the black community. She also started a nonprofit, the Rodney King Foundation, on behalf of King.

<doc id="168602" wikidata="Q611043" url="?curid=168602" title="Flashdance">
<text>Flashdance is a 1983 American romantic drama dance film directed by Adrian Lyne and starring Jennifer Beals as a passionate young dancer, Alex Owens, who aspires to become a professional ballerina, alongside Michael Nouri, who plays her boyfriend and the owner of the steel mill where she works by day in Pittsburgh. It was the first collaboration of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the presentation of some sequences in the style of music videos was an influence on other 1980s films including &quot;Footloose&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and &quot;Top Gun&quot;, Simpson and Bruckheimer&#x27;s most famous production. It was also one of Lyne&#x27;s first major film releases, building on television commercials. Alex&#x27;s elaborate dance sequences were shot using body doubles (Beals&#x27;s main double was the uncredited French actress Marine Jahan, while a breakdance move was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs).

The film opened to negative reviews by professional critics, including Roger Ebert, who panned it as &quot;great sound and flashdance, signifying nothing&quot; (and eventually placed it on his &quot;most hated&quot; list). It was a surprise box-office success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States. Its worldwide box-office gross exceeded $200 million. The soundtrack, compiled by Giorgio Moroder, spawned several hit songs, including &quot;Maniac&quot; (performed by Michael Sembello), and the Academy Award–winning &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot;, which was written for the film by Moroder, with lyrics by Keith Forsey and the singer Irene Cara. &quot;Flashdance&quot; is also often remembered for its film poster featuring Beals sporting a sweatshirt with a large neck hole (according to the actress, her look in the scene came about by accident after she simply cut a large hole at the top of one that had shrunk in the wash).

==Plot==

Alex Owens is an eighteen-year-old welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, who lives with her dog, Grunt, in a converted warehouse. She aspires to become a professional dancer, but has no formal dance training and works as a nightly cabaret performer at Mawby&#x27;s, a neighborhood bar and grill.

Lacking family, Alex bonds with her coworkers at Mawby&#x27;s, some of whom also aspire to greater artistic achievements. Jeanie, a waitress, is training to be a figure skater, while her boyfriend, short-order cook Richie, hopes to become a stand-up comic.

One night, Alex catches the eye of customer Nick Hurley, the owner of the steel mill where she works. After learning that she is one of his employees, he pursues her on the job, though Alex turns down his advances. Alex is also approached by Johnny C., who wants her to dance at his nearby strip club, Zanzibar.

After seeking counsel from her mentor, retired ballerina Hanna Long, Alex attempts to apply to the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. She becomes intimidated by the scope of the application process, which includes listing all prior dance experience and education, so she leaves without applying. Leaving Mawby&#x27;s one evening, Richie and Alex are assaulted by Johnny C. and his bodyguard, Cecil. Nick intervenes, and after following Alex home, the two begin a relationship.

In a skating competition, Jeanie falls twice during her performance and sits defeated on the ice before being helped away. Discouraged by her failure and the departure of Richie, who has decided to try his luck in Los Angeles, Jeanie begins dating Johnny C. and working as one of his strippers at Zanzibar. After finding out about Jeanie&#x27;s situation from Jake, the owner of Mawby&#x27;s, Alex finds her and drags her out of Zanzibar. Jeanie is angry, but she soon realizes her mistake.

After seeing Nick with a woman at the ballet one night, Alex throws a rock through a window of his house, only to discover that it was his ex-wife, whom he was meeting for a charity function. Alex and Nick reconcile, and she gains the courage to apply to the Conservatory. He uses his connections with the arts council to get Alex an audition, as she does not have formal dance training.

Upon discovering this, Alex is furious with Nick because she did not get the opportunity based on her own merit, so she decides not to go to the audition. After the sudden death of Hanna and seeing the results of others&#x27; failed dreams, Alex becomes despondent over her future, but following a conversation with another dancer at Mawby&#x27;s, who encourages her to persevere, Alex has a change of heart and goes through with the audition after all.

At the audition, Alex falters, but begins again and successfully completes a dance number composed of moves that she has studied and practiced, including breakdancing which she has seen on the streets of Pittsburgh. The board responds favorably, and she joyously emerges from the Conservatory to find Nick and Grunt waiting for her with a bouquet of roses.

==Production==

=== Development ===
In April 1980, Thomas Hedley sold the film idea for development to Casablanca, a Los Angeles production company, for $300,000 and 5% of the net, as reported in &quot;The Globe and Mail.&quot; Hedley based the concept on the lives of exotic dancers he had met while editor of &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine such as Gina Healey and Maureen Marder. Marder and Healey were paid $2,500 each for their life stories.

Hedley&#x27;s script was eventually sold to Peter Guber and Jon Peters for PolyGram Pictures, who took the script with them to Paramount Pictures. However, the latter studio had less confidence in the film and placed it into turnaround for two years. Development of the film resumed when Don Simpson, who believed the film could be successful, resigned from his executive post at Paramount Pictures to co-produce the film with Jerry Bruckheimer in their first collaboration. They got Paramount to greenlight the film by hiring Joe Eszterhas to rewrite Hedley&#x27;s script.

Adrian Lyne was not the first choice as director of &quot;Flashdance&quot;. David Cronenberg had turned down an offer to direct as he felt he would have destroyed the film, as had Brian De Palma, who instead chose to direct &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983). At the time, Lyne&#x27;s background was primarily in directing television commercials, such as his 1970s UK commercials for Brutus Jeans (which may conceivably be seen as anticipating the visuals and style of &quot;Flashdance&quot;). Lyne agreed to direct because he wanted to establish enough confidence from studios in his directorial skills to get his next film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986) approved. Executives at Paramount were unsure about the film&#x27;s potential and sold 25% of the rights prior to its release.

===Casting===
Three candidates, Jennifer Beals, Demi Moore, and Leslie Wing, were the finalists for the role of Alex Owens. Two different stories exist regarding how Beals was chosen. One states that then-Paramount president Michael Eisner asked women secretaries at the studio to select their favorite after viewing screen tests. The other: the film&#x27;s scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas claims that Eisner asked &quot;two hundred of the most macho men on the [Paramount] lot, Teamsters and gaffers and grips ... &#x27;I want to know which of these three young women you&#x27;d most want to fuck.&#x27;&quot;

The role of Nick Hurley was originally offered to Kiss founding member Gene Simmons, who turned it down because it would conflict with his &quot;demon&quot; image. Kevin Costner, a struggling actor at the time, came very close for the role of Nick Hurley, which went to Michael Nouri.

===Crew===
&quot;Flashdance&quot; was the first success of a number of filmmakers who became successful in the 1980s and beyond. The film was the first collaboration between Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who went on to produce &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984) and &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). Eszterhas received his second screen credit for &quot;Flashdance&quot;, while Lyne went on to direct &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986), &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), and &quot;Lolita&quot; (1997). Lynda Obst, who developed the original story outline, went on to produce &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987), &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993).

===Filming===

The film was shot between October 18, 1982 and December 30, 1982 in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.

The dimly lit cinematography and montage-style editing are due in part to the fact that most of Jennifer Beals&#x27; dancing in the film was performed by a body double. Her main dance double is the French actress Marine Jahan, while the breakdancing that Alex performs in the audition sequence at the end of the film was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs. The shot of Alex diving through the air in slow motion during the audition sequence was performed by Sharon Shapiro, who was a professional gymnast. The producers of the film stated they had made no secret of having used a double for Beals, and that Jahan&#x27;s name did not appear because Paramount Pictures shortened the closing credits. Marine Jahan was told that her involvement was hidden because &quot;they didn&#x27;t want to break the magic of the film&quot;.

&quot;Flashdance&quot; is often remembered for the sweatshirt with a large neck hole that Beals wore on the poster advertising the film. Beals said that the look of the sweatshirt came about by accident when it shrank in the wash and she cut out a large hole at the top so that she could wear it again.

==== Locations ====
Much of the film was shot in locations around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The opening sequence of scenes with Alex riding her bicycle starts in the Fineview neighborhood. The last scene of the sequence shows Alex riding east over the Smithfield Street Bridge, which is a continuity error. Alex&#x27;s apartment was located in the South Side neighborhood. When Alex goes to visit Hanna, she is seen riding one of the Duquesne Incline cable cars. Hanna&#x27;s apartment is located at 2100 Sidney Street at the southeast corner of South 21st Street.

The fictional Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory was filmed inside the lobby and in front of Carnegie Music Hall, a part of the Carnegie Museum of Art, located near the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

The interior of Alex&#x27;s apartment was filmed in Los Angeles at what was the Feit Electric Building on Los Angeles Street. Additionally, the set for Mawby&#x27;s was located in downtown Los Angeles. The ice skating rink scene on which Jeanie falls was filmed at Culver Ice Rink in Culver City, California.

==Music==
&quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; was performed by Irene Cara, who also sang the title song for the similar 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;. The music for &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; was composed by Giorgio Moroder, and the lyrics were written by Cara and Keith Forsey. The song won an Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as a Golden Globe and numerous other awards. It also reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1983. Despite the song&#x27;s title, the word &#x27;Flashdance&#x27; itself is not heard in the lyrics. The song is used in the opening title sequence of the film, and is the music Alex uses in her dance audition routine at the end of the film.

Another song used in the film, &quot;Maniac&quot;, was also nominated for an Academy Award. It was written by Michael Sembello and Dennis Matkosky. A popular urban legend holds that the song was originally written for the 1980 horror film &quot;Maniac&quot;, and that lyrics about a killer on the loose were rewritten so the song could be used in &quot;Flashdance&quot;. The legend is discredited in the special features of the film&#x27;s DVD release, which reveal that the song was written for the film, although only two complete lyrics (&quot;Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a maniac&quot;) were available when filming commenced. Like the title song, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1983.

Other songs in the film include &quot;Lady, Lady, Lady&quot;, performed by Joe Esposito, &quot;Imagination&quot; performed by Laura Branigan, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here Where the Heart Is&quot;, performed by Kim Carnes.

The soundtrack album of &quot;Flashdance&quot; sold 700,000 copies during its first two weeks on sale and has gone on to sell over six million copies in the U.S. alone. In 1984, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special.

==Release==
&quot;Flashdance&quot; was released in the United States on April 15, 1983. On April 14, 1983, the night before the general release of the film, a special benefit premiere of &quot;Flashdance&quot; was shown at the Warner Theater in Pittsburgh. It was the last film at the theater. Several months later it was torn down to make way for The Warner Centre, a retail and office complex.
===Home media===
&quot;Flashdance&quot; has been issued originally on VHS and Laserdisc with a Paramount Pictures DVD release on October 8, 2002 and a Special Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD in 2010.
It was first released on Blu-ray Disc on August 13, 2013 by Warner Bros. with seven special features including a 15-minute featurette, &quot;The History of &quot;Flashdance&quot;&quot;, a 9-minute featurette, &quot;The Look of &quot;Flashdance&quot;, &quot;Flashdance&quot;: The Choreography&quot; and a teaser and theatrical trailers.
The film was re-released on Blu-ray in the U.S. on May 19, 2020 by Paramount Presents with a new 4K remaster and packaging. It includes a new Filmmakers Focus interview with the director but excludes a few special features from the previous Blu-ray release.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;All style and very little substance, &quot;Flashdance&quot; boasts eye-catching dance sequences—and benefits from an appealing performance from Jennifer Beals—but its narrative is flat-footed&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 39% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert placed it on his list of &quot;Most Hated&quot; films, and in giving the film 1.5 out of 4 stars in his review, stated: &quot;Jennifer Beals shouldn&#x27;t feel bad. She is a natural talent, she is fresh and engaging here, and only needs to find an agent with a natural talent for turning down scripts&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert said &quot;If Flashdance had spent just a little more effort getting to know the heroine of its story, and a little less time trying to rip off &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, it might have been a much better film.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; compared the film to a series of music videos, &quot;Watching Flashdance is pretty much like looking at MTV for 96 minutes. Virtually plotless, exceedingly thin on characterization and sociologically laughable, pic at least lives up to its title by offering an anthology of extraordinarily flashy dance numbers.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;With a score by Giorgio Moroder, and with ingenious costumes that are utterly au courant, Flashdance contains such dynamic dance scenes that it&#x27;s a pity there&#x27;s a story here to bog them down.&quot;

In a 1984 essay for the journal &quot;Jump Cut&quot;, critic Kathryn Kalinak questioned the characterization of Alex: &quot;How could an 18 year-old woman land a skilled labor job as a welder in the unionized steel industry of an economically depressed union town? ... Not only are any other women missing in the factory, so are employees, male or female, under 30.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; – #55

==Legacy==

There were discussions about a sequel, but the film was never made. Beals turned down an offer to appear in a sequel, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been drawn to something by virtue of how rich or famous it will make me. I turned down so much money, and my agents were just losing their minds.&quot;

In March 2001, a Broadway musical version was proposed with new songs by Giorgio Moroder, but failed to materialize. In July 2008, a stage musical adaptation &quot;Flashdance The Musical&quot; premiered at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, England. The book is co-written by Tom Hedley, who created the story outline for the original film, and the choreography is by Arlene Phillips.

In October 2020, Paramount announced plans to reboot the film as a TV series for Paramount+.

Jennifer Beals&#x27; performance started her reputation as a lesbian icon.

===Connection to MTV===
&quot;Flashdance&quot; is not a musical in the traditional sense as none of the characters sing or dance, although the Alex character is portrayed as an amateur dancer, but rather the songs are presented in the style of self-contained music videos. Its success has been attributed in part to the 1981 launch of the cable channel MTV (Music Television) since it was the first feature film to exploit the new popularity of music videos effectively. By excerpting segments of the film and running them as music videos on MTV, the studio benefited from extensive free promotion, establishing the new medium as an important marketing tool for films. In the mid-1980s, it became almost obligatory to release a music video to promote a major motion picture—even if the film was not especially suited for one.

==Legal action==
===Suit against the filmmakers===
&quot;Flashdance&quot; was inspired by the real-life story of Maureen Marder, a construction worker/welder by day and dancer by night at &quot;Gimlets&quot;, a Toronto strip club. Like Alex Owens in the film, she aspired to enroll in a prestigious dance school. Tom Hedley wrote the original story outline for &quot;Flashdance&quot;, and on December 6, 1982, Marder signed a release document giving Paramount Pictures the right to portray her life story on screen, for which she was given a one-off payment of $2,300. &quot;Flashdance&quot; is estimated to have grossed more than $200 million worldwide. In June 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco affirmed a lower court&#x27;s ruling that Marder gave up her rights to the film when she signed the release document in 1982. The panel of three judges stated in its ruling: &quot;Though in hindsight the agreement appears to be unfair to Marder—she only received $2,300 in exchange for a release of all claims relating to a movie that grossed over $150 million—there is simply no evidence that her consent was obtained by fraud, deception, misrepresentation, duress or undue influence.&quot; The court also noted that Marder&#x27;s attorney had been present when she signed the document.

===Suit against Jennifer Lopez and filmmakers over music video===
In 2003, following the use of dance routines from the film by Jennifer Lopez in her music video &quot;I&#x27;m Glad&quot; (directed by David LaChapelle), Marder sued Lopez, Sony Corporation (the makers of the music video), and Paramount in an attempt to gain a copyright interest in the film. Although Lopez argued that her video for &quot;I&#x27;m Glad&quot; was intended as a tribute to &quot;Flashdance&quot;, Sony settled a copyright infringement lawsuit out of court for the use of dance routines and other story material from the film in the video.

<text>In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal. A directed cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal.

A graph without cycles is called an &quot;acyclic graph&quot;. A directed graph without directed cycles is called a &quot;directed acyclic graph&quot;. A connected graph without cycles is called a &quot;tree&quot;.

== Definitions ==
=== Circuit and cycle ===
* A circuit is a non-empty trail in which the first and last vertices are equal (&quot;closed trail&quot;).
: Let be a graph. A circuit is a non-empty trail with a vertex sequence .
* A cycle or simple circuit is a circuit in which only the first and last vertices are equal.
* &quot;n&quot; is called the length of the circuit resp. length of the cycle.

=== Directed circuit and directed cycle ===
* A directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail in which the first and last vertices are equal (&quot;closed directed trail&quot;).
: Let be a directed graph. A directed circuit is a non-empty directed trail with a vertex sequence .
* A directed cycle or simple directed circuit is a directed circuit in which only the first and last vertices are equal.
* &quot;n&quot; is called the length of the directed circuit resp. length of the directed cycle.

== Chordless cycle ==
A chordless cycle in a graph, also called a hole or an induced cycle, is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle. An antihole is the complement of a graph hole. Chordless cycles may be used to characterize perfect graphs: by the strong perfect graph theorem, a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three. A chordal graph, a special type of perfect graph, has no holes of any size greater than three.

The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle; this cycle is necessarily chordless. Cages are defined as the smallest regular graphs with given combinations of degree and girth.

A peripheral cycle is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle. In a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle, a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle.

== Cycle space ==
The term &quot;cycle&quot; may also refer to an element of the cycle space of a graph. There are many cycle spaces, one for each coefficient field or ring. The most common is the &quot;binary cycle space&quot; (usually called simply the &quot;cycle space&quot;), which consists of the edge sets that have even degree at every vertex; it forms a vector space over the two-element field. By Veblen&#x27;s theorem, every element of the cycle space may be formed as an edge-disjoint union of simple cycles. A cycle basis of the graph is a set of simple cycles that forms a basis of the cycle space.

Using ideas from algebraic topology, the binary cycle space generalizes to vector spaces or modules over other rings such as the integers, rational or real numbers, etc.

== Cycle detection ==
The existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by whether a depth-first search (DFS) finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex (i.e., it contains a back edge). All the back edges which DFS skips over are part of cycles. In an undirected graph, the edge to the parent of a node should not be counted as a back edge, but finding any other already visited vertex will indicate a back edge. In the case of undirected graphs, only &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) time is required to find a cycle in an &quot;n&quot;-vertex graph, since at most &quot;n&quot; − 1 edges can be tree edges.

Many topological sorting algorithms will detect cycles too, since those are obstacles for topological order to exist. Also, if a directed graph has been divided into strongly connected components, cycles only exist within the components and not between them, since cycles are strongly connected.

For directed graphs, distributed message-based algorithms can be used. These algorithms rely on the idea that a message sent by a vertex in a cycle will come back to itself.
Distributed cycle detection algorithms are useful for processing large-scale graphs using a distributed graph processing system on a computer cluster (or supercomputer).

Applications of cycle detection include the use of wait-for graphs to detect deadlocks in concurrent systems.

=== Algorithm ===
The aforementioned use of depth-first search to find a cycle can be described as follows:
 For every vertex v: visited(v) = finished(v) = false
 For every vertex v: DFS(v)
where
 DFS(v) =
 if finished(v): return
 if visited(v):
 &quot;Cycle found&quot;
 return
 visited(v) = true
 for every neighbour w: DFS(w)
 finished(v) = true

For undirected graphs, &quot;neighbour&quot; means all vertices connected to &quot;v&quot;, except for the one that recursively called &quot;DFS(v)&quot;. This omission prevents the algorithm from finding a trivial cycle of the form &quot;v&quot;→&quot;w&quot;→&quot;v&quot;; these exist in every undirected graph with at least one edge. 

A variant using breadth-first search instead will find a cycle of the smallest possible length.

== Covering graphs by cycle ==
In his 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, widely considered to be the birth of graph theory, Leonhard Euler proved that, for a finite undirected graph to have a closed walk that visits each edge exactly once (making it a closed trail), it is necessary and sufficient that it be connected except for isolated vertices (that is, all edges are contained in one component) and have even degree at each vertex. The corresponding characterization for the existence of a closed walk visiting each edge exactly once in a directed graph is that the graph be strongly connected and have equal numbers of incoming and outgoing edges at each vertex. In either case, the resulting closed trail is known as an Eulerian trail. If a finite undirected graph has even degree at each of its vertices, regardless of whether it is connected, then it is possible to find a set of simple cycles that together cover each edge exactly once: this is Veblen&#x27;s theorem. When a connected graph does not meet the conditions of Euler&#x27;s theorem, a closed walk of minimum length covering each edge at least once can nevertheless be found in polynomial time by solving the route inspection problem.

The problem of finding a single simple cycle that covers each vertex exactly once, rather than covering the edges, is much harder. Such a cycle is known as a Hamiltonian cycle, and determining whether it exists is NP-complete. Much research has been published concerning classes of graphs that can be guaranteed to contain Hamiltonian cycles; one example is Ore&#x27;s theorem that a Hamiltonian cycle can always be found in a graph for which every non-adjacent pair of vertices have degrees summing to at least the total number of vertices in the graph.

The cycle double cover conjecture states that, for every bridgeless graph, there exists a multiset of simple cycles that covers each edge of the graph exactly twice. Proving that this is true (or finding a counterexample) remains an open problem.

== Graph classes defined by cycle ==
Several important classes of graphs can be defined by or characterized by their cycles. These include:
* Bipartite graph, a graph without odd cycles (cycles with an odd number of vertices)
* Cactus graph, a graph in which every nontrivial biconnected component is a cycle
* Cycle graph, a graph that consists of a single cycle
* Chordal graph, a graph in which every induced cycle is a triangle
* Directed acyclic graph, a directed graph with no directed cycles
* Forest, a cycle-free graph
* Line perfect graph, a graph in which every odd cycle is a triangle
* Perfect graph, a graph with no induced cycles or their complements of odd length greater than three
* Pseudoforest, a graph in which each connected component has at most one cycle
* Strangulated graph, a graph in which every peripheral cycle is a triangle
* Strongly connected graph, a directed graph in which every edge is part of a cycle
* Triangle-free graph, a graph without three-vertex cycles
* Even-cycle-free graph, a graph without even cycles
* Even-hole-free graph, a graph without even cycles of length larger or equal to 6

<doc id="168613" wikidata="Q1164913" url="?curid=168613" title="Morphine (band)">
<text>Morphine was an American rock band formed by Mark Sandman, Dana Colley, and Jerome Deupree in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1989. Drummer Billy Conway replaced Deupree as the band&#x27;s live drummer in 1991. Deupree recorded the album &quot;Cure For Pain&quot;, with the exception of the title track which was recorded by Conway, before being permanently replaced by Conway in 1993. Both drummers appeared together during a 15 date US tour in March of 1999. After five successful albums and extensive touring, they disbanded after lead vocalist Sandman died of a heart attack onstage in Palestrina, Italy, on July 3, 1999 at the Nel Nome Del Rock Festival. Founding members have reformed into the band Vapors of Morphine, maintaining much of the original style and sound.

The band used an idiosyncratic set of instruments and combined blues and jazz elements with more traditional rock arrangements, which gave it an unusual and original sound. The instruments mainly consisted of baritone saxophone (played by Colley), two-string bass (played by Sandman), and drums. Sandman sang distinctively in a &quot;deep, laid-back croon&quot;, and his songwriting featured a prominent beat influence. The band themselves coined the label &quot;low rock&quot; to describe their music, which involved &quot;a minimalist, low-end sound that could have easily become a gimmick: a &#x27;power trio&#x27; not built around the sound of an electric guitar. Instead, Morphine expanded its offbeat vocabulary on each album.&quot;

The band enjoyed positive critical appraisal, but met with mixed results commercially. In the United States, the band was embraced and promoted by the indie rock community, including public and college radio stations and MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, which the band once guest-hosted, but received little support from commercial rock radio and other music television programs. This limited their mainstream exposure and support in their home country, while internationally they enjoyed high-profile success, especially in Belgium, Russia, Portugal, France and Australia.

==History==
===Formation, independent years (1989–1996)===
Morphine was formed in 1989 by bassist and vocalist Mark Sandman, a member of the bluesy alternative rock band Treat Her Right, saxophonist Dana Colley, a former member of the local Boston group Three Colors, and drummer Jerome Deupree, who had played with Sandman in the Hypnosonics. Sandman, a prolific musician who frequently experimented with home-made instruments, played a single-stringed bass guitar of his own devising with a slide, although he later added a second string. Deupree briefly left the group for health reasons in 1991 and was temporarily replaced by Treat Her Right drummer Billy Conway. These years found the group building a strong local audience and touring occasionally.

With Deupree returning, they recorded their debut album, &quot;Good&quot;, for the Boston-based Accurate/Distortion label in 1991. The album received positive reviews and increased the band&#x27;s audience. The band subsequently signed to Rykodisc, who re-released &quot;Good&quot; under its own imprint.

&quot;Cure for Pain&quot;, 1993&#x27;s followup, increased the band&#x27;s audience outside of New England, and singles like &quot;Thursday&quot; and &quot;Buena&quot; picked up some college radio play. During the recording of &quot;Cure for Pain&quot;, Deupree was again replaced by Conway, although Deupree still played most of the percussion work on the album. After the album was completed, the band toured the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.

In 1994, five songs from the album were prominently featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Spanking the Monkey&quot;. The band returned to the studio in 1995 and produced &quot;Yes&quot;. The album featured the single &quot;Honey White,&quot; the music video for which appeared on the MTV animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;, as had &quot;Thursday&quot;. It also included &quot;I Had My Chance,&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.

===DreamWorks Records years (1997–1999)===
After two years of touring, Morphine signed with DreamWorks Records, who released their major label debut, &quot;Like Swimming&quot;, in 1997. It was a critical success, but did not break the band into the domestic mainstream as had been hoped. DreamWorks released a music video for the single &quot;Early to Bed&quot;; directed by Jamie Caliri and released in March 1997, the nightmarish yet humorous video became an instant favorite among fans and was later nominated for a Grammy award. The band also released &quot;B-Sides and Otherwise&quot;, a collection of B-sides and live recordings, on Rykodisc this same year.

In the following time, Deupree once again began performing live and in the studio with the band, making the group a four-piece. The band&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;The Night&quot;, was completed in early 1999.

On July 3, 1999, Sandman collapsed on the stage of the Nel Nome del Rock festival at the Giardini del Principe in Palestrina, Italy, outside of Rome. He was soon pronounced dead of a heart attack and Morphine immediately disbanded. &quot;The Night&quot; was released in 2000. Posthumous Morphine releases followed shortly thereafter, including &quot;Bootleg Detroit&quot;, an &quot;official live bootleg&quot;, and &quot;The Best of Morphine: 1992–1995&quot;, both on Rykodisc.

===Posthumous projects (1999–present)===

Within a year of Sandman&#x27;s death, Colley and Conway created Orchestra Morphine, a group of Sandman&#x27;s friends and colleagues who toured to celebrate the music of the band and to raise funds for the Mark Sandman Music Education Fund. Orchestra Morphine mostly performed music from &quot;The Night&quot;, but also included some other Morphine and Hypnosonics material as well. Orchestra Morphine still performs occasionally but no longer tours. Singer and guitarist Laurie Sargent, a member of Orchestra Morphine and former vocalist for the band Face to Face, later joined Colley and Conway in their first post-Morphine musical endeavor, Twinemen.

Conway and Colley also officially formed the Hi-n-Dry independent record label and studio, converting Sandman&#x27;s workspace into a commercial enterprise. The label&#x27;s roster includes a number of their friends, colleagues and other Boston-area musicians. In 2004, Hi-n-Dry released the Mark Sandman box set &quot;Sandbox&quot;, which contained two CDs and a DVD of previously unreleased material spanning Sandman&#x27;s musical career. The DVD featured clips from early Sandman shows, interviews from the Morphine tours, and various videos from other Sandman solo and group projects, such as Treat Her Right. However, for copyright reasons the box set did not contain any previously released material found in the Morphine catalog, Morphine videos, or promotional material produced by Rykodisc or DreamWorks Records.

Deupree continued to record with various jazz musicians.

In 2009, Colley and Deupree began regularly performing Morphine songs and new material as Members of Morphine (alternately, the Ever-Expanding Elastic Waste Band), with singer, bassist and guitarist Jeremy Lyons of New Orleans. In July 2009, the group played at Nel Nome Del Rock Festival in Palestrina, Italy, marking the ten-year anniversary of Sandman&#x27;s death at the location in which it occurred. As of 2014, the group was renamed Vapors of Morphine and regularly perform in Boston and New Orleans. They held a standing weekly gig at Atwood&#x27;s Tavern in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until its closure after 16 years in March 2023.

In 2009, Rhino Records released the two-disc set &quot;At Your Service&quot;, composed of unreleased Morphine material.

As of 1999, Morphine has sold over 807,000 records in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

On December 19, 2021, drummer Billy Conway died from liver cancer, aged 65.

;Timeline


==Instruments==
Morphine&#x27;s instrumentation was unusual for a rock band: Sandman&#x27;s primary instrument was a two-string bass guitar (with the strings usually tuned to a 5th or octave interval) played with a slide; however, on the group&#x27;s records he added touches of guitar, piano, electronic organ, and other self-invented guitar instruments such as the tritar, featuring two guitar strings and one bass string. Colley played primarily baritone saxophone, along with soprano or tenor saxes, and the rare bass saxophone, and he sometimes played two saxes at once, a la Roland Kirk; he also played occasional percussion, and Dobro on a B-side.

<doc id="168614" wikidata="Q1165655" url="?curid=168614" title="Throbbing Gristle">
<text>Throbbing Gristle were an English music and visual arts group formed in Kingston upon Hull by Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti, later joined by Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson and Chris Carter. They are widely regarded as pioneers of industrial music. Evolving from the experimental performance art group COUM Transmissions, Throbbing Gristle made their public debut in October 1976 in the COUM exhibition &quot;Prostitution&quot;, and released their debut single &quot;United/Zyklon B Zombie&quot; and debut album &quot;The Second Annual Report&quot; the following year. P-Orridge&#x27;s lyrics mainly revolved around mysticism, extremist political ideologies, sexuality, dark or underground aspects of society, and idiosyncratic manipulation of language inspired by the techniques of William S. Burroughs.

The band released several subsequent studio and live albums – including &quot;D.o.A: The Third and Final Report of Throbbing Gristle&quot; (1978), &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot; (1979), and &quot;Heathen Earth&quot; (1980) – on their own record label Industrial Records, building a reputation with their transgressive and confrontational aesthetics; they included the extensive use of disturbing visual imagery, such as ironic fascist and Nazi symbolism and pornography, as well as that of noise and sound manipulation influenced by the works of Burroughs and Brion Gysin.

Throbbing Gristle dissolved in 1981 due to interpersonal differences; the individual members went on to participate in other projects, such as Psychic TV, Coil, and Chris &amp; Cosey. The band was reformed in 2004, and released three more studio albums – &quot;TG Now&quot; (2004), &quot;Part Two&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Third Mind Movements&quot; (2009) – before disbanding again after P-Orridge&#x27;s departure in October 2010 and Christopherson&#x27;s death the following month. The band&#x27;s final studio project, a cover version of the 1970 Nico album &quot;Desertshore&quot; entitled &quot;The Desertshore Installation&quot;, was released in 2012 under the moniker X-TG.

== History ==
=== First era: 1976–1981 ===

Throbbing Gristle evolved from the performance art group COUM Transmissions, formed in Kingston upon Hull by a group of performers including Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. In 1973 COUM moved from Hull to Hackney, London, where P-Orridge and Tutti met Chris Carter, then working as a sound recordist in television, and Peter Christopherson, then a member of the graphic design collective Hipgnosis; the four built a recording studio in Hackney which they dubbed &quot;The Death Factory&quot; and began performing music together. The last known performance of COUM Transmissions – &quot;Prostitution&quot;, an exhibition held in October 1976 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London – was also the public debut of Throbbing Gristle. The provocative sexual content of the exhibition led Conservative Member of Parliament Nicholas Fairbairn to dub the group &quot;wreckers of civilisation&quot;.

Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s confrontational live performances and use of often disturbing imagery, including pornography and photographs of Nazi concentration camps, earned the group a notorious reputation, but they maintained that their mission was to challenge and explore the darker and obsessive sides of the human condition rather than to make attractive music. Throbbing Gristle made extensive use of pre-recorded tape samples and effects units, some of which they had designed or modified themselves, to produce a distinctive, highly distorted sound, usually accompanied by lyrics or spoken-word performances by Tutti or P-Orridge. Though they asserted that they wanted to provoke their audience into thinking for themselves rather than promote any specific political agenda, Throbbing Gristle frequently associated with the anarcho-punk scene. They appeared in the fanzine &quot;Toxic Grafity&quot; with a condensation of their own propaganda parody series, Industrial News.

In 1977, they released their debut single &quot;United / Zyklon B Zombie&quot;, followed by the hybrid live/studio album &quot;The Second Annual Report&quot;. First pressed in a limited run of 786 copies on the band&#x27;s Industrial Records label, it was rereleased on Mute Records following high demand; however, this later release was reversed, with all tracks playing backwards and in reverse order. This was followed by the albums &quot;D.o.A: The Third and Final Report of Throbbing Gristle&quot; (1978), &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot; (1979), and &quot;Heathen Earth&quot; (1980), along with a number of non-album singles.

In 1981 concert promoter and Transparency Records founder Michael Sheppard brought Throbbing Gristle to Los Angeles. On 29 May 1981 Throbbing Gristle performed at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco in what would be the group&#x27;s final performance until reuniting in 2004. Throbbing Gristle announced their dissolution on 23 June 1981, mailing out postcards declaring that their &quot;mission [was] terminated.&quot; In a 1987 interview, Tutti attributed the band&#x27;s split to her own breakup with P-Orridge: &quot;TG broke up because me and Gen broke up.&quot;

P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form Psychic TV, and Tutti and Chris Carter, now a couple, continued to record together as Chris &amp; Cosey. Christopherson later formed Coil with fellow Psychic TV member John Balance; P-Orridge subsequently formed Thee Majesty and PTV3 with their wife Jacqueline &quot;Jaye&quot; Breyer.

=== Reunion: 2004–2010 ===

In 2004, Throbbing Gristle briefly reunited to record and release the limited album &quot;TG Now&quot;. On 2 April 2007, TG released the album &quot;Part Two: The Endless Not&quot;, which the group had finished recording in Berlin. It was originally set to be released by Mute Records in September 2006 but was delayed for unknown reasons.

In March 2007, Side-Line announced &quot;Part Two&quot;&#x27;s final release date, adding that a string of special live events would take place in 2007.

A seven-disc DVD set titled &quot;TGV&quot; was issued in 2007. The set contains old and new footage of the band. &quot;TGV&quot; came packaged in a deluxe box with a 64-page book, all designed by Christopherson.

The group performed a reinterpretation of their debut album &quot;The Second Annual Report&quot; twice in 2008 to mark the thirtieth anniversary of its release. The performance in Paris on 6 June was issued as a limited-edition framed vinyl set titled &quot;The Thirty-Second Annual Report&quot;.

The band then worked to record an album based on their interpretation of Nico&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Desertshore&quot;. The group issued the entirety of the recording sessions for the album as a limited edition 12-CD set packaged in a custom CD wallet, &quot;The Desertshore Installation&quot;, which was sold via mail order from the group&#x27;s website.

In April 2009, Throbbing Gristle toured the United States, appearing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago. &quot;The Third Mind Movements&quot;, a new release, was made available at these shows, which was edited down from improvisations recorded during the &quot;Desertshore Installation&quot; sessions.

A collaborative installation with Cerith Wyn Evans titled &quot;A=P=P=A=R=I=T=I=O=N&quot; was displayed at Tramway in Glasgow from 7 August to 27 September 2009. Throbbing Gristle contributed a multi-channel soundtrack that was played through 16 hanging Audio Spotlight sound panels that Evans had incorporated into his sculpture.

In November 2009, Throbbing Gristle and Industrial Records released their version of the Buddha Machine loop player, designed by the group with Christiaan Virant of FM3.

On 29 October 2010, Throbbing Gristle announced on their website that P-Orridge had left the group; Carter, Cosey and Christopherson finished their current tour under the name X-TG. P-Orridge&#x27;s website stated that they had not quit Throbbing Gristle and had merely stopped participating in the current tour. However, the band would dissolve for good on 24 November following Christopherson&#x27;s death.

=== After dissolution: 2011–present ===

In 2011, Industrial Records had an official &quot;re-activation&quot; to reissue the group&#x27;s studio albums, as Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s contract with Mute Records had expired.

Industrial Records subsequently announced that a double album, titled &quot;Desertshore/The Final Report&quot;, would be released on 26 November 2012. Carter and Tutti produced the album with the participation of film director Gaspar Noé, former pornographic actress Sasha Grey, and guest vocalists Anohni, Blixa Bargeld, and Marc Almond.

The group had decided before Christopherson&#x27;s death to re-record the album because they were not satisfied with the ICA recordings. Christopherson had been the driving force behind the project and had been working on the record in Bangkok with Danny Hyde. &quot;It was Sleazy&#x27;s project, then Cosey and Sleazy&#x27;s, then I came in on it&quot;, Carter said in an interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot;. After Christopherson died, custom instruments built for the project by Christopherson were given to Carter and Tutti, and they began combining his recordings with the work they had done themselves. They announced plans to debut the album live at AV Festival on 17 March 2012 accompanied by a screening of Philippe Garrel&#x27;s film &quot;The Inner Scar&quot; &quot;for which &quot;Desertshore&quot; was the soundtrack and inspiration&quot;.

P-Orridge died from leukaemia on 14 March 2020.

== Legacy ==
The band is widely viewed as having helped create the industrial music genre along with contemporaries Cabaret Voltaire. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by P-Orridge and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Second Annual Report&quot;, they coined the slogan &quot;industrial music for industrial people&quot;.

Alternative Press included Throbbing Gristle in their 1996 list of &quot;100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.&quot;

&quot;Wreckers of Civilization&quot;, a survey on COUM Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s original run written by Simon Ford, was published in 1999. A book in the 33⅓ series on &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot; by Drew Daniel of Matmos was released in 2007.

&quot;Other, Like Me: The Oral History of COUM Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle&quot;, a documentary on both projects consisting of archival footage and photos and interviews with their members, was co-produced by BBC Television and aired on BBC Four in December 2021.

<text>Paulina Susana Rubio Dosamantes (; born 17 June 1971) is a Mexican singer, songwriter and television personality. Referred to as &quot;The Golden Girl&quot;, she first achieved recognition as a member of the successful pop group Timbiriche from 1982 through 1991. After leaving Timbiriche, she embarked on a solo career. Rubio has sold over 15 million records, making her one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time.

Rubio&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;La Chica Dorada&quot; (1992) and &quot;24 Kilates&quot; (1993), were commercial successes and made her EMI Latin&#x27;s best-selling Mexican female artist. In the mid-1990s, she adopted a more dance and electronic style for her next two albums, &quot;El Tiempo Es Oro&quot; (1995) and &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot; (1996), and made her feature film debut with a starring role in &quot;Bésame en la Boca&quot; (1995).

Following a series of concerts with Timbiriche and ending her contract with EMI Latin, Rubio&#x27;s career was interrupted before the release of her fifth studio album—and her first with Universal Latino—the homonym &quot;Paulina&quot; (2000), which is critically referred to as one of her best albums to date. &quot;Paulina&quot; was an international success and Rubio became the best-selling Latin music artist of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End in 2001. She returned to the top of the charts again with her sixth and seventh albums, the crossover &quot;Border Girl&quot; (2002), and the acclaimed &quot;Pau-Latina&quot; (2004), both of which received positive reviews. Rubio garnered critical praise, including nominations for the Grammy Award and Latin Grammy Award. Her next albums, &quot;Ananda&quot; (2006) and &quot;Gran City Pop&quot; (2009), were also critically and commercially successful. She followed it with &quot;Brava!&quot; (2011), which delved into EDM.

Early in the 2010s, Rubio stood out for participating as a coach in the most important talent shows in America and Spain. In 2012, she served as a coach on the second season of &quot;La Voz... Mexico&quot;. In 2013; Rubio became a coach on &quot;La Voz Kids&quot;, and also became a judge on &quot;The X Factor USA&quot;. In 2019, during the promotion of her eleventh studio album, &quot;Deseo&quot; (2018), she returned on &quot;La Voz... España&quot; and &quot;La Voz Senior&quot;.

Rubio has scored three number one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums. Five of Rubio&#x27;s singles have reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs: &quot;Te Quise Tanto&quot;, &quot;Dame Otro Tequila&quot;, &quot;Ni Una Sola Palabra&quot;, &quot;Causa Y Efecto&quot;, and &quot;Me Gustas Tanto&quot;, making her the fifth best performing female artist on the chart. Other singles, &quot;Mío&quot;, &quot;Y Yo Sigo Aquí&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot;, topped the charts in most Hispanic countries. Rubio has earned numerous awards and accolades, including seven &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards; five Lo Nuestro Awards; three MTV Latinoamerica Awards; and two Telehit Awards, including the Trajectory Award; and a special accolade as &quot;Mexican artist with the greatest international projection&quot;.

Rubio is regarded as a pop icon and is credited Latin pop era-defining during the 2000s. As one of the most influential female Mexican artists, she was included twice in 2012 and 2013 among the &quot;50 Most Powerful Women in Mexico&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; Mexico. Additionally she was included in their &quot;Celebrity 100: Twitter&#x27;s most-followed superstars&quot; list in 2015. In 2008, Univision ranked her among the most powerful Latin celebrities in the United States and as one of the Greatest Latin Artists of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2020.
 According to a 2021 ranking by YouGov, Rubio is the 26th most popular Latin music artist and the 17th most famous.

==Life and career==
===1971–1981: Early life and career beginnings===
Paulina Susana Rubio Dosamantes was born on 17 June 1971 in Mexico City. Her father, Enrique Rubio González (1932–2011), was a Spanish-born lawyer; her mother was Susana Dosamantes (1948–2022), a Mexican actress. Dosamantes had lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco until adolescence when she decided to become a film actress, and just before Rubio&#x27;s birth, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1970s in Mexico. Rubio&#x27;s younger brother, Enrique Rubio Jr., is an important lawyer and socialite; her half-sister Ana Paola Rubio stays out of the spotlight. Her musical legacy comes from her grandmother and great-grandmother, who were a mezzo-soprano singer and pianist, respectively. Her great-grandparents were originally from Spain and Portugal, and from a very young age she used to spend two or three months a year in Europe, visiting relatives. The rest of the year she resided between Mexico and Los Angeles. As a little girl &quot;grew up in the middle of an artistic world surrounded by cameras, lights and sets&quot;.

As Rubio has stated of herself: &quot;I&#x27;ve been famous since I was born&quot;, due to the commotion that her birth caused, as she was the daughter of one of the most consecrated actresses in Mexico. According to her mother, Rubio grew up among arts media and the filming locations, while she worked. First Rubio&#x27;s appearance in a film was the early 1980s, when accompanied by younger brother, she got a minor role in film &quot;El Día del Compadre&quot;. She also took singing, acting, jazz, painting, and dance lessons while enrolled at what is now the Centro de Educación Artística (CEA) in Mexico in 1980. After two years there, Rubio&#x27;s parents were contacted by producers Julisa and Guillermo del Bosque to they approval of Rubio&#x27;s joining on a musical band formed by children from the CEA. They were puzzled by Julissa and Guillermo del Bosque&#x27;s request. Later, Rubio told them &quot;I did the casting without notifying you.&quot; Despite Susana and Enrique&#x27;s dissatisfaction, they reached an agreement with their daughter to be part of the children&#x27;s musical band, with the condition that she got &quot;a grade of nine in the school&quot;.

===1982–1990: Timbiriche===
Rubio began her singing career as a 9-year-old, when the children&#x27;s band Timbiriche made its official debut on 30 April 1982 on the Mexican television show &quot;Siempre en Domingo&quot;, featuring Spanish singer Miguel Bosé as its &quot;artistic godfather&quot;. The first song they performed was &quot;Don Diablo&quot; with Bosé. The band&#x27;s name refers to the a paper-and-pencil game of mathematical structure (known in the United States as dots and boxes), and the idea of naming the musical group was a response to the Spanish children&#x27;s musical group Parchís, whose name is also inspired by a table game. Timbiriche was initially made up of Mariana Garza, Alix Bauer, Diego Schoening and Rubio, and they were eventually joined by Benny Ibarra and Sasha Sokol. Mexican actress and producer Martha Zavaleta was in charge to recruiting the group of children, who were part of the children&#x27;s area of the Centro de Educación Artística (CEA). The six children were formed by the major Latin American mass media corporation Televisa with Televisa&#x27;s producers Victor Hugo O&#x27;Farril, Luis de Llano Macedo and María Eugenia &quot;La Gorda&quot; Galindo as part of Timbiriche&#x27;s team creative.

Timbiriche&#x27;s first homonym albums (&quot;Timbiriche&quot; and &quot;La Banda Timbiriche&quot;) released through Fonovisa Records in 1982 was a success in Mexico. They were known as a children&#x27;s band and songs like &quot;Somos Amigos&quot;, &quot;Hoy Tengo Que Decirte Papá&quot;, &quot;Mamá&quot; and &quot;México&quot; was successful on the radio. In 1983 Timbiriche went on their first international tour and released the first live album &quot;En Concierto&quot;. One of the selected songs was a cover version of the song &quot;Mickey&quot; by Tony Basil. The track was chosen because it was one of the most popular in the tour&#x27;s performances. &quot;En Concierto&quot; was gold-certified and marked the debut of Timbiriche&#x27;s seventh member Erik Rubin. The third studio album, &quot;Disco Ruido&quot;, released in December 1983, continued with the same concept line of children&#x27;s songs, but rock-style influences.

In 1984, Timbiriche participated in the musical &quot;Vaselina&quot;, a Spanish-language adaptation of the American musical &quot;Grease&quot;; The band record a studio album inspired from the musical, and is known to be the last &quot;child type&quot; record of the group. It was the first act of Rubio on a professional musical theatre, she performed the role of Licha and sang solo a Spanish version of &quot;Freddy, My Love&quot;. The band members became teenage idols in Mexico, but for Rubio it implied pressure to look much older than she was. Rubio has stated that at age 13 &quot;I wanted to grow up and look tall, and have big eyelashes&quot; because unlike her groupmates she looked much thinner and shorter. She confessed to having suffered bullying in Timbiriche and felt like &quot;the ugly duckling&quot; of the band.

&quot;Timbiriche Rock Show&quot;, released on 1 July 1985, marked the &quot;teenage transition&quot; of the band, with lyrics more aimed at teenagers and sounds more pop-rock mainstream. The album contains Spanish-language covers of notable pop hits during the 1980s. It was certified gold and spawned several hit singles, including &quot;Soy un Desastre&quot;, &quot;Corro, Vuelo, Me Acelero&quot;, &quot;Teléfono&quot; and &quot;Me Plantó&quot;, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry. Rubio totally changed her image during that time, leaving her innocent and childish style to a more &quot;rocker&quot; style, and sporting voluminous and large hairdos. When the promotion of &quot;Timbiriche Rock Show&quot; ended in the summer of 1986, two founding members of Timbiriche left and two new ones entered, which marked a change in the line-up. It was reflected in the album &quot;Timbiriche VII&quot;, released on 29 June 1987. The pop-rock style record was a massive success in Latin America, selling 1 million copies and becoming one of the best-selling Mexican albums of all time. The record features some of the group&#x27;s most widely known songs such as &quot;Mírame (Cuestión de Tiempo)&quot; and &quot;Con Todos Menos Conmigo&quot;.

===1991–1994: Solo career, &quot;La Chica Dorada&quot; and &quot;24 Kilates&quot;===
During an interview to Mexican TV show Galardon a los Grandes in summer 1991, Rubio said that she would travel to Spain to record her first solo album. She anticipated want to show &quot;fresh music for a very broad market&quot;., and also announced she would film her second telenovela at the end of that year. During that time, Rubio began a relationship with her ex-fellow from Timbiriche, Erik Rubin. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Rubin had recently broken up with Mexican singer Alejandra Guzman, who said in different media &quot;he broke-up with me for she [Rubio].&quot; Guzman released the song &quot;Hey Güera&quot;, and the media speculated that the song was about Rubio. Eventually, she confirmed it.

The Televisa&#x27;s telenovela &quot;Baila Conmigo&quot; was aired on 30 March 1992. It based in the late 50s and early 60s at the time of &quot;Rock and Roll era&quot;. She played the role of Andrea de la Reguera, a rich and capricious girl who was used to having everything at her disposal. Her leading role as an antagonist turned out to be very convincing to the press and audience, earning positive reviews for her performance. The telenovela producer was Luis de Llano, who recruited a cast of youth stars who were just beginning their solo career in music and acting. The success of &quot;Baila Conmigo&quot; gave the protagonists the possibility of recording a special album and received 9 nominations for the 1993 TVyNovelas Awards, including &quot;Actress Revelation&quot; for Rubio. Also a &quot;soundtrack&quot; was released under the Fonovisa Records label of ten songs in some Latin American countries.

Rubio embarked recording studio sessions in Spain in fall 1991 to early 1992 with the Spanish producer Miguel Blasco and the songwriters José Ramón Flórez and Cesar Valle; The last two began writing songs together. After her returned to Mexico, Rubio promoted the concept of her debut album through marketing in the media and magazines. In June 1992, Rubio signed to a recording contract with Capitol Latin, and her first single was released on 30 August 1992. &quot;Mío&quot; spent several weeks at number one on the Mexican singles charts and became one of the country&#x27;s best selling single in the 1990s and was certified gold. In United States, the song reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Latin Tracks chart.

Rubio made her first television appearance performing on the legendary TV show &quot;Siempre en Domingo&quot; with Raúl Velasco to publicize his new stage in the music industry. The famous television host commented &quot;it was a great privilege to have presented Paulina as a solo singer&quot;.

In the midst of the success, &quot;Mío&quot; was the subject of controversy due the media speculated that the song was a response to &quot;Hey Güera&quot; by Alejandra Guzman. Several media rated the song as part a love triangle. As well, at the beginning her solo career, several media critics Rubio&#x27;s image style, comparing like a &quot;Madonna wannabe&quot;, but with the polarized critics, Rubio was praised as the new youth pop icon in Mexico. &quot;La Chica Dorada&quot; yielded three top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs, &quot;Mío&quot;, &quot;Abriendo Las Puertas Al Amor&quot; and &quot;Amor De Mujer&quot;. The album was certified triple gold in Mexico and eventually sold 450,000 copies in there. In March 1993, Rubio received two nominations at the Lo Nuestro Awards for the categories Female Pop Artist and New Pop Artist of the Year. The album promotion culminated with the fourth single &quot;Sabor A Miel&quot; and a promotional tour throughout Mexico and Latin America.

The pop-rock-oriented album sold 150,000 copies only before of its release. It was certified platinum, but did not appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nieva, Nieva&quot;, topped Mexico top airplay chart and reached number twenty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks. Beginning in January 1994, Rubio embarked on a concert tour in Latin America. She formed part of the invited judging panel of Viña del Mar International Song Festival and made a short performance, for which she received the Naranja Award. At that time, she released two more hits, &quot;Él Me Engañó&quot; and &quot;Asunto De Dos&quot;, making all three singles from the album peak inside the top twenty on Mexico top airplay chart. &quot;Vuelve Junto A Mí&quot;, the by demand-single, was released only in the U.S. and peaked inside the top twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks.

===1995–1997: &quot;El Tiempo Es Oro&quot;, acting and &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot;===
In March 1995, Rubio released her third studio album, &quot;El Tiempo Es Oro&quot;, and was described as &quot;rhythmic and danceable&quot;, but &quot;in the same concept line [of Golden Girl]&quot; than her previous albums. The album managed to sell 300,00 copies worldwide. The lead single, &quot;Te Daría Mi Vida&quot;, sold 140,000 copies between Mexico and United States, subsequent singles &quot;Nada De Ti&quot; and &quot;Hoy Te Dejé De Amar&quot; both reached the top ten airplay in Mexico. The album was her first record released in Spain and Brazil, and Rubio did a performed as a special guest in the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. She appeared in different magazines in Spain to become known as a singer, but the media highly publicized her relationship with the Spanish architect and socialite Ricardo Bofill, son of the Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura&#x27;s founder. The romance received intense attention from the European media, since Bofill had recently broken up with journalist Chabeli Iglesias (daughter of Spanish singer Julio Iglesias) who was still marrie with him at the time.

Rubio returned to her acting career, and landed her first starring role in the film &quot;Bésame en la Boca&quot;, released in June 1995. Rubio played Claudia Romero, a rich young girl who dies in an accident while riding her motorcycle, and is later returned to Earth, but in other body, to make amends for her mistakes.

In 1996, Rubio changed her conventional music style to avant-garde sounds. She co-produced her fourth studio album &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot; with Marco Flores. The music critics praised it &quot;a sensational album, full of feelings and enthusiasm&quot; inspired in dance-pop, euro-pop, disco, house, electronic and techno styles. Rubio assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material. The album didn&#x27;t matched the commercial success of its predecessors, despite it produced four singles: &quot;Siempre Tuya Desde La Raíz&quot;, &quot;Solo Por Ti&quot;, &quot;Miedo&quot; and &quot;Enamorada&quot;. She also recorded English versions of several songs which did not appear on the album, but were included in the remixes or maxi-singles versions of the songs, such as &quot;Open Up Your Hear&quot;, &quot;Only For You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So In Love&quot;. EMI Music declined to release Rubio&#x27;s first English crossover album, which was supposed to be the English version of the &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot; album due to weak sales of the Spanish version. Subsequently, she got into a legal battle against the record label for not fulfilling what they had already planned.

Despite the modest success of &quot;Planeta Paulina&quot;, songs like &quot;Una Historia Más&quot;—a song about HIV/AIDS—and &quot;Enamorada&quot; introduced Rubio to the gay community.

The album&#x27;s promotion spread throughout Latin America until 1997.

In 1998, Rubio published a calendar, the funds of which went to the Teleton Foundation. The photographs was shot by Mexican photographer José Quintero at locations in Rome, New York, Florence and Mexico. She was in charge of the production, direction and concept of the calendar. During the presentation of the calendar, Rubio said in an interview: &quot;I have to define many things in my professional life, and I am aware of it.&quot; Despite the legal battle with EMI Music, she continued to work on new music. For the initial recording session for fifth studio album Rubio worked first with Mexican composer and singer Armando Manzanero, and Mecano&#x27;s member Nacho Cano.

Rubio met with the original members of Timbiriche in summer 1998, during a performance at the Acapulco Festival. The presentation was received with success and became a historic moment at the festival. After the success obtained, the record label Melody reissues the disc &quot;Los Clásicos de Timbiriche&quot;, now with the name of &quot;Timbiriche Symphonic&quot;, accompanied by Mexico City Philharmonic Orchestra. It generated great stir among the followers. The original members realized the magnitude and impact of Timbiriche, so they decided to go on a concert tour. In November 1998 the band initiated a tour developed in Mexico and part of Latin America. Timbiriche reunion established in the Auditorio Nacional a sold-out record of hearing with more than 20 consecutive concerts.

Rubio explained that she &quot;wanted to do it step by step and very calmly; hence the album title&quot; which means &quot;Latin Peace&quot; in Catalan. Besides that it is a play on words: &quot;Pau&quot;, as all her friends call her, and &quot;Latina&quot;, in honor of her roots.

Rubio first teased a new single on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2014, playing a &quot;La Bamba&quot;-esque song &quot;Cuanto Te Quiero&quot; with producers in the studio. Even though she performed it live several times, the song&#x27;s release as the album lead single was cancelled. In an exclusive interview with Mario Lopez in June, Rubio spoke for the first time publicly about his legal divorce battle with Colate Vallejo-Nájera, and revealed, &quot;I&#x27;m not divorced yet. It&#x27;s been hard to struggle for so long to sign the papers. It&#x27;s been hard for the baby, but hopefully things will be more quiet and more in balance.&quot; Finally, the divorce was &quot;made official&quot; in November 2014, according to a Miami-Dade County Family Court judge, who replied to Rubio, &quot;their marriage has been dissolved&quot;.

In January 2015, Rubio released a new single, &quot;Mi Nuevo Vicio&quot; featuring Colombian group Morat. It reached number one in Spain, and attained a double platinum certification for sales of 80,000 copies, making her the Mexican female artist with more streams on Spotify. Although &quot;Mi Nuevo Vicio&quot; was her comeback single, and was a success in Latin America, it took Universal Music to give the green light to the singer&#x27;s eleventh studio album. Rubio&#x27;s legal battle with &quot;Collate&quot; continued in June 2015, when he sued her for non-payment of three months of maintenance, which would break the divorce regulatory agreement they reached in the Miami courts. That same summer, Rubio co-wrote and collaborated on Juan Magan&#x27;s song &quot;Vuelve&quot;, featuring DCS.

The song was released on 11 November, tentatively as the first single from Rubio&#x27;s eleventh studio album, but again Universal Music postponed the release of the album. Rubio performed &quot;Me Quema&quot; at the Telehit Awards 2016 for the first time; her setlist consisted in perform other three hits, and when finished her performance she confused Telehit with MTV.

===2018–2020: &quot;Deseo&quot;, &quot;La Voz Spain&quot;, departure from Universal Music, and viral video===
&quot;Desire (Me Tienes Loquita)&quot; featuring Nacho, the lead single from her eleventh studio album, was released on 25 May 2018. Its second single &quot;Suave Y Sutil&quot; followed four months later. The album, titled &quot;Deseo&quot;, was released on 14 September 2018. The album received mixed reviews, and debuted at number thirteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Albums. Rubio further promoted the album with a reissue.

The album was certified gold in Chile.

Rubio returned to the talents shows as a judge and coach in January 2019 in the sixth season of Spanish version of &quot;La Voz&quot;; her final act, Ángel Cortés, was finished 4rd in the competition of the season. Rubio distinguished herself by being the only woman on the coaching team. She was considered a right guess in &quot;La Voz&quot;, because the ranking of Antena 3&#x27;s production rose considerably compared to recent seasons. The newspaper of &quot;La Razón&quot; mentioned &quot;[Rubio] is the face that most contrasts with the rest of the members of the jury of the program. The moost international character gives great force to the evaluations and makes &#x27;La Voz&#x27; de España have much more travel outside of our country.&quot; In the following months, she continued as a coach in &quot;La Voz Senior&quot;, a version for people over 60 who are facing a new opportunity in their lives in which music has always been present.

Rubio also embarked on Deseo Tour, which began in June and ended in December 2019. After releasing her promotional single &quot;Si Supieran&quot;, several media announced that Rubio and his 20-year-old record label, Universal Music, had signed a mutual employment termination agreement. Indeed, &quot;Si Supieran&quot; was released outside of Universal Music. The rumors intensified after a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article was published citing Rubio&#x27;s words as the headline: &quot;I Am My Own Boss Now&quot;, thus confirming the rumors. But that was not the only controversy that accompanied &quot;Si Supieran&quot;, the song was a response to what her former partners, Nicolás &quot;Colate&quot; Vallejo-Nájera and Gerado Bazúa, talked about her in the media; evidencing that both conspired to tarnish Rubio&#x27;s public image. A similar message was displayed on her second single released without the Universal Music label, &quot;De Qué Sirve&quot;. The independent song is a trap-ranchera proposal with pop overtones.

In March 2020, Rubio joined with Mexican musician Raymix in the song &quot;Tú Y Yo&quot;. It reached number one in Mexico, giving Rubio her first number one on the Monitor Latino chart since &quot;Golpes En El Corazón&quot; nine years before. &quot;Tú Y Yo&quot; was certified platinum for sold 60,000 copies and won Cumbia Song of the Year - Regional Mexican at the 33rd Lo Nuestro Awards.

On 16 April 2020, Rubio performed a solo some of her hits as part of the &quot;One World: Together At Home&quot; virtual concert, a benefit event by Global Citizen to raise funds for the World Health Organization&#x27;s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Her performance received widespread negative critics due to her strange behavior that developed during the performance, forgetting the lyrics of her own songs and wearing a very disheveled image. Several media and viewers attributed her poor coordination of the virtual concert and her strange behavior to the abuse of alcoholic beverages or drugs. The video was viral on social media, and two days later Rubio posted a video on her Instagram account mocking the moment. But the controversial video prompted her children&#x27;s parents to take steps to request custody of their children. However, the Miami court judge refused to proceed because it could not be proven that Rubio had been under the influence of drugs.

On 7 October 2020, Rubio shared a video on Instagram talking about the controversial viral video, she explained that &quot;what started as a live concert to participate in a social initiative, turned out to be one of the worst days of my life. It was hideous, but I learned from it.&quot; She also addressed rumors as to whether she was under the influence of any drugs while singing, confirming that &quot;much of what has been said about me is a lie&quot;. Despite media scrutiny and public opinion about the viral video, some respected journalists empathized with Rubio. The Spanish writer Lucía Etxebarría said that Rubio &quot;has not known a normal childhood or a normal adolescence and that she has been overextended all her life&quot;. She also examined the breakdown of Britney Spears in 2007 using it as an example as a case of severe media exposure. &quot;If we have understood that Britney had a collapse because she could not bear all the pressure, we probably understand that Paulina Rubio has been subjected to pressure all her life that no one should impose on a child,&quot; Etxebarría explained.

===2021–present: New music, and Perrísimas Tour ===
On 18 September 2021, Rubio came back to the stage at the Miami Beach Pride where she headlined the festival. She performed some of her hits and was crowned as &quot;Gay Queen&quot;. The same day, Rubio announced her new single &quot;Yo Soy&quot; on her social media. It was released 14 October 2021 through Sony Music, her new record label.

In December 2021, after several negotiations, Rubio and Alejandra Guzmán announced that they would reunite for their first joint tour. The Perrísimas Tour had 22 dates in the United States, with several sold out shows. It began on April 15, 2022 in Orlando, Florida, and ended on May 22 in Los Angeles, California.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Rubio has stated that she initially became interested in entertainment during her childhood, naturally influenced by the career of her mother, Mexican actress Susana Dosamantes. She explained &quot;I have been famous since I was born&quot;, rather than becoming famous after she joined Timbiriche. She has also commented that, when watching interviews as a child, she always noted how put-together and visually stunning her mother was. Rubio said that she &quot;sang in front of the mirror&quot;, in her youth, to songs by Daniela Romo, Camilo Sesto, Juan Gabriel, José José, Mecano and Miguel Bosé. In a televised special for Univision, Rubio said that her first connection to music was through The Beatles, and that her first taste of the world of rock &#x27;n roll music was from the English band Queen, when they first performed in México in 1981–a concert Rubio attended with her father in Puebla. &quot;To see Freddie Mercury go out [on stage] with his sequin capes ... I dreamed of going out like him and doing that performance.&quot; 

The American media has cited Madonna&#x27;s career as being a comparable to Rubio&#x27;s, mainly for her image, her character and highly detailed concerts. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; magazine stated that &quot;Rubio is in fact a latin replica of Madonna, complete with a picaresque face, blond hair, cowboy hat, and mini -skirt that is in fact a wide belt-indeed.&quot; In an interview with &quot;ABC&quot; newspaper, she said, &quot;I am from Mexico and the hat is an element that is part of my culture. It has always accompanied me, since I was a child&quot;. In a &quot;HuffPost Live&quot; interview in 2014, Alyona Minkovski asked her what she thought about the media and fans calling her the &quot;Latin Madonna&quot;, to which Rubio replied, &quot;I love Madonna [...] she is strong, she is a warrior and she is an inspiration.&quot; However, Rubio has undoubtedly formed her own identity and musical style throughout her career. Luca Villa, from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, clarified the comparisons, noting that &quot;Like America&#x27;s Madonna, she has reinvented herself with every new release.&quot;

Rubio has also been inspired-by and compared to Marilyn Monroe throughout her career. She received negative comments when she posted a picture on Instagram recreating the same look from Monroe&#x27;s classic movie &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953); previously, Madonna had recreated the same look in the music video for her single &quot;Material Girl&quot; (1984). In a review of Rubio&#x27;s 2004 show at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, during the Pau-Latina World Tour, Spanish journalist Jesús Quintero suggested that, like Madonna, Rubio overflows with sensuality on stage &quot;always in &quot;ménage à trois&quot;.&quot;

===Musical style and themes===
While Rubio incorporates an &quot;eclectic&quot; musical proposal, in different points of her discography has been described as Latin-style pop, dance-pop, pop-rock and electronic. She is known for giving Latin music a new avant-garde sound, as in her song &quot;El Último Adiós&quot;, where she set a new standard in her musical career by combining mariachi and ranchera style with pop and hip hop. She has commented that &quot;in music, there are no rules. Like painting, you can mix colors and textures. I feel very free to perform dance, rock and whatever else I want.&quot; Rubio has also experimented with genres such as folklore, regional Mexican and urban.

Rubio has described her music as &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;lovely&quot;. Through her songs, she involves themes of everyday life and feminist hymns, but always inspired by love. She told ¡Hola!: &quot;In my music you can find spite, nostalgia, joy, euphoria, but always inspired by love, the only feeling that makes me live, breathe.&quot; She has also stated that although the lyrics of her songs &quot;are simple&quot;, she tries to offer a bit of poetry. Mexican writer Zeth Arellano considers that both Rubio&#x27;s music and lyricism &quot;encompasses all the extremes of emotions&quot;.

==Public image==

On social media, Rubio was most followed Mexican person on Twitter between 2011 and 2019. She was included in &quot;Forbes&quot; list &quot;Celebrity 100: Twitter&#x27;s most-followed superstars&quot; list in 2015. Since 2021, she is the third most followed Mexican person on Twitter.

Rubio&#x27;s shows are also known to be expensive. In 2005, her performance at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival was considered one of the most &quot;expensive&quot;. Her performance at the Santa Cruz de Tenerife gala in Spain in February 2020 became the most expensive performance ever paid by an artist at the event. The carnival councilor disclosed that &quot;the Mexican singer was offered 103,000 euros for an 8-minute performance.&quot;

===Fashion and media===
Throughout her career, Rubio has chosen team who attempt to create a new &quot;look&quot; for her, and the resulting have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge in the music entertainment &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to the more traditionally sophisticated &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, making the Rubio face and name known to a broad range of people in different sectors. In 2002 was chosen the year&#x27;s &quot;most beautiful&quot; cover girl of &quot;People En Español&quot;. She was having a crossover moment with her English-language album &quot;Border Girl&quot; and in 2005 Rubio decked up with others female celebrities of white and diamonds from Tiffany&#x27;s for the &quot;50 most beautiful&quot; cover.

By 2000, Rubio was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having reinvented both musically and aesthetically as pop icon. She then became a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans all around the world. Alberto Pinteño, of the Spanish edition of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, described the singer as &quot;that halo of a star that becomes an icon, for better or worse&quot;. Midi dresses became an essential part of her wardrobe and she was already encouraged to be more sensual in front of her viewers. Her &quot;Paulina&quot; era led to some media outlets referring to her as &quot;Latin Madonna&quot; for the great influence of the American artist in her videos, and like her, sensuality became a stronger element in her music videos and shows. The staff of the Mexican edition of Vogue wrote that &quot;[her] towering heels, miniskirts, sun-kissed skin and curls that billowed in the wind were part of her personal trademark.&quot; The Spanish magazine &quot;Hola!&quot; wrote that &quot;with her usual cowboy hat and miniskirts, [Rubio created] a style among the youngest girls.&quot; At that time, she began to associate with the feminist movement and express it through her music and concerts. The Spanish journalist Igor Cubillo by &quot;El País&quot; wrote that her music is a &quot;fresh formula&quot; in cohesion to &quot;well exploited physical attractiveness, to her exaltation of feminine pride and the aforementioned Latin fashion&quot; that made her a pop star that all the girls &quot;want to look like her&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Chuy Varela described &quot;Every generation has its symbols and icons, prophets and elders. Rubio is to her generation what Maria Felix was to hers. But during Felix&#x27;s day, Mexican women were expected to be more subservient and conservative. Rubio represents a more empowered, self-determined Mexican woman who is proud to be glamorous.&quot;

In 2006, she was ranked 12 on &quot;E! Entertainment&#x27;s 25 Sexiest Pop Divas in the world&quot; list. She was also named one of the &quot;Latina&#x27;s The 60 Sexiest Mexicans in Hollywood&quot; in 2018. Rubio was defined as a sex symbol after posing half naked or scantily clad in men&#x27;s magazines like &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;MAN&quot;. In 2007, she was ranked sixty seven on FHM Magazine Spain&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women list. The media at the time attributed Rubio&#x27;s sex appeal as a double-edged sword to sell an album and attract attention. In September 2021, Hard Rock &amp; Casino Hotel Punta Cana in Dominican Republic unveiled its exhibition of celebrity items, in which it includes a characteristic Rubio costume.

For their part, many journalists and critics have assured that Rubio&#x27;s great success has also been influenced by the events of her personal life. Since she began her career, the public had a great interest in exploring her personal life. &quot;El País&quot; journalist Elena Reina says that her success has been thanks to a &quot;brilliant marketing strategy based on her private life&quot;.

Rubio is regarded as a gay icon. The staff of the Spanish women&#x27;s magazine MujerdeElite wrote &quot;[Rubio] was one of the first singers in the 1990s to incorporate gay images in her music videos&quot; referring to the music video for &quot;Enamorada&quot;, where she shows a homosexual couple. The publication quoted, &quot;Since then, she has been the diva of choice for her upbeat, infectious music, full of eroticism and sexuality.&quot; She has been crowned &quot;Gay Queen&quot; in different cities in the United States and Latin America.

Paulina stated, &quot;It is important to make our voice heard and try to bring back some of the care that the community shares each day&quot;. On 17 May 2008, Paulina performed at the ALAS concert (América Latina en Acción Solidaria). The organization&#x27;s mission is to strengthen and expand public and private sector support for Early Childhood Development in Latin America. In 2009, the singer received recognition from the American Heart Association for her work with the organization. Rubio also performed at the event to raise funds.

On 3 December 2009, Paulina held a press conference announcing the creation of an organization in partnership with the Lili Claire Foundation to provide assistance to children living with neurological disorders and their families. Fundación Paulina Rubio is a project inspired by children in anguish as a result of homelessness, birth defects, and lack of education among other pernicious plights that many face today. By directing funds through other pre-existing organizations, such as The Lili Claire Foundation, children will receive a unique and comprehensive blend of support services including medical and behavioral genetics clinics, psychosocial counseling, advocacy services, information libraries, and community outreach that will ultimately help improve the lives of families and children living with neurogenetic disorders.

In 2010, Rubio hosted the Paulina &amp; Friends exclusive benefit concert for The Lili Claire Foundation which showcased musicians such as Luis Fonsi, Aleks Syntek, Noel Schajris, Reik and Fanny Lú. The purpose of the event was to raise funds to build a family resource center. &quot;My friends mean everything to me and I am happy to have the opportunity to share the stage with them to support this great cause. All of them are excellent musicians and I know that as always, they&#x27;ll do their best to make this an unforgettable night&quot;, said the singer. Jeff Simmons, community relations manager for The Lili Claire Foundation said, &quot;I&#x27;m really surprised to see the number of artists who continue to join in on this great event, it&#x27;s truly a blessing. Their contribution to the Paulina &amp; Friends concert is spectacular and the Lili Claire Foundation will be forever grateful&quot;.

In 2018, Rubio appeared in a PETA video reminding people not to leave animals or children in parked cars.
