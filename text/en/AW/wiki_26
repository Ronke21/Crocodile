<text>Chicago is an American rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1967. Self-described as a &quot;rock and roll band with horns,&quot; their songs often also combine elements of classical music, jazz, R&amp;B, and pop music.

Growing out of several bands from the Chicago area in the late 1960s, the original line-up consisted of Peter Cetera on bass, Terry Kath on guitar, Robert Lamm on keyboards, 
Lee Loughnane on trumpet, James Pankow on trombone, Walter Parazaider on woodwinds, and Danny Seraphine on drums. Cetera, Kath, and Lamm shared lead vocal duties. The group initially called themselves The Big Thing, then changed to the Chicago Transit Authority in 1968, and finally shortened the name to Chicago in 1969.

Laudir de Oliveira joined the band as a percussionist and second drummer in 1974. Kath died in 1978 and was replaced by several guitarists in succession. Bill Champlin joined in 1981, providing vocals, keyboards, and rhythm guitar. Cetera left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Jason Scheff. Seraphine left in 1990 and was replaced by Tris Imboden. Although the band&#x27;s lineup has been more fluid since 2009, Lamm, Loughnane, and Pankow have remained constant members. Parazaider &quot;officially retired&quot; in 2017, but is still a band member. In 2021, he revealed he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In September 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Chicago at number thirteen in a list of the top 100 artists of all time for Hot 100 singles chart success, and ranked them at number fifteen on that same list in October 2015. &quot;Billboard&quot; also ranked Chicago ninth on the list of the 100 greatest artists of all time in terms of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart success in October 2015. Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the world&#x27;s best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records. In 1971, Chicago was the first rock act to sell out Carnegie Hall for a week. Chicago is also considered a pioneer in rock music marketing, featuring a recognizable logo on album covers, and sequentially naming their albums using Roman numerals.

In terms of chart success, Chicago is one of the most successful American bands in Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and &quot;Billboard&quot; history (second only to the Beach Boys), and are one of the most successful popular music acts of all time. To date, Chicago has sold over 40 million units in the U.S., with 23 gold, 18 platinum, and eight multi-platinum albums. They had five consecutive number-one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 20 top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and in 1974 the group had seven albums, its entire catalog at the time, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 simultaneously. The group has received ten Grammy Award nominations, winning one for the song &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, released in 1969, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014. The original line-up of Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2017, Cetera, Lamm, and Pankow were elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Chicago received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on October 16, 2020.

== Group history ==
=== The Big Thing ===
The group now known as Chicago began on February 15, 1967, at a meeting involving saxophonist Walter Parazaider, guitarist Terry Kath, drummer Danny Seraphine, trombonist James Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughnane, and keyboardist/singer Robert Lamm. Kath, Parazaider, and Seraphine had played together previously in two other groups—Jimmy Ford and the Executives, and the Missing Links. Parazaider had met Pankow and Loughnane when they were all students at DePaul University. Lamm, a student at Roosevelt University, was recruited from his group, Bobby Charles and the Wanderers. The group of six called themselves the Big Thing, and like most other groups playing in Chicago nightclubs, played Top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a tenor to complement baritones Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm&#x27;s use of organ bass pedals did not provide &quot;adequate bass sound&quot;, local tenor and bassist Peter Cetera was invited to join the Big Thing in late 1967.

=== Chicago Transit Authority and early success ===
While gaining some success as a cover band, the group began working on original songs. In June 1968, at manager James William Guercio&#x27;s request, the Big Thing moved to Los Angeles, California, where they signed with Columbia Records and changed their name to Chicago Transit Authority. While performing on a regular basis at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in West Hollywood, the band got exposure to more famous musical artists of the time, subsequently opening for Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. Group biographer William James Ruhlmann recorded Walt Parazaider as saying that Jimi Hendrix once told him: Jeez, your horn players are like one set of lungs and your guitar player is better than me.

Their first record (April 1969), &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, is a double album, a rarity for a band&#x27;s initial studio release. The album made it to No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, sold over one million copies by 1970, and was awarded a platinum disc. The album included a number of pop-rock songs – &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot;, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; – which were later released as singles. For this inaugural recording effort the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for 1969 Best New Artist of the Year.

According to Cetera, the band was booked to perform at Woodstock in 1969, but promoter Bill Graham, with whom they had a contract, exercised his right to reschedule them to play at the Fillmore West on a date of his choosing, and he scheduled them for the Woodstock dates. Santana, which Graham also managed, took Chicago&#x27;s place at Woodstock, and that performance is considered to be Santana&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot; gig. A year later, when he needed to replace headliner Joe Cocker, and then Cocker&#x27;s intended replacement, Jimi Hendrix, Graham booked Chicago to perform at Tanglewood, which has been called a &quot;pinnacle&quot; performance by Concert Vault.

After the release of their first album, the band&#x27;s name was shortened to Chicago to avoid legal action being threatened by the actual mass-transit company of the same name.

=== 1970s: &quot;Chicago&quot; ===
In 1970, less than a year after its first album, the band released a second album, titled &quot;Chicago&quot; (retroactively known as &quot;Chicago II&quot;), which is another double-LP. The album&#x27;s centerpiece track is a seven-part, 13-minute suite composed by Pankow called &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot;. The suite yielded two top ten hits: &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (No. 9 U.S.) and &quot;Colour My World&quot;, both sung by Kath. Among the other tracks on the album: Lamm&#x27;s dynamic but cryptic &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (Chicago&#x27;s first Top 5 hit), which is a reference to a songwriter trying to write at 25 or 26 minutes before 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning, and was sung by Cetera with Terry Kath on guitar; the lengthy war-protest song &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;; and, at the end, Cetera&#x27;s 1969 Moon landing-inspired &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot; The double-LP album&#x27;s inner cover includes the playlist, the entire lyrics to &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;, and two declarations: &quot;This endeavor should be experienced sequentially&quot;, and, &quot;With this album, we dedicate ourselves, our futures and our energies to the people of the revolution. And the revolution in all of its forms.&quot; The album was a commercial success, rising to number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1970, and platinum in 1991. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards as a result of this album, Album of the Year and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus.

&quot;Chicago III&quot;, another double LP, was released in 1971 and charted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Two singles were released from it: &quot;Free&quot; from Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Travel Suite&quot;, which charted at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; and &quot;Lowdown&quot;, written by Cetera and Seraphine, which made it to No. 35. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1971, and platinum in November 1986.

The band released LPs at a rate of at least one album per year from their third album in 1971 on through the 1970s. During this period, the group&#x27;s album titles primarily consisted of the band&#x27;s name followed by a Roman numeral, indicating the album&#x27;s sequence in their canon. The exceptions to this scheme were the band&#x27;s fourth album, a live boxed set entitled &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot;, their twelfth album &quot;Hot Streets&quot;, and the Arabic-numbered &quot;Chicago 13&quot;. While the live album itself did not bear a number, the four discs within the set were numbered Volumes I through IV.

In 1971, the band released &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall Volumes I, II, III, and IV&quot;, a quadruple LP, consisting of live performances, mostly of music from their first three albums, from a week-long run at Carnegie Hall. Chicago was the first rock act to sell out a week at Carnegie Hall and the live recording was made to chronicle that milestone. Along with the four vinyl discs, the packaging contained some strident political messaging about how &quot;We [youth] can change The System&quot;, including wall posters and voter registration information. The album went gold &quot;out of the box&quot; and on to multi-platinum status. William James Ruhlmann says &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; was &quot;perhaps&quot; the best-selling box set by a rock act and held that record for 15 years. In recognition of setting Carnegie Hall records and the ensuing four-LP live recordings, the group was awarded a &quot;Billboard&quot; 1972 Trendsetter Award. Drummer Danny Seraphine attributes the fact that none of Chicago&#x27;s first four albums were issued on single LPs to the productive creativity of this period and the length of the jazz-rock pieces.

In 1972, the band released its first single-disc release, &quot;Chicago V&quot;, which reached No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop and jazz album charts. It features &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot;, written by Robert Lamm, which mixes everyday life and political yearning in a more subtle way. It peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1972. The second single released from the album was the Lamm-composed &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot;, which featured a musical &quot;debate&quot; between a political activist (sung by Kath) and a blasé college student (sung by Cetera). It peaked at No. 24 on the Hot 100 chart.

Other albums and singles followed in each of the succeeding years. 1973&#x27;s &quot;Chicago VI&quot; was the first of several albums to include Brazilian jazz percussionist Laudir de Oliveira and saw Cetera emerge as the main lead singer. According to William James Ruhlmann, de Oliveira was a &quot;sideman&quot; on &quot;Chicago VI&quot; and became an official member of the group in 1974. &quot;Chicago VI&quot; featured two top ten singles, &quot;Just You &#x27;n&#x27; Me&quot;, written by Pankow, and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Stronger Every Day&quot;, written by Pankow and Cetera. &quot;Chicago VII&quot; was the band&#x27;s double-disc 1974 release. Three singles were released from this album: &quot;(I&#x27;ve Been) Searchin&#x27; So Long&quot;, written by Pankow, and &quot;Call On Me&quot;, written by Loughnane, which both made it into the top ten; and the Beach Boys-infused &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;, written by Cetera, which peaked at number eleven. Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Joel Whitburn reported in October 1974 that the group had seven albums, its entire catalog at the time, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 simultaneously, placing them seventh in a list of artists in that category. Their 1975 release, &quot;Chicago VIII&quot;, featured the political allegory &quot;Harry Truman&quot; (No. 13, Top 100 chart) and the nostalgic Pankow-composed &quot;Old Days&quot; (No. 5, Top 100 chart). That summer also saw a joint tour across America with the Beach Boys, with the two acts performing separately, then coming together for a finale. &quot;Chicago VI&quot;, &quot;VII&quot;, and &quot;VIII&quot; all made it to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, all were certified gold the years they were released, and all have since been certified platinum. &quot;Chicago VI&quot; was certified two times multi-platinum in 1986. &quot;Chicago IX: Chicago&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; was released in 1975 and became the band&#x27;s fifth consecutive No. 1 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&quot;.&quot;

1976&#x27;s &quot;Chicago X&quot; features Cetera&#x27;s ballad &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, which held the top spot in the U.S. charts for two weeks and the UK charts for three weeks. It was the group&#x27;s first No. 1 single, and won Chicago their only Grammy Award to date, the 1976 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards held on February 19, 1977. The single was certified gold by the RIAA the same year of its release. The song almost did not make the cut for the album. &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; was recorded at the last minute. The success of the song, according to William James Ruhlmann, foreshadowed a later reliance on ballads. The album reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified both gold and platinum by the RIAA the same year of its release and two times multi-platinum since, and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. 1976 was the first year that albums were certified platinum by the RIAA. In honor of the group&#x27;s platinum album achievement, Columbia Records that year awarded the group a 25-pound bar of pure platinum, made by Cartier. (&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported it as a 30-pound bar.) At the 4th Annual American Music Awards, a fan-voted awards show, held January 31, 1977, Chicago won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, the group&#x27;s first of two American Music Awards they have received.

The group&#x27;s 1977 release, &quot;Chicago XI&quot;, includes Cetera&#x27;s ballad &quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot;, a No. 4 U.S. hit which became the group&#x27;s last top 10 hit of the decade. &quot;Chicago XI&quot; performed well commercially, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and reaching platinum status during the year of its release. On October 17, 1977, during the intermission of an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concert, Madison Square Garden announced its new Gold Ticket Award, to be given to performers who had brought the venue over 100,000 in unit ticket sales. Because the arena has a seating capacity of about 20,000, this would require a minimum of five sold-out shows there. Chicago was one of at least eleven other acts that were eligible for the award, and weeks later, at its October 28, 1977, Madison Square Garden concert, Chicago was one of the first acts to receive the award for drawing over 180,000 people to the venue in nine sold-out appearances there over the years. &quot;Cashbox&quot; reviewer Ken Terry said of the 1977 Madison Square Garden concert, &quot;Chicago ultimately presents itself in the best light with AM-oriented, good-time music. Its fans are not looking for complicated, introverted songs; they want music to drive to, dance to and work to.&quot;

Besides recording and touring, during the busy 1970s, Chicago also made time for a movie appearance and several television appearances of note. In 1972, Guercio produced and directed &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;, a film about an Arizona motorcycle policeman. Released in 1973, the film stars Robert Blake and features Cetera, Kath, Loughnane, and Parazaider in supporting roles. The group also appears prominently on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Chicago made its &quot;television variety debut&quot; in February 1973 when they were the only rock musicians invited to appear on a television special honoring Duke Ellington, &quot;Duke Ellington... We Love You Madly&quot;, which aired on CBS. They performed the Ellington composition, &quot;Jump for Joy&quot;. In July 1973, the group starred in a half-hour television special produced by Dick Clark, &quot;Chicago in the Rockies&quot;, which aired in prime time on ABC. The show was filmed on location at Caribou Ranch, the 3,000-acre ranch-turned-recording studio located outside of Boulder, Colorado, owned by Chicago&#x27;s producer, James William Guercio. The only musical guest on the show was Al Green, who was rated the number-one male vocalist of 1972, and whom &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named &quot;Rock and Roll Star of the Year&quot;. That special was followed by a second hour-long special the next year, &quot;Chicago ... Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch&quot;, which aired in prime time on ABC in August 1974. &quot;Chicago ... Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch&quot; was again shot on location at Caribou Ranch and was again produced by Dick Clark. Singer Anne Murray and country music star Charlie Rich were guests on the show. Clark produced a third television special starring Chicago, &quot;Chicago&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 1975&quot;, which aired on ABC on December 31, 1974. Musical guests on the -hour-long show included the Beach Boys, the Doobie Brothers, Olivia Newton-John, and Herbie Hancock. It was the third &quot;Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; Clark had produced, and it competed with Guy Lombardo&#x27;s traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve television show which aired on a different network and was in its 45th consecutive year of broadcast. Clark hoped the &quot;Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; format would become an &quot;annual TV custom&quot;.

==== Death of Terry Kath and transition ====
The year 1978 began with a split with Guercio. Chicago had recorded its last five studio albums &quot;Chicago VI&quot;, &quot;VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;XI,&quot; and had made two television specials at Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch. In later years, band members cited Guercio&#x27;s purchase of Caribou Ranch, more particularly their realization that Guercio had enough money to purchase Caribou Ranch, as a contributing factor to their disillusionment with him as a producer. They felt he had taken advantage of them financially. Then on January 23 of that same year, Kath died of an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound from a gun he thought was unloaded. Doc Severinsen, who was the bandleader for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; at the time and a friend of the group, visited them after Kath&#x27;s funeral and encouraged them to continue. According to writer Jim Jerome, the visit &quot;snapped them back&quot; and helped them make the decision to carry on.

After auditioning over 30 potential replacements for Kath, Chicago decided upon guitarist and singer-songwriter Donnie Dacus. While filming for the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, he joined the band in April 1978 just in time to record the &quot;Hot Streets&quot; album. Its energetic lead-off single, &quot;Alive Again&quot;, brought Chicago back to the Top 15; Pankow wrote it &quot;originally as a love song but ultimately as recognition of Kath&#x27;s guiding spirit shining down from above&quot;.

The 1978 album &quot;Hot Streets&quot; was produced by Phil Ramone. It was Chicago&#x27;s first album with a title rather than a number; and was the band&#x27;s first LP to have a picture of the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) featured prominently on the cover (with the ubiquitous logo downsized). These two moves were seen by many as indications that the band had changed following Kath&#x27;s death. To a degree, the band returned to the old naming scheme on its subsequent releases, although most titles now bore Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. &quot;Hot Streets&quot;, the band&#x27;s 12th album, peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts; it was Chicago&#x27;s first release since their debut to fail to make the Top 10. According to Jeff Giles, &quot;Although Chicago quickly soldiered on [after Kath&#x27;s death], releasing their &quot;Hot Streets&quot; album with new guitarist Donnie Dacus that October, it was impossible not to notice the loss of momentum.&quot; The release also marked a move somewhat away from the jazz-rock direction favored by Kath and towards more pop songs and ballads. Dacus stayed with the band through the 1979 album &quot;Chicago 13&quot;, and is also featured in a promotional video on the DVD included in the Rhino Records Chicago box set from 2003. Again produced by Ramone, it was the group&#x27;s first studio album not to contain a Top 40 hit. Dacus departed from the band following the conclusion of the concert tour in support of &quot;Chicago 13&quot;, in 1980.

=== 1980s: changing sound ===
&quot;Chicago XIV&quot; (1980), produced by Tom Dowd, relegated the horn section to the background on a number of tracks, and the album&#x27;s two singles failed to make the Top 40. Chris Pinnick joined the band to play guitar and remained through 1985, and the band were also augmented by saxophone player Marty Grebb on the subsequent tour. Marty Grebb had formerly been with the Buckinghams, and before that had been Cetera&#x27;s bandmate in a local Chicago area cover band called the Exceptions. The album peaked at No. 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and failed to reach gold certification by the RIAA. Believing the band to no longer be commercially viable, Columbia Records dropped them from its roster in 1981 and released a second greatest hits volume (counted as &quot;Chicago XV&quot; in the album chronology) later that year to fulfill its contractual obligation.

In late 1981, the band had new management, a new producer (David Foster), a new label (Warner Bros. Records), and the addition of keyboardist, guitarist, and singer Bill Champlin (Sons of Champlin). Percussionist Laudir de Oliveira and Marty Grebb departed from the band. During Foster&#x27;s stewardship, less of an emphasis was placed on the band&#x27;s horn-based sound, being replaced by lush power ballads, which became Chicago&#x27;s style during the 1980s. The new sound brought more singles success to the band.

For the 1982 album &quot;Chicago 16&quot;, the band worked with composers from outside the group for the first time, and Foster brought in studio musicians for some tracks (including the core members of Toto), and used new technology (such as synthesizers) to &quot;update&quot; and streamline the sound, further pushing back the horn section, and in some cases not even using them at all. The band did return to the charts with the Cetera-sung ballad &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry/Get Away&quot;, which is featured in the soundtrack of the Daryl Hannah film &quot;Summer Lovers&quot;. Co-written by Cetera and David Foster, &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was the group&#x27;s second single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart and gave them a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Chicago 16&quot; reached both gold and platinum status during the year of its release, and went to No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

1984&#x27;s &quot;Chicago 17&quot; became the biggest selling album in the band&#x27;s history, certified by the RIAA in 1997 as six times multi-platinum. The album produced two more Top Ten (both No. 3) singles, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, written by Cetera and David Foster, and &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, written by Steve Kipner and John Lewis Parker. The single, &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, brought two more Grammy Award nominations for the band, for Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The album included two other singles: &quot;Stay the Night&quot; (No. 16), another composition by Cetera and Foster; and &quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; (No. 14), written by Cetera and Mark Goldenberg. Peter&#x27;s brother, Kenny Cetera, who had provided background vocals on the &quot;Chicago 17&quot; album, was brought into the group for the &quot;17&quot; tour to add percussion and high harmony vocals.

By 1985, the band was embracing the newest medium, the music video channel MTV, by releasing music videos for four songs. They featured a track titled &quot;Good for Nothing&quot; on the 1985 global activist album, &quot;We Are the World&quot;. As contributors to the album, along with all other artists who were on the album, the band received its last nomination for a Grammy Award, for Album of the Year.

At the 13th Annual American Music Awards, held January 27, 1986, Chicago won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group for the second time. It is the last American Music Award the band has received.

==== Peter Cetera departure and continued success ====
Concurrently with Chicago&#x27;s existing career, vocalist Peter Cetera had begun a solo career. He proposed an arrangement with the band where they would take hiatuses after tours to let him focus on solo work (mirroring that of Phil Collins and Genesis), but the band declined. Cetera ultimately left Chicago in the summer of 1985. He soon topped the charts with &quot;Glory of Love&quot; (the theme song of the film &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;), and with &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot; (a duet with Amy Grant). Two more songs reached the top ten: a 1988 solo hit called &quot;One Good Woman&quot; (No. 4 U.S.), and a 1989 duet with Cher called &quot;After All&quot; (No. 6 U.S.). In 1992, Cetera released his fourth studio album, &quot;World Falling Down&quot;, which earned him three hits on the Adult Contemporary charts, including the single &quot;Restless Heart&quot;. Cetera&#x27;s former position was filled by bassist and singer-songwriter Jason Scheff, son of Elvis Presley&#x27;s bassist Jerry Scheff. Guitarist Chris Pinnick also left the group in 1985, prior to the recording of the band&#x27;s next album.

For the final Foster-produced album, &quot;Chicago 18&quot;, the band filled Pinnick&#x27;s spot with several session guitarists, none of whom became band members. The album was released on September 29, 1986, and included the No. 3 single &quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot;, and top 20 single &quot;If She Would Have Been Faithful...&quot;, in addition to an updated version of &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; with a video that got airplay on MTV. The video won an award for Best Cinematography for Bobby Byrne at the American Video Awards. Soon after the album was recorded, the band hired guitarist Dawayne Bailey, formerly of Bob Seger&#x27;s Silver Bullet Band. Bailey and Scheff had previously played in bands together, so Scheff introduced Bailey to the band in time for the &quot;Chicago 18&quot; tour.

For the 1988 release &quot;Chicago 19&quot;, the band had replaced producer Foster with co-producers Ron Nevison, who had recently produced two albums for Heart, and Chas Sanford, who had worked with Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks. They topped the charts again with the Diane Warren-composed single &quot;Look Away&quot;. It was the third and last Chicago single to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart. The song ultimately was named as the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 Song of the Year&quot; for 1989. The album also yielded two more top 10 hits, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, both with Champlin singing lead vocals, and the Scheff-sung No. 55 single, &quot;We Can Last Forever&quot;, in addition to including the original version of a top 5 single titled &quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot;. The latter, also sung by Scheff, was remixed for inclusion on the band&#x27;s forthcoming greatest hits record (and 20th album), &quot;Greatest Hits 1982–1989&quot;, and it was this version that became a hit.

=== 1990s: more changes and &quot;Stone of Sisyphus&quot; ===

The beginning of the 1990s brought yet another departure. Original drummer Danny Seraphine was dismissed from the band in May 1990. Seraphine was succeeded by Tris Imboden, a longtime drummer with Kenny Loggins and former session drummer with Peter Cetera. Imboden made his first appearance on the 1991 album &quot;Twenty 1&quot; with a fragment of band&#x27;s logo, which yielded an eleven-week stretch on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, a peak at No. 66, and the song &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Wind&quot; which peaked at No. 39. &quot;Twenty 1&quot; would be their last released album of original music for fifteen years.

The band was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 23, 1992.

In 1993, Chicago wrote and recorded their 22nd album &quot;Stone of Sisyphus&quot;. This album was to have marked their return to their traditional composition of the 1970s, emphasizing major horn accompaniment. However, following a reorganization of the record company, the new executives at Reprise Records (now part of the newly formed Warner Music Group) rejected the completed album. It remained unpublished for fifteen years, aside from bootleg tapes and Internet files. This contributed to the parting of the band from the record label. The band was dismayed by the failure of the label. Upset with the shelving of the album, Dawayne Bailey voiced his objections and his annual contract was not renewed by the band in late 1994. And in the years that followed there were many debates and conjecture about the events surrounding the recordings. It was also suggested some years later that the band&#x27;s management was negotiating with the label regarding a licensing of the extensive Chicago back catalog, and when those talks stalled, the label apparently retaliated by scrapping the project. The album eventually saw an expanded release on Rhino Records in June 2008, and made it to No. 122 on the album charts.

After finishing their 1994 tour, and after signing with the Warner Bros. Records imprint label Giant Records, they released their 1995 album &quot;Night &amp; Day: Big Band&quot;, consisting of covers of songs originally recorded by Sarah Vaughan, Glenn Miller, and Duke Ellington. Guitarist Bruce Gaitsch stepped in and joined the band to handle the album&#x27;s guitar work. The album featured guest appearances by Paul Shaffer of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; fame, Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, and The Gipsy Kings. Parazaider cited the group&#x27;s participation in the 1973 television special honoring Duke Ellington, &quot;Duke Ellington... We Love You Madly&quot;, as key in their decision to record this album. After this big band album, Chicago acquired the rights to their Columbia recordings and reissued them on their own imprint. In early 1995, Keith Howland, who had been a studio musician and stage hand based in Los Angeles, was recruited as Chicago&#x27;s new permanent guitarist.

In 1998, Chicago released &quot;Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album&quot; and a live album in 1999, &quot;Chicago XXVI&quot; on their own imprint.

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, the band licensed their entire recorded output to Rhino Records, after having recorded it at Columbia Records and Warner Bros. Records. In 2002, Rhino released a two-disc compilation, &quot;The Very Best of Chicago: Only The Beginning&quot;, which spanned the band&#x27;s career. The compilation made the Top 40 and sold over 2 million copies in the U.S. Rhino also began releasing remastered versions of all of the band&#x27;s Columbia-era albums. The following year, the band released their most comprehensive compilation to date in the form of a box set, simply titled &quot;The Box&quot;. In October 2003, Rhino reissued &quot;Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album&quot;, along with six new recordings, as &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be, Santa?&quot;.

The American cable music channel VH1 featured the band in an episode of its &quot;Behind the Music&quot; series, &quot;Chicago: Behind the Music&quot;, season 1, episode 133. The episode first aired on October 15, 2000.

In 2004, 2005, and 2009, Chicago toured with Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.

On March 21, 2006, their first all-new studio album since &quot;Twenty 1&quot; arrived with &quot;Chicago XXX&quot;. It was produced by Jay DeMarcus, bassist/vocalist with the country trio Rascal Flatts, who was a long-time fan of Chicago and had cited the group as an influence on him as a musician in a previous fan letter to Jason Scheff. It also marked the first time the band&#x27;s music was available as a digital download. The album peaked at No. 41 in the U.S., spawning two minor adult contemporary hits: &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Love Will Come Back&quot;. Two songs from this album, &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Caroline&quot;, were performed live during Chicago&#x27;s fall 2005 tour.

Chicago made multi-week appearances at the MGM Grand Las Vegas in March, May and October 2006. In July 2006, the band made a series of U.S. appearances with Huey Lewis and the News.

On October 2, 2007, Rhino Records released the two-disc &quot;The Best of Chicago: 40th Anniversary Edition&quot; (&quot;Chicago XXXI&quot;), a new greatest hits compilation spanning their entire forty years, similar to &quot;The Very Best of: Only the Beginning&quot;, released five years earlier.

In 2008, &quot;Stone of Sisyphus&quot; – once known as the aborted &quot;Chicago XXII&quot;, now listed officially as &quot;Chicago XXXII&quot; – was released with an expanded format.

Drew Hester, who was the percussionist and drummer for the Foo Fighters, joined the band in January 2009 to temporarily fill in for an ill Imboden, and continued with the band as a percussionist upon Imboden&#x27;s return later in the year. In August 2009, Champlin was fired from the band. He was replaced by Grammy-nominated keyboardist Lou Pardini, who had worked with Stevie Wonder and Santana.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010 (just as they had already done in 1999 and 2008), Chicago toured with the Doobie Brothers (and would do so again in 2017). A 2011 performance in Chicago became a video for the HDNet cable channel that featured the Doobie Brothers joining Chicago for three encore tunes. The band also appeared on the season nine finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. On July 24, 2011, the band performed at Red Rocks in Colorado, accompanied by the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.

With &quot;Chicago XXXIII: O Christmas Three,&quot; the band re-teamed with producer Ramone (he had previously released the new tracks for the expanded Christmas re-release &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Be, Santa?&quot;) to record a new Christmas album. Dolly Parton was a guest artist on the album, which was released in October 2011. In the meantime, Rhino released &quot;Chicago XXXIV: Live in &#x27;75&quot;, a two-disc set containing two hours of previously unreleased performances recorded June 24–26, 1975 at the Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland, featuring the original members of Chicago performing some of their greatest hits up to that point. In 2012, Chicago and the Doobie Brothers held another joint tour. That same year, Hester left the group shortly before the tour, and was succeeded at first by percussionist Daniel de los Reyes, then by Daniel&#x27;s brother and former long-term Santana member, Walfredo Reyes Jr.

In 2013, Lamm, Loughnane, Pankow, and Parazaider appeared in the HBO film &quot;Clear History&quot; as the band Chicago. In late 2013, the band began releasing singles for a new album, starting with &quot;Somethin&#x27; Comin&#x27;, I Know&quot; in August, &quot;America&quot; in September, &quot;Crazy Happy&quot; in December 2013, and &quot;Naked in the Garden of Allah&quot; in January 2014. The album, titled &quot;Chicago XXXVI: Now&quot;, was released on July 4, 2014.

The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, released in 1969, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2014. On January 25 and 28, 2014 Chicago performed two concerts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In February 2015, Chicago released a two-disc live album, &quot;Chicago at Symphony Hall&quot;, of their performances with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

In 2015, Chicago was listed among the nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The original lineup – Cetera, Kath, Lamm, Loughnane, Pankow, Parazaider, and Seraphine – was inducted at the 31st annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 8, 2016, along with N.W.A., Deep Purple, Steve Miller, and Cheap Trick. In February 2016, it was announced that original drummer Danny Seraphine would join the current lineup of Chicago for the first time in over 25 years for the Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. Peter Cetera chose not to attend. Terry Kath&#x27;s daughter Michelle accepted her father&#x27;s award. 
Chicago and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire embarked on another tour together in 2015 and 2016. In July 2016, Chicago performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

On September 23, 2016, a documentary called &quot;The Terry Kath Experience&quot; was released. The documentary featured most of the members of Chicago talking about Kath&#x27;s life (most notably Kath&#x27;s second wife Camelia Kath and original Chicago bassist Peter Cetera). It was directed by Kath&#x27;s daughter, Michelle Kath Sinclair.

After taking a temporary leave in May 2016, citing &quot;family health reasons&quot;, it was announced on October 25, 2016, that Jason Scheff had left Chicago after 31 years. Bassist/vocalist Jeff Coffey, who had been filling in for Scheff during his absence, was promoted to a full-time member. Saxophonist Ray Herrmann, who had previously filled in for Parazaider on various tour dates since 2005, also became an official member at this time after Parazaider retired permanently from the road. Although Parazaider retired from regular touring, he remained a band member.

In January 2017, CNN Films aired a two-hour biographical documentary film on the group titled &quot;Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago.&quot; The film was directed and edited by Peter Pardini, nephew of band member Lou Pardini, and produced by the band. The film&#x27;s premiere was the highest-rated program in the 25–54 demographic. The film won the 2016 &quot;Best of the Fest&quot; Audience Choice Award at the Sedona International Film Festival. At the 10th Annual Fort Myers Beach Film Festival in 2016, it won the &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; award and Peter Pardini won the &quot;Rising Star Award&quot; as director and filmmaker.

On February 22, 2017, it was announced that Cetera, Lamm, and Pankow were among the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees for their songwriting efforts as members of Chicago. The induction event was held Thursday, June 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.

Chicago&#x27;s website stated that in 2017, the band was working on a new album, &quot;Chicago XXXVII&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Chicago News 2/22/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2017, former percussionist Laudir de Oliveira died of a heart attack while performing onstage in his native Rio de Janeiro.

Chicago began their 2018 touring schedule on Saturday, January 13 by performing the grand opening concert at the new Xcite Center at Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.

On Wednesday, January 17, 2018, drummer Tris Imboden announced he was leaving the band after 27 years to spend more time with his family. On Friday, January 19, 2018, bassist and vocalist Jeff Coffey announced on his Facebook page that he was also departing from the band due to its heavy touring schedule. Chicago announced that percussionist Walfredo Reyes Jr. was moving over to drums, replacing Imboden. Vocalist Neil Donell, of Chicago tribute band Brass Transit, was chosen as the band&#x27;s new lead singer and session musician Brett Simons also joined the band as their new bassist. Daniel de los Reyes&#x27; return to the percussion position was announced, filling the vacancy left by his brother&#x27;s move to the drumset.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago news 1/29/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2018, Chicago released &quot;Chicago: VI Decades Live (This is What We Do)&quot;, a box set chronicling the band&#x27;s live performances throughout their history.

In May 2018, it was revealed that percussionist Daniel de los Reyes was departing Chicago to go back to his other group, the Zac Brown Band. On Thursday, May 17, 2018, Chicago announced on their official Facebook page and on their Twitter account that &quot;Ray&quot; Ramon Yslas had joined the band on percussion.

On June 29, 2018, Chicago released the album &quot;Chicago II: Live on Soundstage&quot;, a live performance from November 2017 of the then current band lineup performing the entire second album.

In July 2018 the band updated its official web site, and no longer listed Parazaider as a member of the band. Instead he is included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to Founding Members&quot;. Parazaider had retired from touring previously.

On October 26, 2018, Chicago released the album &quot;Chicago: Greatest Hits Live&quot;, a live performance from 2017 for the PBS series &quot;Soundstage&quot;.

On August 16, 2019, the band announced on their website that they would be releasing their fourth Christmas album, titled &quot;Chicago XXXVII: Chicago Christmas&quot;, on October 4, 2019. The album has a greater emphasis on original Christmas songs written by the group than their previous holiday albums.

=== 2020s ===

Chicago received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on October 16, 2020.

On April 19, 2021, Walter Parazaider released a statement that he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

During their 2021 summer tour, Lou Pardini was out for part of August and most of September, with Who keyboardist Loren Gold filling in until Pardini was able to return. On November 15, 2021, Howland broke his arm in an accident and took a leave of absence from the band, with guitarist Tony Obrohta filling in for him at shows. On December 1, 2021, Howland announced he was leaving Chicago after over 26 years, citing the recent accident and lengthy recovery period as bringing about the next phase of his life. The band confirmed Howland&#x27;s departure, and removed his name from band lineup page on their website. Tony Obrohta officially joined the group to replace Howland in December 2021.

In November 2021, Chicago and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys announced they will co-headline a 25 date tour in the summer of 2022.

On January 21, 2022, Lou Pardini announced he was departing the band. Loren Gold (vocals, keyboards) appeared with the group on tour filling the role vacated by Pardini starting in January 2022, and on March 2, 2022, Chicago updated their website to list Gold as a band member. On Friday, May 6, 2022, Chicago announced on their website that Brett Simons had departed the band and Eric Baines (bass, backing vocals) had joined the group. The group also announced plans to release a new album in the summer of 2022. Chicago released the single &quot;If This Is Goodbye&quot; on May 20, 2022. On July 15, 2022, Chicago released &quot;Chicago XXXVIII: Born for This Moment&quot;. In November 2023, Chicago and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire announced dates for the 2024 Heart and Soul joint tour.

== Approaches to music ==

=== Style ===

During his discussion of the formation of the band, original drummer Danny Seraphine says he wanted to form a group of talented, skilled musicians, with a horn section, &quot;that could play an inventive mix of rock and jazz.&quot; Walter Parazaider told writer, Paul Elliott, &quot;My idea was to make horns an integral part of a rock band.&quot; According to James Pankow, Chicago set out to be &quot;basically&quot; a rock and roll band with a horn section. Robert Lamm credits Walter Parazaider and Terry Kath for having the vision of &quot;a rock band with expanded instrumentation.&quot; Peter Robb wrote, &quot;The guys had all been influenced by show bands that would come into Chicago playing a variety of music. Those bands always had tenor sax, trumpet and trombone, Loughnane said.&quot;

On the occasion of the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Bobby Olivier, writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, described its style as &quot;chameleonic... shifting from esoteric jazz-rock, funk and soul to ... adult contemporary...&quot;. In a piece for &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, writer Jeff Giles details the band&#x27;s journey from being a &quot;progressive-leaning rock band with horns&quot; in its earlier years to &quot;an adult contemporary act&quot; by the end of the 1980s &quot;in order to stay commercially relevant.&quot;

In a 2021 interview published in &quot;Prog&quot;, Robert Lamm asserts that Chicago is and always has been a progressive rock band and that they were particularly influenced by Yes and King Crimson to write and record their lengthier tracks. In his view, the hit songs on their albums satisfied the record companies and allowed the band more freedom on the rest of the recorded material. As musicians, the group has always &quot;felt blessed enough to try anything at any time.&quot;

Chicago was deeply influenced by jazz, which culminated on their seventh album. Trumpeter Lee Loughnane holds that the term &quot;jazz rock&quot; was invented because of Chicago&#x27;s music. When asked why the band didn&#x27;t continue in its &quot;jazzy improv&quot; direction, Loughnane voiced his opinion that how the songwriters wrote was &quot;materially affected&quot; by changes in payment of royalties by the record companies and by the relatively short airplay time allowed for a song on the radio.

=== Songwriting ===
James Pankow has described the group&#x27;s songwriting process as &quot;organic&quot;, where one person comes up with a song and the other members come up with ideas for their parts. Pankow, one of the songwriters for the group, also has typically been arranger for the horn section. Robert Lamm, another of the group&#x27;s songwriters, sees the group members&#x27; contributions to individual songs more as arranging than co-writing, and says his songs were &quot;enhanced&quot; in the process.

=== Horn section ===
According to the &quot;Daily Press&quot;, Chicago&#x27;s horn section was &quot;the foundation of the sound that launched the band to stardom in the 1970s.&quot; Horns arranger James Pankow, speaking in 2017, said that when the band was being formed, they discussed how to make the horns a &quot;main character in a song&quot;. He said the horns are a big part of the band&#x27;s &quot;signature&quot; and that he &quot;took a melodic lead-voice approach to our horns, where the horn section becomes another lead vocal and interweaves in and around the actual vocals and becomes a part of the story of the song.&quot; In a separate interview that same year, Lee Loughnane echoed Pankow&#x27;s remarks.

== Philanthropy ==
Chicago has supported numerous charitable causes throughout the years.

In the 2010s the group had an ongoing partnership with the American Cancer Society. Fans were given the opportunity to bid to sing their song &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; with them on stage during their live performances. The proceeds went to the American Cancer Society to fund the Society&#x27;s efforts to fight breast cancer.

The group gave a benefit performance for Musicians on Call, on Sunday April 23, 2023, held at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square in New York City. Musicians on Call is a nonprofit organization that brings live and recorded music to the bedsides of patients, families and caregivers in healthcare settings. The group donated an autographed guitar to the event&#x27;s live auction and the $6,000 winning bid was made by singer Dionne Warwick. Chicago also did benefit performances for Musicians on Call in 2011, 2012, and 2022.

== Legacy ==
Chicago&#x27;s music has been used in the soundtracks of movies, television programs and commercials. Cetera&#x27;s composition from the 1976 album &quot;Chicago X&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, has appeared in the movies, &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;A Lot like Love&quot; (2005), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006), and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home 2&quot; (2017); the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;;  and a television commercial that aired during the 2000 Super Bowl. Robert Lamm&#x27;s song from the 1970 album &quot;Chicago II&quot;, &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, was used in the 2017 film &quot;I, Tonya&quot;, and on the animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; was used for the soundtracks of the movies, &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot; (2016), and &quot;Deadpool&quot; (2016); a 2017 Super Bowl commercial;  and the television series, &quot;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds.&quot; The song &quot;Hearts In Trouble&quot; was on the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;.

Other recording artists have covered Chicago&#x27;s music. According to the website &quot;SecondHandSongs&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; has been covered by over 90 recording artists from around the world, &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; by over 30, &quot;Colour My World&quot; by over 24, and &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; by over 18. In 2019, a reimagined hip-hop version of &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; by indie rapper realnamejames was featured in recruitment for the U.S. Army&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Your Warrior&quot; marketing campaign.

Chicago&#x27;s music has long been a staple of marching bands in the U.S. &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; was named as the number one marching band song by Kevin Coffey of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald,&quot; and as performed by the Jackson State University marching band, ranked number seven of the &quot;Top 20 Cover Songs of 2018 by HBCU Bands&quot;. The band performed &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; with the Notre Dame Marching Band on the football field during halftime on October 21, 2017. They performed again at a game against Bowling Green State University on October 5, 2019.

== Graphics ==

Upon being renamed from Chicago Transit Authority to Chicago, the band sported a new logo. Its inspiration was found in the design of the Coca-Cola logo, in the attitude of the city of Chicago itself, and in the desire to visually transcend the individual identities of the band&#x27;s members. It was designed by the art director of Columbia/CBS Records, John Berg, with each album&#x27;s graphic art work being done by Nick Fasciano. Berg said, &quot;The Chicago logo...was fashioned for me by Nick Fasciano from my sketch.&quot;

The logo would serve as the band&#x27;s chief visual icon from &quot;Chicago II&quot; onward. In various artistic forms and visual similes, it has been the subject of every subsequent album cover, except the fifteenth album, &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume II&quot;. For example, it appeared as an American flag on &quot;III&quot;, a piece of wood on &quot;V&quot;, a U.S. dollar bill on &quot;VI&quot;, a leather relief on &quot;VII&quot;, an embroidered patch on &quot;VIII&quot;, a chocolate bar on &quot;X&quot;, a map on &quot;XI&quot;, a building on &quot;13&quot;, a fingerprint on &quot;XIV&quot;, a computer silicon chip on &quot;16&quot;, a parcel on &quot;17&quot;, a mosaic on &quot;18&quot;, and an aquarelle on &quot;19&quot;. &quot;Chicago IX&quot;&#x27;s incarnation was a caricature of the band itself, in the shape of the logo.

The album cover series has endured as a cataloged work of art in its own right, described by Paul Nini of the American Institute of Graphic Arts as a &quot;real landmark in record cover design&quot;. In 2013, the iconic status of Chicago&#x27;s album art was featured in a New York art museum exhibit, which centered upon ninety-five album covers completely selected from John Berg&#x27;s career portfolio of hundreds. Having overseen the design of approximately fourteen Chicago album covers across more than twenty years, Berg stated that this artistic success resulted from the combination of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;unique situation&quot; and his position in &quot;the best possible job at the best possible time to have that job, at the center of the graphic universe&quot;. Berg won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Album Package for &quot;Chicago X&quot;, one of four Grammy Awards he won in his lifetime.

The book titled &quot;Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design&quot; described the logo as &quot;a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes in the tradition of sports teams and orange crate labels&quot;. The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of &quot;Chicago VII&quot; as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band&#x27;s namesake city, quoting the band&#x27;s original manager, James William Guercio: &quot;The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so if you must call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO.&quot;

== Personnel ==
As of July 2018, the three remaining active original members of Chicago are Lamm, Loughnane, and Pankow. Parazaider has retired from regular touring but is still considered as a band member, and has appeared with the group during certain events.

=== Band legal structure ===
The legal hierarchy of the band was illuminated in a July 2022 published interview with Robert Lamm, in which he, Pankow and Loughnane are identified as the &quot;partners&quot; and the rest of the members as &quot;contracted players&quot;. According to Lamm, the three partners control what the band does. The decision to record the 2022 album, &quot;Born for This Moment&quot;, depended largely on the consensus of the three partner members.

=== Status of Walter Parazaider ===
For several years, the exact status of Walter Parazaider as a current member or former member was unclear. A 2017 article said Parazaider retired due to a heart condition, but was still &quot;technically&quot; part of the group. Another 2017 article said that Ray Herrmann had become a full-time touring member, but that &quot;Parazaider is still a band member and performs with the group for certain events.&quot; According to a 2018 article, Parazaider &quot;officially retired&quot; in 2017. By August 10, 2018, Ray Herrmann was shown as a member of the band, and Parazaider was not, on the group&#x27;s official website. While Parazaider at times had been referred to as a non-touring member of the group, he did not appear on either of the studio albums released since his retirement, 2019&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Christmas,&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;Born for This Moment&quot;. In 2021, Parazaider revealed he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="168877" wikidata="Q83468" url="?curid=168877" title="Judas Priest">
<text>Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham in 1969. They have sold over 50 million albums and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Judas Priest have also been referred to as one of the pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) movement, and are cited as a formative influence on various metal subgenres, including speed metal, thrash metal, and power metal, as well as the hard rock/glam metal scene of the 1980s. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with poor record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when their sixth studio album &quot;British Steel&quot; brought them notable mainstream attention.

During the 1970s, the core of bassist Ian Hill, lead singer Rob Halford and guitarists Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing saw a revolving cast of drummers, before Dave Holland joined them for ten years from 1979 to 1989. Since Holland&#x27;s departure, Scott Travis has been the band&#x27;s drummer. Halford left Judas Priest in 1992, and after a four–year hiatus, they regrouped in 1996 with Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens (formerly of Winter&#x27;s Bane) replacing him. After two albums with Owens, Halford returned to the band in 2003. Downing left Judas Priest in 2011, replaced by Richie Faulkner. The current line-up consists of Hill, Tipton, Travis, Halford and Faulkner; although Tipton remains as an official member of the band, he has limited his touring activities since 2018 due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, with Andy Sneap filling in for him. Hill and Tipton are the only two members of the band to appear on every album.

Halford&#x27;s operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest&#x27;s image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing was widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to &quot;British Steel&quot; as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid-1990s, the band have once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors in 2006, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series. In 2022, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame via the Award for Musical Excellence.

== History ==
=== Origins (1969–1974) ===
Judas Priest were formed in 1969 in Birmingham, England, by lead vocalist Al Atkins and bassist Brian &quot;Bruno&quot; Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitars and John &quot;Fezza&quot; Partridge on drums. Perry took his own life at age 18, and amongst the replacements the band auditioned was future Judas Priest guitarist Kenneth &quot;K. K.&quot; Downing; at the time, they turned him down in favour of 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist Ernest Chataway, who had played with Birmingham band Black Sabbath when they were still called Earth. Stapenhill came up with the name Judas Priest from Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest&quot; on the album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;. Partridge was replaced in 1970 by drummer Fred Woolley, who later re-joined Chataway and Stapenhill in the band Bullion. No member of that early line-up lasted long enough to play on the band&#x27;s recordings, though several songs co-written by Atkins appeared on their first two albums.

The band recorded a two-song demo &quot;Good Time Woman&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll Stay Together&quot; and eventually gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in Walsall, but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band called Freight rehearsing without a singer, made up of K. K. Downing on guitars, his childhood friend Ian &quot;Skull&quot; Hill on bass, and drummer John Ellis. He joined them, and they took on Atkins&#x27; defunct band&#x27;s name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with Alan Moore. Early shows included Jimi Hendrix and Quatermass covers, and in 1972, the set list included the originals &quot;Never Satisfied&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, and the show-closer &quot;Caviar and Meths&quot;. July 1971 also saw them making a 45 rpm demo of &quot;Mind Conception&quot; with &quot;Holy is the Man&quot; on the B-side for the Zella Records label.

Moore left and was replaced with Chris &quot;Congo&quot; Campbell and the band joined the management agency of Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, Iommi Management Agency. Atkins continued to write material for the band—including &quot;Whiskey Woman&quot;, which became the base for the Judas Priest staple &quot;Victim of Changes&quot;—but as finances were tight and he had a family to support, he played his last gigs with the band in December 1972 and left the band in May 1973. Campbell left soon afterwards, later to surface in the band Machine, and the band enlisted two members of the band Hiroshima: drummer John Hinch and vocalist Rob Halford, the brother of Hill&#x27;s girlfriend. Halford and Hinch played their first show with the band in May 1973 at The Townhouse in Wellington. The show was recorded and part of it released in 2019 on the compilation &quot;Downer-Rock Asylum&quot; on the Audio Archives label along with one live song from the Atkins era.

Judas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and they returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label Gull. Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill in the band&#x27;s sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist Glenn Tipton, whose group The Flying Hat Band were also managed by Iommi&#x27;s agency.

=== &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; (1974–1975) ===
Judas Priest went into the studio in June–July 1974 with Black Sabbath producer Rodger Bain. The band released their debut single &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; that August and followed in September with the album of the same name. The album features a variety of styles—straight-up rock, heavy riffing, and progressive.

Technical problems during the recording contributed to the poor sound quality of the record. Producer Rodger Bain, whose resume included Black Sabbath&#x27;s first three albums and Budgie&#x27;s first album, dominated the production of the album and made decisions with which the band did not agree. Bain also chose to leave fan favourites from the band&#x27;s live set, such as &quot;Tyrant&quot;, &quot;Genocide&quot; and &quot;The Ripper&quot;, from the album and he cut the song &quot;Caviar and Meths&quot; from a 10-minute song down to a 2-minute instrumental.

The tour for &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; was the band&#x27;s first international tour with dates in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark including one show at Hotel Klubben in Tønsberg, one hour from Oslo, Norway, which scored them a somewhat negative review in the local press. The album flopped upon release, leaving Priest in dire financial straits. Priest attempted to secure a deal with Gull Records to get a monthly pay of £50, however, because Gull Records were struggling as well, they declined.

=== &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; (1975–1977) ===
Judas Priest performed &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1975, as well as the &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;–&quot;Deceiver&quot; pair the year before the songs appeared on &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. Hinch left the band for reasons that are disputed and was replaced with Alan Moore, who returned to the band in October 1975. Finances were tight: band members restricted themselves to one meal a day—and several took on part-time work—while they recorded their follow-up album on a budget of £2,000. The group intended to make an album mixing straight-ahead rock with a progressive edge.

The band recorded &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; over two weeks in November and December 1975 at Rockfield Studios in Wales. The band stayed sober during the 12-hour recording sessions. The cover depicts a struggling, grounded angel surrounded by flames and wearing a devil&#x27;s three-pronged cross, which became the band&#x27;s symbol. The album was released in March 1976, with &quot;The Ripper&quot; as lead single. The band supported the album with a headlining tour of the UK from April to June 1976. By this time Halford joked that fans should burn their copies of &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;.

The album had little commercial success at first and had difficulty getting noticed due to critical competition from the rise of punk rock, though it had a positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Fans, critics, and the band have since come to see &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; as the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image. It features heavy riffing and complex song arrangements that Tipton and Downing have said were inspired by the factories of the Black Country. The album&#x27;s centrepiece &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; evolved from a combination of Atkins&#x27; &quot;Whiskey Woman&quot; and Halford&#x27;s &quot;Red Light Woman&quot;, and went on to become a fan favourite.

The band grew dissatisfied with Gull; the tight finances led Moore to leave the band a second time—this time permanently. &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; caught the attention of , and with the help of new manager David Hemmings, the band signed with CBS and received a £60,000 budget for their next album. The signing required breaking their contract with Gull, resulting in the rights to the first two albums and all related recordings—including demos—becoming property of Gull. Gull periodically repackaged and re-released the material from these albums.

=== &quot;Sin After Sin&quot;, &quot;Stained Class&quot; and &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (1977–1979) ===
Judas Priest recorded their major-label debut, &quot;Sin After Sin&quot;, in January 1977 at The Who&#x27;s Ramport Studios, with Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover as producer. Moore left again during the album&#x27;s sessions and was replaced by session drummer Simon Phillips. The album features significant developments in heavy metal technique, in particular its use of double-kick drumming on tracks such as &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot;, and includes a pop-metal cover of &quot;Diamonds &amp; Rust&quot; by folk singer Joan Baez.

&quot;Sin After Sin&quot; appeared in April 1977. It was the first Priest record under a major label, CBS, and the first of eleven consecutive albums to be certified Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Phillips declined to become a permanent member of Judas Priest, so the band hired Les Binks on Glover&#x27;s recommendation. Together, they recorded 1978&#x27;s &quot;Stained Class&quot;, produced by Dennis MacKay, and &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (released in America as &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;). Binks, credited with co-writing &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot;, now regarded as one of the band&#x27;s classics, was an accomplished and technically skilled drummer and his addition added a dexterous edge to the band&#x27;s sound. Binks also played on &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot; (1979), which was recorded live in Japan during the Killing Machine tour. While the first three Judas Priest albums had considerable traces of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple in them, as well as ballads, &quot;Stained Class&quot; did not contain any ballads aside from &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot;. &quot;Killing Machine&quot; was the first nod to a more commercial sound, with simpler songs that brought back some blues influences. At about the same time, the band members adopted their now-famous &quot;leather-and-studs&quot; image.

=== Mainstream success years (1979–1991) ===

Following the release of &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (1978) was the live release from the supporting tour, &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot; (1979). It was the first of many Judas Priest albums to go platinum. There was some criticism of the band&#x27;s use of studio enhancements and overdubbing in what was marketed as a live album. By this point the playing style of the band had grown progressively heavier, with live versions of songs such as &quot;Exciter&quot;, &quot;Tyrant&quot; and &quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot; sounding much heavier and faster than their studio counterparts.

Les Binks quit in late 1979, as he was unhappy with the band&#x27;s manager Mike Dolan&#x27;s decision not to pay him for his performance on the live album, so they replaced him with Dave Holland, formerly of the band Trapeze. With this line-up, Judas Priest recorded six studio and one live album, which garnered different degrees of critical and financial success.

In 1980, the band released &quot;British Steel&quot;. The songs were shorter and had more mainstream radio hooks, but retained the familiar heavy metal feel. Tracks such as &quot;United&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;, and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; were frequently played on the radio. The next release, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Point of Entry&quot;, followed the same formula, and the tour in support of the album featured new songs such as &quot;Solar Angels&quot; and &quot;Heading Out to the Highway&quot;.

The 1982 album &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; featured &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot;, which became a major radio hit in the US. Songs such as &quot;Electric Eye&quot; and &quot;Riding on the Wind&quot; also appeared on this album, and proved to be popular live. &quot;(Take These) Chains&quot; (by Bob Halligan Jr) was released as a single and received heavy airplay. This album went Double Platinum.

On 29 May 1983, the band played on Heavy Metal Day of the US Festival, a music festival in San Bernardino, California sponsored by Steve Wozniak. The band was fourth in the line-up that also included Quiet Riot, Mötley Crüe, Ozzy Osbourne, Triumph, Scorpions, and Van Halen.
Priest continued their success through the mid-1980s. &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot;, released in 1983, was a regular on rock radio. Its album &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; was released the following year. Some critics dubbed it &quot;Screaming for Vengeance II&quot;, due to its musical similarity to the previous album.

On 13 July 1985, Judas Priest, along with Black Sabbath and other performers, played Live Aid at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. Their setlist included &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)&quot; and &quot;(You&#x27;ve Got) Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Turbo&quot; was released in April 1986. The band adopted a more colourful stage look and gave their music a more mainstream feel by adding guitar synthesizers. The album also went Platinum and had a successful arena tour in support, with 100 concerts in North America, Europe and Japan in 1986. A live album recorded on the tour, titled &quot;Priest...Live!&quot;, was released the next year, offering live tracks from the era. The video documentary &quot;Heavy Metal Parking Lot&quot; was created by Jeff Krulik and John Heyn in 1986. It documents the heavy metal fans waiting on 31 May 1986 for Priest&#x27;s concert (with special guests Dokken) at the Capital Center (later renamed US Airways Arena) in Landover, Maryland.
In May 1988, &quot;Ram It Down&quot; was released, featuring several reworked songs left over from &quot;Turbo&quot;, in addition to new songs. The band recorded three tracks with pop producers Stock-Aitken-Waterman: two originals, &quot;Runaround&quot; and &quot;I Will Return&quot;, and a cover of The Stylistics&#x27; hit &quot;You Are Everything&quot;. Producer Matt Aitken said of the sessions, &quot;I think it was ill-conceived, it was unlikely it was going to work. But we went into it with the spirit of optimism, and we did the best with them, within the parameters within which we would be prepared to work. We weren&#x27;t going to use live drum kits and stuff, and that probably made it a no go from the start. I have no idea why we were working with Judas Priest really, but I think we made a good fist of a heavy metal song. I think it sounded alright.&quot; The tracks were ultimately not included on this album due to a management decision.

A reviewer has called &quot;Ram It Down&quot; a &quot;stylistic evolution&quot; that resulted from the band&#x27;s &quot;attempt to rid themselves of the tech synthesiser approach ... and return to the traditional metal of their fading glory days&quot;. The reviewer argued the album showed &quot;how far behind they were lagging ... the thrashers they helped influence&quot; in earlier years. In 1989, longtime drummer Dave Holland left the band.

In September 1990, the &quot;Painkiller&quot; album used a new drummer, Scott Travis (formerly from Racer X), who gave the band an edgier sound thanks to his heavy use of double pedals. This comeback album also dropped the 1980s-style synthesisers for all songs except &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot;. The tour used bands such as Annihilator, Megadeth, Pantera, Sepultura and Testament as opening bands, and culminated in the Rock in Rio performance in Brazil in front of 100,000+ fans.

Part of the Judas Priest stage show often featured Halford riding onstage on a Harley-Davidson motorbike, dressed in motorcycle leathers and sunglasses. During a Toronto show in August 1991, Halford was seriously injured as he rode on stage, when he collided with a drum riser hidden behind clouds of dry ice mist. Though the show was delayed, he performed the set before going to a hospital. Hill later noted &quot;he must have been in agony&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Halford claimed the accident had nothing to do with his departure from the band.

==== Subliminal message trial ====
In 1990, Judas Priest was the subject of civil action in the United States which alleged that the band was responsible for an incident in Sparks, Nevada, in 1985 in which 20-year-old James Vance and 18-year-old Raymond Belknap shot themselves. On the evening of 23 December 1985, Vance and Belknap went to a church playground with a 12-gauge shotgun with the purpose of committing suicide. They had consumed alcohol and marijuana earlier that evening. The lawsuit alleged that the pair had been listening to Judas Priest&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Stained Class&quot; that night. Belknap was the first to place the shotgun under his chin, and died instantly after pulling the trigger. Some time later, Vance also shot himself, but succeeded only in disfiguring himself by blowing away the lower half of his face. Vance died three years later of a suspected drug overdose.

The Belknap and Vance families sued Judas Priest and its members, alleging that the band had embedded subliminal messages such as &quot;try suicide&quot;, &quot;do it&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s be dead&quot; in the band&#x27;s cover of the 1969 Spooky Tooth song &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot;. Judas Priest had recorded the cover at the urging of their record company after the rest of &quot;Stained Class&quot; had been completed. The plaintiffs alleged that this subliminal command was the trigger which led directly to the pair deciding to shoot themselves. Vance&#x27;s parents claimed that their son had been troubled for a long time prior to the suicide pact, but had recently &quot;changed for the better&quot; and had re-embraced his family&#x27;s Christian faith before the &quot;garbage music&quot; of Judas Priest had again led him astray.

Local fans of heavy metal protested during the trial, calling for Judas Priest to be exonerated. The plaintiffs played the song at various speeds and backward, alleging the use of backmasking. The trial lasted from 16 July to 24 August 1990, when the judge dismissed the lawsuit on the basis that the so-called subliminal message &quot;was a coincidental convergence of a guitar chord with an exhalation pattern&quot;. One of the defense witnesses, Dr. Timothy E. Moore, wrote an article for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; chronicling the trial. The trial was covered in a 1991 documentary film, &quot;Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest&quot;.

===Halford&#x27;s departure and Ripper years (1991–2003)===
After the &quot;Painkiller&quot; tour ended in August 1991, there were indications of internal tensions within the band. Halford went on to form a street-style thrash metal group named Fight, with Scott Travis on drums for the recording sessions. He formed this band to explore new musical territory, but due to contractual obligations, he remained with Judas Priest until May 1992. In his 2020 memoir &quot;Confess&quot;, Halford blamed his departure on a &quot;miscommunication&quot;, rather than an intentional desire to quit the band.

Halford collaborated with Judas Priest in the release of a compilation album entitled &quot;Metal Works &#x27;73–&#x27;93&quot; to commemorate their 20th anniversary. He also appeared in a video by the same title, documenting their history, in which his departure from the band was officially announced later that year.
The remaining members of Judas Priest spent the next few years searching for a replacement for Halford. Known singers who auditioned for, or were offered to join, the band during this period include Steve Grimmett (Grim Reaper, Lionsheart and ex-Onslaught), Ralf Scheepers (Primal Fear and ex-Gamma Ray), Whitfield Crane (Ugly Kid Joe), former Accept singer David Reece, and a then-unknown Devin Townsend. Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens (who had previously sung in Winter&#x27;s Bane and a Judas Priest tribute band called British Steel) was hired in 1996 as Judas Priest&#x27;s new singer. This line-up released two studio albums, &quot;Jugulator&quot; in 1997 (in 1999, the song &quot;Bullet Train&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance) and &quot;Demolition&quot; in 2001. A considerable stylistic departure from prior releases, the former has been characterised as groove metal and the latter as nu metal, both receiving mixed reviews. The line-up also gave rise to two live double-albums – &quot;&#x27;98 Live Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Live in London&quot; (2003), the latter of which had a live DVD counterpart.

In a February 1998 interview on MTV, Halford came out as gay.

=== Reunion and &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; (2003–2006) ===
After eleven years apart, faced with an ever-growing demand for a reunion, Judas Priest and Rob Halford announced they would reunite in July 2003, to coincide with the release of the &quot;Metalogy&quot; box set (despite Halford&#x27;s earlier insistence that he &quot;would never do it&quot;). They did a concert tour in Europe in 2004, and co-headlined the 2004 Ozzfest, being named as the &quot;premier act&quot; by almost all US media coverage of the event. Judas Priest and &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens parted amicably, with Owens joining American heavy metal band Iced Earth.

A new studio album, &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;, was released on 1 March 2005 (US) on Sony Music/Epic Records to critical and commercial success, earning the band a 2005 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best Album. A global tour in support of the album ensued. As for the band Halford, writing for the fourth release was cut off. After the Retribution tour in June 2006, however, Halford announced he would create his own record company, Metal God Entertainment, where he would release all his solo material under his own control. In November 2006 he remastered his back catalogue and released it exclusively through Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. Two new songs allegedly set for the fourth release, &quot;Forgotten Generation&quot; and &quot;Drop Out&quot;, were released through iTunes as well.
Along with Queen, Kiss and Def Leppard, Judas Priest was an inaugural inductee into the &quot;VH1 Rock Honors&quot;. The ceremony took place on 25 May 2006 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and first aired on 31 May. Their presentation was preceded by Godsmack performing a medley of &quot;Electric Eye&quot;/&quot;Victim of Changes&quot;/&quot;Hell Bent for Leather.&quot; Judas Priest then played &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;, &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot;, before which Halford rode a Harley-Davidson motorcycle onstage.

=== &quot;Nostradamus&quot; (2006–2010) ===
In a June 2006 interview with MTV.com, Halford said of the group&#x27;s concept album about the 16th-century French writer Nostradamus, &quot;Nostradamus is all about metal, isn&#x27;t he? He was an alchemist as well as a seer – a person of extraordinary talent. He had an amazing life that was full of trial and tribulation and joy and sorrow. He&#x27;s a very human character and a world-famous individual. You can take his name and translate it into any language and everybody knows about him, and that&#x27;s important because we&#x27;re dealing with a worldwide audience.&quot; In addition to digging new lyrical ground for the band, the album would contain musical elements which might surprise fans. &quot;It&#x27;s going to have a lot of depth&quot;, Halford said. &quot;There&#x27;ll be a lot of symphonic elements. We might orchestrate it, without it being overblown. There may be a massive choir at parts and keyboards will be featured more prominently, whereas they&#x27;ve always been in the background before.&quot; The album &quot;Nostradamus&quot; was released in June 2008; the band began a support tour in that same month.

In early February 2009, the band joined the ranks of bands speaking out against ticket-touting (&quot;scalping&quot;), issuing a statement condemning the practice of selling tickets at well above face value, and urging fans to buy tickets only from official sources. In the same month, Judas Priest continued their tour, bringing their &quot;Priest Feast&quot; (with guests Megadeth and Testament) to multiple arenas in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland in February and March 2009. From there the tour progressed to multiple venues in Sweden. Later in March, Judas Priest performed in Portugal (at Lisbon on the Atlantic Pavilion), which they had not visited since 2005. The tour then continued to Milan, Italy, and then Paris, France; Halford had last performed with Judas Priest in Paris in 1991.
From June through August 2009, Judas Priest completed a North American tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of &quot;British Steel&quot; (1980); the album was performed in its entirety on each tour date, with some other songs thrown in. This tour was to be a joint effort with fellow Englishman David Coverdale and Whitesnake. Unfortunately, Whitesnake would have to leave the tour after the show in Denver, Colorado on 11 August 2009 due to Coverdale falling ill with a serious throat infection; he was advised to stop singing immediately to avoid permanently damaging his vocal cords.

On 14 July 2009, Judas Priest released a new live album, featuring 11 previously unreleased live tracks from the 2005 and 2008 world tours, titled &quot;A Touch of Evil: Live&quot;. The performance of &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot; won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.

In May 2010, Halford said the band had been offered a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but &quot;we&#x27;ve just never been there when they wanted to do the ceremony.&quot; He also revealed that a &quot;Nostradamus&quot; tour was still being contemplated: &quot;We were in Hollywood recently and met with some producers and agents, so there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes.&quot;

=== Downing&#x27;s retirement and Epitaph World Tour (2010–2011) ===
Judas Priest announced on 7 December 2010, that their Epitaph World Tour would be the band&#x27;s farewell tour and would run up until 2012. In a January 2011 interview, Halford said about the band&#x27;s impending retirement: &quot;I think it&#x27;s time, you know. We&#x27;re not the first band to say farewell, it&#x27;s just the way everyone comes to at some point and we&#x27;re gonna say a few more things early next year, so I think the main thing that we just want to ask everybody to consider is don&#x27;t be sad about this, start celebrating and rejoicing over all the great things we&#x27;ve done in Judas Priest.&quot;
On 27 January 2011, it was announced that Judas Priest were in the process of writing new material; the band also clarified their plans for the future, saying, &quot;this is by no means the end of the band. In fact, we are presently writing new material, but we do intend this to be the last major world tour.&quot; Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles on 26 May of the new material Glenn Tipton said: &quot;It&#x27;s quite a mixed bag. Really, there&#x27;s more sentiment on this album. In a way, I suppose, it&#x27;s also our farewell album, although it might not be our last one. There are some anthems on there, which pay tribute to our fans&quot;.

On 20 April 2011, it was announced that K. K. Downing had retired from the band and would not complete the Epitaph World Tour. Downing cited differences with the band and the management, and a breakdown in their relationship. Richie Faulkner, guitarist for Lauren Harris&#x27; band, was announced as his replacement for the Epitaph World Tour. Downing&#x27;s retirement left bassist Ian Hill as the longest-serving member of the band.

On 25 May 2011, Judas Priest played during the finale of &quot;American Idol&quot; season 10 with James Durbin, making it their first live performance without K.K. Downing. The band played a mixture of two songs: &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;.

On 7 June 2011, the band announced that it planned to release the box set &quot;Single Cuts&quot;, a collection of singles, the following August.

=== &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot; (2011–2015) ===
In an August 2011 interview with Billboard, Halford explained that he and Tipton had &quot;about 12 or 14 tracks completely mapped out&quot; for a new studio album, with four of those tracks already recorded and mixed. The band made a point to take its time with the album, with Halford explaining &quot;I&#x27;m of the attitude it&#x27;ll be ready when it&#x27;s ready ... I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to slack off. We&#x27;re determined to do a lot of work and be just as dedicated as we&#x27;ve always been and take a lot of care and attention with all the songs. We&#x27;re not going to just bang this one out, so to speak.&quot;

On 13 September 2011, Priest announced its plans to release a new compilation album, &quot;The Chosen Few&quot;, a set of Priest songs chosen by other iconic heavy metal musicians.

On 5 June 2013, Halford confirmed that the Epitaph World Tour would not be the band&#x27;s final tour. On 22 December, Judas Priest released a short Christmas message on their official website, which confirmed that they would be releasing their next album in 2014.

On 17 March 2014 at the Ronnie James Dio Awards in Los Angeles, Halford announced that the band&#x27;s 17th studio album was finished. On 28 April, the band released the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot; for streaming on their official website. On 14 May 2014, the band&#x27;s original guitarist Ernie Chataway died at the age of 62 from cancer, as reported by vocalist Al Atkins. &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot; was released on 8 July 2014. It sold around 32,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart, the band&#x27;s highest charting position in the US after the double-disc concept album, &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, debuted at No. 11. This was the band&#x27;s first top 10 album in the US. The band went on tour in support of the album which ran from 1 October 2014 until 17 December 2015. The Redeemer of Souls Tour led to the sixth live album &quot;Battle Cry&quot;, which was released on 25 March 2016 after being recorded at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany on 1 August 2015.

=== &quot;Firepower&quot; and Tipton&#x27;s retirement from touring (2015–2019) ===
In a November 2015 interview with Reverb.com, Richie Faulkner said that the band would start work on their eighteenth studio album in 2016. In April 2016, Loudwire posted a photo showing Rob Halford, Glenn Tipton and Faulkner himself in the studio beginning the process of the album, with Halford confirming in a radio interview that it would be ready by early 2017. During an interview at the 2016 edition of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fantasy Camp, Halford expressed dissatisfaction on making an album similar to &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot;. Faulkner then stated that the band would begin recording in January 2017 and also said that they would not go on tour until 2018.

In March 2017, the band entered the studio to begin the recording process, with support from long time producer Tom Allom, along with former Sabbat guitarist and producer Andy Sneap and engineer Mike Exeter, who worked with the band on the previous album. This marked the first time since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Ram It Down&quot; that they had worked with Allom. In an April 2017 interview with Planet Rock, Halford said that the band was &quot;coming to some of the final moments&quot; of completion of the new album. He also promised &quot;a very exciting 2018 period&quot; with a world tour taking place in 2018. In an Instagram post in June 2017, Sneap said that the band completed tracking.

The eighteenth album, &quot;Firepower&quot;, was released on 9 March 2018, with a world tour taking place thereafter, beginning in North America with Saxon and Black Star Riders as their support acts.

On 12 February 2018, Glenn Tipton revealed that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease and would step down from touring. According to the band, the disease&#x27;s progression left him unable to play the more challenging material. Tipton stated that he was still a member of the band despite his diagnosis and did not rule out future on-stage appearances. Andy Sneap was then announced as his replacement for the tour. Richie Faulkner later assured fans that Tipton would perform with the band &quot;at some point in the tour.&quot; At the 20 March 2018 show in Newark, New Jersey, Tipton joined the band on stage to perform &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, then &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; and &quot;No Surrender&quot; on later dates. He continued to appear for encores throughout the remainder of the Firepower World Tour.

On 29 January 2019, Judas Priest&#x27;s European tour with Ozzy Osbourne was cancelled after Osbourne experienced a severe upper-respiratory infection. The band later confirmed that the tour was rescheduled to 2020.

=== 50th anniversary and &quot;Invincible Shield&quot; (2019–2024) ===
In a March 2019 interview with Australia&#x27;s &quot;May the Rock Be with You&quot;, Rob Halford stated that there would be a new studio album in the foreseeable future, and that Tipton had already started composing riffs. Bassist Ian Hill said that the band had &quot;some very strong ideas that were left out of &quot;Firepower&quot; which we never got around to completing. So it&#x27;s very much on the cards. When that will happen, I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Despite Tipton&#x27;s condition, Faulkner said that he would &quot;very much be involved in the creation of the next record.&quot; Halford said that the band began compiling ideas for the next album, but said that &quot;Firepower&quot; would be difficult to top.

The writing sessions began in February 2020, with Andy Sneap and Tom Allom returning to contribute to the album&#x27;s production. Faulkner said that a month&#x27;s worth of songs was written prior to the COVID-19 lockdowns, and that the band would eventually begin composing material. Halford said that Tipton contributed material during the writing process, describing the songs as &quot;monsters. Even in a very, very rough, primitive stage, they&#x27;re great — they&#x27;re really, really good.&quot; He explained that the album would capture &quot;the emotion of what we&#x27;re going through together.&quot;

Judas Priest were originally scheduled to embark on the 50 Heavy Metal Years Tour in 2020 in Europe and North America, but was pushed back to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, due to its continued presence, the European leg was pushed back to 2022. They returned to the stage on 15 August 2021 as they headlined the Bloodstock Open Air festival, once again rejoined by Tipton for the encore songs. As the tour began on 8 September, the remainder of the US tour was postponed as Faulkner was hospitalized for major medical heart condition issues. It was rescheduled for the spring of 2022 with Queensrÿche as their support band, while the European leg with Ozzy Osbourne was rescheduled for 2023. However, Osbourne cancelled all shows for that year for health reasons.

On 29 April 2021, former drummer John Hinch died at the age of 73, as confirmed by Halford on Instagram. When speaking about the upcoming album, Halford said that the band had &quot;a bunch of great new ideas for tracks, lots of really strong demos&quot;, describing it as being &quot;a very potent record&quot;. Ian Hill said that there was enough material for at least an album or two, expressing doubt that it would be released before 2023 due to the band&#x27;s tour schedule. Halford confirmed Tipton&#x27;s appearance on the album.

In January 2022, Judas Priest announced the departure of Andy Sneap as he would shift his focus on his production work while the band continued as a quartet; however, the decision was retracted and he was reinstated. In regards to the album&#x27;s musical direction, Faulkner and Halford said that it would take a more progressive approach than &quot;Firepower&quot;, but Faulkner elaborated on its meaning. Tipton assured that it would be &quot;what every Priest fan will want&quot;, while explaining that the tracks may or may not fancy the fans’ taste, but expressed satisfaction in its sound. Faulkner described it being different to &quot;Firepower&quot;. While the album was completely written, he said that &quot;we need to record it properly and everything like that. So it&#x27;s not really anywhere near done. But when it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done.&quot; Halford indicated that it would not be released until 2023 or 2024, but later confirmed its release for 2024.

On 5 November 2022, Judas Priest were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Alice Cooper as they received the Musical Excellence Award. The other inductees included were former members K.K. Downing, Les Binks, and Dave Holland. The band performed a three–song set with Downing and Binks on stage.

Before the band&#x27;s performance at the Power Trip festival on 7 October 2023, they revealed their next album &quot;Invincible Shield&quot;, which was released on 8 March 2024. Its lead single &quot;Panic Attack&quot; was made available for streaming on 13 October. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; was released on 17 November 2023, followed in January 2024 by &quot;Crown of Horns&quot; and a month later by &quot;The Serpent and the King&quot;.

=== Upcoming twentieth studio album (2024–present) ===
In a February 2024 interview with Audio Ink Radio, Faulkner was asked if Judas Priest had &quot;many more albums left&quot; in them. His reply was, &quot;I know personally, whenever we kind of put the writing sessions to bed and we finish the writing and everything, I always feel spent. I&#x27;m out of ideas. I&#x27;ve got nothing left, I&#x27;ve given everything to it. Where the hell am I gonna get more ideas from if we choose to do another record? But somehow they always, over the next couple of years, you start banking new riffs and melodies and stuff, and somehow you get a new ones. So you never know what the future holds.&quot; When commenting on the possibility of a twentieth studio album, Halford said that &quot;it&#x27;s inevitable there will be something else.&quot;

In an October 2024 interview with KNAC.com, Faulkner was asked if Judas Priest were going to continue touring in 2025 or planning to hit the studio to write and record another album. His reply was, &quot;I think a bit of both, really. These tours tend to grow and evolve over time — the more we do, we get more offers from different territories and stuff — so I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be more touring. And there&#x27;s always ideas coming up, there&#x27;s always creative juices flowing. So if we&#x27;re able, we might be able to get in and put some ideas together and see where we are. Is there another record? I know we&#x27;ve got ideas coming up all the time — riffs and melodies and song ideas and stuff. We&#x27;re creative people — as a group of creative people, that&#x27;s gonna happen. So I think, hopefully if we get some time early next year, we&#x27;ll be able to pool those ideas and see what we&#x27;ve got and then hopefully hit the road again somewhere else.&quot;

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style and influences ===
Judas Priest&#x27;s style has always been rooted in heavy metal, and many of their albums reflect diverse aspects of the genre; for example, their debut album, &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot; (1974), is primarily rooted in heavy blues rock. From &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; (1976) through &quot;Stained Class&quot; (1978), the band&#x27;s style was somewhat progressive, with complex guitar passages and poetic lyrics. Songs would often shift in dynamics and tempo, and the music was some of the heaviest of its day. This would later have a major influence on progressive metal and stoner rock bands. &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; (1977) used a combination of double bass drum (or &quot;double kick&quot;) and rapid 16th-note bass rhythms combined with rapid 16th-note guitar rhythms used by Black Sabbath, Venom, and Motörhead that came to define the genre. While the double-bass rhythms used by Judas Priest are generally measured and technical, the song &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot; (from &quot;Sin After Sin&quot;) pushed an increase in &quot;tempo and aggression&quot;, which was later adopted by other bands with a much harder-edged approach.

Starting with their fifth album, &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (1978), the band began to incorporate a more commercial, radio-friendly style to their music. &quot;British Steel&quot; has been referred to as the &quot;record that, more than any other, codified what we mean by heavy metal&quot;. The lyrics and music were simplified, and this style prevailed up to their seventh album, &quot;Point of Entry&quot; (1981). With their eighth album, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; (1982), the band incorporated a balance of these two styles. This continued on &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; (1984). With the follow-up album, &quot;Turbo&quot; (1986), the band incorporated guitar synthesizers into its signature heavy metal sound. On 1988&#x27;s &quot;Ram It Down&quot;, the band retained some of the more commercial qualities of &quot;Turbo&quot; but also returned to some of the fast tempo heavy metal found on their earlier works. This fast-tempo style continued with 1990&#x27;s &quot;Painkiller&quot;. &quot;Jugulator&quot; (1997) tried to incorporate some of the 1990s contemporary groove metal styles. &quot;Demolition&quot; (2001) has a more traditional heavy metal sound with nu metal elements. Following the return of Halford for &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; and &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, the band returned to the style of its early albums.

The band&#x27;s popularity and status as one of the exemplary and influential heavy metal bands has earned them the nickname &quot;Metal Gods&quot; from their song of the same name.

Halford listened to and was influenced by Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin, and Robert Plant as a vocalist. He learned to push to the limits of his vocal abilities by their vocal demonstrations on record. He developed a powerful, operatic vocal style with an impressive range from lower throaty growls to ear-piercing high screams with strong vibrato. He was also a fan of Freddie Mercury, referring to him as his ultimate hero.

=== Fashion ===
In addition to the sound, Judas Priest are also known for being revolutionary in heavy metal fashion. In the band&#x27;s early years, they dressed in hippie-style 1970s outfits, but as the decade drew to a close, the rise of punk rock made this look outdated, so the band began wearing simplified wardrobes on their 1978 tour. For the 1979 tour, Halford adopted his now-trademark leather-and-studs look, inspired by punk fashion and leather culture. The rest of the band adopted a similar style which became prominent at the time of their 1978 release, &quot;Killing Machine&quot;. This style would go on to be adopted by many heavy metal bands in the early 1980s, especially those of the new wave of British heavy metal and early black metal movements. To this day, it is not uncommon to find metal artists and fans sporting such a look at concerts.

In a published quote on the back cover of K. K. Downing&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest&quot;, Downing said that Judas Priest &quot;had a bit of an identity crisis from the beginning. There was always a bit of a question mark about the band&#x27;s look. To me, it never seemed to say anything—and in the earliest days of our career, I suppose I actually saw that as a good thing.&quot;

Downing claims that he was the one who came up with the band&#x27;s black-leather look back when he first started in the music business. He explains, &quot;I had this Heavy Metal attitude inside of me. I had it all of my life. When I got into Judas Priest I knew I had a band that had a great name. I knew we were a great band ... but something was not quite complete. The leather and studs image came along and it all started to complete itself. We had the album cover with the razor blade ... and Heavy Metal was born, mate. I was a youngster and it came to me. Around 1976 is when it happened. The band took to it and got on with it, really.&quot;

Though he adopted gay leather fetish wear for the band&#x27;s look, Halford has stated that he &quot;had no interest in S&amp;M, domination or the whole queer subcult of leather and chains&quot; because he is a vanilla gay man. He feels that fans of the era also did not suspect a homosexual or kink subtext in the leather-and-studs look. However, following Halford&#x27;s coming out as gay, modern listeners often identify Judas Priest as having queer themes in their lyrics and fashion.

== Legacy and influence==
Judas Priest have influenced a great deal of metal music since the late 1970s. They were ranked by MTV as the second &quot;Greatest Metal Band&quot; of all time (after Black Sabbath), and VH1 named them the 78th greatest artist of all time in 2010. They were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, but were passed over despite placing among the top 5 fan-voted nominees. In May 2022, it was announced that the band were to be among the 2022 inductee class for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band have sold over 50 million records as of 2017, including 11 top 30 albums in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the band had eleven consecutive albums to be certified gold, platinum or higher by the RIAA, starting with 1977&#x27;s &quot;Sin After Sin&quot;.

Several metal bands have named themselves after classic era Judas Priest songs and albums, including Sinner, Exciter, Running Wild, Steeler and Tyrant.

Judas Priest have been cited as both an influence and an inspiration to the thrash metal, speed metal and groove metal genres, including bands such as Annihilator, Anthrax, Exciter, Dark Angel, Death Angel, Destruction, Exodus, Flotsam and Jetsam, Heathen, Kreator, Megadeth, Metal Church, Metallica, Nuclear Assault, Onslaught, Overkill, Pantera, Possessed, Sacrifice, Sepultura, Slayer, Sodom, Testament, and Voivod.

==Awards, nominations, and critical reception==
Despite their huge, loyal fanbase, Judas Priest have never been well received by much of the music press, partially because their late 1970s rise coincided with the punk rock and new wave movements, which occupied much of the music press&#x27;s attention at the time. The first edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave their first three albums one star each and described the band as &quot;for lovers of stolen Led Zeppelin riffs only&quot;. The second edition of the guide a few years later also panned their entire discography. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was notably disdainful of the band, refusing to outright review any of their albums and relegating them to his &quot;Meltdown&quot; list (referring to artists he did not consider having any material worth listening to). In 2018, they were nominated for entrance into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but failed to get in, a move the band was critical of. They were however inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History at the Wacken festival in August 2018. Founder/CEO Pat Gesualdo thanked them &quot;for the decades of hard work and dedication to heavy metal, an art form they helped establish.&quot; The band then stated that their induction &quot;also sends a great message of inclusion for the metal community around the world, and keeps us defending the metal faith together.&quot; In May 2022, it was announced that the band were to be among the 2022 inductee class for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as the recipients of the committee selected &quot;Award for Musical Excellence&quot;. Despite finally being inducted, many outlets, including MetalSucks and &quot;Loudwire&quot;, were critical of the band being inducted via &quot;Award for Musical Excellence&quot; rather than in the &quot;Performer&quot; category. Halford, after originally expressing excitement about the honor, shared this sentiment.

== In popular culture ==
The American director Rob Reiner went to see Judas Priest in concert as part of his preparation for making the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), which spoofs British heavy metal bands.

The drama-comedy film &quot;Rock Star&quot; (2001), starring Mark Wahlberg, is loosely based on the story of how Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens replaced Rob Halford as the vocalist in Judas Priest.

On 5 January 2014, the band appeared in the episode &quot;Steal This Episode&quot; of comedy cartoon show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; playing a parody of their song &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;. Their music was referred to as &quot;death metal&quot;, for which the producers subsequently apologised by having Bart Simpson write &quot;Judas Priest is not &#x27;Death Metal in the opening sequence chalkboard gag.

<doc id="168880" wikidata="Q235687" url="?curid=168880" title="Common year starting on Monday">
<text>A common year starting on Monday is any non-leap year (i.e., a year with 365 days) that begins on Monday, 1 January, and ends on Monday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is G. The most recent year of such kind was 2018, and the next one will be 2029 in the Gregorian calendar, or likewise, 2019 and 2030 in the Julian calendar, see below for more. This common year is one of the three possible common years in which a century year can begin on and occurs in century years that yield a remainder of 300 when divided by 400. The most recent such year was 1900, and the next one will be 2300.

Any common year that starts on Monday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this common year occur in April and July.
From July of the year in this type of year to September in the year that follows this type of year is the longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th, unless the following year is a leap year starting on Tuesday, in which case the gap only 11 months, as the next Friday the 13th is already in June.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, along with Sunday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-three common years per cycle or exactly 10.75% start on a Monday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.


=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). This sequence occurs exactly once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 6, 12 and 23 of the cycle are common years beginning on Monday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Monday.

<doc id="168885" wikidata="Q202415" url="?curid=168885" title="Child abandonment">
<text>Child abandonment is the practice of relinquishing interests and claims over one&#x27;s offspring in an illegal way, with the intent of never resuming or reasserting guardianship. The phrase is typically used to describe the physical abandonment of a child. Still, it can also include severe cases of neglect and emotional abandonment, such as when parents fail to provide financial and emotional support for children over an extended period (sometimes referred to as &quot;throwaway&quot; children). An abandoned child is referred to as a foundling (as opposed to a runaway or an orphan). Baby dumping refers to parents leaving a child younger than 12 months in a public or private place with the intent of terminating their care for the child. It is also known as rehoming when adoptive parents use illegal means, such as the internet, to find new homes for their children. In the case where child abandonment is anonymous within the first 12 months, it may be referred to as secret child abandonment.

In the United States and many other countries, child abandonment is usually treated as a subset of the broader category of child abuse. (However, states have laws allowing a parent to permanently surrender a child at a designated safe haven &quot;where they will not be prosecuted.&quot;) In the United States it is punishable as a class 4 felony, and a second or subsequent offense after a prior conviction is a class 3 felony (see &quot;classes of felonies&quot;) with different state judicial systems treating it with varying severities and classifications. Child abandonment may lead to the permanent loss of parental rights of the parents. Some states allow for reinstatement of the parental rights, with about half of the states in the US having had laws for this purpose. Perpetrators can also be charged with reckless abandonment if victims die as a result of their actions or neglect.

Official statistics on child abandonment do not exist in most countries. In Denmark, an estimate of child abandonment prevalence was 1.7 infants per 100,000 births, with another source suggesting higher prevalence in Central and Eastern European countries such as Slovakia with data suggesting 4.9 per 1,000 live births.

==Causes==
* Poverty and homelessness are often causes of child abandonment. People living in countries with poor social welfare systems (i.e. China, Myanmar, Mexico, the United States, and other countries) who are not financially capable of taking care of a child are more likely to abandon their children because of a lack of resources. In some cases the parents already have a child or children, but are unable to take care of another child at that time.
* In societies where young women and young men are looked down upon for being teenage or single mothers and single fathers, child abandonment is more common.
* Children born out of the confines of marriage may be abandoned in a family&#x27;s attempt to prevent being shamed by their community.
* Physical disability, mental illness, and substance abuse problems that parents face.
* Children who are born with congenital disorders or other health complications may be abandoned if their parents feel unequipped to provide them with the level of care that their condition requires.
* In cultures where the sex of the child is of utmost importance, parents are more likely to abandon a baby of the undesired sex. Similarly, people may choose to pursue the often controversial option of sex-selective abortion.
* Political conditions, such as war and displacement of a family, also cause parents to abandon their children. 
* Additionally, a parent being incarcerated or deported can result in the involuntary abandonment of a child, even if the parent(s) did not voluntarily relinquish their parental role.
* Disownment of a child is a form of abandonment that entails ending contact with and support for one&#x27;s dependent. Disownment tends to occur later in a child&#x27;s life, generally due to a conflict between the parent(s) and the child, but can also occur when children are still young. Reasons include: divorce of parents, discovering the true paternity of a child, and a child&#x27;s actions bringing shame to a family; most commonly, breaking the law, teenage pregnancy, major religious or ideological differences, and identifying as LGBT.

== Effects on survivors ==
* Possibility of experiencing abuse and neglect in institutionalized care
* Low self-esteem stemming from feelings of guilt about being at fault for being abandoned
* Separation anxiety: feelings of anxiety about being separated from parents or caregivers
* Attachment issues: difficulty becoming emotionally attached to and trusting other people, especially caregivers
* Abandonment issues, characteristic of abandoned child syndrome, including social alienation, guilt, anxiety, clinginess, insomnia and nightmares, eating disorders, anger issues, depression, substance abuse, and traumatic reenactment through romantic relationships
* Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), referred to as posttraumatic stress disorder of abandonment.
* Depending upon the severity of their symptoms, children who have developed certain maladjusted tendencies in social interaction may be diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement disorder.
* For children who are abandoned in dangerous places, such as dumpsters, doorsteps, and other public areas, exposure to the elements and physical injury are distinct possibilities.

== Financial cost ==
In 2015, the United States&#x27; government spent over $9 billion to support 427,910 children who were in foster care.

== Child abandonment laws ==
Child abandonment is illegal in most of the world, and depending upon the facts of the case and laws of the state in which it occurs could be prosecuted as a misdemeanor or felony criminal offense.

== Prevention ==
* Providing access to sex education and to family planning resources, like contraception, and abortion can help prevent people who cannot take care of, or do not want to raise, children from becoming pregnant in the first place.
* Evidence has shown that, when bans on abortion are lifted, the number of abandoned, abused, and neglected children goes down in response. However, access is an issue. In the United States, 87% of all counties, and 97% of all rural counties, do not have any access to abortion services.
* Governmental assistance can be provided in the form of parental counseling, post-natal services, mental health services, and other community support services for parents who are at a higher risk of abandoning their children because of age, support, physical ability, mental illness, or poverty.

==History==
Historically, many cultures practiced abandonment of infants, often called &quot;infant exposure.&quot; Children were left on hillsides, in the wilderness, near churches, and in other public places. If taken up by others, the children might join another family either as slaves or as free family members. Roman societies, in particular, chose slaves to raise their children rather than family members, who were often indifferent towards their children. Although being found by others would allow children who were abandoned to often survive, exposure is sometimes compared to infanticide—as described by Tertullian in his &quot;Apology&quot;: &quot;it is certainly the more cruel way to kill... by exposure to cold and hunger and dogs.&quot; Despite the comparison, other sources report that infanticide and exposure were viewed as morally different in ancient times.

In the Early Middle Ages, parents who did not want to raise their children gave them to monasteries with a small fee, an act known as oblation, and in times of social stress, monasteries often received large numbers of children. By the high Middle Ages, oblation was less common and more often arranged privately between the monastery and the parents of the child. Sometimes, medieval hospitals cared for abandoned children at the community&#x27;s expense. Still, some refused to do so because being willing to accept abandoned children would increase abandonment rates. Medieval laws in Europe governing child abandonment, as the Visigothic Code, often prescribed that the person who had taken up the child was entitled to the child&#x27;s service as a slave. Conscripting or enslaving children into armies and labor pools often occurred as a consequence of war or pestilence when many children were left parentless. Abandoned children then became the wards of the state, military organization, or religious group. When this practice happened en masse, it had the advantage of ensuring the strength and continuity of cultural and religious practices in medieval society.

Early Modern Europe saw the rise of foundling homes and increased abandonment of children to these homes. These numbers continued to rise and peaked when 5% of all births resulted in abandonment in France around 1830. The national reaction to this was to limit the resources provided by foundling homes and switch to foster homes instead such that fewer children would die within overcrowded foundling homes during infancy. As access to contraception increased and economic conditions improved in Europe towards the end of the 19th century, the number of children being abandoned declined.

Abandonment increased towards the end of the 19th century, particularly in the United States. The largest migration of abandoned children in history occurred in the United States between 1853 and 1929. Over one hundred and twenty thousand orphans (not all of whom were intentionally abandoned) were shipped west on railroad cars, where families agreed to foster the children in exchange for their use as farmhands, household workers, etc. Orphan trains were highly popular as a source of free labor. The sheer size of the displacement and the complications and exploitation that occurred gave rise to new agencies and a series of laws that promoted adoption rather than indenture. By 1945, adoption was formulated as a legal act with consideration of the child&#x27;s best interests. The origin of the move toward secrecy and the sealing of all adoption and birth records began when Charles Loring Brace introduced the concept to prevent children from the orphan trains from returning to or being reclaimed by their parents.

Notable contemporary instances of child abandonment include homicidal neglect by confinement of infants or children, such as in the affair of the Osaka child abandonment case or the affair of two abandoned children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada by their mother Rie Fujii.

==Current situation==

Today, abandonment of a child is considered to be a serious crime in many jurisdictions because it can be considered malum in se (wrong in itself) due to the direct harm to the child, and because of welfare concerns (in that the child often becomes a ward of the state). For example, in the U.S. state of Georgia, it is a misdemeanor to willfully and voluntarily abandon a child, and a felony to abandon one&#x27;s child &quot;and&quot; leave the state. In 1981, this distinction was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court against a parent&#x27;s argument that it denied parents the right to travel and thereby denied parents the equal protection of the laws. &#x27;Rehoming&#x27; is still legal in Arkansas where, in 2015, state legislator Justin Harris made national headlines by rehoming two young adopted children.

Many jurisdictions have exceptions to abandonment laws in the form of safe haven laws, which apply to babies left in designated places such as hospitals (see, for example, baby hatch).

In the UK abandoning a child under the age of two years is a criminal offence. In 2004 49 babies were abandoned nationwide with slightly more boys than girls being abandoned.

Abandonment is rife in Malaysia, where between 2005 and 2011, 517 babies were dumped. Of those 517 children, 287 were found dead. In 2012, there were 31 cases, including at least one instance of a child being tossed from a window of a high rise apartment.

Persons in cultures with poor social welfare systems who are not financially capable of taking care of a child are more likely to abandon them. Several American states are moving towards passing legislation to prevent rehoming of children post adoption. However, national legislation may be needed to protect children from being rehomed in all states.

=== State programs for facilitating anonymous child abandonment ===

* Anonymous birthing allows pregnant mothers to give birth to their child without revealing their identity or claiming any ownership over or legal obligation to the child. Different countries wait varying lengths of time from 2–8 weeks before putting the child up for adoption to allow mothers to return to the hospital and reclaim the child. Anonymous birthing is most often implemented as measure to prevent neonaticide and has been successful in multiple countries. Police in Austria report a 57% drop in neonaticides after the country passed a law allowing for anonymous birthing and free delivery in 2001. Anonymous birthing provides the opportunity for mothers to disclose relevant health history to later be shared with the child and adoptive family, as well as access to hospital care to reduce risk during birth. In some states, France for example, mothers who choose anonymous birthing undergo counselling and are informed of available support structures to help them keep the child. Mothers who are seeking to anonymously abandon their child at birth may avoid anonymous birthing due to increased interaction with hospital staff and the possibility of undergoing counselling. 
* Baby boxes provide a safe and anonymous way to abandon children, typically newborns, rather than resorting to infant exposure or neonaticide. Baby boxes can be found in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Korea, and the United States. Advantages of baby boxes include a greater degree of anonymity for parents abandoning their children and a guarantee that the child will be found and attended to. However, children are sometimes placed in baby boxes with existing issue or injury and baby boxes are under-utilized and costly to operate. It is also debated if baby boxes are an accessible option for rural mothers who may not be willing to travel to abandon their children.
* Safe haven laws allow parents of a child, typically a newborn child but age can vary, to abandon the child at a place of local authority such as a hospital, fire station, or police station with no further question. Some states allow the parent to reclaim the child within a certain timeframe. Safe Haven Laws passed in the United States in 1999 and have since been adopted in Canada, Japan, France, and Slovakia. It is debated if safe haven laws prevent child abandonment or neonaticide. As with baby boxes, one study suggests that mothers in rural areas are not willing to travel to abandon their children and would not be willing to travel to a hospital to do so. As of 2017, 3,317 babies have been surrendered via safe haven laws in the United States.

==National law and effects on child abandonment==

China&#x27;s One Child Policy:
In 1979 China introduced its one-child policy which set up penalties for families that chose to have more than one child. Women were compelled to undergo a surgical implantation of an IUD following the birth of their first child and tubal ligation if they were to have another child. Families that disobeyed the law were levied a fine and lost their right to many government services, including access to health and educational services. Nevertheless, transgressions of the law most certainly occurred. Consequently, over the course of over three decades, hundreds of thousands of children, the majority of which were girls, were abandoned and required caretaking. Non-governmental organizations stepped in to assist with the re-housing of these girls, leading to the international adoption of over 120,000 Chinese children. Today, China&#x27;s fertility rate has not quite returned to the rate of replacement (the birth rate that will maintain population size under conditions of zero net immigration/emigration). In fact, in the years since the relinquishing of the policy, China&#x27;s fertility rate has only risen .04 per family.

Vietnam War:
During and following the Vietnam War, it is estimated that roughly 50,000 babies were born of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers. A large contingent of these children were either unwanted due to the circumstances of their conception or unable to be cared for due to the lack of available resources and assistance in the war-torn country. Locally, these children were known as &quot;children of the dust.&quot; Operation Babylift was established by the US government in an effort to bring over 3,300 children, many but not all of whom were abandoned, orphaned, or mixed-race, leading to fears of their exploitation, to Western countries to be adopted, with varying degrees of success. Non-governmental organizations attempted to alleviate the problem by setting up international adoptions and other rehoming methods but were largely ineffective. To this day, attempts are being made to link American veterans to children that they may have fathered during their time in Vietnam as well as children to their families in Vietnam.

Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu:
During the rule of Communist politician Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romania underwent drastic changes to its populace. Ceaușescu, in an attempt to form a robust and young population, outlawed methods of contraception and encouraged the creation of large families with many children. Much like during the Fascist period of Italian history, incentives and cultural praise were offered to parents who produced many children. Ceaușescu established Decree 770 which outlawed abortion and contraception for all women, except those who were over 40, had already borne 4–5 children, had life-threatening complications during pregnancy, or who became pregnant through rape or incest. In the following years, Romania&#x27;s birth rate nearly doubled. However, due to a lack of resources necessary to care for the abundance of children, thousands were abandoned or left to die. Other women resorted to unsafe forms of abortion carried out by people without medical training. The problem persisted until Ceaușescu was overthrown in 1989. Following the revolution, Romania&#x27;s birthrate steadily declined for the following decades. Today, the birth rate has dropped to 1.52 births per woman, under the rate of replacement.

==In literature==

Foundlings, who may be orphans, can combine many advantages to a plot: mysterious antecedents, leading to plots to discover them; high birth and lowly upbringing. Foundlings have appeared in literature in some of the oldest known tales. The most common reasons for abandoning children in literature are oracles that the child will cause harm; the mother&#x27;s desire to conceal her illegitimate child, often after rape by a god; or spite on the part of people other than the parents, such as sisters and mothers-in-law in such fairy tales as &quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird.&quot; In some chivalric romances, such as &quot;Le Fresne&quot; and &quot;the Swan-Children,&quot; in the variant &quot;Beatrix,&quot; some children of a multiple birth are abandoned after the heroine has taunted another woman with a claim that such a birth is proof of adultery and then suffered such a birth of her own. Poverty usually features as a cause only with the case of older children, who can survive on their own. Indeed, most such individuals are of royal or noble birth; their abandonment means they grow up in ignorance of their true social status.

===Abandonment===
One of the earliest surviving examples of child abandonment in literature is that of Oedipus, who is left to die as a baby in the hills by a herdsman ordered to kill the baby, but is found and grows up to unwittingly marry his biological mother.

In a common variant on the abandonment and rediscovery of an infant, the biblical story of Moses describes how the Jewish infant is abandoned by his mother and set to float in the Nile in a reed basket, in hopes that he will be found and nurtured; as planned, the child is discovered and adopted by the queen of Egypt, thus gaining a higher social status and better education, as well as a more powerful position than his birth family could have given him. A similar story is told of other heroes who eventually learn about their true origins only as adults, when they find they are able to save their original parents or family by wielding power from their adoptive status, while making use of an education that sets them apart from their peers. The theme is also carried through in the case of many modern superheroes, most famously Superman (see Modern Media below). Mark Twain tweaks the traditional &quot;upgrading&quot; of the foundling&#x27;s social status by having the child&#x27;s twin, who is powerful by birth, experience the &quot;downgrading &quot; of his position in a switch planned by the two children, in &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;.

In many tales, such as &quot;Snow White,&quot; the child is actually abandoned by a servant who had been given orders to put the child to death. Other tales such as Hansel and Gretel has children reluctantly abandoned in the forest by their parents since they were no longer able to feed them.

Children are often abandoned with birth tokens, which act as plot devices to ensure that the child can be identified. This theme is a main element in Angelo F. Coniglio&#x27;s historical fiction novella &quot;The Lady of the Wheel,&quot; in which the title refers to a &quot;receiver of foundlings&quot; who were placed in a device called a &quot;foundling wheel&quot;, in the wall of a church or hospital.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; a recognition scene in the final act reveals by these that Perdita is a king&#x27;s daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover. Similarly, when the heroine of &quot;Le Fresne&quot; reveals the brocade and the ring she was abandoned with, her mother and sister recognize her; this makes her a suitable bride for the man whose mistress she had been.
From Oedipus onward, Greek and Roman tales are filled with exposed children who escaped death to be reunited with their families—usually, as in Longus&#x27; &quot;Daphnis and Chloe,&quot; more happily than in Oedipus&#x27; case. Grown children, having been taken up by strangers, were usually recognized by tokens that had been left with the exposed baby: In Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Ion,&quot; Creüsa is about to kill Ion, believing him to be her husband&#x27;s illegitimate child, when a priestess reveals the birth-tokens that show that Ion is her own, abandoned infant.

This may reflect the widespread practice of child abandonment in their cultures. On the other hand, the motif is continued through literature where the practice is not widespread. William Shakespeare used the abandonment and discovery of Perdita in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale,&quot; as noted above, and Edmund Spenser reveals in the last Canto of Book 6 of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; that the character Pastorella, raised by shepherds, is in fact of noble birth. Henry Fielding, in one of the first novels recognized as such, recounted &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling.&quot; In the case of Quasimodo, the eponymous character in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, the disfigured child is abandoned at the cathedral&#x27;s foundling&#x27;s bed, made available for the leaving of unwanted infants. Ruth Benedict, in studying the Zuni, found that the practice of child abandonment was unknown, but featured heavily in their folktales.

Still, even cultures that do not practice it may reflect older customs; in medieval literature, such as &quot;Sir Degaré&quot; and &quot;Le Fresne,&quot; the child is abandoned immediately after birth, which may reflect pre-Christian practices, both Scandavian and Roman, that the newborn would not be raised without the father&#x27;s decision to do so.

===Upbringing===
The strangers who take up the child are often shepherds or other herdsmen. This befell not only Oedipus, but also Cyrus II of Persia, Amphion and Zethus and several of the characters listed above. Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf in the wilderness, but afterward, again found by a shepherd. This ties this motif in with the genre of the pastoral. This can imply or outright state that the child benefits by this pure upbringing by unspoiled people, as opposed to the corruption that surrounded his birth family.

Often, the child is aided by animals before being found; Artemis sent a bear to nurse the abandoned Atalanta, and Paris was also nursed by a bear before being found. In some cases, the child is depicted as being raised by animals; however, in actuality, feral children have proven to be incapable of speech.

The theme of young boys being raised by leading women of the early Mongol Empire is prominent in sources such as the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. For example, the young Shigi Qutuqu was found wandering a destroyed Tatar camp, he was taken to either Genghis Khan&#x27;s wife Börte or mother Hoelun to be raised.

===In adulthood===
The pattern of a child remaining with its adoptive parents is less common than the reverse, but it occurs. In the Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; Karna is never reconciled with his mother, and dies in battle with her legitimate son. In the Grimm fairy tale &quot;Foundling-Bird,&quot; Foundling Bird never learns of, least of all reunites with, his parents. George Eliot depicted the abandonment of the character Eppie in &quot;Silas Marner;&quot; despite learning her true father at the end of the book, she refuses to leave Silas Marner, who had actually reared her.

When the cause of the abandonment is a prophecy, the abandonment is usually instrumental in causing the prophecy to be fulfilled. Besides Oedipus, Greek legends also included Telephus, who was prophesied to kill his uncle; his ignorance of his parentage, stemming from his abandonment, caused his uncle to jeer at him and him to kill the uncle in anger.

===Older children===
When older children are abandoned in fairy tales, while poverty may be cited as a cause, as in &quot;Hop o&#x27; My Thumb,&quot; also called &quot;Thumbelina,&quot; the most common effect is when poverty is combined with a stepmother&#x27;s malice, as in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (or sometimes, a mother&#x27;s malice). The stepmother&#x27;s wishes may be the sole cause, as in &quot;Father Frost.&quot; In these stories, the children seldom find adoptive parents, but malicious monsters, such as ogres and witches; outwitting them, they find treasure enough to solve their poverty. The stepmother may die coincidentally, or be driven out by the father when he hears, so that the reunited family can live happily in her absence.

In a grimmer variation, the tale &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; features a wicked uncle in the role of the wicked stepmother, who gives an order for the children to be killed. However, although the servants scruple to obey him, and the children are abandoned in the woods, the tale ends tragically: the children die, and their bodies are covered with leaves by robins.

===In modern media===
Foundlings still appear in modern literature; this is a partial list of examples:
*In George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s stage play &quot;Major Barbara,&quot; industrialist Andrew Undershaft, a foundling himself, intently searches for a foundling to assume the family business.
*Superman may be seen as a continuation of the foundling tradition, the lone survivor of an advanced (but almost-completely extinct) civilization who is found and raised by Kansas farmers in a pastoral setting, and later discovers his alien origins and uses his powers for good.
*Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s movie &quot;The Kid&quot; revolves about the Tramp&#x27;s efforts to raise an abandoned child.
*In the graphic novel &quot;Aqua Leung&quot;, the main protagonist is a prince who is whisked out of a castle under attack in a basket-like device and then found by a couple and raised on land so that his father&#x27;s enemies do not find him. He returns to the seas to fulfill the prophecy thought to be his father&#x27;s but that was actually his.
*Elora Danan, in the film &quot;Willow,&quot; and Lir, in the novel &quot;The Last Unicorn,&quot; both continue the tradition of foundlings abandoned because of prophecies, and who fulfil the prophecies because of their abandonment. 
*In the last book of &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain,&quot; Dallben reveals to the hero Taran that he is a foundling; in a story set in the same world, &quot;The Foundling,&quot; Dallben himself proves to be a foundling as well.
*The protagonist Thorby of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1957 novel Citizen of the Galaxy is a foundling sold as a slave on a remote planet. He is bought and freed by a beggar who educates and inspires him, then learns from multiple kind foster families. He later discovers that his parents were killed for opposing slavery in the galactic conglomerate that they owned and that he inherits, and he carries on their work.
*The character Leela from &quot;Futurama&quot; was a foundling, given to the Ophanarium and a note in an alien language to make people believe that she was an alien rather than a mutant; she would have been forced, in the latter case, to live in the sewers with the other mutants.
*Several foundlings appear in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld:&quot; most notably Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson, who was found, as a toddler, among the ruins of a caravan party that had been attacked by bandits, and was then surrounded by the bodies of the adults.
*The character of Mozzie, from &quot;White Collar,&quot; is a foundling, left in a basket with only a bear.
*In some cartoons, wily characters may disguise themselves as foundlings. This may be accomplished by the character dressing as a baby and lying in a bassinet or basket on a doorstep, perhaps with a note adding to the ruse. This was parodied in the 2006 movie &quot;Little Man.&quot;
*In &quot;The Flintstones,&quot; Bamm-Bamm was abandoned on the Rubbles&#x27;s doorstep and eventually adopted by them.

<doc id="168888" wikidata="Q5616570" url="?curid=168888" title="Guinn v. United States">
<text>Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347 (1915), was a United States Supreme Court decision that found certain grandfather clause exemptions to literacy tests for voting rights to be unconstitutional. Though these grandfather clauses were superficially race-neutral, they were designed to protect the voting rights of illiterate white voters while disenfranchising black voters.

The 1870 ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution barred each state from denying the right to vote on the basis of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;. In response, several Southern states, including Oklahoma, established constitutional provisions designed to effectively disenfranchise African Americans (including but not limited to American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS)) voters without explicitly violating the Fifteenth Amendment. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White held that Oklahoma&#x27;s grandfather clause was &quot;repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void&quot;. The decision had little immediate impact, as Southern legislatures found other methods to disenfranchise Americans of Color.

==Background==
When Oklahoma was admitted to the Union in 1907, it had adopted a constitution which allowed men of all races to vote, in compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, state legislators soon passed an amendment to the Oklahoma constitution that required voters to satisfy a literacy test. A potential voter could be exempted from the literacy requirement if he could prove either that his grandfathers had been voters or had been citizens of some foreign nation, or had served as soldiers before 1866. As a result, illiterate whites were able to vote — but not illiterate blacks, whose grandfathers had almost all been slaves and therefore barred from voting or serving as soldiers before 1866. Most states that had permitted free people of color to vote in early decades of the 19th century had rescinded that right before 1840. Thus, even blacks who might have descended from families free before the Civil War could not get an exemption from literacy tests. In practice these were highly subjective, administered by white registrars who discriminated against black voters. Oklahoma&#x27;s amendment followed those of numerous Southern states that had similar grandfather clauses in their constitutions.

The Oklahoma amendment provided:
:&quot;No person shall be registered as an elector of this state or be allowed to vote in any election held herein, unless he be able to read and write any section of the Constitution of the state of Oklahoma; but no person who was, on January 1, 1866, or any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of government, or who at that time resided in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant of such person, shall be denied the right to register and vote because of his inability to so read and write sections of such Constitution. Precinct election inspectors having in charge the registration of electors shall enforce the provisions of this section at the time of registration, provided registration be required. Should registration be dispensed with, the provisions of this section shall be enforced by the precinct election officers when electors apply for ballots to vote.&quot;

The amendment came into force before the election of November 8, 1910, was held. During that election, certain election officers refused to allow black citizens to vote; those officers were indicted and convicted of fraudulently disenfranchising black voters, in violation of the 15th Amendment and in violation of Oklahoma State Law.

== Fifteenth Amendment ==
The 15th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides the right to not be discriminated against while voting on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. In the view of some, the Grandfather Clause in the Oklahoma Constitution was void of racial discrimination since it looked at relatives prior to 1866 and not 1871, creating a loophole that allowed discrimination.

==History of grandfather clauses==
Grandfather clauses were first instituted as a means of allowing whites to vote while simultaneously disenfranchising blacks. The grandfather clause in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; involved requirement that a citizen must pass a literacy test in order to register to vote. At the time, many poor whites in the South were illiterate and would lose their voting rights if contingent upon passing a literacy test. The grandfather clauses were introduced since very few poor whites did not have a grandfather who had been able to vote. These clauses typically allowed poor, illiterate whites to register to vote if they had been able to vote before 1867 or if their ancestors could have voted then, creating a loophole. The laws had time limits, which were used to try to get as many white voters registered as possible before the laws were challenged in court. The modern expression &#x27;grandfathered in&#x27;, despite its links with this racial history, is not generally associated with it.

==Case==
The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 17, 1913. It represented the second appearance before the Court of John W. Davis as United States Solicitor General and the first case in which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a brief. After the case was argued, the Court ruled that the grandfather clause of the Constitution of Oklahoma was created and intended to exclude as many illiterate black people as possible and include as many illiterate whites as possible. The number of black citizens allowed to vote under the clause approximately equals the number of white citizens barred from voting. This is undoubtedly proof of discrimination and differences in classifying whites and blacks into two classes of illiterates. Therefore, the entire amendment regarding illiteracy in voters is wholly unconstitutional, violating the 15th Amendment. The clause was implemented as a way to try to avoid violating the 15th Amendment while still disenfranchising black voters. The previous conditions of servitude based on the race or skin color of people rendered them incapable of gaining literacy or meeting the ambiguously formed loopholes within said clause. The convictions of Guinn and Beal were upheld.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court handed down its decision in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; together with &quot;Myers v. Anderson&quot;, which concerned a grandfather clause in the Maryland constitution. In its decision published on June 21, 1915, the Court found &quot;the grandfather clauses in the Maryland and Oklahoma constitutions to be repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void&quot;. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White held that the grandfather clause was clearly designed to interfere with the voting rights protections of the Fifteenth Amendment even though it was racially neutral on its face.

==Opinions==
Chief Justice White wrote the majority opinion, writing that the Oklahoma law brings race-based discrimination &quot;into existence since it is based purely on a period of time before the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment and makes that period the controlling and dominant test of the right of suffrage.&quot; The decision was joined by all eight justices who participated in the case; there was no dissenting opinion.

==Aftermath==
Even though &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; seemed to be a major step for black voters in the South, it conveyed a false sense of victory. Oklahoma immediately implemented a new voting statute which restricted voter registration, stating that &quot;[a]ll persons, except those who voted in 1914, who were qualified to vote in 1916 but who failed to register between April 30 and May 11, 1916, with some exceptions for sick and absent persons who were given an additional brief period to register, would be perpetually disenfranchised.&quot; After &quot;Guinn&quot; in Oklahoma, similar constitutional clauses were struck down in former slave states in the South such as Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia, but just like Oklahoma, these states found other ways to disenfranchise black voters, mainly through poll taxes. Many kept literacy tests in place as only the use of grandfather clauses had been struck down, the result being the only substantive change was poor whites as well as blacks were disenfranchised.

After 23 years, the Supreme Court struck down the new Oklahoma statute in &quot;Lane v. Wilson&quot;. The Court ruled that the new statute still violated the Fifteenth Amendment because they were &quot;operated unfairly against the very class on whose behalf the protection of the Constitution was here successfully invoked.&quot; &quot;Guinn&quot; successfully paved the way for judicial intervention regarding voter discrimination and disenfranchisement of specific groups, although it did not immediately provide enfranchisement of black voters in the South, as was expected.

<doc id="168889" wikidata="Q4982600" url="?curid=168889" title="Buchanan v. Warley">
<text>Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States addressed civil government-instituted racial segregation in residential areas. The Court held unanimously that a Louisville, Kentucky, city ordinance prohibiting the sale of real property to blacks in white-majority neighborhoods or buildings and vice versa violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s protections for freedom of contract. The ruling of the Kentucky Court of Appeals was thus reversed.

Previous state court rulings had overturned racial zoning ordinances on grounds of the &quot;takings clause&quot; because of their failures to grandfather land that had been owned before enactment. The Court, in &quot;Buchanan&quot;, ruled that the motive for the Louisville ordinance—separation of races for purported reasons—was an inappropriate exercise of police power, and its insufficient purpose also made it unconstitutional.

==Background==
The city of Louisville had an ordinance that forbade any black person to own or occupy any buildings in an area in which a greater number of white persons resided, and vice versa. In 1915, William Warley, the prospective black buyer and an attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), made an offer to Charles H. Buchanan for his property in a predominantly white neighborhood.

He based his offer on the following condition:
It is understood that I am purchasing the above property for the purpose of having erected thereon a house which I propose to make my residence, and it is a distinct part of this agreement that I shall not be required to accept a deed to the above property or to pay for said property unless I have the right under the laws of the State of Kentucky and the City of Louisville to occupy said property as a residence.

Buchanan, a white man, accepted the offer. When Warley did not complete the transaction, Buchanan brought an action in the Chancery Court of Louisville to force him to complete the purchase. Warley argued that Louisville&#x27;s ordinance prevented him from occupying the property, so it was of less value to him. Buchanan sued on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and he should receive full payment.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with Buchanan:
&quot;The effect of the ordinance under consideration was not merely to regulate a business or the like, but was to destroy the right of the individual to acquire, enjoy, and dispose of his property. Being of this character, it was void as being opposed to the due process clause of the constitution.&quot; Reversing the Appeals Court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance surpassed the legitimate grounds of police power, as it interfered with individuals&#x27; rights of property. In addition, the court noted that the ordinance neither regulated the race of servants who might be employed in certain areas nor counted them as members of the household. The ruling did not address the right of owners or developers to restrict housing based on private agreements, meaning private housing restrictions against race were legally enforceable.

Justice Holmes wrote a draft opinion which suggested the case was &quot;manufactured&quot; by the seller and buyer. He withdrew the dissent and voted with the majority.

<doc id="168890" wikidata="Q149127" url="?curid=168890" title="Pat Buchanan">
<text>Patrick Joseph Buchanan ( ; born November 2, 1938) is an American paleoconservative author, political commentator, and politician. He was an assistant and special consultant to U.S. presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan. He is an influential figure in the modern paleoconservative movement in America.

In 1992 and 1996, Buchanan sought the Republican presidential nomination. In 1992, he ran against incumbent president George H. W. Bush, campaigning against Bush&#x27;s breaking of his &quot;Read my lips: no new taxes&quot; pledge, as well as his foreign policy, his trade and immigration policy, and his positions on social issues. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Buchanan delivered his &quot;culture war&quot; speech in support of the nominated President Bush. In 1996, he ran against eventual Republican nominee Bob Dole, but withdrew after getting only 21 percent of Republican primary votes. In 2000, he was the Reform Party&#x27;s presidential nominee. His campaign centered on non-interventionism in foreign affairs, opposition to illegal immigration, and opposition to the outsourcing of manufacturing from free trade. He selected educator and conservative activist Ezola Foster as his running-mate. Despite his own terminology of self-identification, expressed in the desire to be called a &quot;supporter of the doctrine of disengagement&quot;, his foreign policy views have been categorized as isolationist.

In 2002, he co-founded &quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazine and launched a foundation named The American Cause. He has been published in &quot;The Occidental Observer&quot;, &quot;Human Events, National Review, The Nation,&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The original host on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, he was a political commentator on the MSNBC cable network, including the show &quot;Morning Joe&quot; until February 2012, later appearing on Fox News. Buchanan was also a regular panelist on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;. Many of his views, particularly his opposition to American imperialism and the managerial state, echo those of the Old Right Republicans of the first half of the 20th century. Starting in 2006, Buchanan had been a frequent contributor to VDARE until his retirement in 2023.
==Early life==
Buchanan was born in Washington, D.C., a son of William Baldwin Buchanan (August 13, 1905, in Virginia – January 19, 1988 in Washington, D.C.), a partner in an accounting firm, and his wife Catherine Elizabeth (Crum) Buchanan (December 23, 1911, in Charleroi, Washington County, Pennsylvania – September 18, 1995, in Oakton, Fairfax County, Virginia), a nurse and a homemaker. Buchanan had six brothers (Brian, Henry, James, John, Thomas, and William Jr.) and two sisters (Kathleen Theresa and Angela Marie, nicknamed Bay). Bay served as U.S. Treasurer under Ronald Reagan. His father was of Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, and his mother was of German descent. He had a great-grandfather who fought in the American Civil War in the Confederate States Army, which is why he is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He admires Robert E. Lee, Douglas MacArthur, and Joseph McCarthy.

Of his Southern ancestry, Buchanan has written:

Buchanan was born into a Catholic family and attended Catholic schools, including the Jesuit-run Gonzaga College High School. As a student at a Catholic college—Georgetown University—he was in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) but did not complete the program. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Georgetown, and received his draft notice after he graduated in 1960. The District of Columbia draft board exempted Buchanan from military service because of reactive arthritis, classifying him as 4-F. He received a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1962, writing his thesis on the expanding trade between Canada and Cuba.

==Career==

===&quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; editorial writer===
Buchanan joined the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; at age 23. During the first year of the United States embargo against Cuba in 1961, Canada–Cuba trade tripled. The &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; published a rewrite of Buchanan&#x27;s Columbia master&#x27;s project under the eight-column banner &quot;Canada sells to Red Cuba — And Prospers&quot; eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan&#x27;s memoir &quot;Right from the Beginning&quot;, this article was a career milestone. Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it. Buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported Barry Goldwater&#x27;s presidential campaign. The &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; did not endorse Goldwater, and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Buchanan recalled: &quot;The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats ... I can&#x27;t think of a single conservative who was sorry about the Goldwater campaign.&quot; According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in some editions of Goldwater&#x27;s &quot;Conscience of a Conservative&quot;, Buchanan was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell law offices in New York City in 1965.

===Work for the Nixon White House===

The next year, he was the first adviser hired by Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign; he worked primarily as an opposition researcher. The highly partisan speeches Buchanan wrote were consciously aimed at Richard Nixon&#x27;s dedicated supporters, for which his colleagues soon nicknamed him Mr. Inside. Buchanan traveled with Nixon throughout the campaigns of 1966 and 1968. He made a tour of Western Europe, Africa and, in the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, the Middle East.

During the course of Nixon&#x27;s presidency, Buchanan became entrusted on press relations, policy positions, and political strategy. Early on during Nixon&#x27;s presidency, Buchanan worked as a White House assistant and speechwriter for Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew. Buchanan coined the phrase &quot;Silent Majority,&quot; and helped shape the strategy that drew millions of Democrats to Nixon. In a 1972 memo, he suggested the White House &quot;should move to re-capture the anti-Establishment tradition or theme in American politics.&quot; His daily assignments included developing political strategy, publishing the President&#x27;s &quot;Daily News Summary&quot;, and preparing briefing books for news conferences. He accompanied Nixon on his trip to China in 1972 and the summit in Moscow, Yalta and Minsk in 1974. He suggested that Nixon label Democratic opponent George McGovern an extremist and burn the White House tapes. Buchanan later argued that Nixon would have survived the Watergate scandal with his reputation intact if he had burnt the tapes.

Buchanan remained as a special assistant to Nixon through the final days of the Watergate scandal. He was not accused of wrongdoing, though some mistakenly suspected him of being Deep Throat. In 2005 when the actual identity of the press leak was revealed as Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director Mark Felt, Buchanan called him &quot;sneaky,&quot; &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;criminal.&quot; Because of his role in the Nixon campaign&#x27;s &quot;attack group,&quot; Buchanan appeared before the Senate Watergate Committee on September 26, 1973. He told the panel: &quot;The mandate that the American people gave to this president and his administration cannot, and will not, be frustrated or repealed or overthrown as a consequence of the incumbent tragedy&quot;.

When Nixon resigned in 1974, Buchanan briefly stayed on as special assistant under incoming President Gerald Ford. Chief of Staff Alexander Haig offered Buchanan his choice of three open ambassador posts, including South Africa, for which Buchanan opted. President Ford initially signed off on the appointment, but then rescinded it after it was prematurely reported in the &quot;Evans-Novak Political Report&quot; and caused controversy, especially among the U.S. diplomatic corps.

Buchanan remarked about Watergate: &quot;The lost opportunity to move against the political forces frustrating the expressed national will ... To effect a political counterrevolution in the capital— ... there is no substitute for a principled and dedicated man of the Right in the Oval Office&quot;.

Long after his resignation, Nixon called Buchanan a confidant and said he was neither a racist nor an antisemite nor a bigot or &quot;hater,&quot; but a &quot;decent, patriotic American.&quot; Nixon said Buchanan had &quot;some strong views,&quot; such as his &quot;isolationist&quot; foreign policy, with which he disagreed. While Nixon did not think Buchanan should become president, he said the commentator &quot;should be heard.&quot; However, according to a memo President Nixon sent to John Ehrlichman in 1970, Nixon characterized Buchanan&#x27;s attitude towards integration as &quot;segregation forever.&quot; Following Nixon&#x27;s re-election in 1972, Buchanan himself had written in a memo to Nixon suggesting he should not &quot;fritter away his present high support in the nation for an ill-advised governmental effort to forcibly integrate races.&quot;

===News commentator===

Buchanan returned to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and political commentator. He co-hosted a three-hour daily radio show with liberal columnist Tom Braden called the &quot;Buchanan-Braden Program&quot;. He delivered daily commentaries on NBC radio from 1978 to 1984. Buchanan started his TV career as a regular on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; and CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; (inspired by &quot;Buchanan-Braden&quot;) and &quot;The Capital Gang&quot;, making him nationally recognizable. His several stints on &quot;Crossfire&quot; occurred between 1982 and 1999; his sparring partners included Braden, Michael Kinsley, Geraldine Ferraro, and Bill Press.

Buchanan was a regular panelist on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;. He appeared most Sundays alongside John McLaughlin and the more liberal Newsweek journalist Eleanor Clift. His columns are syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate.

===Work for the Reagan White House===

Buchanan served as White House Communications Director from February 1985 to March 1987. In a speech to the National Religious Broadcasters in 1986, Buchanan said of the Reagan administration: &quot;Whether President Reagan has charted a new course that will set our compass for decadesor whether history will see him as the conservative interruption in a process of inexorable national declineis yet to be determined&quot;.

A year later, he remarked that &quot;the greatest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan.&quot; While her brother was working for Reagan, Bay Buchanan started a &quot;Buchanan for President&quot; movement in June 1986. She said the conservative movement needed a leader, but Buchanan was initially ambivalent. After leaving the White House, he returned to his column and &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Out of respect for Jack Kemp he sat out the 1988 race, although Kemp later became his adversary.

==Political campaigns==

===1992 presidential primaries===


Buchanan was highly critical of the foreign and economic policies of the George H.W. Bush administration, particularly Bush&#x27;s breaking of his 1988 &quot;Read my lips: no new taxes&quot; pledge. In 1990, Buchanan published a newsletter called &quot;Patrick J. Buchanan: From the Right&quot;; it sent subscribers a bumper sticker reading: &quot;Read Our Lips! No new taxes.&quot; In the 1992 Republican Party presidential primaries, Buchanan challenged Bush in his bid for re-nomination by the Republican Party, launching his campaign in December 1991. Buchanan failed to win any primaries, but finished a strong second in the New Hampshire primary and was regarded as forcing Bush to walk back his economic policies. The Buchanan campaign ran a number of radio and TV spots criticizing Bush&#x27;s policies; in one, Buchanan accused Bush of being a &quot;trade wimp&quot;, while another attacked him for presiding over the National Endowment of the Arts, which he said &quot;invested our tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art too shocking to show.&quot;

In 1992, Buchanan explained his reasons for challenging the incumbent, President George H. W. Bush:

He ran on a platform of immigration reduction and social conservatism, including opposition to multiculturalism, abortion, and gay rights. Buchanan challenged Bush (whose popularity was waning) when he won 38% of the New Hampshire primary. In the primary elections, Buchanan garnered three million total votes or 23% of the vote.

Buchanan later threw his support behind Bush and delivered an address at the 1992 Republican National Convention, which became known as the culture war speech, in which he described &quot;a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America.&quot; In the speech, he said of Bill and Hillary Clinton:

Buchanan also said, in reference to the then recently held 1992 Democratic National Convention, &quot;Like many of you last month, I watched that giant masquerade ball at Madison Square Garden—where 20,000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists—in the greatest single exhibition of cross-dressing in American political history.&quot;

The contents of Buchanan&#x27;s speech prompted his detractors to claim that the speech alienated moderate voters from the Bush-Quayle ticket. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins wrote: &quot;Many people did not care for Pat Buchanan&#x27;s speech; it probably sounded better in the original German.&quot;

===Off the campaign trail===
Buchanan returned to his column and &quot;Crossfire&quot;. To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded The American Cause, a conservative educational foundation, in 1993. Bay Buchanan serves as the Vienna, VA-based foundation&#x27;s president and Pat is its chairman.

Buchanan returned to radio as host of &quot;Buchanan and Company&quot;, a three-hour talk show for Mutual Broadcasting System on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including Barry Lynn, Bob Beckel, and Chris Matthews, in a time slot opposite Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.

===1996 presidential primaries===
Buchanan again ran for the Republican nomination in 1996. He was endorsed by conservative Phyllis Schlafly, among others.

In February, the liberal Center for Public Integrity issued a report claiming Buchanan&#x27;s presidential campaign co-chairman, Larry Pratt, appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the conservative Manchester &quot;Union Leader&quot; he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence &quot;to answer these charges,&quot; &quot;so as not to have distraction in the campaign.&quot;

In the February New Hampshire primary, Buchanan defeated front-runner Bob Dole by about 3,000 votes. Buchanan won three other states (Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the Iowa caucus. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right-wing opinion against what he saw as the bland Washington establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:
 
In the Super Tuesday primaries Dole defeated Buchanan by large margins. Having collected only 21%, or 3.1 million, of the total votes in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a pro-choice running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now Constitution Party) candidate. Dole chose Jack Kemp, and he received Buchanan&#x27;s endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and &quot;Crossfire&quot;. He also began a series of books with 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;.

===2000 presidential campaign===
Buchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a &quot;beltway party.&quot; He sought the nomination of the Reform Party. Many reformers backed Iowa physicist John Hagelin, whose platform was based on Transcendental Meditation. Party founder Ross Perot did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination. (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot&#x27;s 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)

Supporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party&#x27;s open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were &quot;tainted.&quot; The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions&#x27; delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.

Ultimately, when the Federal Elections Commission ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot&#x27;s showing in the 1996 election, Buchanan won the nomination. In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the United Nations Headquarters from New York, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Housing and Urban Development, taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and affirmative action programs.

As his running mate, Buchanan chose African American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, Ezola B. Foster. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future Socialist Party USA presidential candidate Brian Moore, who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because &quot;he was for fair trade over free trade. He had some progressive positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.&quot; On August 19, the New York Right to Life Party, in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him.

In a campaign speech at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, Buchanan attempted to rally his conservative base:

In the 2000 presidential election, Buchanan finished fourth with 449,895 votes, 0.4% of the popular vote. (Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the Natural Law Party candidate.) In Palm Beach County, Florida, Buchanan received 3,407 voteswhich some saw as inconsistent with Palm Beach County&#x27;s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer stated, &quot;Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that&#x27;s why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.&quot; Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500. Appearing on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, Buchanan said: &quot;When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it&#x27;s very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for Al Gore&quot;. Palm Beach County&#x27;s butterfly ballot is credited with misdirecting over 2,000 votes from Al Gore to Pat Buchanan, tipping Florida — and the 2000 U.S. presidential election — to George W. Bush.

Some observers said his campaign was aimed at spreading his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.

===Later presidential elections===
Following the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the neo-conservative Republican party leadership. Prior to the 2004 election, Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush&#x27;s 2004 reelection, writing: &quot;Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values. Kerry is right on nothing&quot;.

Buchanan also endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, stating in an article that &quot;Obama offers more of the stalemate America has gone through for the past two years&quot; while &quot;Romney alone offers a possibility of hope and change.&quot;

Buchanan supported the nomination of Donald Trump, who ran on many of the same positions that Buchanan ran on twenty years prior, as Republican presidential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.

==Later media activities==
===MSNBC commentator===

Although CNN decided not to take him back, Buchanan&#x27;s column resumed. A longer variation of the &quot;Crossfire&quot; format was aired by MSNBC as &quot;Buchanan &amp; Press&quot; on July 15, 2002, reuniting Buchanan and Press. Billed as &quot;the smartest hour on television&quot;, &quot;Buchanan and Press&quot; featured the duo interviewing guests and sparring about the top news stories. As the Iraq War loomed, Buchanan and Press toned down their rivalry, as they both opposed the invasion. Press claims they were the first cable hosts to discuss the planned attack. MSNBC Editor-in-Chief Jerry Nachman once jokingly lamented this unusual situation:

Just hours after his talk show debuted, Buchanan was a guest on the premiere of MSNBC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Donahue&quot; program. Host Phil Donahue and Buchanan debated the separation of church and state. Buchanan called Donahue &quot;dictatorial&quot; and said that the host got his job through affirmative action.

MSNBC President Eric Sorenson canceled &quot;Buchanan &amp; Press&quot; on November 26, 2003. Buchanan stayed at MSNBC as a political analyst. He regularly appeared on the network&#x27;s talk shows. He occasionally filled in on the nightly show &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; during its run on MSNBC. Buchanan also was a frequent guest and co-host of &quot;Morning Joe&quot; as well as &quot;Hardball&quot; and &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;.

In September 2009, Buchanan wrote an MSNBC opinion column arguing that Adolf Hitler did not want war and the Allied powers&#x27; actions were unnecessary. The article was removed from the website after MSNBC was urged to do so in a public statement by the National Jewish Democratic Council. Buchanan had used the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the German invasion of Poland to argue that the United Kingdom should not have declared war on Nazi Germany. This revived charges of antisemitism and helping to legitimize Holocaust denial.

In October 2011, Buchanan was indefinitely suspended from MSNBC as a contributor after the publication of his book &quot;Suicide of a Superpower&quot;. One of the book&#x27;s chapters is titled, &quot;The End of White America.&quot; The minority advocacy group Color of Change had urged MSNBC to fire him over alleged racial slurs. It was announced on February 16, 2012, that MSNBC&#x27;s connection with Buchanan had ended.

===&quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazine===

In 2002, Buchanan partnered with former &quot;New York Post&quot; editorial page editor Scott McConnell and journalist Taki Theodoracopulos to found &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, a new magazine intended to promote traditional conservative viewpoints on economic, immigration and foreign policies. The first issue was dated October 7, 2002.

=== VDARE ===
From 2006 until his retirement in 2023, Buchanan had been a frequent contributor to VDARE, a far-right website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow. VDARE is considered a white nationalist news source by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

==Controversies==
=== Antisemitism allegations ===
In December 1991, a 40,000-word article by William F. Buckley Jr. was published in the &quot;National Review&quot; discussing antisemitism among conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book &quot;In Search of Anti-Semitism&quot; (1992). He wrote: &quot;I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism&quot;, but concluded: &quot;If you ask, do I think Pat Buchanan is an anti-Semite, my answer is he is not one. But I think he&#x27;s said some anti-Semitic things.&quot;

The Anti-Defamation League has described Buchanan as an &quot;unrepentant bigot&quot; who &quot;repeatedly demonizes Jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists.&quot; In an article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in March 1992, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer suggested: &quot;The real problem with Buchanan ... is not that his instincts are antisemitic but that they are, in various and distinct ways, fascistic.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt,&quot; said Krauthammer in 1999 when contacted for a &quot;Salon&quot; article, &quot;he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice.&quot; He added: &quot;The interesting thing is how he can say these things and still be considered a national figure.&quot; Buchanan denies assertions that he is an antisemite, and some of his fellow journalists, including Murray Rothbard, Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge.

====Nazi war criminals====
Around 1982, Buchanan began to defend Cleveland auto-worker John Demjanjuk against the charge that Demjanjuk was a Nazi war criminal nicknamed &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; responsible for the mass murder of Jews at Treblinka. In 1986, while he was a senior figure in the Reagan administration, he was highly critical of the charges brought by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), the Nazi war crimes unit of the Justice Department. He claimed Demjanjuk was the victim of mistaken identity and possibly the victim of a deliberate frame-up by the Soviet Union.

The following year, while still a member of the administration, he made unofficial attempts to stop the deportation of suspected Nazi war criminals from the Eastern Bloc, including Estonian Karl Linnas as well as Demjanjuk. Menachem Z. Rosensaft, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, described Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;oft-expressed sympathy for a host of Nazi criminals&quot; like Linnas as being &quot;a constitutionally protected perversion.&quot; Buchanan referred to such cases as being pursued by &quot;revenge-obsessed Nazi hunters&quot; in 1987. As a member of the Reagan White House, he was accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department&#x27;s investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS&#x27;s Operation Paperclip.

In 1990, Allan Ryan Jr., a former head of the OSI said Buchanan&#x27;s accusation of KGB involvement in the Demjanjuk case was &quot;an absolutely cockamamie theory.&quot; Ryan accused Buchanan of being &quot;the spokesman for Nazi war criminals in America.&quot; Neal Sher, OSI head in 1990 said Buchanan had never contacted them, even when he was a government official. &quot;He essentially took what was fed him by our opponents, sometimes Holocaust-deniers, and just regurgitated it,&quot; Sher told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In 1993, however, the Supreme Court of Israel overturned Demjanjuk&#x27;s war crimes conviction and sentence of death by hanging as a miscarriage of justice based on mistaken identity. Demjanjuk then returned to the United States to fight the revocation of his American citizenship. 

Following an elderly Demjanjuk&#x27;s re-arrest and extradition to the Federal Republic of Germany in 2009, Menachem Z. Rosensaft in &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; and Jeffrey Goldberg in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, objected to an outraged Buchanan again accusing the case of being a frame-up and comparing Demjanjuk to Jesus Christ and calling him an &quot;American Dreyfuss.&quot; This was alleged by Goldberg as an example of the libel that the Jews as a whole killed Christ. Describing Buchanan&#x27;s comparison as &quot;strikingly offensive&quot; and an attempt to &quot;revive the charge of blood libel&quot; against Jews, Peter Wehner wrote in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine: &quot;Rarely do you find such an obscene mix of blasphemy and bigotry, and all in less than 900 words.&quot; Demjanjuk was later convicted of being an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor extermination camp. Demjanjuk died in 2012, while the verdict had been overturned and was pending appeal.

====Bitburg visit by President Reagan====
Buchanan supported President Reagan&#x27;s plan to visit a German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, where among buried Wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 Waffen SS members. At the insistence of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and over the vocal objections of Jewish groups, the trip went ahead. In a 1992 interview, Elie Wiesel described attending a White House meeting of Jewish leaders about the trip: &quot;The only one really defending the trip was Pat Buchanan, saying, &#x27;We cannot give the perception of the President being subjected to Jewish pressure.&#x27;&quot; Buchanan accused Wiesel of fabricating the story in an ABC interview in 1992: &quot;I didn&#x27;t say it and Elie Wiesel wasn&#x27;t even in the meeting ... That meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news.&quot;

====Comments on the Holocaust====
In a 1990 column for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka in a return to his interest in the Demjanjuk case. &quot;Diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide to kill anybody,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cited experts to the effect that there is more than sufficient carbon monoxide present in the fumes to speedily asphyxiate victims, causing their death. Buchanan once argued Treblinka &quot;was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a &#x27;pass-through point&#x27; for prisoners&quot;. In fact, historians have estimated that some 900,000 Jews were murdered at Treblinka. When George Will challenged him on the issue on TV in December 1991, Buchanan did not reply.

====Comments about Israel====
In the context of the Gulf War, on August 26, 1990, Buchanan appeared on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; and said: &quot;there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its &#x27;amen corner&#x27; in the United States.&quot; Buchanan on &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; on June 15, 1990, asserted: &quot;Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory&quot;. He also said in the August 1990 program: &quot;The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don&#x27;t care about our relations with the Arab world.&quot; A. M. Rosenthal, in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; explicitly accused Buchanan of antisemitism on the grounds that he had used the word &quot;Israelis&quot; as a cover for Jews. Abraham Foxman, the director of the ADL, compared Buchanan&#x27;s comments to insinuations made during the Second World War &quot;that Jews were the only ones who sought American entry in the war against Nazi Germany&quot;.

Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel in September 1990 said Buchanan &quot;leaves the memory of Jewish victims in such disdain; a man who always takes the side of those accused of being killers; a man who is constantly criticizing Israel; a man who always has something nasty to say about the Jewish people&quot;.

=== Central Park jogger case ===
In a 1989 column, Buchanan called for the public hanging in Central Park of a 16-year-old black teenager and the horsewhipping of four other younger African American and Hispanic teenagers for allegedly raping a white jogger in the Central Park Five case. He also called for the civilizing of &quot;barbarians&quot; by putting the &quot;fear of death&quot; in them. Robert C. Smith, professor of political science at San Francisco State University, characterized the column as racist. The five teenagers were convicted, but their charges were later withdrawn, when in 2002 a man said he acted alone and DNA testing affirmed his guilt. All sentences of the Central Park Five were vacated that same year, 13 years after Buchanan called for the public hanging and horsewhipping.

==Personal life==

Buchanan married White House staffer Shelley Ann Scarney in 1971. They had a tabby cat named Gipper, who reportedly would sit on Buchanan&#x27;s lap during staff meetings. Buchanan identifies as a traditionalist Catholic who attends Mass in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, and strongly defended &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;.

<doc id="168892" wikidata="Q1642249" url="?curid=168892" title="Miranda v. Arizona">
<text>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that law enforcement in the United States must warn a person of their constitutional rights before interrogating them, or else the person&#x27;s statements cannot be used as evidence at their trial. Specifically, the Court held that under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the government cannot use a person&#x27;s statements made in response to an interrogation while in police custody as evidence at the person&#x27;s criminal trial unless they can show that the person was informed of the right to consult with a lawyer before and during questioning, and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights but also voluntarily waived them before answering questions.

&quot;Miranda&quot; was viewed by many as a radical change in American criminal law, since the Fifth Amendment was traditionally understood only to protect Americans against formal types of compulsion to confess, such as threats of contempt of court. It has had a significant impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what became known as the &quot;Miranda&quot; warning part of routine police procedure to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights, which would become known as &quot;&quot;Miranda&quot; rights&quot;. The concept of &quot;Miranda warnings&quot; quickly caught on across American law enforcement agencies, who came to call the practice &quot;Mirandizing&quot;.

Pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Berghuis v. Thompkins&quot; (2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and to an attorney but choose not to &quot;unambiguously&quot; invoke them may find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied waiver of their rights, and used as or as part of evidence. 
== Background ==
=== Legal ===
In 1951 &quot;Legal Aid in the United States&quot;, a report in the Survey of the Legal Profession series, was published by the American Bar Association. It identified large gaps in the availability of legal services in both civil and criminal cases for those unable to afford a lawyer. By the early 1960s, in response to the report, efforts by various bar associations to expand legal aid for defendants had resulted in a substantial increase in services albeit still with large areas of the country underserved.

In the civil realm, it led to the creation of the Legal Services Corporation under the Great Society program of Lyndon B. Johnson. &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;, a case which closely foreshadowed &quot;Miranda,&quot; provided for the presence of counsel during police interrogation.

=== Factual ===

On March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by the Phoenix Police Department officers Carroll Cooley and Wilfred Young, based on circumstantial evidence linking him to the kidnapping and rape of an 18-year-old woman 10 days earlier. After two hours of interrogation by police officers, Miranda signed a confession to the rape charge on forms that included the typed statement: &quot;I do hereby swear that I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.&quot;

However, at no time was Miranda told of his right to counsel. Before being presented with the form on which he was asked to write out the confession that he had already given orally, he was not advised of his right to remain silent, nor was he informed that his statements during the interrogation would be used against him. At trial, when prosecutors offered Miranda&#x27;s written confession as evidence, his court-appointed lawyer, Alvin Moore, objected that because of these facts, the confession was not truly voluntary and should be excluded. Moore&#x27;s objection was overruled, and based on this confession and other evidence, Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 20–30 years of imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run concurrently. Moore filed Miranda&#x27;s appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, claiming that Miranda&#x27;s confession was not fully voluntary and should not have been admitted into the court proceedings. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the trial court&#x27;s decision to admit the confession in &quot;State v. Miranda&quot;, 401 P.2d 721 (Ariz. 1965). In affirmation, the Arizona Supreme Court heavily emphasized the fact that Miranda did not specifically request an attorney.

Attorney John Paul Frank, former law clerk to Justice Hugo Black, represented Miranda in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gary K. Nelson represented Arizona.

== Supreme Court decision ==
On June 13, 1966, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision in Miranda&#x27;s favor that overturned his conviction and remanded his case back to Arizona for retrial.

===Opinion of the Court===

Five justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The Court ruled that because of the coercive nature of the custodial interrogation by police (Warren cited several police training manuals that had not been provided in the arguments), no confession could be admissible under the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and Sixth Amendment right to an attorney unless a suspect has been made aware of his rights and the suspect has then waived them:

Thus, Miranda&#x27;s conviction was overturned. The Court also made clear what must happen if a suspect chooses to exercise their rights:


Warren also pointed to the existing procedures of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which required informing a suspect of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel, provided free of charge if the suspect was unable to pay. If the suspect requested counsel, &quot;the interview is terminated.&quot; Warren included the FBI&#x27;s four-page brief in his opinion.

=== Clark&#x27;s concurrence in part, dissent in part ===
In a separate concurrence in part, dissent in part, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the Warren Court went &quot;too far too fast.&quot; Instead, Justice Clark would use the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test enunciated by Justice Goldberg in &quot;Haynes v. Washington&quot;. Under this test, the court would:

=== Harlan&#x27;s dissent ===
In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that &quot;nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipitously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.&quot; Harlan closed his remarks by quoting former Justice Robert H. Jackson: &quot;This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.&quot;

=== White&#x27;s dissent ===
Justice Byron White took issue with the court having announced a new constitutional right when it had no &quot;factual and textual bases&quot; in the Constitution or previous opinions of the Court for the rule announced in the opinion. He stated: &quot;The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids in-custody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.&quot; White did not believe the right had any basis in English common law.

White further warned of the dire consequences of the majority opinion:

== Subsequent developments ==
===Retrial===
Miranda was retried in 1967 after the original case against him was thrown out. This time the prosecution, instead of using the confession, introduced other evidence and called witnesses. One witness was Twila Hoffman, a woman with whom Miranda was living at the time of the offense; she testified that he had told her of committing the crime. Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed, and the United States Supreme Court denied review. Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers&#x27; &quot;Miranda cards&quot; that contained the text of the warning for reading to arrestees. Miranda was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31, 1976. A suspect was arrested, but due to a lack of evidence against him, he was released.

Another three defendants whose cases had been tied in with Miranda&#x27;s – an armed robber, a stick-up man, and a bank robber – either made plea bargains to lesser charges or were found guilty again despite the exclusion of their confessions.

===Reaction===
The &quot;Miranda&quot; decision was widely criticized when it came down, as many felt it was unfair to inform suspected criminals of their rights, as outlined in the decision. Richard Nixon and conservatives denounced &quot;Miranda&quot; for undermining the efficiency of the police, and argued the ruling would contribute to an increase in crime. Nixon, upon becoming president, promised to appoint judges who would reverse the philosophy that he viewed as &quot;soft on crime.&quot; Many supporters of law enforcement were angered by the decision&#x27;s negative view of police officers.

===Miranda warning===

After the &quot;Miranda&quot; decision, the nation&#x27;s police departments were required to inform arrested persons or suspects of their rights under the ruling prior to custodial interrogation or their answers would not be admissible in court. Such information is called a Miranda warning. Since it is usually required that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

Many American police departments have pre-printed Miranda waiver forms that a suspect must sign and date (after hearing and reading the warnings again) if an interrogation is to occur.

Data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports show a sharp reduction in the clearance rate of violent and property crimes after &quot;Miranda&quot;. However, according to other studies from the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;contrary to popular belief, Miranda had little, if any, effect on detectives&#x27; ability to solve crimes.&quot;

===Legal developments===
The federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 purported to overrule &quot;Miranda&quot; for federal criminal cases and restore the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test that had prevailed previous to &quot;Miranda&quot;. The validity of this provision of the law, which is still codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3501, was not ruled on for another 30 years because the Justice Department never attempted to rely on it to support the introduction of a confession into evidence at any criminal trial.

&quot;Miranda&quot; was undermined by several subsequent decisions that seemed to grant exceptions to the Miranda warnings, challenging the ruling&#x27;s claim to be a necessary corollary of the Fifth Amendment. The exceptions and developments that occurred over the years included:

* The Court held in &quot;Harris v. New York&quot;, , that a confession obtained in violation of the &quot;Miranda&quot; standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching the defendant&#x27;s testimony; that is, if the defendant takes the stand at trial and the prosecution wishes to introduce the defendant&#x27;s confession as a prior inconsistent statement to attack the defendant&#x27;s credibility, the &quot;Miranda&quot; holding will not prohibit this.
* The Court held in &quot;Rhode Island v. Innis&quot;, , that a &quot;spontaneous&quot; statement made by a defendant while in custody, even though the defendant has not been given the Miranda warnings or has invoked the right to counsel and a lawyer is not yet present, is admissible in evidence, as long as the statement was not given in response to police questioning or other conduct by the police likely to produce an incriminating response.
* The Court held in &quot;Berkemer v. McCarty&quot;, , that a person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in &quot;Miranda&quot;, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which he is suspected or for which he was arrested.
* The Court held in &quot;New York v. Quarles&quot;, , that there is also a &quot;public safety&quot; exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given before questioning; for example, if the defendant is in possession of information regarding the location of an unattended gun or there are other similar exigent circumstances that require protection of the public, the defendant may be questioned without warning and his responses, though incriminating, will be admissible in evidence. In 2009, the California Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Richard Allen Davis, finding that the public-safety exception applied despite the fact that 64 days had passed from the disappearance of the girl later found to be murdered.
* The Court held in &quot;Colorado v. Connelly&quot;, , that the words &quot;knowing, intelligent, and voluntary&quot; mean only that suspects reasonably appear to understand what they are doing and are not being coerced into signing the waiver; the Court ruled that it is irrelevant whether the suspect may actually have been cognitively or mentally impaired at the time.

&quot;United States v. Garibay&quot; (1998) clarified an important matter regarding the scope of &quot;Miranda&quot;. Defendant Jose Garibay barely spoke English and clearly showed a lack of understanding; indeed, &quot;the agent admitted that he had to rephrase questions when the defendant appeared confused.&quot; Because of the defendant&#x27;s low I.Q. and poor English-language skills, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that it was a &quot;clear error&quot; when the district court found that Garibay had &quot;knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights.&quot; The court investigated his waiver and discovered that it was missing all items for which they were looking: he never signed a waiver, he only received his warnings verbally and in English, and no interpreter was provided although they were available. With an opinion that stressed &quot;the requirement that a defendant &#x27;knowingly and intelligently&#x27; waive his Miranda rights,&quot; the Court reversed Garibay&#x27;s conviction and remanded his case.

&quot;Miranda&quot; survived a strong challenge in &quot;Dickerson v. United States&quot;, , when the validity of Congress&#x27;s overruling of &quot;Miranda&quot; through § 3501 was tested. At issue was whether the Miranda warnings were actually compelled by the Constitution, or were rather merely measures enacted as a matter of judicial policy. In &quot;Dickerson&quot;, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Rehnquist, upheld &quot;Miranda&quot; 7–2 and stated that &quot;the warnings have become part of our national culture&quot;. In dissent, Justice Scalia argued that &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings were not constitutionally required. He cited several cases demonstrating a majority of the then-current court, counting himself, and Justices Kennedy, O&#x27;Connor, and Thomas, as well as Rehnquist (who had just delivered a contrary opinion), &quot;[were] on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution.&quot;

Over time, interrogators began to devise techniques to honor the &quot;letter&quot; but not the &quot;spirit&quot; of Miranda. In the case of &quot;Missouri v. Seibert&quot;, , the Supreme Court halted one of the more controversial practices. Missouri police had been deliberately withholding Miranda warnings and questioning suspects until they obtained confessions, then providing the warnings, getting waivers, and eliciting confessions again. Justice Souter wrote for the plurality: &quot;Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of &quot;Miranda&quot; cannot accomplish by training instructions what &quot;Dickerson&quot; held Congress could not do by statute.&quot;

&quot;Berghuis v. Thompkins&quot; (2010) was a ruling in which the Supreme Court held that a suspect&#x27;s &quot;ambiguous or equivocal&quot; statement, or lack of statements, does not mean that police must end an interrogation. At least one scholar has argued that &quot;Thompkins&quot; effectively gutted &quot;Miranda&quot;. In &quot;The Right to Remain Silent&quot;, Charles Weisselberg wrote that &quot;the majority in &quot;Thompkins&quot; rejected the fundamental underpinnings of &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;&#x27;s prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails to protect the rights of suspects&quot; and that 
In &quot;Vega v. Tekoh&quot; (2022), the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that police officers could not be sued under a particular statutory cause of action for failing to administer the Miranda warning, ruling that not every &quot;Miranda&quot; violation is a deprivation of a constitutional right. In dissent, three justices held that the court had &quot;repeatedly and emphatically&quot; determined that the &quot;Miranda&quot; decision established a constitutional right, and would have allowed such lawsuits. According to pundits, the ruling &quot;Vega v. Tekoh&quot; &quot;makes it easier for police to obtain coerced confessions – by continuing to ask questions even if someone doesn&#x27;t want to speak&quot; and &quot;guts a major pathway for incentivizing police to provide a Miranda warning and ensuring their accountability.&quot;

===Effect on law enforcement===

&quot;Miranda&quot;″s impact on law enforcement remains in dispute. Many legal scholars believe that police have adjusted their practices in response to &quot;Miranda&quot; and that its mandates have not hampered police investigations. Others argue that the &quot;Miranda&quot; rule has resulted in a lower rate of conviction, with a possible reduction in the rate of confessions of between four and sixteen percent. Some scholars argue that Miranda warnings have reduced the rate at which the police solve crimes, while others question their methodology and conclusions.

<doc id="168894" wikidata="Q6124208" url="?curid=168894" title="Schenck v. United States">
<text>Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court concerning enforcement of the Espionage Act of 1917 during World War I. A unanimous Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., concluded that Charles Schenck and other defendants, who distributed flyers to draft-age men urging resistance to induction, could be convicted of an attempt to obstruct the draft, a criminal offense. The First Amendment did not protect Schenck from prosecution, even though, &quot;in many places and in ordinary times, the defendants, in saying all that was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.&quot; In this case, Holmes said, &quot;the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.&quot; Therefore, Schenck could be punished.

The Court followed this reasoning to uphold a series of convictions arising out of prosecutions during wartime, but Holmes began to dissent in the case of &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;, insisting that the Court had departed from the standard he had crafted for them and had begun to allow punishment for ideas. In 1969, &quot;Schenck&quot; was largely overturned by &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, which limited the scope of speech that the government may ban to that directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot).

==Background==
&quot;Schenck&quot; was the first in a line of Supreme Court cases defining the modern understanding of the First Amendment. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the often-cited opinion. The United States&#x27; entry into the First World War had caused deep divisions in society and was vigorously opposed, especially by socialists, pacifists, isolationists, and those who had ties to Germany. The Wilson administration launched a broad campaign of criminal enforcement that resulted in thousands of prosecutions. Many of these were for trivial acts of dissent that today would be protected by the First Amendment.

In the first case arising from this campaign to come before the Court&quot;Baltzer v. United States&quot;, 248 U.S. 593 (1918)South Dakota farmers had signed a petition criticizing their governor&#x27;s administration of the draft, threatening him with defeat at the polls. They were charged with obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service, and convicted. When a majority of the Court voted during their conference to affirm the conviction, Holmes quickly drafted and circulated a strongly worded dissenting opinion:Real obstructions of the law, giving real aid and comfort to the enemy, I should have been glad to see punished more summarily and severely than they sometimes were. But I think that our intention to put out all our powers in aid of success in war should not hurry us into intolerance of opinions and speech that could not be imagined to do harm, although opposed to our own. It is better for those who have unquestioned and almost unlimited power in their hands to err on the side of freedom.Rather than proceed in the face of Holmes&#x27;s biting dissent, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White set the case aside. Word of the situation evidently reached the Administration, because it abandoned the prosecution. White then asked Holmes to write the opinion for a unanimous Court in the next case, one in which they could agree, &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;. Holmes wrote that opinion and wrote again for a unanimous court upholding convictions in two more cases that spring, &quot;Frohwerk v. United States&quot; and &quot;Debs v. United States&quot;, establishing the standard for deciding the constitutionality of criminal convictions based on expressive behavior. Holmes disliked legislative-style formulas, and he did not repeat the language of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; in any subsequent opinion, however. &quot;Schenck&quot; alone accordingly is often cited as the source of this legal standard, and some scholars have suggested that Holmes changed his mind and offered a different view in his equally famous dissent in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;. The events leading to the assignment of the &quot;Schenck&quot; opinion to Holmes were discovered when Holmes&#x27;s biographer Sheldon Novick unearthed the unpublished &quot;Baltzer&quot; opinion among Holmes&#x27;s papers at Harvard Law School.
The facts of the &quot;Schenck&quot; case were as follows. Charles Schenck and Elizabeth Baer were members of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia, of which Schenck was General Secretary. The executive committee authorized, and Schenck oversaw, printing and mailing more than 15,000 fliers to men slated for conscription during World War I. The fliers urged men not to submit to the draft, saying &quot;Do not submit to intimidation&quot;, &quot;Assert your rights&quot;, &quot;If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain,&quot; and urged men not to comply with the draft on the grounds that military conscription constituted involuntary servitude, which is prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment.

After jury trials Schenck and Baer were convicted of violating Section 3 of the Espionage Act of 1917. Both defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court, arguing that their conviction, and the statute which purported to authorize it, were contrary to the First Amendment. They relied heavily on the text of the First Amendment, and their claim that the Espionage Act of 1917 had what today one would call a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free discussion of the war effort.

==The Court&#x27;s decision==

The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., held that Schenck&#x27;s criminal conviction was constitutional. The statute only applied to successful obstructions of the draft, but common-law precedents allowed prosecution for attempts that were dangerously close to success. Attempts made by speech or writing could be punished like other attempted crimes; the First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging men to resist induction, because, &quot;when a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.&quot; In other words, the court held, the circumstances of wartime allow greater restrictions on free speech than would be allowed during peacetime, if only because new and greater dangers are present.

The opinion&#x27;s most famous and most often quoted passage was this: The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. The phrase &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; has since become a popular metaphor for the dangers or limitations of free speech, even though Holmes limited it to &quot;falsely&quot; shouting and did not specify a &quot;crowded&quot; theater.

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
In subsequent cases, when it appeared to him that the Court was departing from the precedents established in &quot;Schenck&quot; and companion cases, Holmes dissented, reiterating his view that expressions of honest opinion were entitled to near absolute protection, but that expressions made with the specific intent to cause a criminal harm, or that threatened a clear and present danger of such harm, could be punished. In &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot;, he elaborated on the common-law privileges for freedom of speech and of the press, and stated his conviction that freedom of opinion was central to the constitutional scheme because competition in the &quot;marketplace&quot; of ideas was the best test of their truth. In &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; (1927), concerning a conviction for seditious speech forbidden by California law, Holmes joined a concurring opinion written by Justice Louis D. Brandeis once again explaining the clear-and-present-danger standard for criminal attempts in these terms, reiterating the argument that political speech was protected because of the value of democratic deliberation. The Supreme Court continued to affirm convictions for seditious speech in a series of prosecutions of leftists, however, culminating in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, 341 U.S. 494 (1951) in which a bitterly divided Court upheld the sedition convictions for the leaders of the Communist Party. Judge Learned Hand in the court below and Chief Justice Vinson for the plurality in the Supreme Court cited &quot;Schenck&quot;, and the language of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; accordingly fell into disfavor among the advocates of free speech and freedom of the press.

A unanimous Court in a brief &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; (1969), abandoned the disfavored language while seemingly applying the reasoning of &quot;Schenck&quot; to reverse the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member prosecuted for giving an inflammatory speech. The Court said that speech could be prosecuted only when it posed a danger of &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot; a formulation that is sometimes said to reflect Holmes&#x27; reasoning as more fully explicated in his &quot;Abrams&quot; dissent, rather than the common law of attempts explained in &quot;Schenck&quot;. &quot;Brandenburg&quot; is also taken to have repudiated the clear-and-present-danger standard as construed in &quot;Dennis&quot;, and to have adopted something more like the explication given by Holmes and Brandeis in subsequent opinions. Partly because the standard for protecting expressive behavior under the First Amendment was stated differently in his different opinions, &quot;revisionist&quot; scholars have argued that Holmes changed his mind in the summer of 1919, and that after writing three opinions for a unanimous court, he stated a different and more liberal view in his &quot;Abrams&quot; dissent a few weeks later. Bolstered by this argument, a number of advocates for freedom of expression have insisted that the Supreme Court has rejected &quot;Schenck&quot; and the majority opinion in &quot;Abrams,&quot; and in practice has followed the reasoning of Holmes&#x27; &quot;Abrams&quot; dissent and Brandeis&#x27; and Holmes&#x27; concurring opinion in &quot;Whitney&quot;.

<doc id="168896" wikidata="Q5069667" url="?curid=168896" title="Chambers v. Florida">
<text>Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 (1940), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that dealt with the extent to which police pressure resulting in a criminal defendant&#x27;s confession violates the Due Process Clause.

==Case ==
The case was argued on January 6, 1940, in front of the court by S.D. McGill, a Black civil rights attorney involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, representing four black men convicted for the murder of a white man in Florida. McGill, joined by Leon A. Ransom of the NAACP National Legal Committee, argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. Thurgood Marshall, special counsel for the NAACP, appeared on the defendants’ brief but did not participate in the courtroom arguments. 

The defendant Chambers, along with three other co-defendants, were four of up to forty transient black men arrested for the murder of Robert Darcy, an elderly local man, in Pompano Beach, Florida. The community was outraged by the murder, and the Broward County Sheriff&#x27;s department was apparently under pressure to close the case. Chambers and the other defendants were taken to Miami for questioning, ostensibly to protect them from the mob that had formed, and then to Fort Lauderdale.

The state did not contest that the defendants were held without access to legal counsel, and were not arraigned for a week. They were subjected to questioning on a random basis, often alone in a room with up to ten police officers and other members of the community. In the legal climate before &quot;Miranda&quot;, they were not informed of their right to remain silent. After a week of questioning, and despite previous denials, the four co-defendants eventually confessed to the crime and were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Their convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida.

==Decision==
On February 13, 1940, the court delivered its ruling. The opinion of the court was delivered by Justice Hugo Black of Alabama.

This was Marshall&#x27;s first of many triumphs in front of the nation&#x27;s highest tribunal; the Court ruled in favor of the defendants, and overturned their convictions. The court found that on the facts admitted by the police and sheriff&#x27;s officers, the confessions had clearly been compelled and were therefore inadmissible. It marked one of the first times that the court had accepted the contention that treatment short of physical violence should result in the suppression of evidence.

Several of the features of this case, such as not allowing defendants to contact anyone, holding them without formal charges or arraignment, and denying them counsel during questioning were common tactics in law enforcement at the time and were eventually rejected by the court in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966), a case in which Marshall argued on behalf of the United States government as Solicitor General of the United States.

==Aftermath==
In subsequent proceedings before the Florida courts, the indictment against the defendants was quashed on the ground that blacks had been arbitrarily and intentionally excluded from the grand jury.

<doc id="168897" wikidata="Q2982599" url="?curid=168897" title="1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting">
<text>On December 7, 1993, a mass shooting occurred aboard a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) train in Garden City Park, New York, United States. As the train arrived at the Merillon Avenue station, passenger Colin Ferguson began firing at other passengers with a semi-automatic pistol. Six of the victims were killed and nineteen others were wounded before Ferguson was tackled and held down by other passengers on the train.

Ferguson&#x27;s trial was noted for a number of unusual developments, including him dismissing his defense counsel, insisting on representing himself and questioning his victims on the stand. He was convicted in February 1995 on six counts of murder and nineteen counts of attempted murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is currently incarcerated at Mid-State Correctional Facility, with an earliest possible release date of August 6, 2309.

==Shooting==
On December 7, 1993, Colin Ferguson boarded the 5:33 p.m. eastbound train at Penn Station in Manhattan, New York, which stopped at the Jamaica station in Queens. He boarded the third car of the eastbound Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commuter train from Penn Station to Hicksville, along with more than eighty other passengers. He sat on the southwestern end of the car, carrying a Ruger P89 semi-automatic pistol and a canvas bag filled with 160 rounds of ammunition.

As the train approached the Merillon Avenue station in Garden City Park, Long Island, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the floor, stood up, and opened fire at random. During the next three minutes, he killed six people and injured another nineteen. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, &quot;He&#x27;s got a gun! He&#x27;s shooting people!&quot; Ferguson walked east (forward) on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to the eastern end of the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Ferguson&#x27;s actions &quot;as methodical as if he were taking tickets.&quot; Ferguson said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to get you,&quot; over and over as he walked down the aisle.

Other passengers farther away in the train did not realize that a shooting had occurred until after the train stopped, as a crowd of panicked passengers fled from the third car into neighboring cars. One man appeared annoyed by their unruliness and said, &quot;Be calm,&quot; before they forced a train door open and fled into the station. Two people were injured in the stampede of passengers. The train&#x27;s conductor was informed of the shooting, but he decided against opening the train doors right away because two of the cars were not yet at the platform. An announcement was made ordering conductors not to open the doors, but engineer Thomas Silhan climbed out the window of his cab and opened each door from the outside so that panicked passengers could escape.

Ferguson had emptied two 15-round magazines during the shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, &quot;Grab him!&quot; Passengers Michael O&#x27;Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee tackled him and pinned him to one of the train&#x27;s seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and helped to pin him across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, &quot;Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? I deserve whatever I get.&quot; He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot me. I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for several minutes while they awaited relief. Andrew Roderick, an off-duty LIRR police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, then boarded the train and handcuffed him. Of the people who were killed, five died on the day of the shooting while the sixth died five days later. The deceased victims ranged in ages 24 to 52.

==Investigation==
Police detectives later said it appeared Ferguson had been planning the shooting for more than a week. LIRR police chief Joseph Flynn said, &quot;This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who for a variety of reasons decided to explode.&quot; None of Ferguson&#x27;s victims were Black, although it was unclear whether any other Black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion as he sat in the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, &quot;How can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did?&quot;

Police found pieces of notebook paper in Ferguson&#x27;s pockets with scribbled notes with the heading &quot;reasons for this&quot;. One of the notes referred to &quot;racism by Caucasians and Uncle Tom Negroes&quot;. They included a reference to &quot;the false allegations against me by the filthy Caucasian racist female on the #1 line&quot;, a reference to his February 1992 arrest. Ferguson&#x27;s notes expressed anger towards the New York State Workers&#x27; Compensation Board, Asians, Governor Mario Cuomo, and &quot;so-called civil right leaders such as the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, C. Vernon Mason, and Calvin Butts.&quot; They also included the names and telephone numbers of the Lt. Governor, the Attorney General, and the Manhattan law firm that Ferguson had previously threatened, whom he referred to as &quot;those corrupt &#x27;black&#x27; attorneys who not only refuse to help me but tried to steal my car&quot;. The notes indicated Ferguson planned to wait to start the killings until he was beyond the New York City limit out of respect for outgoing Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

Ferguson showed no remorse during hours of questioning from the Nassau County District Attorney&#x27;s Office. Officials there said, &quot;He was lucid and clear and aware of what was going on.&quot; Ferguson was arraigned on December 8, 1993. He never spoke during the arraignment and did not enter a plea. He was ordered held without bail. As Ferguson was escorted from the courthouse, a reporter asked him if he hated whites, to which Ferguson replied, &quot;It&#x27;s a lie&quot;.

==Perpetrator==
Colin Ferguson was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on January 14, 1958 to Von Herman and May Ferguson. Von Herman was a wealthy pharmacist and the managing director of the large pharmaceutical company Hercules Agencies, and was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;one of the most prominent businessmen in Jamaica&quot;. Ferguson attended the Calabar High School in Red Hills Road, Kingston, from 1969 to 1974, where the principal described him as a &quot;well-rounded student&quot; who played cricket and soccer. He graduated in the top third of his class.

Von Herman was killed in a car crash in 1978 when Ferguson was aged 20, and his funeral was attended by government and military luminaries. Ferguson&#x27;s mother died from cancer soon afterwards, and the deaths destroyed the family&#x27;s fortunes. Family friends said that this deeply disturbed Ferguson. He moved to the United States in 1982 on a visitor&#x27;s visa. His friends speculated that he had trouble dealing with racism in the U.S. and that he felt frustrated because he couldn&#x27;t find work outside of menial jobs.

Ferguson married Audrey Warren on May 13, 1986, a native of Southampton County, Virginia, which qualified him for permanent U.S. residence. The couple moved to a house on Long Island where they often fought, sometimes to the point that police intervention was required. On May 18, 1988, she obtained an uncontested divorce from Ferguson, claiming that the marriage ended because they had &quot;differing social views&quot;. Acquaintances said that she left Ferguson because he was &quot;too aggressive or antagonistic&quot; for her, and that the divorce was a &quot;crushing blow&quot; to Ferguson.

Ferguson got a job doing clerical work for the Ademco Security Group in Syosset, New York. He slipped and fell on August 18, 1989, while standing on a stool to reach invoices from a filing cabinet, injuring his head, neck, and back, and the injury led to his termination. Ferguson filed a complaint with the state workers&#x27; compensation agency, which reviewed the matter over the next several years. He enrolled at Nassau Community College in East Garden City, where he made the dean&#x27;s list three times. Also that year, he was forced to leave a class after a disciplinary hearing board found that he had acted overly aggressive towards the teacher.

In late 1990, Ferguson transferred to Adelphi University in Garden City, where he majored in business administration. He spoke out against coexistence with whites, routinely made calls for retributive revolution, and regularly accused others around him of racism. On one occasion, he complained that a white woman in the library shouted racial epithets at him after he asked her about a class assignment, but an investigation concluded that the incident never occurred. Later, he attended a symposium by a faculty member discussing her experiences in South Africa under apartheid. Ferguson interrupted the professor by shouting, &quot;We should be talking about the revolution in South Africa and how to get rid of the white people&quot; and, &quot;Kill everybody white!&quot; Students and teachers tried to quiet him, but he started threatening them, repeatedly saying, &quot;The black revolution will get you.&quot; He was suspended from the school in June 1991 as a result of the threats. Although he was free to reapply after the suspension, he chose not to.

In 1991, Ferguson rented a room in Flatbush, Brooklyn. He was unemployed and lived around many other West Indian immigrants. Neighbors said that he dressed very neatly but kept to himself and rarely smiled or spoke to anybody, except occasionally to say hello. &quot;He had delusions of grandeur,&quot; his landlord Patrick Denis recounted. &quot;He felt like, &#x27;I&#x27;m such a great person. There must be only one thing holding me back. It must be white people.&#x27;&quot; In 1992, Ferguson&#x27;s ex-wife filed a complaint with police alleging that he pried open the trunk of her car. Prior to the shooting, she had not seen him since the divorce.

In February 1992, Ferguson was arrested and charged with harassing a woman on a subway. The woman tried to sit in a vacant seat alongside Ferguson and asked him to move over, prompting him to scream at her and press his leg and elbow against her until police officers pinned him to the ground. Ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted, &quot;Brothers, come help me!&quot; He sent letters to the New York City Police Commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest, describing it as &quot;viscous and racist,&quot; and claiming that he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him. The New York City Transit Authority investigated and dismissed the claims.

In September 1992, Ferguson was awarded $26,250 for his workers&#x27; compensation claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, he insisted that he was still in pain and demanded that the case be reopened so that he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, Ferguson visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation, and attorney Lauren Abramson said that she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by him. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because she did not want to be alone with Ferguson, which she had never done before. Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, but he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, he made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming that they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre which occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers&#x27; compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers&#x27; Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed him on a list of potentially dangerous people whom security guards were to watch for.

In April 1993, Ferguson moved to California in search of new career opportunities. He unsuccessfully applied for several jobs, including at a car wash where the manager laughed at him. Ferguson purchased a Ruger P89 9×19mm pistol at a Turner&#x27;s Outdoorsman in Long Beach for $400 after waiting the fifteen-day period required under California&#x27;s gun laws. He presented himself as a California resident by providing a driver&#x27;s license that he received two months earlier, which had an address of the Long Beach motel where he stayed. He had been robbed by two men, so he started carrying the gun with him in a paper bag. Ferguson moved back to New York in May 1993 because, as he told a friend, he did not like competing with immigrants and Hispanics for jobs. His Flatbush landlord said that he appeared even more unstable upon his return, speaking in the third person about &quot;some apocryphal-type doom scenario&quot; which included black people rising up and striking down &quot;their pompous rulers and oppressors.&quot; Ferguson started taking five showers a day and could be heard by neighbors repeatedly chanting at night &quot;all the black people killing all the white people.&quot; His landlord became increasingly concerned about Ferguson&#x27;s obsession with racism and apparent growing mental instability, and asked him to move out by the end of the month.

==Litigation==

===Pre-trial===

====Early court appearances====
Anthony J. Falanga was appointed Ferguson&#x27;s attorney on December 11, 1993. Falanga called for his client to receive a psychiatric evaluation. Under New York state law, an insanity defense would require Ferguson&#x27;s lawyers to prove he suffers from a mental disease or defect and, as a result, could not tell whether his actions were right or wrong. At the time, lawyers and mental health experts said such a defense would be difficult because Ferguson appeared to have carefully planned the attacks, and because he said, &quot;oh God, what did I do&quot; after he was stopped. However, media outlets and legal experts at the time speculated a defense could argue Ferguson suffered from paranoia, particularly based on Ferguson&#x27;s history of irrational racism allegations and claims that whites were discriminating against him. Ferguson was placed on suicide watch in the Nassau County Jail.

On December 18, 1993 Ferguson asked a judge to let him replace Falanga with Colin A. Moore, a Brooklyn-based attorney with a reputation for pursuing allegations of racism in the criminal-justice system. Moore offered to represent Ferguson pro bono. Before a ruling was even made on the request, Moore held a press conference announcing he would seek a change of venue to Brooklyn, claiming it was impossible for Ferguson to receive a fair trial in a Nassau court due to a &quot;severe underrepresentation of African-Americans on the Nassau County jury panel.&quot; Later, Moore withdrew his offer to represent Ferguson, citing conflicts he did not explain. Ferguson told a judge he questioned Falanga&#x27;s integrity, disagreed with his handling of the case and had no intention of cooperating with him. Dr. Allen Reichman, a psychiatrist who interviewed Ferguson, indicated in his report that Ferguson may have been feigning mental illness when he spoke of conspiracies against him. Reichman said Ferguson&#x27;s assertions were &quot;vague and somewhat evasive,&quot; in contrast to the normally detailed and highly focused nature of systematized paranoid delusional thinking. On January 5, 1994, a report by a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist concluded Ferguson was suffering from paranoid personality disorder but was competent to stand trial.

====Indictment====
On January 19, 1994, after three days of evidence presentation, a grand jury handed up a 93-count indictment against Ferguson, which carried the possibility of up to 175 years in prison. Nassau County District Attorney Denis Dillon said of the sentence maximum; &quot;it&#x27;s not quite infinity, but it will do.&quot; Dillon also announced he would not agree to any plea bargain in the case. The indictment included two counts of murder for each slain victim, both for intentional murder and for depraved indifference to human life. It also included 19 counts of attempted murder, 34 counts of assault, criminal possession of a weapon, intent to use the weapon, violation of civil rights of each of the 25 victims and &quot;intent to harass, annoy, threaten and alarm&quot; the victims &quot;because of their race, color or national origin.&quot;

On March 1, 1994, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, law partners known for representing unpopular clients, announced they had accepted a request by Ferguson to handle his case. Kunstler, who said he would not collect a fee for the defense, said Ferguson had been made out to be a &quot;pariah&quot; by the media and public. In April 1994, District Attorney Dillon sought a gag order for all lawyers involved in the case, arguing Kunstler and Kuby had made statements to the media that might be inadmissible during the trial and could influence potential jurors. Kunstler and Kuby argued they would have no problem finding 12 unbiased jurors and claimed Ferguson had already been publicly attacked in the press by government and police officials. Nassau County Judge Donald E. Belfi rejected the gag order on April 23, claiming the impact of inflammatory statements already made by lawyers, politicians and police would fade in the months before the trial began. However, Belfi warned attorneys from both sides to follow a State Court professional disciplinary rule which already limited their comments to news organizations.

====Prison attacks====
Shortly after his incarceration began, Ferguson complained about his treatment, claiming correction officers attacked him with milk crates and a fire extinguisher, while depriving him of necessities like soap and antiperspirant spray. Ferguson said: &quot;Of course, there is no sympathy for me in the institution. When I suffered and screamed I was told that it was a good sign by the prison guards because they were hoping for my swift departure from life.&quot; Later, Ron Kuby argued Ferguson had been a frequent target of harassment at the Nassau County jail, and requested that the United States Department of Justice intervene to ensure Ferguson&#x27;s safety.

On March 23, 1994, while returning to his cell from the medical unit, Ferguson was attacked in jail by a group of inmates. Ferguson suffered a broken nose and a swollen left eye. Prison officials had been notified by Kuby that an assault was imminent, and were in the process of following up on the warning when Ferguson was attacked. Kuby, who said he had been warned of the attack by another inmate, stated &quot;the word was out. Everyone in the institution knew he was going to be set up.&quot; Kuby called the attack racially motivated, and later alleged some jail officials and guards had advance knowledge of the impending assault. Five inmates were charged with second-degree assault for their connection in the attack.

In November 1994, Ferguson&#x27;s lawyers claimed prison guards taunted him with claims that the election of Governor George Pataki, a death penalty supporter, meant Ferguson would be executed if found guilty. Ferguson&#x27;s lawyers claimed prison guards showed him the headlines of newspaper stories about Pataki and claimed Ferguson was &quot;headed for electrocution sometime soon.&quot; Ferguson was deeply troubled by the claims, despite assurances from his attorneys that the death penalty could only be imposed in crimes committed after a capital punishment bill became law. Ferguson was not reassured until after a judge told him the same thing, at the request of Kunstler.

====&quot;Black rage&quot; defense====
Kunstler and Kuby proposed an innovative defense: Ferguson had been driven to temporary insanity by a psychiatric condition they termed &quot;black rage&quot;. Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson had been driven insane by racial prejudice and could not be held criminally liable for his actions, even though he had committed the killings. The attorneys compared it to the utilization of the battered woman defense, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the child abuse syndrome in other cases to negate criminal liability. Kuby said the notes carried by Ferguson on the day of his arrest demonstrated that Ferguson was motivated by rage during the shootings. Donald E. Belfi, the Nassau County Judge assigned to the Ferguson case, criticized Kunstler for speaking to the media about the proposed defense before it had been examined by a mental health professional. Belfi said &quot;Mr. Kunstler may have many talents, but until he receives his medical degree with a specialty in psychiatry, these types of conclusions should best be left for medical experts and the triers of the facts.&quot;

Black rage was first proposed by psychologists William Henry Grier and Price Cobbs in their 1968 book, &quot;Black Rage&quot; (). Grier and Cobbs argue that black people living in a racist, white supremacist society are psychologically damaged by the effects of racist oppression. They argue that this damage causes black people to act abnormally in certain situations.

Ferguson started to claim he was not involved in the Long Island Rail Road shootings at all, and repeatedly refused to meet with a psychiatrist chosen by Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson told the attorneys he was receiving messages straight from God, and spoke of conspiracies to destroy him by those opposed to God. On August 12, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby asked Judge Belfi to reconsider Ferguson&#x27;s competence to stand trial, claiming he was growing more delusional, paranoid and obsessive by the day, and that he was too mentally unbalanced for them to mount any kind of defense. George Peck, the prosecutor in Ferguson&#x27;s trial, insisted Ferguson&#x27;s apparent lack of cooperation with his lawyers was a defense tactic to avoid a trial.

On August 20, 1994, Ferguson appeared before Belfi and rejected his lawyer&#x27;s efforts to have him declared mentally unfit to stand trial. Ferguson spoke in a long and rambling manner, occasionally ignoring Belfi when the judge tried to interrupt him. Ferguson claimed a police officer who escorted him from the Nassau County Jail said to him, &quot;You realize someone else, in fact, was actually responsible for the shooting.&quot; When asked if Ferguson understood the role of the prosecuting attorney, Ferguson replied; &quot;to perpetrate injustices against me&quot;. Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson&#x27;s behavior was indicative of his mental imbalance, but Belfi refused the lawyers&#x27; request to reconsider his competence, citing the original psychiatric report that concluded Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was &quot;malingering in an attempt to create an impression&quot; that he was mentally imbalanced and unable to cooperate with his attorney. When Belfi ended the proceeding, Ferguson tried to continue talking. After he was placed into handcuffs by guards, Ferguson shouted &quot;they have made it too tight,&quot; collapsed to the floor, and had to be dragged from the courtroom. Denis Dillon suggested Kunstler was trying to create &quot;such a bizarre situation&quot; that the court would reverse its earlier ruling regarding Ferguson&#x27;s competence.

====Removal of Kunstler and Kuby====
On September 20, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby filed notice that they would pursue an insanity defense despite the objections of their client. Ferguson continued to claim he was not involved in the shootings and proposed defending himself during the trial. In the following months, Ferguson sent Judge Belfi several letters regarding disputes between Ferguson, Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson claimed in the letters that he was not insane, and rejected Kunstler&#x27;s and Kuby&#x27;s &quot;black rage&quot; defense. Although George Peck argued the letters proved Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was actively participating in his defense, Kuby argued the letters only further demonstrated Ferguson&#x27;s confused state of mind. On November 11, Ferguson agreed he would stop resisting efforts to meet with a court-appointed psychiatrist. As a result, Judge Belfi agreed to hold a third hearing as to whether Ferguson was mentally competent to stand trial.

On December 10, 1994, Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was competent to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision in part on his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson&#x27;s concern over Governor Pataki&#x27;s promise to sign a death-penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to do so anyway. Kuby said of the decision, &quot;What we will have now is a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train.&quot; Kuby continued, &quot;Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was no doubt that he was there, that he fired the weapon, that he would have fired it more had he not been wrestled to the ground. There is no doubt that Colin Ferguson, if sane, was guilty.&quot;

===Trial===
Ferguson&#x27;s trial proved to be bizarre, as he cross-examined the police officers that arrested him and victims he shot. It was broadcast live by local media and Court TV, but was overshadowed by the O. J. Simpson murder case, going on simultaneously on the West Coast.

Ferguson argued that the 93 counts he was charged with were related to the year 1993, and had it been 1925 he would have been charged with only 25 counts. He admitted bringing the gun onto the train, but claimed he fell asleep and another man grabbed his gun and began firing. He also argued of a mysterious man named Mr. Su, who had information concerning a conspiracy against him. He found another man who was willing to testify that the government had implanted a computer chip in Ferguson&#x27;s brain, but at the last minute decided not to call him to the stand. This individual, Raul Diaz, was a parapsychologist from Manhattan who claimed during a press conference on the courthouse steps to have witnessed an Asian man press a chip into Ferguson&#x27;s head prior to the attack. According to Diaz, the Asian man told him to behold what he was about to do prior to pushing the button. &quot;He was lasered out by a remote-control device,&quot; Diaz told reporters outside the courtroom. &quot;He was zapped, just like that, right out of the twilight zone&quot; and was &quot;commanded to go up and down the aisle shooting people.&quot;

His cross-examination questions mostly started with &quot;is it your testimony...&quot; and would simply force the witness to repeat testimony already given. When a witness refused to answer the question to his satisfaction, he would often ask the judge to &quot;admonish the witness to answer the question.&quot; During the course of his cross-examinations, Ferguson would refer to himself in the third person, particularly asking the victims of the shooting, &quot;did you see Colin Ferguson...&quot; to which the witness would reply, &quot;I saw &quot;you&quot; shoot me.&quot; Legal experts pointed out that Ferguson&#x27;s questions were pointless and were not geared towards rebutting testimony. By not recognizing when to object to testimony and closing arguments, he lost his right to appeal on those grounds. Among the defense witnesses Ferguson requested was President Bill Clinton.

Ferguson originally sought to question himself on the witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media that he intended to call a number of witnesses who would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but they were afraid to come forward and take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the Jewish Defense League to kill him in prison if he was convicted. He said the prison slaying of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was &quot;set up as a prelude against me.&quot;

===Conviction===
Ferguson was convicted on February 17, 1995, of murder of the six passengers who died of their injuries. He was also convicted of attempted murder for wounding nineteen passengers. He received 315 years and eight months to life, meaning his current earliest possible parole date is August 6, 2309. The judge said, &quot;Colin Ferguson will never return to society, and will spend the rest of his natural life in prison.&quot; At the sentencing, Judge Donald E. Belfi called Ferguson a &quot;selfish, self-righteous coward.&quot; He also used the sentencing as an opportunity to criticize New York&#x27;s controversial Sentencing Cap Law, which would have capped each of Ferguson&#x27;s sentences at 50 years and required that they all be served concurrently had no one died in the massacre, since all of the felonies he committed on the train were part of one occurrence. After his conviction, Ferguson was put in the position to argue in appellate briefs that he had incompetent counsel (himself).

After his sentencing, Ferguson was incarcerated for a time at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York.

==Lawsuits==
Carolyn McCarthy — whose husband Dennis McCarthy was killed by Ferguson, and whose son Kevin McCarthy was severely injured — was subsequently elected to the United States Congress on a platform of gun control. She was motivated to run for Congress after the representative in her district, Dan Frisa, voted against an assault weapons bill. Some of Ferguson&#x27;s other victims and their family members have also become involved in gun control efforts.

McCarthy also sued Olin Corporation, the parent of Winchester Ammunition, under products liability and negligence theories for their manufacture of the Black Talon bullets used by Ferguson. The cartridges carry hollow-tipped bullets that expand upon impact, increasing the severity of wounds. One month before the LIRR shooting, Winchester Ammunition announced they were voluntarily withdrawing the Black Talon cartridges from the market. McCarthy&#x27;s suit failed, partly because New York State law placed no responsibility on manufacturers for the criminal misuse of their products.

At least a half-dozen lawsuits related to the shootings were filed against the Long Island Rail Road and its parent company, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Carolyn McCarthy filed a $36 million damage lawsuit against the two entities, claiming they failed to provide adequate protection for passengers and should have installed metal detectors and used undercover police officers. The suit sought $1 million for Dennis McCarthy&#x27;s pain and suffering, $10 million for his death and for damages to survivors, and $25 million for injuries to Kevin McCarthy.

==Reaction==
Many African-Americans expressed concern that the LIRR shooting would lead to a backlash of violence and racial animosities against the black community. Civil rights activists Al Sharpton and Herbert Daughtry urged that African-Americans in general not be blamed for the crime; Sharpton, in particular, criticized what he called attempts &quot;to demonize black and Hispanic dissatisfaction&quot; by linking those groups to the murders. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson delivered a sermon at the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, during a service attended by the victims&#x27; grieving families. Audrey Warren released a statement shortly after the shootings expressing sorrow for the victims and their families. Jackson stressed the shootings were the result of one man and should not be seen as indicative of all African-Americans. The day after the shootings, Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta called Ferguson &quot;an animal.&quot; Jackson and other African-American leaders criticized the comment as racially charged, but Gulotta later said his statement had nothing to do with race.

During a press conference in the days after the shooting, the Long Island Rail Road Police Benevolent Association called the trains &quot;unsafe&quot; and said the railroad needed to triple the size of its 216-person police force. LIRR officials responded by noting that the rate of crime against passengers had dropped over the past few years before the shooting. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad placed more officers on trains and increased the visibility of police in response to the shootings. LIRR officials also made counselors available for passengers who wanted one, and sent senior railroad officials out to trains to answer riders&#x27; questions. A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial called for stronger gun control laws in response to the murders, specifically citing the ease with which Ferguson obtained a handgun in California, which had one of the country&#x27;s stricter gun laws. Several Adelphi University students expressed concern that Ferguson may have been taking the train to the school with plans of shooting people out of revenge for his past experiences there, although the train Ferguson took was not the closest one to Adelphi. Most of the regular commuters who used the 5:33 Hicksville local returned to the train the day after the shootings. In interviews with the media, a number of passengers cited the need to face their fears and the psychological trauma created by the incident, rather than avoid riding their regular train.

=== Politicians ===
President Bill Clinton took notice of the LIRR shooting, calling it a &quot;terrible human tragedy&quot;. The day after the shooting, Clinton announced he had asked Attorney General Janet Reno to review a proposal by New York City Mayor-elect Rudy Giuliani that would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers. Clinton cited the Ferguson murders as a factor in his support of the program, which would include background checks, tests and required renewals every two years. About one week after the shooting, Clinton visited with O&#x27;Connor, Blum and McEntee. During his first major speech since his election as mayor, Giuliani cited the Ferguson murders while he repeated his previous calls for the death penalty and a uniform gun licensing law. During his monthly radio call-in show, Governor Mario Cuomo called the Ferguson shootings &quot;a dramatic, spectacular slaughter&quot;, and called for stronger gun control measures. U.S. Senator Al D&#x27;Amato said the Ferguson case demonstrated the need for capital punishment in New York State because &quot;that is the only fitting punishment for this cold-blooded killer&quot;.

== In media ==

Ferguson was the subject of a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comedy sketch in which he, portrayed by Tim Meadows, declared &quot;I did not shoot them, they shot me&quot; and asked witnesses questions about shooting him while they were on the stand, then ducking when they pointed to him as the killer.

A 2002 book by trial consultant Mark C. Bardwell and criminal justice professor Bruce A. Arrigo examined the competency issues in the Ferguson case.

The song &quot;Last Train to Hicksville&quot; by the punk rock band Smut Peddlers is about this particular shooting incident including direct quotations from the shooter in the lyrics. Due to the racial slurs said by Ferguson that were quoted in the song, some people mistakenly have thought that Smut Peddlers were a white power band despite the fact that they are not a white power band.

<text>Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), was a United States Supreme Court case relating to Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA. The Court ruled that Dennis did not have the right under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to exercise free speech, publication and assembly, if the exercise involved the creation of a plot to overthrow the government. In 1969, &quot;Dennis&quot; was &quot;de facto&quot; overruled by &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;.

==Background of the case==
In 1948, eleven Communist Party leaders were convicted of advocating the violent overthrow of the US government and for the violation of several points of the Smith Act. The party members who had been petitioning for socialist reforms claimed that the act violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and that they served no clear and present danger to the nation. The eleven petitioners were:
* Benjamin J. Davis – Chairman of the CPUSA&#x27;s Legislative Committee
* Eugene Dennis – General Secretary
* John Gates – Leader of the Young Communist League
* Gil Green – Member of the National Board
* Gus Hall – Member of the National Board
* Irving Potash – Furriers Union official
* Jack Stachel
* Robert G. Thompson – Lead of the New York organization
* John Williamson – Member of the Central Committee
* Henry Winston – Member of the National Board
* Carl Winter – Lead of the Michigan organization

The 1949 trial was presided over by S.D.N.Y. Judge Harold Medina, a former Columbia University professor who had been a judge for only 18 months when the trial began. The trial was held in the Foley Square federal courthouse in New York City, and opened on November 1, 1948; preliminary proceedings and jury selection lasted until January 17, 1949; the defendants first appeared in court on March 7; and the trial concluded on October 14, 1949. Although later trials surpassed it, in 1949 it was the longest federal trial in US history.

Prosecutor John McGohey did not assert that the defendants had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA&#x27;s philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. To prove this, the prosecution proffered articles, pamphlets and books (such as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;) written by authors such as Karl Marx. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were also personally guilty of advocating violent overthrow of the government.

The five attorneys who volunteered to defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and personally supported the defendants&#x27; rights to espouse communist views. They were Abraham Isserman, George W. Crockett, Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe. Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act. However, the ACLU did provide an &quot;amicus&quot; brief for the Foley Square defendants, endorsing a motion for dismissal.

The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, portraying the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, employing the &quot;labor defense&quot; tactic to attack the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome to proletarian defendants; and third, using the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.

The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions, which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina. Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of &quot;mutual hostility&quot; arose between the judge and attorneys. Medina came to believe that the defense attorneys were using the trial as an opportunity to publicize communist propaganda, and that they deliberately disrupted the trial using any means they could. Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing defendants who were out of order. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts. Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.

On October 14, 1949, after the defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury instructions to guide them in reaching a verdict. After deliberating for seven and a half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants. The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years&#x27; imprisonment and a $10,000 fine each.

===Appeal===
Petitioners were found guilty by the trial court and the decision was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court granted writ of certiorari, but limited it to whether section two or three of the Smith Act violated the First Amendment and whether the same two sections violated the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.

George W. Crockett, Jr., Abraham J. Isserman and Harry Sacher argued the cause for petitioners. With them on the brief was Richard Gladstein.

Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman and Irving S. Shapiro argued the cause for the United States. With them on the brief were U.S. Attorney General James Howard McGrath, U.S. Assistant Attorney General McInerney, Irving H. Saypol, Robert W. Ginnane, Frank H. Gordon, Edward C. Wallace, and Lawrence K. Bailey.

==The court&#x27;s decision==
Handed down as a 6-2 decision by the Court on June 4, 1951, the judgment and a plurality opinion was delivered by Chief Justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson, who was joined by Justices Stanley Forman Reed, Sherman Minton, and Harold H. Burton. Separate concurring opinions were delivered by Justices Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson. Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas wrote separate dissenting opinions. Justice Tom C. Clark did not participate in this case.

The Court rule affirmed the conviction of the petitioner, a leader of the Communist Party in the United States. Dennis had been convicted of conspiring and organizing for the overthrow and destruction of the United States government by force and violence under provisions of the Smith Act. In affirming the conviction, a plurality of the Court adopted Judge Learned Hand&#x27;s formulation of the clear and probable danger test, an adaptation of the clear and present danger test:

In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the &quot;evil&quot;, discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to avoid the danger.

In his dissent, Black wrote:
These petitioners were not charged with an attempt to overthrow the Government. They were not charged with overt acts of any kind designed to overthrow the Government. They were not even charged with saying anything or writing anything designed to overthrow the Government. The charge was that they agreed to assemble and to talk and publish certain ideas at a later date: The indictment is that they conspired to organize the Communist Party and to use speech or newspapers and other publications in the future to teach and advocate the forcible overthrow of the Government. No matter how it is worded, this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech and press, which I believe the First Amendment forbids. I would hold 3 of the Smith Act authorizing this prior restraint unconstitutional on its face and as applied...
So long as this Court exercises the power of judicial review of legislation, I cannot agree that the First Amendment permits us to sustain laws suppressing freedom of speech and press on the basis of Congress&#x27; or our own notions of mere &quot;reasonableness.&quot; Such a doctrine waters down the First Amendment so that it amounts to little more than an admonition to Congress. The Amendment as so construed is not likely to protect any but those &quot;safe&quot; or orthodox views which rarely need its protection...
There is hope, however, that in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society.
==Aftermath==
In 1957, the Court in &quot;Yates v. United States&quot; restricted the holding in Dennis, ruling that the Smith Act did not prohibit advocacy of forcible overthrow of the government as an abstract doctrine. While &quot;Yates&quot; did not overrule &quot;Dennis&quot;, it rendered the broad conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act unenforceable. Finally, in 1969, &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; held that &quot;mere advocacy&quot; of violence was &quot;per se&quot; protected speech. &quot;Brandenburg&quot; was a &quot;de facto&quot; overruling of &quot;Dennis&quot;, defining the bar for constitutionally unprotected speech to be incitement to &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;.

<text>An attorney at law (or counsellor-at-law) in the United States is a practitioner in a court of law who is legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in court on the retainer of clients. As of January 1, 2023, there were 1,331,290 active lawyers in the United States. In terms of absolute numbers, the American legal profession was the largest in the world as of 2015, and it is thought to be the largest in the world in proportion to domestic population. A 2012 survey conducted by LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell determined 58 million consumers in the U.S. sought an attorney in the last year and that 76 percent of consumers used the Internet to search for an attorney.

The United States legal system does not draw a distinction between lawyers who plead in court and those who do not, unlike some other common law jurisdictions. For example, jurisdictions in the United Kingdom distinguish between solicitors, who do not plead in court, and barristers, who do. Likewise, civil law jurisdictions distinguish between advocates and civil law notaries. An additional factor that differentiates the American legal system from other countries is that there is no delegation of routine work to notaries public.

Attorneys may be addressed by the post-nominal letters Esq., the abbreviated form of the word Esquire.

==Specialization==
Many American attorneys limit their practices to specialized fields of law. Often distinctions are drawn between different types of attorneys, but, with the exception of patent law practice, these are neither fixed nor formal lines. Attorneys can be both outside of in-house counsel; doing plaintiff or defendant representation; having transactional or litigation practice; and having trial or appellate litigation specialties.

Despite these descriptions, some states forbid or discourage claims of specialization in particular areas of law unless the attorney has been certified by their state bar or state board of legal specialization.

Some states grant formal certifications recognizing specialties. In California, for example, bar certification is offered in family law, appellate practice, criminal law, bankruptcy, estate planning, immigration, taxation and workers&#x27; compensation. Any attorney meeting the bar requirements in one of these fields may represent themselves as a specialist. The State Bar of Texas, for example, formally grants certification of specialization in 21 select areas of law.

The majority of lawyers practicing in a particular field may typically not be certified as specialists in that field (and state board certification is not generally required to practice law in any field). For example, the State Bar of Texas (as of mid-2006) reported 77,056 persons licensed as attorneys in that state (excluding inactive members of the Bar), while the Texas Board of Legal Specialization reported, at about the same time, only 8,303 Texas attorneys who were board certified in any specialty. Indeed, of the 8,303 certified specialists in Texas, the highest number of attorneys certified in one specific field at that time was 1,775 (in personal injury trial law).

Specialization in patent law is administered by the Office of Enrollment and Discipline of the US Patent and Trademark Office, which imposes stringent requirements for applicants to become registered as patent attorneys or patent agents.

==Training and accreditation==
In the United States, the practice of law is conditioned upon admission to practice of law, and specifically admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction. Regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary. Arguing cases in the federal courts requires separate admission.

===Bar examinations===

Each US state and similar jurisdiction (e.g. territories under federal control) sets its own rules for bar admission, which can lead to different admission standards among states. In most cases, a person who is admitted to the bar is thereby a member of the particular bar.

In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements.

A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.

In 1763, Delaware created the first bar exam with other American colonies soon following suit.

The bar examination in most U.S. states and territories is at least two days long (a few states have three-day exams). It consists of essay questions, usually testing knowledge of the state&#x27;s own law. Some jurisdictions choose to use the Multistate Essay Examination (MEE), drafted by the NCBE since 1988, for this purpose. Others may draft their own questions with this goal in mind, while some states both draft their own questions and use the MEE. Some jurisdictions administer questions that specifically test knowledge of that state&#x27;s law.

Bar exams also usually consist of the Multistate Bar Examination, which is a multiple-choice standardized test created and sold to participating state bar examiners by the National Conference of Bar Examiners since 1972. The MBE contains 200 questions which test six subjects based upon principles of common law and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

The State of Washington has a separate Law Clerk program under Rule Six of the Washington Court Admission to Practice Rules. A college graduate of good moral character may be accepted into the four-year Rule Six Law Clerk Program, obtain employment in a law firm or with a judge for at least 30 hours a week and study a prescribed Course of Study under a tutor. After successful completion of the program, a law clerk may take the Washington State Bar Exam and, upon passing, will be admitted as an attorney into the Washington State Bar Association.

===Degrees in law===

The degree earned by prospective attorneys in the United States is generally a Juris Doctor (Latin for &quot;Doctor of Jurisprudence&quot;; abbreviated &quot;J.D.&quot;).

The highest law degrees obtainable in the United States are Doctor of Juridical Science (&quot;Scientiae Juridicae Doctor&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.J.D.&quot; or &quot;J.S.D.&quot;). The S.J.D. is akin to an academic degree that, like the Ph.D., is research-based and requires a dissertation (an original contribution to the academic study of law).

The LL.M. is generally earned by completing studies in a particular area of law. LL.M. is an abbreviation of the Latin, &quot;Legum Magister&quot;, which means Master of Laws. After earning a J.D., an attorney may seek admission to an LL.M. program. There is no requirement for attorneys to complete an LL.M. program to practice law in the United States, and relatively few attorneys hold an LL.M. In the U.S., for example, some states allow foreign lawyers to seek admission to the bar upon completion of an LL.M., while in other states, a J.D. is required. 

===Law students in court===
Some courts allow law students to act as &quot;certified student attorneys&quot; after the satisfactory completion of their first year of law school and the completion of particular second- and third-year courses with subjects such as evidence.

Many states allow students to argue in front of a court as a certified legal intern (CLI), provided they meet certain prerequisites, such as having completed at least half of their law education, having taken or be taking the law school&#x27;s ethics class and being under the supervision of a qualified and licensed attorney.

===Unlicensed practice of law===
Some states provide criminal penalties for falsely holding oneself out to the public as an attorney at law and the unauthorized practice of law by a non-attorney.

An &quot;Attorney at law&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; must be an individual admitted to a state bar and licensed by a state, not just a person with a professional law degree.

A few areas of law, such as patent law, bankruptcy, or immigration law, are mandated by the U.S. Constitution to be strictly under federal jurisdiction. In this case, state courts and bar associations are not allowed to restrict the practice of that field of law.

<doc id="168905" wikidata="Q17080465" url="?curid=168905" title="Mathematical folklore">
<text>In common mathematical parlance, a mathematical result is called folklore if it is an unpublished result with no clear originator, but which is well-circulated and believed to be true among the specialists. More specifically, folk mathematics, or mathematical folklore, is the body of theorems, definitions, proofs, facts or techniques that circulate among mathematicians by word of mouth, but have not yet appeared in print, either in books or in scholarly journals.

Quite important at times for researchers are folk theorems, which are results known, at least to experts in a field, and are considered to have established status, though not published in complete form. Sometimes, these are only alluded to in the public literature. 
An example is a book of exercises, described on the back cover:
Another distinct category is well-knowable mathematics, a term introduced by John Conway. These mathematical matters are known and factual, but not in active circulation in relation with current research (i.e., untrendy). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the actual context in which research work is done.

Some people, in particular non-mathematicians, use the term &quot;folk mathematics&quot; to refer to the informal mathematics studied in many ethno-cultural studies of mathematics. Although the term &quot;mathematical folklore&quot; can also be used within the mathematics circle to describe the various aspects of their esoteric culture and practices (e.g., slang, proverb, limerick, joke).

==Stories, sayings and jokes==

Mathematical folklore can also refer to the unusual (and possibly apocryphal) stories or jokes involving mathematicians or mathematics that are told verbally in mathematics departments. Compilations include tales collected in G. H. Hardy&#x27;s &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot; and ; examples include:
* Srinivasa Ramanujan&#x27;s taxicab numbers.
*Galileo dropping weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
*An apple falling on Isaac Newton&#x27;s head to inspire his theory of gravitation.
*John von Neumann&#x27;s encounter with the famous fly puzzle.
*The drinking, duel, and early death of Galois.
*Richard Feynman cracking safes in the Manhattan Project.
*Alfréd Rényi&#x27;s definition of a mathematician: &quot;a device for turning coffee into theorems&quot;.
*Pál Turán&#x27;s suggestion that weak coffee was only suitable for lemmata.
*The &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; story told by Stephen Hawking.
*Fermat&#x27;s lost simple proof.
*The unwieldy proof and associated controversies of the Four Color Theorem.
*The murder of Hippasus by the Pythagoreans for his discovery of irrational numbers, specifically, √2.
*Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in a sudden moment of inspiration, discovered quaternions while crossing Brougham Bridge.

<text>Robert Houghwout Jackson (February 13, 1892 – October 9, 1954) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1941 until his death in 1954. He had previously served as United States Solicitor General and United States Attorney General, and is the only person to have held all three of those offices. Jackson was also notable for his work as Chief United States Prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals following World War II. Jackson developed a reputation as one of the best writers on the Supreme Court and one of the most committed to enforcing due process as protection from overreaching federal agencies. 

Jackson was the most recent U.S. Supreme Court justice who did not earn a law degree . He was admitted to the bar via the older tradition of an internship under an established lawyer (&quot;reading law&quot;) after studying at Albany Law School for a year. Jackson is recognized for his advice that, &quot;Any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect, in no uncertain terms, to make no statement to the police under any circumstances&quot;, and for his aphorism describing the Supreme Court, &quot;We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.&quot;

He was viewed as a moderate liberal, and is known for his dissents in &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot;, &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot;, &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, as well as his majority opinion in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; and his concurring opinion in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;. Justice Antonin Scalia, who occupied the seat once held by Jackson, considered Jackson to be &quot;the best legal stylist of the 20th century&quot;.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on his family&#x27;s farm in Spring Creek Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania, on February 13, 1892, and was raised in Frewsburg, New York. The son of William Eldred Jackson and Angelina Houghwout, he graduated from Frewsburg High School in 1909 and spent the next year as a post-graduate student attending Jamestown High School, where he worked to improve his writing skills.

Jackson decided on a legal career; since attendance at college or law school was not a requirement if a student learned under the tutelage of an established attorney, at age 18 he began to read law with the Jamestown, New York, firm in which his uncle, Frank Mott, was a partner. His uncle soon introduced him to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was then serving as a member of the New York State Senate. Jackson attended Albany Law School of Union University from 1911 to 1912. At the time, students at Albany Law School had three options: taking individual courses without receiving a degree, completing a two-year program and receiving an LL.B. degree, or demonstrating the knowledge required of a first-year student and then taking the second year of the two-year program, which produced a certificate of completion. Jackson chose the third option; he successfully completed the second-year courses, and received his certificate in 1912.

After his year at Albany Law School, Jackson returned to Jamestown to complete his studies. He attained admission to the bar in 1913 at age twenty-one, then joined a law practice in Jamestown. In 1916, he married Irene Alice Gerhardt, in Albany. In 1917, Jackson was recruited to work for Penney, Killeen &amp; Nye, a leading Buffalo firm, primarily defending the International Railway Company in trials and appeals. In late 1918, Jackson was recruited back to Jamestown to serve as the city&#x27;s corporation counsel.

Over the next 15 years, he built a successful practice, and became a leading lawyer in New York State; he also enhanced his reputation nationally, through leadership roles with bar associations and other legal organizations. In 1930, Jackson was elected to membership in the American Law Institute; in 1933, he was elected Chairman of the American Bar Association&#x27;s Conference of Bar Association Delegates (a predecessor to today&#x27;s ABA House of Delegates).

Jackson became active in politics as a Democrat; in 1916, he spearheaded Jamestown&#x27;s local Wilson for President organization. In the years during and after World War I, he was a member of the New York State Democratic Committee. He also continued his association with Roosevelt; when Roosevelt served as Governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, he appointed Jackson to a commission which reviewed the state judicial system and proposed reforms. He served on that commission from 1931 to 1939. Jackson also turned down Roosevelt&#x27;s offer to appoint him to the New York Public Service Commission, because he preferred to remain in private practice.

==Federal appointments, 1934–1938==
In 1932, Jackson was active in Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential campaign as chairman of an organization called Democratic Lawyers for Roosevelt. (Another Robert H. Jackson was also active in the Roosevelt campaign. That Jackson (1880–1973) was Secretary of the Democratic National Committee, and was a resident of New Hampshire.)

In 1934, Jackson agreed to join the Roosevelt administration; he served initially as Assistant General Counsel of the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Bureau of Internal Revenue (today&#x27;s Internal Revenue Service), where he was in charge of 300 lawyers who tried cases before the Board of Tax Appeals. In 1936, Jackson became Assistant Attorney General, heading the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, and in 1937, he became Assistant Attorney General, heading the Antitrust Division.

Jackson was a supporter of the New Deal, litigating against corporations and utilities holding companies. He participated in the 1934 prosecution of Samuel Insull, the 1935 income tax case against Andrew Mellon, and the 1937 anti-trust case against Alcoa, in which the Mellon family held an important interest.

==U.S. Solicitor General, 1938–1940==
In March 1938, Jackson became United States Solicitor General, succeeding Stanley Forman Reed, who had been appointed to the Supreme Court. Jackson served as Solicitor General until January 1940, working as the government&#x27;s chief advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court. During his time in this post, he argued 44 cases to the Supreme Court on behalf of the federal government, and lost only six. His record of accomplishment caused Justice Louis Brandeis to once remark that Jackson should be Solicitor General for life.

Roosevelt regarded Jackson as a possible successor to the presidency in 1940, and worked with his staff on an effort to raise Jackson&#x27;s public profile. Their plan was to mention Jackson favorably in presidential remarks as often as possible, and to have Jackson take part frequently in Roosevelt&#x27;s public appearances. Roosevelt and his advisers next intended for Jackson to become the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York in 1938. They abandoned their effort to create a groundswell of support for Jackson&#x27;s gubernatorial candidacy when they ran into resistance from state Democratic Party leaders. In addition, Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to run for a third term in 1940 rendered moot the need to identify and promote a successor. Instead of running for Governor or President, Jackson joined Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet when he was appointed as Attorney General.

==U.S. Attorney General, 1940–1941==
Jackson was appointed as United States Attorney General by Roosevelt, on January 4, 1940, replacing Frank Murphy, whom Roosevelt had appointed to the Supreme Court. As Attorney General, Jackson supported a bill introduced by Sam Hobbs that would have legalized wiretapping by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any other government agency, if it was suspected that a felony was occurring. The bill was opposed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman James Lawrence Fly, and it did not pass. While in office, he also helped President Roosevelt organize the Lend-Lease agreement, which allowed the United States to supply materials to help with the war effort to the Allied forces, before formally entering World War II.

==U.S. Supreme Court, 1941–1954==
On June 12, 1941, Roosevelt nominated Jackson as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy created when Harlan Fiske Stone replaced Charles Evans Hughes as chief justice. Jackson was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 7, 1941, and took the judicial oath of office on July 11, 1941. On the Court, he was known for his eloquent writing style and championing of individual liberties.

In 1943, Jackson wrote the majority opinion in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;, which overturned a public school regulation making it mandatory to salute the flag, and imposing penalties of expulsion and prosecution upon students who failed to comply. Jackson&#x27;s stirring language in &quot;Barnette&quot; concerning individual rights is widely quoted. Jackson&#x27;s concurring opinion in 1952&#x27;s &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot; (forbidding President Harry Truman&#x27;s seizure of steel mills during the Korean War to avert a strike), in which Jackson formulated a three-tier test for evaluating claims of Presidential power, remains one of the most widely cited opinions in Supreme Court history.

===Feud with Hugo Black===
Justices Jackson and Hugo Black had profound professional and personal disagreements dating back to October 1941, the first term during which they served together on the Supreme Court. According to Dennis Hutchinson, editor of &quot;The Supreme Court Review&quot;, Jackson objected to Black&#x27;s practice of importing his personal preferences into his jurisprudence. Hutchinson quotes Jackson as having remarked, &quot;With few exceptions, we all knew which side of a case Black would vote on when he read the names of the parties.&quot; While Hutchinson points out that Jackson objected to Black&#x27;s style of jurisprudence in such cases as &quot;Minersville v. Gobitis&quot; (1940) and &quot;United States v. Bethlehem Steel&quot; (1942), Black&#x27;s involvement in the &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; case struck Jackson as especially injudicious.

In &quot;Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers&quot; (1945), the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether to grant the coal company&#x27;s petition for a rehearing, on the grounds that the victorious miners were, in a previous matter, represented by Crampton P. Harris, who was Justice Black&#x27;s former law partner and personal lawyer. Despite this apparent conflict of interest, Black lobbied the Court for a per curiam denial of the petition. Justice Jackson objected, with the result that Jackson filed a concurrence disassociating himself from the ruling and, by implication, criticizing Black for not addressing the conflict of interest. Jackson also strongly objected to Black&#x27;s judicial conduct in &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; for another reason. As Jackson later alleged, while Justice Murphy was preparing his opinion, Black urged that the Court hand down its decision without waiting for the opinion and dissent. In Jackson&#x27;s eyes, the &quot;...only apparent reason behind this proposal was to announce the decision in time to influence the contract negotiations during the coal strike&quot; between the coal company and the miners, which were taking place at the time.

Jackson probably regarded Black&#x27;s conduct as unbecoming of a Supreme Court Justice in another related matter. On April 3, 1945, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare held a dinner, at which it honored Justice Black as the 1945 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Award. Fred M. Vinson spoke at the dinner. While Jackson declined an invitation to the event, citing a conflict arising out of the fact that a number of leading sponsors of the dinner were then litigants before the Supreme Court, Black attended the dinner and received his award. Crampton Harris, counsel in two pending cases, &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; and &quot;CIO v. McAdory&quot; (1945), was one of the sponsors.

Jackson later took these grievances public in two cables from Nuremberg. Jackson had informally been promised the Chief Justiceship by Roosevelt; however, the seat came open while Jackson was in Germany, and Roosevelt was dead. President Harry S. Truman was faced with two factions, one recommending Jackson for the seat, and the other advocating for Hugo Black. In an attempt to avoid controversy, Truman appointed Vinson. Jackson blamed machinations by Black for his being passed over for the seat, and publicly exposed some of Black&#x27;s controversial behavior and feuding within the Court. The controversy was heavily covered in the press, casting the New Deal Court in a negative light, and had the effect of tarnishing Jackson&#x27;s reputation in the years that followed.

On June 8, 1946, Jackson sent a cable to President Truman. Jackson&#x27;s cable to Truman began with an insincere offer of congratulations to the President for his appointment of Vinson. However, the cable then quickly addressed the rumor, which Jackson had gotten wind of in Nuremberg, according to which Truman had appointed Fred Vinson, in part, to avert a resignation on the part of Justice Black. Rumors had been circulating in Washington that Black would resign in the event that Truman chose Jackson as Chief Justice Stone&#x27;s successor. &quot;I would be loath to believe that you would concede to any man a veto over court appointments.&quot; Jackson closed his cable by stating that he could not continue his service as an Associate Justice under Vinson if an associate &quot;had something on [him]&quot;, which would disqualify him from serving, or if he, Truman, regarded Jackson&#x27;s opinion in the &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; case as a &quot;gratuitous insult&quot; to Justice Black.

After receiving a response from Truman in which he denied having given consideration to, or having even heard of, the rumor of Black&#x27;s threatened resignation, Jackson rashly fired off a second cable to Congress, on June 10. This cable stated Jackson&#x27;s reasons for his belief that Justice Black faced a conflict of interest in &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot;, from which he wrongfully, at least, in Jackson&#x27;s eyes, did not recuse himself, and ended with Jackson&#x27;s threat that if such a practice &quot;is ever repeated while I am on the bench, I will make my &quot;Jewell Ridge&quot; opinion look like a letter of recommendation by comparison.&quot;

===&quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;===
====&quot;Clear and present danger&quot; test====

In 1919, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;. In Schenck, the petitioners, members of the Socialist Party, were convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 for printing and distributing circulars asserting that American citizens had a right to oppose the draft during World War I because, among other things, it violated the United States Constitution. The &quot;Schenck&quot; decision promulgated the &quot;clear and present danger test,&quot; which provided the standard for sustaining a conviction when speech is relied upon as evidence that an offense has been committed. Justice Holmes, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the decision of the lower court positing:

We admit that, in many places and in ordinary times, the defendants, in saying all that was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances, and are of such a nature as to create a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.

====Background====
In 1951, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;. In Dennis, the petitioners were zealous Communists who organized for the purpose of teaching the &quot;Marxist-Leninist Doctrine.&quot; The principal texts used to teach the doctrine were: &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union&quot;; &quot;Foundations of Leninism&quot; by Stalin; &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; by Marx and Engels; and &quot;State and Revolution&quot; by Lenin. The Petitioners were convicted for violating clause 2 and clause 3 of the Smith Act which, among other things, made it unlawful to conspire to organize a group which advocates the overthrow of the United States government by force or violence. The issue before the Supreme Court was &quot;[w]hether either §2 or §3 of the Smith Act, inherently, or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights ...&quot;

====Jackson&#x27;s concurrence====
In &quot;Dennis&quot;, Jackson concluded that the &quot;clear and present danger test&quot; should not be applied. To this end, Jackson analyzed: the effect Communism had outside the United States; the nature of Communists; and the problems with applying the test. Jackson&#x27;s analysis can be summarized as follows:

On the effect that Communists historically had on foreign countries, Jackson analyzed their effect on Czechoslovakia. In Czechoslovakia, a Communist organization disguised as a competing political faction secretly established its roots in key control positions &quot;of police and information services.&quot; During a period of national crisis, a clandestine Communist organization appeared and overthrew the Czechoslovakian government. Establishing control of mass communication and industry, the Communist organization&#x27;s rule was one of &quot;oppression and terror.&quot; Ironically, as Jackson points out, the Communist organization suppressed the very freedoms which made its conspiracy possible.

On the nature of Communists, Jackson characterized them as an extraordinarily dedicated and highly selective group, disciplined and indoctrinated by Communist policy. The goal of Party members is to secretly infiltrate key positions of government, industry, and unions and to leverage their power once in such positions. Jackson goes on to say that, although &quot;Communist[s] have no scruples against sabotage, terrorism, assassination, or mob disorder,&quot; they &quot;advocate force only when prudent,&quot; which &quot;may never be necessary, because infiltration and deception may be enough.&quot;

On the problems with applying the clear and present danger test in &quot;Dennis&quot;, Jackson deemed significant that the test was authored &quot;before the era of World War II revealed the subtlety and efficacy of modernized revolutionary technique used by totalitarian parties.&quot; Jackson believed that the application of the test should be limited to cases bearing strong enough likeness to those for which it was originally crafted – i.e., &quot;...criminality of hot-headed speech on a street corner, or parading by some zealots behind a red flag, or refusal of a handful of Jehovah Witness school children to salute our flag.&quot; Expressing strong concern that the expansive construction the Court had recently given the test in &quot;Bridges v. California,&quot; Jackson asserted that the test provided Communists with &quot;unprecedented immunities,&quot; while the &quot;Government is captive in a judge-made verbal trap.&quot; Jackson goes on to describe the application of the test to Communists, when determining the constitutionality of the Smith Act facially, or as applied as one of &quot;...apprais[ing] imponderables, including international and national phenomena, which baffle the best informed foreign offices and our most experienced politicians.&quot;

Jackson concludes his First Amendment analysis in &quot;Dennis&quot; by asserting that:

The authors of the &quot;clear and present danger test&quot; never applied it to a case like this, nor would I. If applied as it is proposed here, it means that the Communist plotting is protected during its period of incubation; its preliminary stages of organization and preparation are immune from the law; the Government can move only after imminent action is manifest, when it would, of course, be too late.

====Conclusion====
In the end, the Court applied its own version of the &quot;clear and present danger test&quot; in &quot;Dennis&quot;, essentially disregarding the analytical elements of probability and temporality which had previously appeared to be requirements of the doctrine. Jackson, however, as one commentator put it, expressed in &quot;Dennis&quot; (at least with regards to Communists) that, &quot;when used as part of a conspiracy to act illegally, speech loses its First Amendment protection.&quot;

===&quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;===
====Background====

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, there was great suspicion surrounding Japanese-Americans, particularly those residing on the West Coast of the United States. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, giving the War Department permission to declare some zones &quot;military zones&quot; in which they could prohibit certain people from accessing prescribed areas. With this executive order, the War Department was able to declare that all United States citizens of Japanese ancestry were prohibited from areas in California that were deemed unsafe for Japanese-American habitation for national security purposes, and it forced them into internment camps.

Fred Korematsu, born to Japanese parents on American soil, believed that this was an unconstitutional infringement on an individual&#x27;s civil liberty. The question that came before the Supreme Court was whether the Executive and Legislative branches went beyond their war powers by depriving citizens of rights with no criminal basis.

====Jackson&#x27;s dissent====

The Supreme Court decided that the President and Congress did not stretch their war powers too far by choosing national security over an individual&#x27;s rights in a time of war. Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion for this case, and Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion. The opening paragraph of Jackson&#x27;s dissent illustrated his view of the case:

Korematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a citizen of the United States by nativity, and a citizen of California by residence. No claim is made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here, he is not law-abiding and well- disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.

Jackson warned of the danger that this great allowance of executive power presented, through the War Department&#x27;s ability to deprive individuals of their rights in favor of national security in time of war:

But if we cannot confine military expedients by the Constitution, neither would I distort the Constitution to approve all that the military may deem expedient. That is what the Court appears to be doing, whether consciously or not. I cannot say, from any evidence before me, that the orders of General DeWitt were not reasonably expedient military precautions, nor could I say that they were. But even if they were permissible military procedures, I deny that it follows that they are constitutional. If, as the Court holds, it does follow, then we may as well say that any military order will be constitutional, and have done with it.

Jackson was not concerned in evaluating the validity of DeWitt&#x27;s claim that the internment of Japanese citizens on the West Coast was necessary for national security purposes, but whether this would set a precedent of war-time racial discrimination that would be used to strip individual liberties.

But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time has validated the principles of racial discrimination in criminal procedure, and of transplanting American citizens. The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking, and expands it to new purposes.

===&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;===
One of Jackson&#x27;s law clerks during 1952 – 53, William H. Rehnquist, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1971, and became chief justice in 1986. In December 1971, after Rehnquist&#x27;s nomination had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was pending before the full Senate, a 1952 memorandum came to light that he had written as Jackson&#x27;s law clerk in connection with the landmark case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that argued in favor of affirming the separate-but-equal doctrine of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;. Rehnquist wrote a brief letter attributing the views to Jackson, and was confirmed. In his 1986 hearing, he was questioned about the matter. His explanation of the memorandum was disputed in both 1971 and 1986 by Jackson&#x27;s former secretary, and scholars have questioned its plausibility. However, the papers of Justices Douglas and Frankfurter indicate that Jackson voted for &quot;Brown&quot; in 1954 only after changing his mind.

The views of Justice Jackson about &quot;Brown&quot; can be found in his 1954 unpublished draft concurrence. The &quot;Memorandum by Mr. Justice Jackson, March 15th, 1954&quot;, is available with Jackson&#x27;s papers in the Library of Congress, but did not become publicly available until after Rehnquist&#x27;s 1986 hearing for chief justice. Jackson&#x27;s draft concurrence in &quot;Brown&quot;, divided into four parts, shows how he struggled with how to write an effective opinion to strike down segregation. In Part 1 of Jackson&#x27;s draft concurrence in &quot;Brown&quot;, he wrote that he went to school where &quot;Negro pupils were very few&quot; and that he was &quot;predisposed to the conclusion that segregation elsewhere has outlived whatever justification it may have had.&quot; Despite his own opinions regarding desegregation, Jackson acknowledged the inability of the Court to &quot;eradicate&quot; the &quot;fears, prides and prejudices&quot; that made segregation an important social practice in the South. Jackson thus concluded that the Northerners on the Court should be sensitive to the conditions that brought segregation to the South.

In Part 2 of the draft memorandum, Jackson described the legal framework for forbidding segregation in &quot;Does Existing Law Condemn Segregation?&quot;. Jackson notes that it was difficult for the Court, which expected &quot;not to make new law, but only to declare existing law,&quot; to overturn a decision of such longevity as &quot;Plessy&quot;. Looking at the doctrine of original intent with regard to the Fourteenth Amendment, Jackson found no evidence that segregation was prohibited, particularly since states that had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment had segregated schools at the time. Jackson concluded, &quot;I simply cannot find in the conventional material of constitutional interpretation any justification for saying&quot; that segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

Part 3 of the draft memorandum, titled &quot;Enforcement Power Limits&quot;, describes enforcement by Congress of the Fourteenth Amendment. Jackson addressed the possibility of leaving enforcement to Congress, particularly because the &quot;courts have no power to enforce general declarations of law.&quot; Jackson noted that while segregation was already fading in some states, it would be difficult to overcome in those states where segregation was firmly established. While Jackson recognized the difficulties in the Supreme Court enforcing its judgment, he did not want the task to be left to the lower courts, as suggested by the Government. Jackson concluded that the Court must act because &quot;our representative system has failed&quot;, and even though this &quot;premise is not a sound basis for judicial action.&quot;

Finally, in Part 4 of the draft memorandum, &quot;Changed Conditions&quot;, Jackson began by stating that prior to &quot;Brown&quot;, segregation was legal. According to Jackson, the premise for overruling &quot;Plessy&quot; was the now erroneous &quot;factual assumption&quot; that &quot;there were differences between the Negro and the white races, viewed as a whole.&quot; The draft asserted that the &quot;spectacular&quot; progress of African-Americans, under adverse circumstances, &quot;enabled [them] to outgrow the system and to overcome the presumptions on which it was based.&quot; Jackson emphasized that the changed conditions, along with the importance of a public education, required the Court to strike down the concept of &quot;separate but equal&quot; in public education. While Jackson could not justify the decision in &quot;Brown&quot; in law, he did so on the basis of a political and social imperative. It is unknown if Jackson ever intended to publish this concurrence.

Jackson was in the hospital from March 30 to May 17, 1954. It is reported that Chief Justice Warren visited Jackson in the hospital several times, and discussed both Jackson&#x27;s draft opinion and Warren&#x27;s drafts. One suggestion that Warren took from Jackson was adding the following sentence: &quot;Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences, as well as in the business and professional world.&quot; This quote is tied to the arguments in Part 4 of Jackson&#x27;s draft opinion. On May 17, 1954, Jackson went to the Court from the hospital, so that he could be there the day that the &quot;Brown&quot; decision was handed down. When the &quot;Brown&quot; decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H. Jackson died on October 9, 1954, and so there was not enough time between &quot;Brown&quot; and the death of Jackson to fully explore his views on desegregation.

===Procedural due process===

Jackson was a staunch defender (along with Felix Frankfurter) of procedural due process, for the rule of law that protects members of the public from overreaching by government agencies. One of his hymns to due process is often quoted:

==International Military Tribunal, 1945–1946==

In 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed Jackson (who took a leave of absence from the Supreme Court), as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. He helped draft the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal, which created the legal basis for the Nuremberg Trials. He then served in Nuremberg, Germany, as United States Chief Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal. Jackson pursued his prosecutorial role with a great deal of vigor. His opening and closing arguments before the Nuremberg court were widely celebrated. In the words of defendant Albert Speer, the Nazi Minister of Armaments and War Production,

However, some believe that his cross-examination skills were generally weak, and it was British prosecutor David Maxwell Fyfe who got the better of Hermann Göring in cross-examination, rather than Jackson, who was rebuked by the Tribunal for losing his temper and being repeatedly baited by Göring during the proceedings.

==Death and legacy==

On March 30, 1954, Jackson suffered a massive heart attack. He was confined to the hospital until May 17 when he returned to the Court for the announcement of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. He remained functioning in his position as Justice until October 4, 1954. On Saturday, October 9, 1954, Jackson had another heart attack. At 11:45 a.m. he died at age 62. Funeral services were held in Washington&#x27;s National Cathedral and later in Jamestown&#x27;s St. Luke&#x27;s Church. All eight of the other Supreme Court Justices traveled together to Jamestown, New York, to attend his funeral service; the last time, for security purposes, that the Supreme Court all traveled together. Other prominent guests included Thomas E. Dewey. He was interred near his boyhood home in Frewsburg, New York. His headstone reads &quot;He kept the ancient landmarks and built the new.&quot;

Jackson was the last justice to die while in active service to the Court until his former law clerk, now Chief Justice Rehnquist&#x27;s passing on September 3, 2005, and the last Associate Justice to die while in active service until Antonin Scalia, who occupied the seat Jackson once held, on February 13, 2016.

The Robert H. Jackson Center in Jackson&#x27;s hometown of Jamestown, New York, offers guided tours to visitors who can see exhibits on Jackson&#x27;s life, collections of his writings, and photos from the International Military Tribunal. An extensive collection of Jackson&#x27;s personal and judicial papers is archived at the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress and is open for research. Smaller collections are available at several other repositories.

There are statues dedicated to Jackson outside the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York, as well as the Robert H. Jackson field at the Chautauqua County-Jamestown Airport. The United States District Court for the Western District of New York main courthouse, which is located in Buffalo and opened in November 2011, is dedicated to Jackson and is named the Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse.

<doc id="168907" wikidata="Q6983596" url="?curid=168907" title="Naïve physics">
<text>Naïve physics or folk physics is the untrained human perception of basic physical phenomena. In the field of artificial intelligence the study of naïve physics is a part of the effort to formalize the common knowledge of human beings.

Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism.

Naïve physics is characterized by a mostly intuitive understanding humans have about objects in the physical world. Certain notions of the physical world may be innate.

==Examples==
Some examples of naïve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature:

* What goes up must come down
* A dropped object falls straight down
* A solid object cannot pass through another solid object
* A vacuum sucks things towards it
* An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense
* Two events are either simultaneous or they are not

Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by Aristotle and the medieval scholastics in Western civilization. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of Galileo, Newton, and others. The idea of absolute simultaneity survived until 1905, when the special theory of relativity and its supporting experiments discredited it.

==Psychological research==
The increasing sophistication of technology makes possible more research on knowledge acquisition. Researchers measure physiological responses such as heart rate and eye movement in order to quantify the reaction to a particular stimulus. Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can.

Research in naïve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get bored looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time. That boredom is called habituation. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus.

As an example of the use of this method, research by Susan Hespos and colleagues studied five-month-old infants&#x27; responses to the physics of liquids and solids. Infants in this research were shown liquid being poured from one glass to another until they were habituated to the event. That is, they spent less time looking at this event. Then, the infants were shown an event in which the liquid turned to a solid, which tumbled from the glass rather flowed. The infants looked longer at the new event; that is, they dishabituated.

Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena. When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, they will attend to it until it makes sense.

It is commonly believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that appear physically impossible. Such studies hypothesize that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world.

Smith and Casati (1994) have reviewed the early history of naïve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist Paolo Bozzi.

===Types of experiments===
The basic experimental procedure of a study on naïve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant&#x27;s expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant&#x27;s attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated.

====Solidity====
An experiment that tests an infant&#x27;s knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0° to 180° in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in probable event trial.

====Occlusion====
An occlusion event tests the knowledge that an object exists even if it is not immediately visible. Jean Piaget originally called this concept object permanence. When Piaget formed his developmental theory in the 1950s, he claimed that object permanence is learned, not innate. The children&#x27;s game peek-a-boo is a classic example of this phenomenon, and one which obscures the true grasp infants have on permanence. To disprove this notion, an experimenter designs an impossible occlusion event. The infant is shown a block and a transparent screen. The infant habituates, then a solid panel is placed in front of the objects to block them from view. When the panel is removed, the block is gone, but the screen remains. The infant is confused because the block has disappeared indicating that they understand that objects maintain location in space and do not simply disappear.

====Containment====
A containment event tests the infant&#x27;s recognition that an object that is bigger than a container cannot fit completely into that container. Elizabeth Spelke, one of the psychologists who founded the naïve physics movement, identified the continuity principle, which conveys an understanding that objects exist continuously in time and space. Both occlusion and containment experiments hinge on the continuity principle. In the experiment, the infant is shown a tall cylinder and a tall cylindrical container. The experimenter demonstrates that the tall cylinder fits into the tall container, and the infant is bored by the expected physical outcome. The experimenter then places the tall cylinder completely into a much shorter cylindrical container, and the impossible event confuses the infant. Extended attention demonstrates the infant&#x27;s understanding that containers cannot hold objects that exceed them in height.

===Baillargeon&#x27;s research===
The published findings of Renee Baillargeon brought innate knowledge to the forefront in psychological research. Her research method centered on the visual preference technique. Baillargeon and her followers studied how infants show preference to one stimulus over another. Experimenters judge preference by the length of time an infant will stare at a stimulus before habituating. Researchers believe that preference indicates the infant&#x27;s ability to discriminate between the two events.

<doc id="168915" wikidata="Q4358078" url="?curid=168915" title="Effects of cannabis">
<text>The short-term effects of cannabis are caused by many chemical compounds in the cannabis plant, including 113 different cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, and 120 terpenes, which allow its drug to have various psychological and physiological effects on the human body. Different plants of the genus Cannabis contain different and often unpredictable concentrations of THC and other cannabinoids and hundreds of other molecules that have a pharmacological effect, so the final net effect cannot reliably be foreseen.

Acute effects while under the influence can sometimes include euphoria or anxiety. Although some assert that cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts, may alleviate the adverse effects of THC that some users experience, little is known about CBD&#x27;s effects on humans. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have previously been tested as antidotes for cannabis intoxication with success, reducing or eliminating the physiological and psychological effects of intoxication. Some of these products are currently in development as cannabis antidotes.

== Background and chronic use ==
In the United States, medical cannabis research is limited by federal restrictions.

Cannabis use disorder is defined as a medical diagnosis in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

==Chemistry ==



===Cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors===
The most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids, particularly THC. Some varieties, having undergone careful selection and growing techniques, can yield as much as 34% THC. Another psychoactive cannabinoid present in &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; is tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist.

There are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: cannabidiol (CBD), an isomer of THC; cannabivarin (CBV), an analog of cannabinol (CBN) with a different side chain, cannabidivarin (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and cannabinolic acid. CBD is believed to regulate the metabolism of THC by inactivating cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolize drugs; one such mechanism is via generation of carbon monoxide (a pharmacologically active neurotransmitter) by upon metabolism of CBD. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also pharmacologically active, so the euphoria outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.

===Biochemical mechanisms in the brain===

Cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1&#x27;-di-methyl-pyran ring, a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds. Like most other neurological processes, the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction, the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response. It is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary history of 500 million years. The binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors decrease adenylyl cyclase activity, inhibit calcium N channels, and disinhibit K+A channels. There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2).

===Sustainability in the body===

Most cannabinoids are lipophilic (fat soluble) compounds that are easily stored in fat, thus yielding a long elimination half-life relative to other recreational drugs. The THC molecule, and related compounds, are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days. Long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use (see drug test).

==Toxicities==
When cannabis is smoked, blood levels of THC peak rapidly after a few minutes and then decline, although the psychotropic effects persist for longer. Edible forms of cannabis often contain tens to hundreds of milligrams of THC, much more than the 32 mg of a typical cannabis cigarette. The rise of edible cannabis products has been responsible for a large increase of poisoning of children and young people. Symptoms in children can include lethargy, sedation and seizure.

Synthetic cannabis is suspected of being a potential contributory factor or direct cause of sudden death, due to the strain it can place on the cardiovascular system, or because of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.

===Related to cannabinoids===
THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death. In dogs, the minimum lethal dose of THC is over 3000 mg/kg. According to &quot;The Merck Index&quot;, the of THC (the dose which causes the death of 50% of individuals) is 1270 mg/kg for male rats and 730 mg/kg for female rats from oral consumption in sesame oil, and 42 mg/kg for rats from inhalation.
Cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs, especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes CYP450, thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking.

===Related to smoking===

As of 2025, no high-quality evidence has been found linking cannabis smoking to lung cancer, despite cannabis smoke having similar properties to tobacco smoke. Why this is the case remains unclear. Various studies have speculated that differences in patterns of use compared to tobacco could account for the difference, as well as the anti-inflammatory properties of certain cannabinoids. The health effects of cannabis smoke are an area of active study.

A 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar, cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study found that directly inhaled cannabis smoke contained as much as 20 times as much ammonia and 5 times as much hydrogen cyanide as tobacco smoke and compared the properties of both mainstream and sidestream (smoke emitted from a smouldering &#x27;joint&#x27; or &#x27;cone&#x27;) smoke. Mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than sidestream tobacco smoke. However, other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco, and that some other constituents (such as polonium-210, lead, arsenic, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke. A 2021 longitudinal study conducted among populations of HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults found that smoke-related carcinogenic toxicants and biomarkers detected in tobacco smokers were also detected in exclusive cannabis smokers, including carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aldehydes (such as acrolein), acrylonitrile and acrylamide metabolites, but exposures are lower compared with tobacco or dual smokers. Increased levels of acrolein exposure by tobacco smoking but not exclusive cannabis smoking were detected both in HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults, and contribute to increased diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases among tobacco smokers.

Cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemical compounds. This tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke or cigars. Over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke. These include nitrosamines, reactive aldehydes, and polycylic hydrocarbons, including benz[a]pyrene. Cannabis smoke was listed as a cancer agent in California in 2009. A study by the British Lung Foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users. Other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco. Professor David Nutt, a UK drug expert, points out that the study cited by the British Lung Foundation has been accused of both &quot;false reasoning&quot; and &quot;incorrect methodology&quot;. Further, he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer, and accuses the BLF of &quot;scaremongering over cannabis&quot;.

==Short-term effects==
=== Onset and duration ===
When smoked, the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes, typically lasting 1–3 hours, varying by the person and the strain of cannabis. With oral ingestion, however, the onset of effect is delayed, taking 30 minutes to 2 hours, but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption. The duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish after prolonged, repeated use leading to the development of increased tolerance to cannabinoids.

=== Psychological effects ===
The psychoactive effects of cannabis, known as a &quot;high&quot;, are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use.

When THC enters the blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to cannabinoid receptors. The endogenous ligand of these receptors is anandamide, the effects of which THC emulates. This agonism of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine, which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as euphoria and anxiety.
Some effects may include a general altered state of consciousness, euphoria, relaxation or stress reduction, increased appreciation of the arts, including humor and music, joviality, metacognition and introspection, enhanced recollection (episodic memory), and increased sensuality, sensory awareness, libido, and creativity. Abstract or philosophical thinking, disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical. Anxiety is cannabis&#x27;s most commonly reported adverse side effect. Up to 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis. Some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time. Inexperience and use in an unfamiliar environment are major contributing factors to this anxiety. Cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid found in cannabis, has been shown to mitigate THC&#x27;s adverse effects, including anxiety.

Cannabis produces many other subjective effects, including increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma, and marked distortions in the perception of time. At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory or visual illusions, pseudohallucinations, and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization.

Furthermore, even in those with no family history of psychosis, the administration of pure THC in clinical settings has been demonstrated to elicit transient psychotic symptoms. Any episode of acute psychosis that accompanies cannabis use usually abates after six hours, but in rare instances, users may find the symptoms continuing for many days.

While psychoactive drugs are typically categorized as stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens, cannabis exhibits a mix of all of these effects. Scientific studies have suggested that other cannabinoids like CBD may also play a significant role in its psychoactive effects.

===Somatic effects===
Cannabis use can decrease blood pressure, which increases the risk of fainting. Combining alcohol with cannabis greatly increases the level of impairment and the risk of injury or death from accidents.
Some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate, dry mouth, reddening of the eyes (congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels), a reduction in intra-ocular pressure, muscle relaxation, and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet.

Electroencephalography (EEG) shows somewhat more persistent alpha waves of slightly lower frequency than usual. Cannabinoids produce a marked depression of motor activity via activation of receptors of cannabinoid receptor type 1.

===Duration===
Peak levels of cannabis-associated intoxication occur about 20 minutes after smoking it and last several hours. The total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked depends on the potency, method of smoking – e.g. whether pure or in conjunction with tobacco – and quantity. Peak levels of intoxication typically last an average of three to four hours. When taken orally (in the form of capsules, food, or drink), the psychoactive effects take longer to manifest and generally last longer, typically an average of four to six hours after consumption. Oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking.

===Appetite===
Increased appetite after cannabis use has been documented for hundreds of years and is known colloquially as the &quot;munchies&quot;. Clinical studies and survey data have found that cannabis increases food enjoyment and interest in food. A 2015 study suggests that cannabis triggers uncharacteristic behaviour in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are usually associated with decreasing hunger.

Endogenous cannabinoids, more commonly known as endocannabinoids, exist in cow and human milk. It is widely accepted that the neonatal survival of many species is largely dependent upon their suckling behavior, and research has identified the endogenous cannabinoid system as the first neural system to display complete control over milk ingestion and neonatal survival.

===Cardiovascular effects===
Short-term (one to two hours) effects on the cardiovascular system can include increased heart rate, dilation of blood vessels, and fluctuations in blood pressure. There are medical reports of occasional heart attacks or myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular side effects. Cannabis&#x27;s cardiovascular effects are not associated with serious health problems for most young, healthy users. Researchers reported in the &quot;International Journal of Cardiology&quot;, &quot;Marijuana use by older people, particularly those with some degree of coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, poses greater risks due to the resulting increase in catecholamines, cardiac workload, and carboxyhemoglobin levels, and concurrent episodes of profound postural hypotension. Indeed, marijuana may be a much more common cause of myocardial infarction than is generally recognized. In day-to-day practice, a history of marijuana use is often not sought by many practitioners, and even when sought, the patient&#x27;s response is not always truthful&quot;.

A 2013 analysis of 3,886 myocardial infarction survivors over an 18-year period showed &quot;no statistically significant association between marijuana use and mortality&quot;.

A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke.

A 2000 study by researchers at Boston&#x27;s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard School of Public Health found that a middle-aged person&#x27;s risk of heart attack rises nearly fivefold in the first hour after smoking cannabis, &quot;roughly the same risk seen within an hour of sexual activity&quot;.

Cannabis arteritis is a very rare peripheral vascular disease similar to Buerger&#x27;s disease. There were about 50 confirmed cases from 1960 to 2008, all in Europe.

===Memory and learning===

Studies on cannabis and memory are hindered by small sample sizes, confounding drug use, and other factors. The strongest evidence regarding cannabis and memory focuses on its temporary negative effects on short-term and working memory.

In a 2001 study of neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users, researchers found &quot;some cognitive deficits appear detectable at least 7 days after heavy cannabis use but appear reversible and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use&quot;. Of his studies on cannabis use, lead researcher and Harvard professor Harrison Pope said he found it is not dangerous over the long term, but there are short-term effects. From neuropsychological tests, Pope found that chronic cannabis users showed difficulty with verbal memory in particular for &quot;at least a week or two&quot; after they stopped smoking. Within 28 days, memory problems vanished and the subjects &quot;were no longer distinguishable from the comparison group&quot;.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine failed to show substantial, systemic neurological effects from long-term cannabis use. Their findings were published in the July 2003 issue of the &quot;Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society&quot;. The research team, headed by Igor Grant, found that cannabis use affects perception but does not cause permanent brain damage. Researchers looked at data from 15 previously published controlled studies involving 704 long-term cannabis users and 484 nonusers. The results showed long-term cannabis use was only marginally harmful on memory and learning. Other functions such as reaction time, attention, language, reasoning ability, and perceptual and motor skills were unaffected. The observed effects on memory and learning, they said, showed long-term cannabis use caused &quot;selective memory defects&quot;, but &quot;of a very small magnitude&quot;. A study by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found that heavy cannabis use is associated with decrements in neurocognitive performance even after 28 days of abstinence.

===Effects on driving===

Several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers, but others have found no increased risk. Cannabis usage has been shown in some studies to have an adverse effect on driving ability.
The British Medical Journal indicated that &quot;drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol&quot;.

In &quot;Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for Transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving, finding that, although impaired, &quot;subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do&quot;. In a review of driving simulator studies, researchers found that &quot;even in those who learn to compensate for a drug&#x27;s impairing effects, substantial impairment in performance can still be observed under conditions of general task performance (i.e. when no contingencies are present to maintain compensated performance).&quot;

A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash. An extensive 2013 review of 66 studies of crash risk and drug use found that cannabis is associated with slightly but not statistically significantly increased odds of injury or fatal accident.

In the largest and most precisely controlled study of its kind, carried out by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it was found that other &quot;studies that measure the presence of THC in the drivers&#x27; blood or oral fluid, rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates. Likewise better controlled studies have found lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates&quot;. The study found that &quot;after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving&quot;. A 2018 study found that fatal crashes involving cannabis increased in Colorado, Washington, and Massachusetts after recreational cannabis legalization or decriminalization.

===Combination with other drugs===
A confounding factor in cannabis research is the prevalent usage of other recreational drugs, especially alcohol and nicotine. Such complications demonstrate the need for studies with stronger controls, and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco. Some critics question whether agencies doing the research make an honest effort to present an unbiased summary of the evidence without &quot;cherry-picking&quot; data to please funding sources such as the tobacco industry or governments dependent on cigarette tax revenue; others caution that the raw data, and not the final conclusions, are what should be examined.

The Australian National Household Survey of 2001 found that cannabis is rarely used in Australia without other drugs. 95% of cannabis users also drank alcohol; 26% took amphetamines; 19% took ecstasy and only 2.7% reported not having used any other drug with cannabis. While there has been research on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis on performing certain tasks, little has been done on the reasons this combination is so popular. Evidence from a controlled experimental study by Lukas and Orozco suggests that alcohol causes THC to be absorbed more rapidly into the user&#x27;s blood plasma. Data from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that three-quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available, suggesting that the two have similar effects.

===Pathogens and microtoxins===
Most microorganisms found in cannabis affect only plants, not humans, but some, especially those that proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored, can be harmful to humans. Some users store cannabis in an airtight bag or jar in a refrigerator to prevent fungal and bacterial growth.

The fungi &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus tamarii&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus sulphureus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus repens&quot;, &quot;Mucor hiemalis&quot; (not a human pathogen), &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot;, &quot;Penicillium italicum&quot;, and &quot;Rhizopus nigricans&quot; have been found in moldy cannabis. &quot;Aspergillus&quot; mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or handling of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Mold is also found in smoke from mold-infected cannabis, and the lungs and nasal passages are a major means of contracting fungal infections. Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggest baking cannabis in home ovens at 150 °C [302 °F], for five minutes before smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of &quot;A. fumigatus&quot;, &quot;A. flavus&quot; and &quot;A. niger&quot;, and did not lower THC levels. Cannabis contaminated with &quot;Salmonella muenchen&quot; was correlated with dozens of cases of salmonellosis in 1981. Thermophilic actinomycetes were also found in cannabis.

==Long-term effects==

Exposure to cannabis may have biologically based physical, mental, behavioral, and social health consequences and is &quot;associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, eyesight, and vasculature&quot; according to a 2013 literature review by Gordon and colleagues. The association with these diseases has only been reported in cases where people have smoked cannabis. The authors cautioned that &quot;evidence is needed, and further research should be considered, to prove causal associations of cannabis with many physical health conditions&quot;.

Cannabis use disorder is defined in the fifth revision of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) as a condition requiring treatment. Several drugs have been investigated in an attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of stopping cannabis use. Such drugs include bupropion, divalproex, nefazodone, lofexidine, and dronabinol. Of these, dronabinol (a trade name for THC) has proven the most effective. The drugs buspirone and rimonabant have shown some success in helping maintain cannabis abstinence.

There is evidence that long-term use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis, regardless of confounding factors, and particularly for people who have genetic risk factors. A 2019 meta-analysis found that 34% of people with cannabis-induced psychosis transitioned to schizophrenia. This was found to be comparatively higher than hallucinogens (26%) and amphetamines (22%).

Long-term cannabis users are at risk for developing cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), characterized by recurrent bouts of intense vomiting and abdominal cramping during or within 48 hours of heavy cannabis use. The mechanism behind CHS is poorly understood and is contrary to the antiemetic properties of cannabis and cannabinoids. Of those who went to the emergency department (ED) with recurrent vomiting in one institution in the United States from 2005 to 2010, about 6% had the condition. The condition is usually not responsive to traditionally used antiemetics and the primary treatment is cessation from cannabis use.

Smoking cannabis can potentially cause cancer, due to carcinogens present in smoke.

==Effects in pregnancy==

Cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus, miscarriage, and cognitive deficits in offspring based on animal studies, although there is limited evidence for this in humans at this time. A 2012 systematic review found although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions, there was some evidence that prenatal exposure to cannabis was associated with &quot;deficits in language, attention, areas of cognitive performance, and delinquent behavior in adolescence&quot;. A report prepared for the Australian National Council on Drugs concluded cannabis and other cannabinoids are contraindicated in pregnancy as it may interact with the endocannabinoid system.

==Effects in pediatrics==
Children can become exposed to cannabis, typically through accidental exposure which can lead to very high doses, especially in the case of edibles. Unlike in adults, these levels of exposure can lead to major complications in children. These complications include encephalopathy, hypotension, respiratory depression severe enough to require ventilation, somnolence, coma, and in extreme cases, reports of death. Pediatric exposure to edibles is of increasing concern because these products are typically sweets (gummies, cookies, etc.), and their prevalence is increasing as cannabis is legalized or decriminalized in many territories.

<text>The legality of cannabis for medical and recreational use varies by country, in terms of its possession, distribution, and cultivation, and (in regards to medical) how it can be consumed and what medical conditions it can be used for. These policies in most countries are regulated by three United Nations treaties: the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Cannabis was reclassified in 2020 to a Schedule I-only drug under the Single Convention treaty (from being a Schedule I and IV drug previously), with the schedules from strictest to least being IV, I, II, and III. As a Schedule I drug under the treaty, countries can allow the medical use of cannabis but it is considered to be an addictive drug with a serious risk of abuse.

The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries; however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation). Others have much more severe penalties such as some Middle Eastern and Far Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years. Countries that have legalized recreational use of cannabis are Canada, Georgia, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay, plus 24 states, 3 territories, and the District of Columbia in the United States and the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. Commercial sale of recreational cannabis is legalized nationwide in three countries (Canada, Thailand, and Uruguay) and in all subnational U.S. jurisdictions that have legalized possession except Virginia and Washington, D.C. A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed coffeeshops.

The legalization of recreational cannabis has been put forward as a solution to restrict access to the drug by minors, a method of harm reduction, a way of reducing organized crime, aid economic growth and revenue, as well as enable job creation. Unregulated cannabis from the illegal black market comes with increased health risks, such as unknown THC rate, unknown potency, possible toxic additives and contaminants and synthetic cannabinoids. Whereas, a legal and regulated cannabis system enables product quality and safety requirements to be mandated for public safety and consumer awareness. Cannabis illegality tends to become a burden on the criminal justice system, with legalization as a way to free up police time and resources to focus on more serious crimes, reduce the prison population of non-violent drug offenders and thus save taxpayers money.

Countries that have legalized medical use of cannabis include Albania, Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Others have more restrictive laws that allow only the use of certain cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals, such as Sativex, Marinol, or Epidiolex. In the United States, 39 states, 4 territories, and the District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of cannabis, but at the federal level its use remains prohibited.

<text>Business cycles are intervals of general expansion followed by recession in economic performance. The changes in economic activity that characterize business cycles have important implications for the welfare of the general population, government institutions, and private sector firms. 

There are many definitions of a business cycle. The simplest defines recessions as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. More satisfactory classifications are provided by, first including more economic indicators and second by looking for more data patterns than the two quarter definition. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research oversees a Business Cycle Dating Committee that defines a recession as &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.&quot; 

Business cycles are usually thought of as medium term evolution. They are less related to long-term trends, coming from slowly-changing factors like technological advances. Further, a one period change, that is unusual over the course of one or two years, is often relegated to “noise”; an example is a worker strike or an isolated period of severe weather. 

The individual episodes of expansion/recession occur with changing duration and intensity over time. Typically their periodicity has a wide range from around 2 to 10 years.

There are many sources of business cycle movements such as rapid and significant changes in the price of oil or variation in consumer sentiment that affects overall spending in the macroeconomy and thus investment and firms&#x27; profits. Usually such sources are unpredictable in advance and can be viewed as random &quot;shocks&quot; to the cyclical pattern, as happened during the 2007–2008 financial crises or the COVID-19 pandemic.

== History ==
=== Theory ===

The first systematic exposition of economic crises, in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium, was the 1819 by Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi. Prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles, blamed them on external factors, notably war, or only studied the long term. Sismondi found vindication in the Panic of 1825, which was the first unarguably international economic crisis, occurring in peacetime.

Sismondi and his contemporary Robert Owen, who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 &quot;Report to the Committee of the Association for the Relief of the Manufacturing Poor,&quot; both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption, caused in particular by wealth inequality. They advocated government intervention and socialism, respectively, as the solution. This work did not generate interest among classical economists, though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in Keynesian economics in the 1930s.

Sismondi&#x27;s theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating &quot;cycles&quot; by Charles Dunoyer, and similar theories, showing signs of influence by Sismondi, were developed by Johann Karl Rodbertus. Periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of Karl Marx, who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and, on the basis of which, he predicted a communist revolution. Though only passing references in &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (1867) refer to crises, they were extensively discussed in Marx&#x27;s posthumously published books, particularly in &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot;. In &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1879), Henry George focused on land&#x27;s role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a single tax on land as a solution.

Statistical or econometric modelling and theory of business cycle movements can also be used. In this case a time series analysis is used to capture the regularities and the stochastic signals and noise in economic time series such as Real GDP or Investment. [Harvey and Trimbur, 2003, &quot;Review of Economics and Statistics&quot;] developed models for describing stochastic or pseudo- cycles, of which business cycles represent a leading case. As well-formed and compact – and easy to implement – statistical methods may outperform macroeconomic approaches in numerous cases, they provide a solid alternative even for rather complex economic theory.

=== Classification by periods ===

In 1860 French economist Clément Juglar first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long, although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity. This interval of periodicity is also commonplace, as an empirical finding, in time series models for stochastic cycles in economic data. Furthermore, methods like statistical modelling in a Bayesian framework – see e.g. [Harvey, Trimbur, and van Dijk, 2007, &quot;Journal of Econometrics&quot;] – can incorporate such a range explicitly by setting up priors that concentrate around say 6 to 12 years, such flexible knowledge about the frequency of business cycles can actually be included in their mathematical study, using a Bayesian statistical paradigm.

Later, economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that a Juglar cycle has four stages:
# Expansion (increase in production and prices, low interest rates)
# Crisis (stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur)
# Recession (drops in prices and in output, high interest-rates)
# Recovery (stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes)

Schumpeter&#x27;s Juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity, consumer confidence, aggregate demand, and prices.

In the 20th century, Schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity, so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers:

* The Kitchin inventory cycle of 3 to 5 years (after Joseph Kitchin)
* The Juglar fixed-investment cycle of 7 to 11 years. A range of periods rather than one fixed period is needed to capture business cycle fluctuations, which may be done by using a random or irregular source as in an econometric or statistical framework. 
* The Kuznets infrastructural investment cycle of 15 to 25 years (after Simon Kuznets – also called &quot;building cycle&quot;)
* The Kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of 45 to 60 years (after the Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev)

Some say interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics, which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles. Further econometric studies such as the two works in 2003 and 2007 cited above demonstrate a clear tendency for cyclical components in macroeconomic times to behave in a stochastic rather than deterministic way.

Others, such as Dmitry Orlov, argue that simple compound interest mandates the cycling of monetary systems. Since 1960, World GDP has increased by fifty-nine times, and these multiples have not even kept up with annual inflation over the same period. Social Contract (freedoms and absence of social problems) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle.

The Bible (760 BCE) and Hammurabi&#x27;s Code (1763 BCE) both explain economic remediations for cyclic sixty-year recurring great depressions, via fiftieth-year Jubilee (biblical) debt and wealth resets. Thirty major debt forgiveness events are recorded in history including the debt forgiveness given to most European nations in the 1930s to 1954.

=== Occurrence ===

There were great increases in productivity, industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from 1870 to 1890 that included the Long Depression and two other recessions. There were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the Great Depression. Both the Long and Great Depressions were characterized by overcapacity and market saturation.

Over the period since the Industrial Revolution, technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt, the primary exception being the Great Depression, which caused a multi-year steep economic decline. The effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour&#x27;s work, which has grown from $3 in 1900 to $22 in 1990, measured in 2010 dollars. There were similar increases in real wages during the 19th century. (&quot;See: Productivity improving technologies (historical)&quot;.) A table of innovations and long cycles can be seen at: . Since surprising news in the economy, which has a random aspect, impact the state of the business cycle, any corresponding descriptions must have a random part at its root that motivates the use of statistical frameworks in this area.

There were frequent crises in Europe and America in the 19th and first half of the 20th century, specifically the period 1815–1939. This period started from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815, which was immediately followed by the Post-Napoleonic depression in the United Kingdom (1815–1830), and culminated in the Great Depression of 1929–1939, which led into World War II. See Financial crisis: 19th century for listing and details. The first of these crises not associated with a war was the Panic of 1825.

Business cycles in OECD countries after World War II were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles. This was particularly true during the Golden Age of Capitalism (1945/50–1970s), and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the Late-2000s recession. Economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles, and automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the government&#x27;s budget also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers.

In this period, the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead. The first declaration was in the late 1960s, when the Phillips curve was seen as being able to steer the economy. However, this was followed by stagflation in the 1970s, which discredited the theory. The second declaration was in the early 2000s, following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as the Great Moderation. Notably, in 2003, Robert Lucas Jr., in his presidential address to the American Economic Association, declared that the &quot;central problem of depression-prevention [has] been solved, for all practical purposes.&quot;

Various regions have experienced prolonged depressions, most dramatically the economic crisis in former Eastern Bloc countries following the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. For several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression, with real income still lower than in 1989.

== Identifying ==
In 1946, economists Arthur F. Burns and Wesley C. Mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book &quot;Measuring Business Cycles&quot;:
According to A. F. Burns:
In the United States, it is generally accepted that the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. An expansion is the period from a trough to a peak and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough. The NBER identifies a recession as &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production&quot;.

=== Upper turning points of business cycle, commodity prices and freight rates ===
There is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle, commodity prices, and freight rates, which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873, 1889, 1900 and 1912. Hamilton expressed that in the post war era, a majority of recessions are connected to an increase in oil price.

Commodity price shocks are considered to be a significant driving force of the US business cycle.

Along these lines, the research in [Trimbur, 2010, &quot;International Journal of Forecasting&quot;] shows empirical results for the relation between oil-prices and real GDP. The methodology uses a statistical model that incorporate level shifts in the price of crude oil; hence the approach describes the possibility of oil price shocks and forecasts the likelihood of such events.

=== Indicators ===

Economic indicators are used to measure the business cycle: consumer confidence index, retail trade index, unemployment and industry/service production index. Stock and Watson claim that financial indicators&#x27; predictive ability is not stable over different time periods because of economic shocks, random fluctuations and development in financial systems. Ludvigson believes consumer confidence index is a coincident indicator as it relates to consumer&#x27;s current situations. Winton &amp; Ralph state that retail trade index is a benchmark for the current economic level because its aggregate value counts up for two-thirds of the overall GDP and reflects the real state of the economy. According to Stock and Watson, unemployment claim can predict when the business cycle is entering a downward phase. Banbura and Rüstler argue that industry production&#x27;s GDP information can be delayed as it measures real activity with real number, but it provides an accurate prediction of GDP.

Series used to infer the underlying business cycle fall into three categories: lagging, coincident, and leading. They are described as main elements of an analytic system to forecast peaks and troughs in the business cycle. For almost 30 years, these economic data series are considered as &quot;the leading index&quot; or &quot;the leading indicators&quot;-were compiled and published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

A prominent coincident, or real-time, business cycle indicator is the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Index.

=== Spectral analysis of business cycles ===
Recent research employing spectral analysis has confirmed the presence of Kondratiev waves in the world GDP dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance. Korotayev &amp; Tsirel also detected shorter business cycles, dating the Kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-harmonic of the Kondratiev, meaning that there are three Kuznets cycles per Kondratiev.

===Recurrence quantification analysis===
Recurrence quantification analysis has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and economic development. To this end, Orlando et al. developed the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index to test correlations of RQA on a sample signal and then investigated the application to business time series. The said index has been proven to detect hidden changes in time series. Further, Orlando et al., over an extensive dataset, shown that recurrence quantification analysis may help in anticipating transitions from laminar (i.e. regular) to turbulent (i.e. chaotic) phases such as USA GDP in 1949, 1953, etc. Last but not least, it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics.

=== Cycles or fluctuations? ===

The Business Cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, inflation, exchange rates. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock&#x27;s current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock&#x27;s return growth.

Unlike long-term trends, medium-term data fluctuations are connected to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and its role in regulating inflation during an economic cycle. At the same time, the presence of nominal restrictions in price setting behavior might impact the short-term course of inflation.

In recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of &quot;economic fluctuation&quot; rather than a &quot;business cycle&quot; – though some economists use the phrase &#x27;business cycle&#x27; as a convenient shorthand. For example, Milton Friedman said that calling the business cycle a &quot;cycle&quot; is a misnomer, because of its non-cyclical nature. Friedman believed that for the most part, excluding very large supply shocks, business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon. Arthur F. Burns and Wesley C. Mitchell define business cycle as a form of fluctuation. In economic activities, a cycle of expansions happening, followed by recessions, contractions, and revivals. All of which combine to form the next cycle&#x27;s expansion phase; this sequence of change is repeated but not periodic.
== Proposed explanations ==
The explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them.

=== Exogenous vs. endogenous ===
Within economics, it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external (exogenous) versus internal (endogenous) causes. In the first case shocks are stochastic, in the second case shocks are deterministically chaotic and embedded in the economic system. The classical school (now neo-classical) argues for exogenous causes and the underconsumptionist (now Keynesian) school argues for endogenous causes. These may also broadly be classed as &quot;supply-side&quot; and &quot;demand-side&quot; explanations: supply-side explanations may be styled, following Say&#x27;s law, as arguing that &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;, while demand-side explanations argue that effective demand may fall short of supply, yielding a recession or depression.

This debate has important policy consequences: proponents of exogenous causes of crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or regulation (laissez faire), as absent these external shocks, the market functions, while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as Keynesians largely argue for larger government policy and regulation, as absent regulation, the market will move from crisis to crisis. This division is not absolute – some classicals (including Say) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles, despite believing in external causes, while Austrian School economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises, despite believing in internal causes.

The view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to Say&#x27;s law, and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting Say&#x27;s law; this is also referred to as the &quot;general glut&quot; (supply in relation to demand) debate.

Until the Keynesian Revolution in mainstream economics in the wake of the Great Depression, classical and neoclassical explanations (exogenous causes) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles; following the Keynesian revolution, neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected. There has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of real business cycle (RBC) theory. The debate between Keynesians and neo-classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007.

Mainstream economists working in the neoclassical tradition, as opposed to the Keynesian tradition, have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences, such as the State or its regulations, labor unions, business monopolies, or shocks due to technology or natural causes.

Contrarily, in the heterodox tradition of Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, Clément Juglar, and Marx the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it.

The 19th-century school of under consumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle, notably the paradox of thrift, and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of Keynesian economics via the Keynesian revolution.

=== Mainstream economics ===

Mainstream economics views business cycles as essentially &quot;the random summation of random causes&quot;. In 1927, Eugen Slutzky observed that summing random numbers, such as the last digits of the Russian state lottery, could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles, an observation that has since been repeated many times. This caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact. This means that what appear to be cyclical phenomena can actually be explained as just random events that are fed into a simple linear model. Thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time. Mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based on the idea that they are caused by random shocks. Due to this inherent randomness, recessions can sometimes not occur for decades; for example, Australia did not experience any recession between 1991 and 2020.

While economists have found it difficult to forecast recessions or determine their likely severity, research indicates that longer expansions do not cause following recessions to be more severe.

=== Keynesian ===
According to Keynesian economics, fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output. These fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles. Keynesian models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles. However, simple Keynesian models involving the interaction of the Keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks. Paul Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;oscillator model&quot; is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator. The amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment, for investment determines the level of aggregate output (multiplier), and is determined by aggregate demand (accelerator).

In the Keynesian tradition, Richard Goodwin accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers&#x27; wages. The fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of employment (wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle), for when the economy is at high employment, workers are able to demand rises in wages, whereas in periods of high unemployment, wages tend to fall. According to Goodwin, when unemployment and business profits rise, the output rises.

=== Cyclical behavior of exports and imports ===
Exports and imports are large components of an economy&#x27;s aggregate expenditure, especially one that is oriented toward international trade. Income is an essential determinant of the level of imported goods. A higher GDP reflects a higher level of spending on imported goods and services, and vice versa. Therefore, expenditure on imported goods and services falls during a recession and rises during an economic expansion or boom.

Import expenditures are commonly considered to be procyclical and cyclical in nature, coincident with the business cycle. Domestic export expenditures give a good indication of foreign business cycles as foreign import expenditures are coincident with the foreign business cycle.

=== Credit/debt cycle ===

One alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle: the net expansion of credit (increase in private credit, equivalently debt, as a percentage of GDP) yields economic expansions, while the net contraction causes recessions, and if it persists, depressions. In particular, the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions, and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle.

A primary theory in this vein is the debt deflation theory of Irving Fisher, which he proposed to explain the Great Depression. A more recent complementary theory is the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Hyman Minsky, and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with Post-Keynesian economics such as Steve Keen.

Post-Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit, interest rates and financial frailty, called the Financial Instability Hypothesis. In an expansion period, interest rates are low and companies easily borrow money from banks to invest. Banks are not reluctant to grant them loans, because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans. This process leads to firms becoming excessively indebted, so that they stop investing, and the economy goes into recession.

While credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream, they have gained occasional mention, such as , cited approvingly by .

=== Real business-cycle theory ===

Within mainstream economics, Keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor (which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment). This theory is most associated with Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, and more generally the Chicago school of economics (freshwater economics). They consider that economic crisis and fluctuations cannot stem from a monetary shock, only from an external shock, such as an innovation.

=== Product based theory of economic cycles ===

This theory explains the nature and causes of economic cycles from the viewpoint of life-cycle of marketable goods. The theory originates from the work of Raymond Vernon, who described the development of international trade in terms of product life-cycle – a period of time during which the product circulates in the market. Vernon stated that some countries specialize in the production and export of technologically new products, while others specialize in the production of already known products. The most developed countries are able to invest large amounts of money in the technological innovations and produce new products, thus obtaining a dynamic comparative advantage over developing countries.

Recent research by Georgiy Revyakin proved initial Vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries. He also presumed economic cycles with different periodicity can be compared to the products with various life-cycles. In case of Kondratiev waves such products correlate with fundamental discoveries implemented in production (inventions which form the technological paradigm: Richard Arkwright&#x27;s machines, steam engines, industrial use of electricity, computer invention, etc.); Kuznets cycles describe such products as infrastructural components (roadways, transport, utilities, etc.); Juglar cycles may go in parallel with enterprise fixed capital (equipment, machinery, etc.), and Kitchin cycles are characterized by change in the society preferences (tastes) for consumer goods, and time, which is necessary to start the production.

Highly competitive market conditions would determine simultaneous technological updates of all economic agents (as a result, cycle formation): in case if a manufacturing technology at an enterprise does not meet the current technological environment – such company loses its competitiveness and eventually goes bankrupt.

=== Political business cycle ===
Another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions. The political business cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of Michał Kalecki who discussed &quot;the reluctance of the &#x27;captains of industry&#x27; to accept government intervention in the matter of employment&quot;. Persistent full employment would mean increasing workers&#x27; bargaining power to raise wages and to avoid doing unpaid labor, potentially hurting profitability. However, he did not see this theory as applying under fascism, which would use direct force to destroy labor&#x27;s power.

In recent years, proponents of the &quot;electoral business cycle&quot; theory have argued that incumbent politicians encourage prosperity before elections in order to ensure re-election – and make the citizens pay for it with recessions afterwards. The political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected, it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence. It then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election, hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on election day.

The &quot;partisan business cycle&quot; suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes. Regime A adopts expansionary policies, resulting in growth and inflation, but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high. The replacement, Regime B, adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth, and the downwards swing of the cycle. It is voted out of office when unemployment is too high, being replaced by Party A.

=== Marxian economics ===

For Marx, the economy based on production of commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to crisis. In the heterodox Marxian view, profit is the major engine of the market economy, but business (capital) profitability has a tendency to fall that recurrently creates crises in which mass unemployment occurs, businesses fail, remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered. In the long run, these crises tend to be more severe and the system will eventually fail.

Some Marxist authors such as Rosa Luxemburg viewed the lack of purchasing power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand, creating crisis, in a model that has similarities with the Keynesian one. Indeed, a number of modern authors have tried to combine Marx&#x27;s and Keynes&#x27;s views. Henryk Grossman reviewed the debates and the counteracting tendencies and Paul Mattick subsequently emphasized the basic differences between the Marxian and the Keynesian perspective. While Keynes saw capitalism as a system worth maintaining and susceptible to efficient regulation, Marx viewed capitalism as a historically doomed system that cannot be put under societal control.

The American mathematician and economist Richard M. Goodwin formalised a Marxist model of business cycles known as the Goodwin Model in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers (a result of high employment in boom periods) pushing up the wage share of national income, suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation. Later theorists applying variants of the Goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the United States and elsewhere. David Gordon provided a Marxist model of long period institutional growth cycles in an attempt to explain the Kondratiev wave. This cycle is due to the periodic breakdown of the social structure of accumulation, a set of institutions which secure and stabilize capital accumulation.

=== Austrian School ===

Economists of the heterodox Austrian School argue that business cycles are caused by excessive issuance of credit by banks in fractional reserve banking systems. According to Austrian economists, excessive issuance of bank credit may be exacerbated if central bank monetary policy sets interest rates too low, and the resulting expansion of the money supply causes a &quot;boom&quot; in which resources are misallocated or &quot;malinvested&quot; because of artificially low interest rates. Eventually, the boom cannot be sustained and is followed by a &quot;bust&quot; in which the malinvestments are liquidated (sold for less than their original cost) and the money supply contracts.

One of the criticisms of the Austrian business cycle theory is based on the observation that the United States suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century, notably the Panic of 1873, which occurred prior to the establishment of a U.S. central bank in 1913. Adherents of the Austrian School, such as the historian Thomas Woods, argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers&#x27; efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard, and are thus consistent with Austrian Business Cycle Theory.

The Austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the mainstream understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists. Mainstream economists generally do not support Austrian school explanations for business cycles, on both theoretical as well as real-world empirical grounds. Austrians claim that the boom-and-bust business cycle is caused by government intervention into the economy, and that the cycle would be comparatively rare and mild without central government interference.

=== Yield curve ===


The slope of the yield curve is one of the most powerful predictors of future economic growth, inflation, and recessions. One measure of the yield curve slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rate and the 3-month Treasury bond rate) is included in the Financial Stress Index published by the St. Louis Fed. A different measure of the slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate) is incorporated into the Index of Leading Economic Indicators published by The Conference Board.

An inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of recession. A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of inflationary growth. Work by Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession. Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs. The New York Fed publishes a monthly recession probability prediction derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella&#x27;s work.

All the recessions in the United States since 1970 (up through 2017) have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs. 3-month). Over the same time frame, every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession as declared by the NBER business cycle dating committee.
Estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or bank-like financial institutions). When the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or other forms of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a credit crunch. When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a credit bubble.

=== Georgism ===

Henry George claimed land price fluctuations were the primary cause of most business cycles.

===Other factors===
Population swings can impact business cycles.

== Mitigating an economic downturn ==
Many social indicators, such as mental health, crimes, and suicides, worsen during economic recessions (though general mortality tends to fall, and it is in expansions when it tends to increase). As periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs, there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions. Since the 1940s, following the Keynesian Revolution, most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government, under the rubric of stabilization policy.

Since in the Keynesian view, recessions are caused by inadequate aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium. This the government can do in two ways, firstly by increasing the money supply (expansionary monetary policy) and secondly by increasing government spending or cutting taxes (expansionary fiscal policy).

By contrast, some economists, notably New classical economist Robert Lucas, argue that the welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible, and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization.

However, even according to Keynesian theory, managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy. Some theorists, notably those who believe in Marxian economics, believe that this difficulty is insurmountable. Karl Marx claimed that recurrent business cycle crises were an inevitable result of the operations of the capitalistic system. In this view, all that the government can do is to change the &quot;timing&quot; of economic crises. The crisis could also show up in a different &quot;form&quot;, for example as severe inflation or a steadily increasing government deficit. Worse, by delaying a crisis, government policy is seen as making it &quot;more dramatic&quot; and thus more painful.

Additionally, since the 1960s neoclassical economists have played down the ability of Keynesian policies to manage an economy. Since the 1960s, economists like Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps have made ground in their arguments that inflationary expectations negate the Phillips curve in the long run. The stagflation of the 1970s provided striking support for their theories while proving a dilemma for Keynesian policies, which appeared to necessitate both expansionary policies to mitigate recession and contractionary policies to reduce inflation.
Friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the central bank of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes, as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the Wall Street crash of 1929, in which they made what would have been a recession into the Great Depression.

<text>Deliberative democracy or discursive democracy is a form of democracy in which deliberation is central to decision-making. Deliberative democracy seeks quality over quantity by limiting decision-makers to a smaller but more representative sample of the population that is given the time and resources to focus on one issue.

It often adopts elements of both consensus decision-making and majority rule. Deliberative democracy differs from traditional democratic theory in that authentic deliberation, not mere voting, is the primary source of legitimacy for the law. Deliberative democracy is related to consultative democracy, in which public consultation with citizens is central to democratic processes. The distance between deliberative democracy and concepts like representative democracy or direct democracy is debated. While some practitioners and theorists use deliberative democracy to describe elected bodies whose members propose and enact legislation, Hélène Landemore and others increasingly use deliberative democracy to refer to decision-making by randomly-selected lay citizens with equal power.

Deliberative democracy has a long history of practice and theory traced back to ancient times, with an increase in academic attention in the 1990s, and growing implementations since 2010. Joseph M. Bessette has been credited with coining the term in his 1980 work &quot;Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government&quot;.

==Overview==
Deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. &quot;Authentic deliberation&quot; is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtains through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.

The roots of deliberative democracy can be traced back to Aristotle and his notion of politics; however, the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas&#x27; work on communicative rationality and the public sphere is often identified as a major work in this area.

Deliberative democracy can be practiced by decision-makers in both representative democracies and direct democracies. In &quot;elitist deliberative democracy,&quot; principles of deliberative democracy apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as legislatures and courts; in &quot;populist deliberative democracy,&quot; principles of deliberative democracy apply to groups of lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions. One purpose of populist deliberative democracy can be to use deliberation among a group of lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues for other decision-makers to consider; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal. Another purpose of populist deliberative democracy can, like direct democracy, result directly in binding law. If political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives, then there is no democratic element; this deliberative process is called &quot;elite deliberation&quot;.

James Fearon and Portia Pedro believe deliberative processes most often generate ideal conditions of impartiality, rationality and knowledge of the relevant facts, resulting in more morally correct outcomes. Former diplomat Carne Ross contends that the processes are more civil, collaborative, and evidence-based than the debates in traditional town hall meetings or in internet forums if citizens know their debates will impact society. Some fear the influence of a skilled orator. John Burnheim critiques representative democracy as requiring citizens to vote for a large package of policies and preferences bundled together, much of which a voter might not want. He argues that this does not translate voter preferences as well as deliberative groups, each of which are given the time and the ability to focus on one issue.

==Characteristics==

===Fishkin&#x27;s model of deliberation===
James Fishkin, who has designed practical implementations of deliberative democracy through deliberative polling for over 15 years in various countries, describes five characteristics essential for legitimate deliberation:
*&quot;Information&quot;: The extent to which participants are given access to reasonably accurate information that they believe to be relevant to the issue
* &quot;Substantive balance&quot;: The extent to which arguments offered by one side or from one perspective are answered by considerations offered by those who hold other perspectives
* &quot;Diversity&quot;: The extent to which the major positions in the public are represented by participants in the discussion
* &quot;Conscientiousness&quot;: The extent to which participants sincerely weigh the merits of the arguments
* &quot;Equal consideration&quot;: The extent to which arguments offered by all participants are considered on the merits regardless of which participants offer them
Studies by James Fishkin and others have concluded that deliberative democracy tends to produce outcomes which are superior to those in other forms of democracy. Desirable outcomes in their research include less partisanship and more sympathy with opposing views; more respect for evidence-based reasoning rather than opinion; a greater commitment to the decisions taken by those involved; and a greater chance for widely shared consensus to emerge, thus promoting social cohesion between people from different backgrounds. Fishkin cites extensive empirical support for the increase in public spiritedness that is often caused by participation in deliberation, and says theoretical support can be traced back to foundational democratic thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville. 

===Cohen&#x27;s outline===
Joshua Cohen, a student of John Rawls, argued that the five main features of deliberative democracy include:

# An ongoing independent association with expected continuation.
# The citizens in the democracy structure their institutions such that deliberation is the deciding factor in the creation of the institutions and the institutions allow deliberation to continue.
# A commitment to the respect of a pluralism of values and aims within the polity.
# The citizens consider deliberative procedure as the source of legitimacy, and prefer the causal history of legitimation for each law to be transparent and easily traceable to the deliberative process.
# Each member recognizes and respects other members&#x27; deliberative capacity.
Cohen presents deliberative democracy as more than a theory of legitimacy, and forms a body of substantive rights around it based on achieving &quot;ideal deliberation&quot;:
# It is free in two ways:
## The participants consider themselves bound solely by the results and preconditions of the deliberation. They are free from any authority of prior norms or requirements.
## The participants suppose that they can act on the decision made; the deliberative process is a sufficient reason to comply with the decision reached.
# Parties to deliberation are required to state reasons for their proposals, and proposals are accepted or rejected based on the reasons given, as the content of the very deliberation taking place.
# Participants are equal in two ways:
## Formal: anyone can put forth proposals, criticize, and support measures. There is no substantive hierarchy.
## Substantive: The participants are not limited or bound by certain distributions of power, resources, or pre-existing norms. &quot;The participants…do not regard themselves as bound by the existing system of rights, except insofar as that system establishes the framework of free deliberation among equals.&quot;
# Deliberation aims at a rationally motivated consensus: it aims to find reasons acceptable to all who are committed to such a system of decision-making. When consensus or something near enough is not possible, majoritarian decision making is used.

In &quot;Democracy and Liberty&quot;, an essay published in 1998, Cohen updated his idea of pluralism to &quot;reasonable pluralism&quot; – the acceptance of different, incompatible worldviews and the importance of good faith deliberative efforts to ensure that as far as possible the holders of these views can live together on terms acceptable to all.

===Gutmann and Thompson&#x27;s model===
Amy Gutmann and Dennis F. Thompson&#x27;s definition captures the elements that are found in most conceptions of deliberative democracy. They define it as &quot;a form of government in which free and equal citizens and their representatives justify decisions in a process in which they give one another reasons that are mutually acceptable and generally accessible, with the aim of reaching decisions that are binding on all at present but open to challenge in the future&quot;.

They state that deliberative democracy has four requirements, which refer to the kind of reasons that citizens and their representatives are expected to give to one another:
# Reciprocal. The reasons should be acceptable to free and equal persons seeking fair terms of cooperation. 
# Accessible. The reasons must be given in public and the content must be understandable to the relevant audience.
# Binding. The reason-giving process leads to a decision or law that is enforced for some period of time. The participants do not deliberate just for the sake of deliberation or for individual enlightenment. 
# Dynamic or Provisional. The participants must keep open the possibility of changing their minds, and continuing a reason-giving dialogue that can challenge previous decisions and laws.

=== Standards of good deliberation - from first to second generation (Bächtiger et al., 2018) ===
For Bächtiger, Dryzek, Mansbridge and Warren, the ideal standards of &quot;good deliberation&quot; which deliberative democracy should strive towards have changed:
==History==

=== Early examples ===

Consensus-based decision making similar to deliberative democracy has been found in different degrees and variations throughout the world going back millennia. The most discussed early example of deliberative democracy arose in Greece as Athenian democracy during the sixth century BC. Athenian democracy was both &quot;deliberative&quot; and largely &quot;direct&quot;: some decisions were made by representatives but most were made by &quot;the people&quot; directly. Athenian democracy came to an end in 322 BC. Even some 18th century leaders advocating for representative democracy mention the importance of deliberation among elected representatives.

=== Recent scholarship ===

The deliberative element of democracy was not widely studied by academics until the late 20th century. According to Professor Stephen Tierney, perhaps the earliest notable example of academic interest in the deliberative aspects of democracy occurred in John Rawls 1971 work &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Joseph M. Bessette has been credited with coining the term &quot;deliberative democracy&quot; in his 1980 work &quot;Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government&quot;, and went on to elaborate and defend the notion in &quot;The Mild Voice of Reason&quot; (1994). In the 1990s, deliberative democracy began to attract substantial attention from political scientists. According to Professor John Dryzek, early work on deliberative democracy was part of efforts to develop a theory of democratic legitimacy. Theorists such as Carne Ross advocate deliberative democracy as a complete alternative to representative democracy. The more common view, held by contributors such as James Fishkin, is that direct deliberative democracy can be complementary to traditional representative democracy. Others contributing to the notion of deliberative democracy include Carlos Nino, Jon Elster, Roberto Gargarella, John Gastil, Jürgen Habermas, David Held, Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann, Noëlle McAfee, Rense Bos, Jane Mansbridge, Jose Luis Marti, Dennis Thompson, Benny Hjern, Hal Koch, Seyla Benhabib, Ethan Leib, Charles Sabel, Jeffrey K. Tulis, David Estlund, Mariah Zeisberg, Jeffrey L. McNairn, Iris Marion Young, Robert B. Talisse, and Hélène Landemore.

Although political theorists took the lead in the study of deliberative democracy, political scientists have in recent years begun to investigate its processes. One of the main challenges currently is to discover more about the actual conditions under which the ideals of deliberative democracy are more or less likely to be realized.

Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt, Shmuel Lederman laments the fact that &quot;deliberation and agonism have become almost two different schools of thought&quot; that are discussed as &quot;mutually exclusive conceptions of politics&quot; as seen in the works of Chantal Mouffe, Ernesto Laclau, and William E. Connolly. Giuseppe Ballacci argues that agonism and deliberation are not only compatible but mutually dependent: &quot;a properly understood agonism requires the use of deliberative skills but also that even a strongly deliberative politics could not be completely exempt from some of the consequences of agonism&quot;.

Most recently, scholarship has focused on the emergence of a &#x27;systemic approach&#x27; to the study of deliberation. This suggests that the deliberative capacity of a democratic system needs to be understood through the interconnection of the variety of sites of deliberation which exist, rather than any single setting. Some studies have conducted experiments to examine how deliberative democracy addresses the problems of sustainability and underrepresentation of future generations. Although not always the case, participation in deliberation has been found to shift participants opinions in favour of environmental positions.

=== Platforms and algorithms ===
Aviv Ovadya also argues for implementing bridging-based algorithms in major platforms by empowering deliberative groups that are representative of the platform&#x27;s users to control the design and implementation of the algorithm. He argues this would reduce sensationalism, political polarization and democratic backsliding. Jamie Susskind likewise calls for deliberative groups to make these kind of decisions. Meta commissioned a representative deliberative process in 2022 to advise the company on how to deal with climate misinformation on its platforms.

=== Modern examples ===

The OECD documented hundreds of examples and finds their use increasing since 2010. For example, a representative sample of 4000 lay citizens used a &#x27;Citizens&#x27; congress&#x27; to coalesce around a plan on how to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

<text>Laura Cecilia Bozzo Rotondo (born August 19, 1951) is a Peruvian talk show hostess, best known for her Spanish-language talk show &quot;Laura&quot; that was broadcast in the United States on the Univision television network.

Bozzo has hosted other talk shows under her name, including &quot;Laura en América&quot;, back in the 1990s to early 2000s. Her talk shows have been compared to the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot; due to the fights that regularly occur as well as the sensitive subject matter routinely discussed. In 2008, a scandal erupted when it was discovered by the Peruvian press, led by important figures such as Jaime Bayly, that some of the shows provided by Bozzo were staged.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bozzo was born in Callao, Peru to engineer Miguel Bozzo Chirichignio and Victoria Luisa Rotondo Mendoza, both of Italian, Spanish, and Quechua descent; She has triple citizenship between Peru, Italy and Mexico. She studied law at Female University of the Sacred Heart and Federico Villarreal National University in Lima, Peru and at Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela receiving degrees in law and political science there and teaching classes within such fields in various universities. In 1987, she became the appointed officer of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura and organized competitions to promote the conservation of the cultural heritage of Peru. In 1992, she became the &quot;regidora&quot; (alderman) of metropolitan Lima.

===Career===
She began in television in 1994 with &quot;Las mujeres tienen la palabra&quot;, a feminist show, on RBC Televisión. In 1997, Laura Bozzo went to Panamericana Televisión and assumed the conductor role of the reality show &quot;Intimidades&quot;. A year later, Bozzo was hired by América Televisión and launched &quot;Laura en América&quot;, this program was very popular in Peru and other countries in the Americas, such as the United States.

In 1998, she organized the organization &quot;Solidaridad de Familia&quot; (Family Solidarity) as a charitable foundation to assist people from Peru and other Latin American nations with legal, medical, and psychological problems; which has been under much criticism for increasing suspicion of being funded by former president Alberto Fujimori.

In February 1998, the American Spanish-language broadcast network Telemundo began broadcasting her show &quot;Laura en América&quot; on its affiliates. The show soon began to be shown all over Latin America. Similar in nature to the American &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot;, it routinely featured guests usually having troubles within their lives, including infidelity. Usually, the show would expose evidence of wrongdoing by the suspect that the guest presents, leading to fighting between guests. The authenticity of the show has been questioned, given the unusually sensational subjects explored. By the end of the year, Bozzo moved to Miami, Florida.

2006, Bozzo&#x27;s RAT contract with Telemundo expired after five years, so she moved her production to Televisa; production of &quot;Laura en America&quot; ended in July 2006. In October 2006, Bozzo appeared on the program &quot;¿Dónde estás corazón?&quot; on the network Antena 3 from Spain, criticizing Alejandro Toledo for causing her arrest.

Just a few days before the one-year anniversary of her release from house arrest, Laura Bozzo was convicted of all the charges against her and was sentenced to four consecutive years in prison. Laura later informed a local television station, Canal 9, that she planned to use a newly enacted law in her favor and sue the Peruvian government.

In January 2007, Bozzo attempted to enter the Spanish TV market through Spain&#x27;s Telecinco, but once some executives saw pilots of the program, a proposal for a new Bozzo show was canceled. On November 6, 2007, her new show &quot;Laura en acción&quot; debuted on Telemundo in the United States. However, in March 2008, lawyer Freddy Escobar started an investigation about the possible illegal use of minors in her program, being exposed on TV to present fake cases of family sex violence. A scandal involving an underage girl who appeared on &quot;Laura en acción&quot; caused the show to be canceled by Peruvian network América Televisión, in which the show originally aired. Telemundo stopped airing the series by the beginning of May 2008.

In June 2009, Laura Bozzo made her television reappearance after her last talk show, &quot;Laura en Acción&quot; was cancelled in April 2008. Bozzo relocated herself in Mexico and started working on many shows on Televisa, the largest Spanish-speaking television network in all the World, but then she went to TV Azteca and hosted the talkshow &quot;Laura de todos&quot; (shortened from &quot;Laura de todos: sin miedo a la verdad&quot;), for two years and a half. Laura Bozzo&#x27;s show aired on Azteca 13 at 17:00 hrs. CT in the country. The show was also televised in the United States, through Azteca America at 20:00 hrs. Laura left the show after having differences with the executives of TV Azteca. Bozzo was replaced by the Mexican television host Rocío Sánchez Azuara with the return of the talk show &quot;Cosas de la vida&quot;. Laura Bozzo returned to Televisa.

She signed a contract for five years with Televisa to make a new show called &quot;Laura&quot; herself and Federico Wilkins were the producers of &quot;Laura&quot;. Wilkins was fired after making up that Laura&#x27;s boyfriend, Argentinian singer Christian Suárez who is 24 years her junior, was cheating on her with Karina Alvarez; Gabriel Vasquez Woodman took over the production. The talk show airs on Canal de las Estrellas network in Mexico. The show premiered on January 24, 2011, at 16:00 hrs the show airs for 1 hour and 30 minutes. (CT), the show also airs on Saturdays at 17 hrs. The show&#x27;s premiere live in Mexico was very successful with 18.9 points in rating and 40.5 in share and on its second day the show reached 19.4 in rating beating its competition. &quot;Laura&quot; started airing in the United States through Telefutura (now UniMás) at 7/6c pm competing with Telemundo&#x27;s Caso cerrado. Although the show was cancelled due to low ratings and other factors in April 2011, Telefutura aired &quot;Laura&quot; again at 2pm/1pm central on October 10, 2011, and since has become such a hit that it airs two hours a day starting at 11pm/10pm pacific.

==Criticism==
In September, 2013, Mexican social media ramped up criticisms against Laura Bozzo through Twitter and Facebook with the hashtags #LauraBozzoFueraDeMexico and #LauraBozzoMexicoNoTeQuiere, for using official State of Mexico government helicopters during a telecast allegedly used for the benefit of her show in order to set dramatic staging for the TV audience, while deferring rescue labors during the relief efforts for Hurricane Manuel. Criticism was sparked on Televisa&#x27;s competitor, MVS networks, by Mexican journalist and noted Televisa detractor Carmen Aristegui&#x27;s recount on the story, first published in the political journal Proceso. This was followed by Bozzo&#x27;s public contest of the allegations. A petition on Change.org has been made by civil group &quot;CREAMOS México A.C.&quot; to elicit her dismissal from Mexican TV.

==Personal life==
Bozzo married lawyer Mario de la Fuente in 1980. The couple had two daughters, Alejandra and Victoria. After 20 years of marriage, they divorced in August 2000. In 2000, Laura Bozzo stirred controversy by starting a relationship with Cristian Zuárez; 24 years her junior and former member of the Argentine musical group Ráfaga ending the relationship in July 2017.

==Legal troubles==
It was reported, in August 2021, that a judge in Mexico ordered Bozzo to be detained after she did not voluntarily appear at a jail to face charges of tax evasion. It is believed that she left Mexico and the Interpol has been asked to help finding her.

<doc id="168926" wikidata="Q51716967" url="?curid=168926" title="Killing of JonBenét Ramsey">
<text>JonBenét Patricia Ramsey (August 6, 1990 – December 26, 1996) was an American child beauty queen who was killed at age six in her family&#x27;s home at 755 15th Street in Boulder, Colorado, on the night of December 25, 1996. Her body was found in the house&#x27;s basement about seven hours after she had been reported missing. She had sustained a fractured skull, and a garrote was tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that JonBenét&#x27;s official cause of death was &quot;asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma&quot;. Her death was ruled a homicide. The case generated worldwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen, had entered JonBenét into a series of child beauty pageants.

The Boulder police initially suspected that a long handwritten ransom note that was reportedly found in the home had been written by Patsy, and that the note and the appearance of JonBenét&#x27;s body had been staged by Patsy and her husband, John Bennett Ramsey, to cover up the killing. In 1999, the police and district attorney (DA) both said that JonBenét&#x27;s brother Burke, who was nine years old at the time of her death, was not a suspect. JonBenét&#x27;s parents gave several televised interviews but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury recommended filing charges against the Ramseys for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation. John and Patsy were also accused of hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had &quot;committed... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death&quot;. However, the DA determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a successful indictment.

In 2002, a new DA took over the investigation from the police and primarily pursued the theory that an intruder had committed the killing. In 2003, trace DNA taken from JonBenét&#x27;s clothes was found to belong to an unknown male; each family member&#x27;s DNA had been excluded from this match. The DA sent the Ramseys a letter of apology in 2008, declaring the family was &quot;completely cleared&quot; by the DNA results. In a 2015 interview former Boulder police chief Mark Beckner said that in his view the perpetrator was the source of the unidentified DNA found on JonBenét’s clothing. In 2009, the Boulder police took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation.

National and international media coverage of the case focused on JonBenét&#x27;s brief beauty pageant career, as well as her parents&#x27; wealth and the unusual evidence found in the case, particularly suggestions of sexual abuse. Media reports questioned how the police had handled the investigation and accused various members of the Ramsey family. Ramsey family members and friends have filed defamation suits against several media organizations. The crime is still considered a cold case and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department with annual updates published on the police department website.

==Life and interment==

JonBenét Patricia Ramsey was born on August 6, 1990, in Atlanta, Georgia, the younger of two children of Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Ramsey (1956–2006) and John Bennett Ramsey (born 1943). She had an older brother named Burke (born 1987). JonBenét&#x27;s first name combines her father&#x27;s first and middle names, and her mother&#x27;s first name was used as her middle name. She was enrolled in kindergarten at High Peaks Elementary School in Boulder, Colorado.

JonBenét&#x27;s body was found on December 26, 1996, in her family&#x27;s Boulder residence. She was buried at St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Georgia, on December 31. JonBenét was interred next to her half-sister Elizabeth Pasch Ramsey, who had died in a car crash nearly five years earlier at age 22.

==Parents==
John Ramsey was a businessman who was the president of Access Graphics, a computer software company that later became a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1978. In 1991, John had moved with Patsy, his second wife, and family to Boulder, where Access Graphics&#x27; headquarters was located.

Patsy Ramsey entered JonBenét in various child beauty pageants, where she won the titles of America&#x27;s Royale Miss, Little Miss Charlevoix, Little Miss Colorado, Colorado State All-Star Kids Cover Girl, and National Tiny Miss Beauty. JonBenét&#x27;s active role in child beauty pageants and Patsy&#x27;s reported &quot;pageant mother&quot; behavior were reported by the media after the murder.

In 1997—approximately six months after JonBenét&#x27;s death—the Ramseys moved to a new home in Atlanta after a summer at their vacation retreat in Charlevoix, Michigan. Patsy died of ovarian cancer at age 49 in 2006; she was interred next to her daughter.

==Evidence==
===Eyewitnesses===
Scott Gibbons, a neighbor, claimed that around midnight, while looking from his kitchen window, he saw the upper kitchen of the Ramsey residence lit up with dimmed lights. Neighbor Melody Stanton reported that she was awoken shortly after midnight by the sound of a child&#x27;s scream coming from the Ramsey residence.

===Ransom note===
Patsy Ramsey reported that she found a two-and-a-half-page handwritten ransom note on the kitchen staircase in their home. The note demanded for JonBenét&#x27;s return. John pointed out to police first on the scene that the amount was nearly identical to his Christmas bonus of the prior year, which suggested that someone who would have access to that information would be involved in the crime. Investigators looked at several theories behind the dollar amount demanded, considering employees at Access Graphics who may have known the amount of John&#x27;s prior bonus. They also considered the possibility that the ransom demand was a reference to Psalm 118 and spoke to religious sources to determine possible relevance.

The ransom note appears to echo film dialogue. The films &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, &quot;Ransom&quot;, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; are considered to be potential sources.

The ransom note was unusually long. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the police that it was very unusual for such a note to be written at the crime scene. The police believed that the note was staged, because it did not have any fingerprints except for Patsy&#x27;s and authorities who had handled it, and because it included an unusual use of exclamation marks and initialisms. The note and a practice draft were written with a pen and notepad from the Ramsey home. According to a Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) report, there were &quot;indications that the author of the ransom note is Patricia Ramsey.&quot; However, the evidence fell short of a definitive conclusion. Michael Baden, a board-certified forensic pathologist, who had consulted with both sides of the case, said he had never seen a note like it in his 60-year experience and that he did not think it was written by an outside stranger.

A federal court ruled it highly unlikely that Patsy wrote the note, citing six certified handwriting experts. The court lamented the existence of self-proclaimed experts—without credentials—trying to enter the case by accusing Patsy without scientific basis.


===911 call and initial search for the child===
The only people known to be in the house on the night of JonBenét&#x27;s death were her immediate family: Patsy and John Ramsey and their son Burke. The ransom note contained specific instructions against contacting police and friends, but Patsy telephoned the police at 5:52 a.m. MST. She also called family and friends. Two police officers responded to the 9-1-1 call and arrived at the Ramsey home within three minutes. They conducted a cursory search of the house but did not find any sign of forced entry.

Officer Rick French went to the basement and came to a door that was secured by an additional wooden latch at the top of the door frame. He paused for a moment in front of the door, but walked away without opening it. French later explained that he was looking for an exit route used by the kidnapper; since the wooden latch was holding the door closed from inside the house, the kidnapper could not have used this door and then closed the latch from the inside, ruling this out as a possible exit. JonBenét&#x27;s body was later found behind the door.

With JonBenét still missing, John made arrangements to pay the ransom. A forensics team was dispatched to the house. The team initially believed that the child had been kidnapped, and JonBenét&#x27;s bedroom was the only room in the house that was cordoned off to prevent contamination of evidence. No precautions were taken to prevent contamination of evidence in the rest of the house. Meanwhile, friends, victim advocates, and the Ramsey family&#x27;s minister arrived at the home to show support. Visitors picked up and cleaned surfaces in the kitchen, possibly destroying evidence. Boulder detective Linda Arndt arrived at about 8:00 a.m. MST, in anticipation of receiving further instructions by the kidnapper(s), but there was never an attempt by anyone to claim the money.

===Discovery of the body===
At 1:00 p.m. MST, Detective Arndt asked John Ramsey and Fleet White, a family friend, to search the house to see if &quot;anything seemed amiss.&quot; They started their search in the basement. John opened the latched door which Officer French had overlooked; his daughter&#x27;s body lay in one of the rooms. JonBenét&#x27;s mouth was covered with duct tape, a nylon cord was found around her wrists and neck, and her torso was covered by a white blanket. John picked up her body and rushed upstairs. When JonBenét was moved, the crime scene was further contaminated, and critical forensic evidence was disturbed for the returning forensics team.

Each of the Ramseys provided handwriting, blood, and hair samples to the police. John and Patsy participated in a preliminary interview for more than two hours, and Burke was also interviewed within the first couple of weeks following JonBenét&#x27;s death.

===Autopsy===
The autopsy revealed that JonBenét was killed by strangulation and a skull fracture. The official cause of death was &quot;asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma.&quot; There was no evidence of conventional rape, although sexual assault could not be ruled out. Although no semen was found, there was evidence that there had been a vaginal injury. Evidence also suggested that the paintbrush used in the garrote was also used for sexual assault. At the time of the autopsy, the pathologist recorded that it appeared her vaginal area had been wiped with a cloth. Her death was ruled a homicide.

A garrote that was made from a length of nylon cord and the broken handle of a paintbrush was tied around JonBenét&#x27;s neck and had apparently been used to strangle her. Part of the bristle end of the paintbrush was found in a tub containing Patsy&#x27;s art supplies, but the bottom third of it was never found despite extensive searching of the house by the police in subsequent days.

The autopsy revealed a &quot;vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple,&quot; which JonBenét had eaten a few hours before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBenét&#x27;s body was found show a bowl of pineapple on the kitchen table with a spoon in it. However, neither John nor Patsy said they remembered putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found Patsy Ramsey&#x27;s fingerprints on the bowl.

===Blood samples===
In December 2003, forensic investigators extracted enough material from a mixed blood sample found on JonBenét&#x27;s underwear to establish a DNA profile. That DNA belonged to an unknown male person, and excluded the DNA of each of the Ramseys. The DNA was submitted to the FBI&#x27;s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a database containing more than 1.6 million DNA profiles, but the sample did not match any profile in the database. In October 2016, a report said that new forensic analysis with more sensitive techniques revealed that the original DNA contained genetic markers from two individuals other than JonBenét.

A. James Kolar, who was a lead investigator for the DA&#x27;s office, said that there were additional traces of male DNA found on the cord and paintbrush that Boulder district attorney Mary Lacy did not mention, and that there were six separate DNA samples belonging to unknown individuals that were found by the test. Former FBI profiler Candice Delong believes that the DNA, having shown up identically in several different places on multiple surfaces, belongs to the killer. Former Adams County, Colorado, District Attorney Bob Grant, who has assisted the Boulder DA&#x27;s office on the case for many years, also believes that the DNA evidence is significant, saying that any resolution of the case would have to explain how the DNA showed up on several pieces of JonBenét&#x27;s clothing. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden said, &quot;Trace amounts of DNA can get on places and clothing from all different, nonsuspicious means. There is no forensic evidence to show that this is a stranger murder.&quot;

==Investigation==
Experts, media commentators, and the Ramseys have identified potential suspects in the case. Boulder police initially focused almost exclusively upon John and Patsy, but by October 1997 had over 1,600 people in their index of persons of interest for the case.

Errors that were made in the initial investigation complicated the resolution of the investigation and applicable theory. Those errors included loss and contamination of evidence, lack of experienced and technical staff on the investigation, evidence shared with the Ramseys, and delayed informal interviews with the parents. Other issues include misleading information intentionally leaked by Boulder Police in hopes of creating public pressure on John and Patsy Ramsey to better cooperate with police interview requests, which contributed to the intense media attention surrounding the family. 

Lou Smit was a detective who came out of retirement in early 1997 to assist the Boulder County District Attorney&#x27;s office with the case. In May 1998, he presented his findings to the Boulder police with other staff members of the DA&#x27;s Office, concluding that the evidence pointed away from the Ramseys. They were unable to successfully challenge the police department&#x27;s belief that the Ramseys were guilty. The DA&#x27;s office sought to take control of the investigation. Due to the animosity between the police and the DA&#x27;s office, and the pressure to obtain a conviction, Colorado governor Roy Romer interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury.

Two of the lead investigators in the case had opposing views. Both Lou Smit and Steve Thomas ultimately resigned—Smit because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis, and Thomas because he believed the DA&#x27;s office had interfered with and failed to support his hypothesis of the case.

A grand jury was convened beginning September 15, 1998, to consider indicting the Ramseys for charges relating to the case. In 1999, the grand jury returned a true bill to charge the Ramseys with placing the child at risk in a way that led to her death, based on the probable cause standard applied in such grand jury proceedings. Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter did not prosecute them, because he did not believe that he could meet the higher standard of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that is required for a criminal conviction.

Mary Lacy, the next Boulder County District Attorney, took over the investigation from the police on December 26, 2002. In April 2003, she agreed with a federal judge who sat on a 2002 libel case that evidence in the suit is &quot;more consistent with a theory that an intruder murdered JonBenét than it was with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did&quot;. On July 9, 2008, the Boulder District Attorney&#x27;s office announced that, as a result of newly developed DNA sampling and testing techniques (touch DNA analysis), the Ramsey family members were excluded as suspects in the case. Lacy publicly exonerated the Ramseys.

On February 2, 2009, Boulder police chief Mark Beckner announced that Stan Garnett, the new Boulder County District Attorney, was turning the case over to his agency, and that his team would resume investigating it. Garnett found that the statute of limitations for the crimes identified in the 1999 grand jury true bill had expired, and did not pursue review of the case against the Ramseys.

In October 2010, the Boulder police reopened the cold case. New interviews were conducted following a fresh inquiry by a committee that included state and federal investigators. Police were expected to use the latest DNA technology in their investigation. There was no new information gleaned from those interviews. It was reported in September 2016 that the investigation into JonBenét&#x27;s death continues to be an active homicide case, per Boulder Police Chief Greg Testa.

In 2015, Beckner disagreed with exonerating the Ramseys, stating, &quot;Exonerating anyone based on a small piece of evidence that has not yet been proved to even be connected to the crime is absurd.&quot; He also stated that the unknown DNA from JonBenét&#x27;s clothing &quot;has got to be the focus of the investigation&quot; at this point in time and that, until one can prove otherwise, &quot;the suspect is the donator of that unknown DNA.&quot; In 2016, Gordon Coombes, a former investigator for the Boulder County District Attorney&#x27;s office, also questioned total absolution of the Ramseys, stating, &quot;We all shed DNA all the time within our skin cells. It can be deposited anywhere at any time for various reasons, reasons that are benign. To clear somebody just on the premise of touch DNA, especially when you have a situation where the crime scene wasn&#x27;t secure at the beginning ... really is a stretch.&quot; Steven E. Pitt, a forensic psychiatrist hired by Boulder authorities, said, &quot;Lacy&#x27;s public exoneration of the Ramseys was a big slap in the face to Chief Beckner and the core group of detectives who had been working on the case for years.&quot;

==Theories and suspects==
There are two primary theories about JonBenét&#x27;s death. In the family-member theory, JonBenét was killed by one or more family members. In the intruder theory, an intruder committed the crime. 

===Family-member theory===
Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon JonBenét&#x27;s parents. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired FBI profiler, &quot;statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it&#x27;s a family member or a care giver&quot; who is involved in the homicide of a child. The police saw no evidence of a forced entry, but they did see evidence of staging of the scene, such as the ransom note. They did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping solve the case. The Ramseys had said that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders, and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to the &quot;Daily Camera&quot;.

John Edward Douglas, a former FBI special agent and a criminal profiler, contends that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter. He was critical of the way the media and the public viewed the case: &quot;Many crimes are tried in the court of public opinion long before they reach a court of law. But I know of no other case in which the majority of people have decided the solution based on statistics. I know of no other case in which the public substantially believes what has been reported in the tabloids. I know of no other case in which the mainline media have let the tabloids take the lead and then reported on their reporting. And I know of no other case in which largely respectable television programs have so tried to outdo each other in sensationalism.&quot;

One theory is that Patsy struck JonBenét in a fit of rage after a bedwetting episode, and strangled her to cover up what had happened after mistakenly thinking she was already dead. However, Patsy did not have a known history of uncontrolled anger. JonBenét&#x27;s brother Burke Ramsey later said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t get spanked, nothing of the sort, nothing close, nothing near laying a finger on us, let alone killing your child.&quot;

Theoretically, the strangulation could have been a red herring to conceal other elements of the assault and killing.

Burke, who was nine years old at the time of JonBenét&#x27;s death, was interviewed by investigators at least three times. The interviews did not raise any concerns. A review by a child psychologist stated that it appeared that the Ramseys had &quot;healthy, caring family relationships&quot;. In 1998, Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner said during an interview with a news reporter that Burke was not involved in the killing of his sister. In May 1999, the Boulder County District Attorney&#x27;s office reiterated that Burke was not a suspect. The investigators had never considered him a suspect.

The Ramseys offered a $100,000 reward in a newspaper ad dated April 27, 1997. Three days later, more than four months after the body of their daughter was found, they submitted for the first time to separate formal interviews at the Boulder County Justice Center.

In 1999, Colorado Governor Bill Owens spoke out, telling the Ramsey couple to &quot;quit hiding behind their attorneys, quit hiding behind their PR firm&quot;.

A Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents. The indictment cited &quot;two counts each of child abuse&quot; and said the parents &quot;did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that posed a threat of injury to the child&#x27;s life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenét Ramsey, a child under the age of sixteen.&quot;

Among the experts who testified in the case were DNA specialist Barry Scheck and forensic expert Henry Lee. On October 13, 1999, district attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient for prosecution. The public thought that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive. In 2002, the statute of limitations on the grand jury&#x27;s charges expired.

The grand jury&#x27;s vote to indict was not revealed publicly until October 25, 2013, when previously sealed court documents were released.

&quot;The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey&quot;, a show broadcast on CBS on September 18 and 19, 2016, used a group of experts to evaluate the evidence. The group theorized that Burke hit his sister in the head with a heavy object (possibly a flashlight) after she stole a piece of pineapple from his bowl, perhaps not intending to kill her. They suggested that the ransom letter was an attempt to cover up the circumstances of JonBenét&#x27;s death. On behalf of Burke Ramsey, his counsel filed defamation lawsuits against CBS, the producers of the program, and several of its participants, based on many of its claims.

===Intruder theory===
The police and the prosecutors followed leads for intruders partly due to the unidentified boot mark left in the basement room where JonBenét&#x27;s body was found. 

Early persons of interest included neighbor Bill McReynolds; Chris Wolf, a local reporter whose then-girlfriend reported him as a suspect; family housekeeper Linda Hoffmann-Pugh; and a man named Michael Helgoth, who died in an apparent suicide shortly after JonBenét&#x27;s death. Hundreds of DNA tests were performed to find a match to the DNA recovered during her autopsy. In a 2003 defamation lawsuit related to the case (&quot;Wolf v. Ramsey&quot;), involving the Ramseys publicly identifying an early suspect in the case, Judge Julie E. Carnes wrote: 
:[T]here is virtually no evidence to support [Wolf&#x27;s] theory that [the Ramseys] murdered their child, but abundant evidence to support their belief that an intruder entered their home at some point during the night of December 25, 1996, and killed their daughter.

Lou Smit, a detective in the case, assessed the evidence and concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. On the night JonBenét was killed, there had been two windows that were left slightly open to allow for electrical cords for the outside Christmas lights to pass through, a broken basement window, and one unlocked door. Smit&#x27;s theory was that someone entered the Ramsey home through the broken basement window. Critics have questioned this theory, because there was an intact cobweb in the basement window. The steel grate that covered the window also had undisturbed cobwebs, and the foliage around the grate had been undisturbed. There were also cobwebs in the tracks of various windows, and dust and debris were on some sills. Smit believed that the intruder subdued JonBenét using a stun gun and took her down to the basement. JonBenét was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit&#x27;s theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. Believing that the Ramseys were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, five days after the grand jury was convened against the Ramseys. While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010.

Author Stephen Singular in his book &quot;Presumed Guilty&quot; (1999, revised 2016) refers to consultations with cyber-crime specialists to argue JonBenét attracted the attention of child pornographers and pedophiles affiliated with the child pageant scene. Singular further believes the investigation was overly focused on the Ramsey parents, hampering investigation into alternate scenarios, and the Ramseys were not responsible for the murder other than perhaps unwittingly exposing their daughter to sexual predators. Singular speculates this scenario explains why the grand jury did not recommend indicting the Ramsey parents for murder, but for child abuse or endangerment for placing their daughter in a risky situation.

It was determined that there had been more than 100 burglaries in the Ramseys&#x27; neighborhood in the months before JonBenét&#x27;s murder. There were 38 registered sex offenders living within a radius of the Ramseys&#x27; home. In 2001, former Boulder County prosecutor Trip DeMuth and Boulder County Sheriff&#x27;s Detective Steve Ainsworth stated that there should be a more aggressive investigation of the intruder theory.

One of the individuals whom Smit identified as a suspect was Gary Howard Oliva, who was arrested for &quot;two counts of attempted sexual exploitation of a child and one count of sexual exploitation of a child&quot; charges in June 2016, according to Boulder&#x27;s &quot;Daily Camera&quot;. Oliva, a registered sex offender, was publicly identified as a suspect in an October 2002 episode of &quot;48 Hours Investigates&quot;.

In &quot;The Killing of JonBenét: The Truth Uncovered&quot;, broadcast by A&amp;E on September 5, 2016, DNA and forensic scientist expert Lawrence Kobilinsky stated that, based on forensic DNA analysis of evidence, &quot;an unidentified male committed this crime&quot;.

The District Attorney&#x27;s office investigating pedophiles indicated to former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman that the District Attorney&#x27;s office followed the intruder theory. The Ramseys developed a relationship with District Attorney Mary Lacy and her office, which was criticized by authorities such as the city&#x27;s mayor, Leslie L. Durgin. Silverman said, &quot;Once you have conceded the possibility of an intruder, I don&#x27;t see how any Ramsey could ever be successfully prosecuted.&quot; Gordon Coombes joined the office as an investigator under Lacy when they were testing JonBenét&#x27;s clothing for touch DNA. He also said that Lacy strongly supported the intruder theory and talked about it with the staff. Although he was not directly involved with the case, he said he was told not to voice opposition to the theory because he might lose his job. &quot;It just seemed weird the whole premise of ... this attempt to influence the entire agency,&quot; he stated.

==Karr confession==
John Mark Karr, a 41-year-old school teacher, was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, on August 15, 2006, following a false confession to murdering JonBenét. Karr claimed to have drugged, sexually assaulted, and accidentally killed JonBenét. According to CNN, &quot;Authorities also said they did not find any evidence linking Karr to the crime scene.&quot;

In the confession, Karr had provided only basic facts that were publicly known and failed to provide any additional convincing details. The claim that JonBenét was drugged cast further doubt on the confession because the autopsy indicated no drugs were found in her body. Furthermore, Karr&#x27;s DNA did not match DNA found on JonBenét&#x27;s body.

==Defamation lawsuits==
L. Lin Wood, the Ramsey family libel attorney, filed defamation lawsuits against several people and companies that had reported on the case, starting in 1999. The family sued &quot;Star&quot; magazine and its parent company, American Media, Inc., on their son&#x27;s behalf in 1999. Defamation suits have been filed by the Ramseys and their friends against several unnamed media outlets. A defamation suit was filed in 2001 against the authors and publisher of &quot;JonBenét: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation&quot; (2000). The suit against Don Davis, Steven Thomas, and St. Martin&#x27;s Press was settled out of court the following year.

John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two defamation lawsuits arising from the publication of their book, &quot;The Death of Innocence&quot; (2001). These suits were brought by two persons named in the book who were said to have been investigated by Boulder police as suspects in the case. The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer. They obtained the dismissal of both lawsuits. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes later concluded that &quot;abundant evidence&quot; in the murder case pointed to an intruder having committed the crime.

In November 2006, Rod Westmoreland, a friend of John Ramsey, filed a defamation suit against an anonymous web surfer using the pseudonym &quot;undertheradar&quot; who had posted two messages on Internet forums implicating Westmoreland in the murder.

During a September 2016 interview with CBS Detroit and in &quot;The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey&quot; documentary television program, forensic pathologist Werner Spitz accused Burke Ramsey of killing his sister. On October 6, 2016, Burke filed a defamation lawsuit against Spitz. Burke and his attorneys, who include Lin Wood, sought a total of $150 million in punitive and compensatory damages. Wood said he would also file a suit against CBS at the end of October 2016.

On December 28, 2016, Burke Ramsey&#x27;s lawyers filed an additional civil lawsuit that accused CBS, the production company Critical Content LLC, and seven experts and consultants of defamation of character. They sought $250 million in compensatory damages and $500 million in punitive damages.

In January 2018, a judge denied the CBS motion to dismiss, and the suit was allowed to proceed. In January 2019, Wood announced that the lawsuit had been settled &quot;to the satisfaction of all parties.&quot;

==Dramatizations==
JonBenét has been portrayed by Dyanne Iandoli in the miniseries &quot;Perfect Murder, Perfect Town&quot; (2000); by Julia Granstrom in the TV movie &quot;Getting Away with Murder: The JonBenet Ramsey Story&quot; (2000); by Payton Lepinski in Lifetimes &quot;Who Killed Jonbenet&quot; (2016); and Emily Mitchell in an upcoming untitled Paramount+ limited series.

<doc id="168927" wikidata="Q1939923" url="?curid=168927" title="Somatic cell nuclear transfer">
<text>In genetics and developmental biology, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory strategy for creating a viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell. The technique consists of taking a denucleated oocyte (egg cell) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic (body) cell. It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal. In January 2018, a team of scientists in Shanghai announced the successful cloning of two female crab-eating macaques (named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua) from foetal nuclei.

&quot;Therapeutic cloning&quot; refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine; this approach has been championed as an answer to the many issues concerning embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use, though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are.

==Introduction==
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. After the somatic cell transfers, the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote. The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The first mammal to be developed by this technique was Dolly the sheep, in 1996.

== Early 20th-Century ==
Although Dolly is generally recognized as the first animal to be cloned using this technique, earlier instances of SCNT exist as early as the 1950s. In particular, the research of Sir John Gurdon in 1958 entailed the cloning of &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; utilizing the principles of SCNT. In short, the experiment consisted of inducing a female specimen to ovulate, at which point her eggs were harvested. From here, the egg was enucleated using ultra-violet irradiation to disable the egg&#x27;s pronucleus. At this point, the prepared egg cell and nucleus from the donor cell were combined, and then incubation and eventual development into a tadpole proceeded. Gurdon&#x27;s application of SCNT differs from more modern applications and even applications used on other model systems of the time (i.e., &quot;Rana pipiens&quot;) due to his usage of UV irradiation to enucleate the egg instead of using a pipette to remove the nucleus from the egg.

==Process==

The process of somatic cell nuclear transfer involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it &#x27;deprogrammed.&#x27; What is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the &#x27;empty&#x27; ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell&#x27;s nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, the single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.

Conventional SCNT requires the use of micromanipulators, which are expensive machines used to accurately manipulate cells. Using the micromanipulator, a scientist makes an opening in the zona pellucida and sucks out the egg cell&#x27;s original nucleus using a pipette. They then make another opening to a different pipette to inject the donor nucleus. Alternatively, electric energy can be applied to fuse the empty egg cell with a donor cell containing a nucleus.

An alternative technique called &quot;handmade cloning&quot; was described by Indian scientists in 2001. This technique requires no use of a micromanipulator and has been used for the cloning of several livestock species. Removal of the nucleus can be done chemically, by centrifuge, or with the use of a blade. The empty egg is glued to the donor cell with phytohaemagglutinin, then fused using electricity. (If a blade is used, two fusion steps would be required: the first fusion is between the donor and an empty half-egg, the second between the half-size &quot;demi-embryo&quot; and another empty half-egg.)

==Applications==

===Stem cell research===
Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo. These cells genetically matched the donor organism from which they came. This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research.

Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos, leading scientists to seek alternative methods of obtaining pluripotent stem cells, SCNT is one such method.

A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient&#x27;s particular disease. By doing so, an &quot;in vitro&quot; model could be created, would be useful for studying that particular disease, potentially discovering its pathophysiology, and discovering therapies. For example, if a person with Parkinson&#x27;s disease donated their somatic cells, the stem cells resulting from SCNT would have genes that contribute to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition.

Another application of SCNT stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient. The resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor, thus avoiding any complications from immune system rejection.

Only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using SCNT techniques in human stem cell research. In the United States, scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the University of California San Francisco, the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Stemagen (La Jolla, CA) and possibly Advanced Cell Technology are currently researching a technique to use somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce embryonic stem cells. In the United Kingdom, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has granted permission to research groups at the Roslin Institute and the Newcastle Centre for Life. SCNT may also be occurring in China.

Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies a problem in the human cell&#x27;s ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success.

A research group from the Oregon Health &amp; Science University demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum&#x27;s nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, enucleation negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability.

Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed trophectoderm. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum&#x27;s nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like. This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC.

In April 2014, an international research team expanded on this break through. There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells. Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed. Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors aged 35 and 75, indicating that age does not impede a cell&#x27;s ability to be reprogrammed.

Late April 2014, the New York Stem Cell Foundation was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells. One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic. The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation. When injected into mice, cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed. The most significant of these cells, were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone. These insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics, demonstrating real SCNT stem cell therapeutic potential.

The impetus for SCNT-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into pluripotent stem cells were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based stem cell research: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell using only the yamanaka factors will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. Recent studies indicate however that changes to the epigenetic memory of iPSCs using small molecules can reset them to an almost naive state of pluripotency. Studies have even shown that via tetraploid complementation, an entire viable organism can be created solely from iPSCs. SCNT stem cells have been found to have similar challenges. The cause for low yields in bovine SCNT cloning has, in recent years, been attributed to the previously hidden epigenetic memory of the somatic cells that were being introduced into the oocyte.

===Reproductive cloning===

This technique is currently the basis for cloning animals (such as the famous Dolly the sheep), and has been proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries. Most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.

There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease. This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents. A father providing a sperm cell, one mother providing the egg nucleus, and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell.

In 2018, the first successful cloning of primates using somatic cell nuclear transfer, the same method as Dolly the sheep, with the birth of two live female clones (crab-eating macaques named &quot;Zhong Zhong&quot; and &quot;Hua Hua&quot;) was reported.

===Interspecies nuclear transfer===
Interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer being used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT cloning which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, Robert Lanza was able to produce a cloned fetus of a gaur, &quot;Bos gaurus&quot;, combining it successfully with a domestic cow, &quot;Bos taurus&quot;.

In 2017, the first cloned Bactrian camel was born through iSCNT, using oocytes of dromedary camel and skin fibroblast cells of an adult Bactrian camel as donor nuclei.

==Limitations==

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can be inefficient due to stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus. This can result in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos, giving it a measly 0.3% efficiency. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. Millie, the offspring that survived, took 95 attempts to produce. Because the procedure was not automated and had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. Another reason why there is such high mortality rate with the cloned offspring is due to the fetus being larger than even other large offspring, resulting in death soon after birth. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. Another limitation is trying to use one-cell embryos during the SCNT. When using just one-cell cloned embryos, the experiment has a 65% chance to fail in the process of making morula or blastocyst. The biochemistry also has to be extremely precise, as most late term cloned fetus deaths are the result of inadequate placentation. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with cloning pigs and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day.

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell&#x27;s genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell&#x27;s mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT-derived tissues and organs for therapy, as there may be an immuno-response to the non-self mtDNA after transplant. Additionally, the genes found in the mitochondria’s genome need to communicate with the cell’s genome and a failure of somatic cell nuclear reprogramming can lead to non communication to the cell’s genome causing SCNT to fail. 

Epigenetic factors play an important role in the success or failure of SCNT attempts. The varying gene expression of a previously activated cell and its mRNAs may lead to overexpression, underexpression, or in some cases non functional genes which will affect the developing fetus. One such example of epigenetic limitations to SCNT is regulating histone methylation. Differing regulation of these histone methylation genes can directly affect the transcription of the developing genome, causing failure of the SCNT. Another contributing factor to failure of SCNT includes the X chromosome inactivation in early development of the embryo. A non coding gene called XIST is responsible for inactivating one X chromosome during development, however in SCNT this gene can have abnormal regulation causing mortality to the developing fetus.

==Controversy==

Nuclear transfer techniques present a different set of ethical considerations than those associated with the use of other stem cells like embryonic stem cells which are controversial for their requirement to destroy an embryo. These different considerations have led to some individuals and organizations who are &quot;not&quot; opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about, or opposed to, SCNT research.

One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction, or its prohibition.

A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human egg cells, which can only be obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients. Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient&#x27;s own DNA, thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment. For example, to treat a man with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor, creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient&#x27;s own cells. (There would be differences. For example, the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor. In comparison, his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother.)

Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy, and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line. Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through assisted reproductive technology. Therefore, healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients. It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from.

Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyper-ovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyper-ovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.

To address the problem of creating a human egg market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs. If successful, human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines. However, this technology may be a long way off.

==Policies regarding human SCNT==
SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the United Kingdom, having been incorporated into the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Permission must be obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in order to perform or attempt SCNT.

In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law. However, in 2002, a moratorium on United States federal funding for SCNT prohibits funding the practice for the purposes of research. Thus, though legal, SCNT cannot be federally funded. American scholars have recently argued that because the product of SCNT is a clone embryo, rather than a human embryo, these policies are morally wrong and should be revised.

In 2003, the United Nations adopted a proposal submitted by Costa Rica, calling on member states to &quot;prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.&quot; This phrase may include SCNT, depending on interpretation.

The Council of Europe&#x27;s &quot;Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine&quot; and its &quot;Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being&quot; appear to ban SCNT of human beings. Of the Council&#x27;s 45 member states, the &quot;Convention&quot; has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The &quot;Additional Protocol&quot; has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14.

<doc id="168929" wikidata="Q458629" url="?curid=168929" title="Billy Elliot">
<text>Billy Elliot is a 2000 British coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Daldry and written by Lee Hall. Set in County Durham in North East England during the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike, the film is about a working-class boy who has a passion for ballet. His father objects, based on negative stereotypes of male ballet dancers. The film stars Jamie Bell as 11-year-old Billy, Gary Lewis as his father, Jamie Draven as Billy&#x27;s older brother, and Julie Walters as his ballet teacher.

Adapted from a play called &quot;Dancer&quot; by Lee Hall, development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was chosen for the role. Filming began in the North East of England in August 1999. Greg Brenman and Jon Finn served as producers, while Stephen Warbeck composed the film&#x27;s score. &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is a co-production among BBC Films, Tiger Aspect Pictures and Working Title Films.

The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, and began a wider theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2000 by Universal Pictures through United International Pictures. &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the 54th British Academy Film Awards, the film won three of thirteen award nominations. Jamie Bell became the youngest winner of Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film also earned three nominations at the 73rd Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

In 2001, the film was adapted as a novel by Melvin Burgess. The story was also adapted for the West End stage as &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot;, first produced in 2005. It opened in Australia in 2007 and on Broadway in New York City in 2008.

== Plot ==
In 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on strike (the latter being the union delegate). His maternal grandmother lives with them; she has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and had once aspired to be a professional dancer.

Billy&#x27;s father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is being used temporarily as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unbeknownst to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet classes. But, passionate about dancing, he secretly continues his lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.

Sandra believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the Royal Ballet School in London, but due to Tony&#x27;s arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Sandra tells Jackie about the missed opportunity but, fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.

Over Christmas, Billy learns his best friend, Michael, is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy and Michael dancing in the gym, and realizes his son is truly passionate. Although stunned at first, he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Sandra tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to cross the picket line to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money, and Jackie pawns Billy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.

Although very nervous, Billy performs well. He punches another boy in frustration at the audition, and fears that he has ruined his chances. He is rebuked by the review board and, when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, struggles for words. He says that it is &quot;like electricity&quot;. Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners&#x27; strike, and Billy leaves home to study in London.

In 1998, 25-year-old Billy performs as the Swan in Matthew Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; with Jackie, Tony, and Michael watching from the audience. As Billy takes the stage, his father is overcome with emotion while the other dancers watch from the wings.

==Cast==
==Production==

=== Development ===
Lee Hall developed &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; from his play &quot;Dancer&quot;, which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the Live Theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was heavily influenced by photographer Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen&#x27;s book &quot;Step by Step&quot;, about a dancing school in nearby North Shields. Writing in 2009, Hall said that &quot;almost every frame of &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; was influenced by &quot;Step by Step&quot; [...] as every member of the design team carried around their own copy.&quot;

Hall met with director Stephen Daldry, who was working at the Royal Court Theatre at the time. At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, &quot;I liked the emotional honesty of &quot;Billy Elliot.&quot; Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there&#x27;s a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner&#x27;s strike itself.&quot; Working Title Films approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer. The BBC financed the project.

=== Casting ===
Thousands of boys were considered for the lead role. The producers were looking for a boy in a specific geographical area with a dance background. Jamie Bell had about seven auditions in total before eventually in mid-1999, it was announced that he would play the lead role in the film. Peter Darling, the film&#x27;s choreographer, worked with Bell for &quot;eight hours a day for three months, finding out what drove him as a dancer.&quot; Julie Walters accepted the role of Sandra Wilkinson. Walters called the script &quot;moving&quot;, explaining, &quot;It was a diamond in the sand [...] I loved the character, and the fact that she was disappointed on every level possible. She was so grim and jaded. Her relationship with the boy was so unusual&quot;.

In preparation for filming, Gary Lewis met with miners which he said was beneficial. Lewis stated that his own personal experience of the miners&#x27; strike made the role enjoyable. &quot;My family and I were very active in supporting the miners: I stood in picket lines, I raised money for the miners and I was involved in the whole campaign to stop [...] closing the pits. Basically, it was the state that launched a complete attack on a section of the work force, a section of the working class. Lots of people responded with solidarity and that was a key element in the script: solidarity working at different levels, the collective solidarity, the economic solidarity.&quot;

===Filming===

Principal photography lasted seven weeks, beginning in August 1999. Most of the film, including the interior of the Elliot home at 5 Alnwick Street, was shot on location in the Easington Colliery area, with the producers using over 400 locals as extras. The mining scenes were filmed at the Ellington and Lynemouth Colliery in Northumberland, with some filming in Dawdon, Middlesbrough and Newcastle upon Tyne. Andrew Street and Alnwick Street, where the characters live, were two of several streets demolished in 2003 after becoming derelict. The cemetery scene was filmed at Lynemouth Cemetery. School scenes were filmed in Langley Park Primary School. Other filming locations include the Green Drive Railway Viaduct in Seaham, Tees Transporter Bridge, New Wardour Castle and Theatre Royal in Haymarket.

Daldry remarked in an interview: &quot;The shooting schedule was a nightmare; we only had seven weeks. Kids can only work nine to five and you can&#x27;t work Saturdays. And the kid had to dance the whole time. So it was tight.&quot; Producer Jon Finn spoke of the difficulties of seeking filming locations: &quot;We didn&#x27;t realise how hard it would be to find working pits.&quot;

==Music==

Stephen Warbeck scored the incidental music for the film. Polydor Records released the soundtrack on 11 March 2002, which includes several well-known glam rock and punk songs from T. Rex and The Clash. The soundtrack also contains pieces of dialogue from the film.

==Reception and legacy==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Billy Elliot&quot; premiered on 19 May at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival under the title &quot;Dancer&quot;. It was later decided to re-title the film &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, another film at Cannes that year. &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; was theatrically released on 29 September 2000 in the United Kingdom by Universal Pictures through United International Pictures. In the United States, Universal Focus released the film on 13 October 2000. Against expectations, the film grossed $109,280,263 worldwide, including $24 million in the United Kingdom and $22 million in the United States and Canada. Universal Home Entertainment released &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; on VHS on 20 April 2001, and on Blu-ray on 10 January 2012. The Blu-ray includes a short documentary of the film&#x27;s production.

=== Critical response ===

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 119 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Billy Elliot&quot; is a charming movie that can evoke both laughter and tears.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling the film &quot;as much parable and fantasy as it is realistic&quot;. He said Bell&#x27;s performance was &quot;engaging&quot;, Lewis was &quot;convincing&quot; and Walters was &quot;spirited and colourful&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film saying, &quot;This is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour and a lot of heart. Daldry&#x27;s direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall distinguish themselves further in the discreet, intelligent way ... &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; has a freshness that makes it a pleasure to watch; it&#x27;s a very emphatic success&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; also praised the cast, writing, &quot;Relationships between all the characters are well observed—the father and his sons, the two brothers, and Billy and his grandmother, his friend Michael and jaded Mrs. Wilkinson—all of them yielding sweet, unforced feel-good moments&quot;. Rooney also praised the cinematography, visuals and soundtrack in showing Billy&#x27;s rebelliousness. Charlotte O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote the cast are &quot;near perfect&quot;, adding the film is &quot;as raw a slice of escapism as you could wish for&quot;. William Gallagher from the BBC gave the film five out of five stars, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s a simple tale but one that is extremely well told and acted. Fittingly for a story about dance, it doesn&#x27;t put a foot wrong and is engrossing, funny, very sad, very moving and very uplifting.&quot;

Some critics gave a mixed response. &quot;Timeout&quot; magazine believes that &quot;Daldry overuses the dance as a metaphor for escape and frustration, and choreographer Peter Darling&#x27;s grandstanding ballet numbers sit a little uneasily, given the realist comedy pitch&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that there were &quot;patches of thinness and predictability&quot;, and that &quot;the first half seems to acknowledge its own triteness&quot;. However, he compliments the pacing of the scenes and the actors who &quot;inhabit their roles like second-hand suits&quot;. Mark Holcomb, writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, took issue with the &quot;odd, unsuccessful mix of theatrical whimsy and social realism&quot;, and a dance scene which he describes as a &quot;cringe-inducing &#x27;80s-style music video routine&quot;.

=== Themes ===
Poverty and social class have been seen as major themes of the film. Author Rebecca Mahon observed the film has a realistic setting; the early scenes emphasising the miners&#x27; strike, the death of Billy&#x27;s mother and the family&#x27;s financial situation. Daldry adds, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter where you are in the world, people understand the idea that you&#x27;re part of an industrial, working class group that is being discarded. And its question—of what happens to communities devastated by de-industrialisation and privatisation&quot;. In addition to social class, Daldry states that the film is about finding a voice—&quot;someone trying to express himself or herself&quot;. Koller-Alonso writes that gender differences are expressed by showing girls attending ballet classes, while their male counterparts are having boxing lessons. Homosexuality, a taboo subject in the 1980s, as well as police brutality are depicted and explored in the film.

===Accolades===
==Stage musical==

After the film&#x27;s release, English singer-songwriter Elton John collaborated with the film&#x27;s screenwriter Lee Hall to produce a musical adaptation of the film, which premiered 31 March 2005 at the Victoria Palace Theatre on the West End. Many of the film&#x27;s crew took part in the stage production, including director Stephen Daldry and choreographer Peter Darling. The musical received positive reviews and ran for over 4,000 performances before closing in April 2016.

The musical ran on Broadway from November 2008 to January 2012, and won ten Tony Awards in 2009, including Best Musical.

<doc id="168931" wikidata="Q845799" url="?curid=168931" title="Tomboy">
<text>Tomboy is a term referring to girls or young women with masculine traits. It may include wearing androgynous or unfeminine clothing and engaging in physical sports or other activities and behaviors traditionally associated with boys or men.

==Origins==

The word &quot;tomboy&quot; is a compound word which combines &quot;tom&quot; with &quot;boy&quot;. Though this word is now used to refer to &quot;boy-like girls&quot;, the etymology suggests the meaning of tomboy has changed drastically over time.

In 1533, according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;, &quot;tomboy&quot; was used to mean a &quot;rude, boisterous or forward boy&quot;. By the 1570s, however, &quot;tomboy” had taken on the meaning of a &quot;bold or immodest woman&quot;, finally, in the late 1590s and early 1600s, the term morphed into its current meaning: &quot;a girl who behaves like a spirited or boisterous boy; a wild romping girl.&quot;

==History==

=== In the United States ===

==== 19th century ====

Before the mid-19th century, femininity was equated with emotional fragility, physical vulnerability, hesitation, and domestic submissiveness, commonly known as the &quot;Cult of True Womanhood&quot;. Under the influence of this ideal of femininity, women did not engage in strenuous sports or any physical activity. This paradigm remained stagnant until the mid-nineteenth century. During the Long Depression of the late 1800s, the US&#x27;s increasing economic instability made fragile femininity no longer desirable. Young women joined the workforce to support their families and learn practical job skills, and thus a more robust physique was needed to support the physical demands of job practices. This led to the paradigm shift in people&#x27;s expectations of young women from languishing, decorative beauty to vigorously healthy, thus laying the groundwork for tomboyism.

In Charlotte Perkin Gilman&#x27;s 1898 book, &quot;Women and Economics&quot;, the author lauds the health benefits of being a tomboy, that girls should be &quot;not feminine till it is time to be&quot;. Joseph Lee, a playground advocate, wrote in 1915 that a &quot;tomboy phase&quot; was crucial to physical development of young girls between the ages of 8 and 13. Coupled with the birth of first wave feminism and the US&#x27;s depressed economy, tomboyism amongst young girls emerged because the young girls&#x27; parents permitted or even promoted the tomboy upbringing due to the decaying economy and the American turbulent political climate.

==== Late 19th century and Civil War ====

During the American Civil War, American society fully realized the importance of healthy women. When hostilities of the North and South broke out and thousands of men fled to the battlefield, many adolescent girls and young women were pushed to be responsible for tasks that would be traditionally considered in the men&#x27;s realm. Women who had not been allowed to have independent bank accounts were now expected to take care of the finances. American wives, mothers, and young girls who used to rely on the men in the household for security now had the duty of protecting their homes from the enemy. As a result, mothers focused on improving the physical constitution of their daughters while taking care of their own. Many women who had subscribed to the Cult of True Womanhood before the Civil War found themselves engaging in an array of masculine actions during it. Women being given the duties of men during the period of Civil War encouraged tomboyism.

==== 20th century: Second wave feminism ====
While first wave feminism mainly focused on women&#x27;s suffrage, second wave feminism expanded the discussion of gender inequality in areas such as sexuality, family dynamics, workspace, and laws in relation with patriarchy and culture. With the main purpose of critiquing the patriarchal system, this movement opened avenues for women in education, employment, and legal protection against domestic violence. 

==== Late 20th century ====

In the late 20th century, the term tomboy describes girls who wear unfeminine clothing, actively engage in physical sports, and embrace what are often known as &quot;boy toys&quot; such as cars, or other activities usually associated with boys. The term is used less frequently than before in the West mainly because it is now a societal norm for adolescent girls to engage in physical activities, play with peers of the same and opposite gender, and wear comfortable clothing.

==== Beginning 21st century ====
Sebastian Zulch of &quot;Bustle&quot; argued that since the term tomboy implicitly associates a behavior to masculine gender and reminds the societal expectation for girls, its use could be considered condescending and sexist.

==Psychobehavioral aspects==
=== Child development ===

Tomboy can be seen as a phase of gender presentation in adolescence. Some parents might be concerned by the lack of femininity in their child but the tomboy phase is, in fact, crucial to physical development between the ages of 8 and 13, according to Joseph Lee, the playground movement advocate in 1915. Some girls start to embrace femininity as age increases while some persist to be tomboys in adulthood.

Psychologists speculate that childhood tomboy behavior results from a young child&#x27;s innate curiosity combined with family dynamics and imposed societal gender roles and behavioral customs. The preference of athletics and masculine clothing can be explained by adolescent tomboys&#x27; curiosity about outdoors and physical games, by which comfortable clothing such as pants and jersey helps to facilitate their physical engagement. A 2002 study suggests that some girls are &quot;born tomboys&quot; because of the higher testosterone levels of the mother during pregnancy. Being a childhood tomboy does not determine one&#x27;s sexual orientation or life-long gender presentation. 

===Gender roles===

The idea that there are girl activities and clothing, and that there are boy activities and clothing, is often reinforced by the tomboy concept. Tomboyism can be seen as both refusing gender roles and traditional gender conventions, but also conforming to gender stereotypes. The concept may be considered outdated or looked at from a positive viewpoint. Feminine traits are often devalued and unwanted, and tomboys often respond to this viewpoint. This can be due in part to an environment that desires and only values masculinity, depending on the decade and geographical region. Idealized masculinity is atop the hegemony and sets the traditional standard, and is often upheld and spread by young children playing with one another. Tomboys may view femininity as having been pushed on them, which results in negative feelings toward femininity and those who embrace it. In this case, masculinity may be seen as a defense mechanism against the harsh push toward femininity, and a reclaiming of agency that is often lost due to sexist ideas of what girls are and are not able to do.

In western culture, tomboys are expected to one day cease their masculine behavior, usually during or right before puberty, return to feminine behavior, and are expected to embrace heteronormativity. Tomboys who do not do such are occasionally stigmatized, usually due to homophobia. Barbara Creed argues that the tomboy&#x27;s &quot;image undermines patriarchal gender boundaries that separate the sexes&quot;, and thus is a &quot;threatening figure&quot;. This &quot;threat&quot; affects and challenges the idea of what a family must look like, generally nuclear independent heterosexual couplings with two children.

Gender scholar Jack Halberstam argues that while the defying of gender roles is often tolerated in young girls, adolescent girls who show masculine traits are often repressed or punished. However, the ubiquity of traditionally female clothing such as skirts and dresses has declined in the Western world since the 1960s, where it is generally no longer considered a male trait for girls and women not to wear such clothing. An increase in the popularity of women&#x27;s sporting events (see Title IX) and other activities that were traditionally male-dominated has broadened tolerance and lessened the impact of &quot;tomboy&quot; as a pejorative term. Sociologist Barrie Thorne suggested that some adult women take pride in describing their childhood selves as tomboys, &quot;as if to suggest: I was (and am) independent and active; I held (and hold) my own with boys and men and have earned their respect and friendship; I resisted (and continue to resist) gender stereotypes&quot;.

In the Philippines, tomboys are masculine-presenting women who have relations with other women, with the other women tending to be more feminine, although not exclusively, or transmasculine people who have relationships with women; the former appears more common than the latter. Women who engage in romantic relationships with other women, but who are not masculine, are often still deemed heterosexual. This leads to more invisibility for those that are lesbian and feminine. Scholar Kale Bantigue Fajardo argues for the similarity between &quot;tomboy&quot; in the Philippines and &quot;tombois in Indonesia&quot;, and &quot;toms in Thailand&quot; all as various forms of female masculinity. In China, tomboys are called &quot;假小子&quot; (Pinyin: jiáxiǎozi), which literally translates as &quot;pseudo-boy&quot;. This term is largely used as a derogatory term to describe those girls with masculine characteristics. Most of the times calling someone a &quot;假小子&quot; is a humiliation which implies that the individual could not find a boyfriend. This largely reduces the value of women to only romance and diminishes girls&#x27; confidence in working in what is traditionally defined as the &quot;boy&#x27;s realm.&quot;

===Sexual orientation===
====Association of tomboyism with lesbianism====

During the 20th century, Freudian psychology and backlash against LGBT social movements resulted in societal fears about the sexualities of tomboys, and this caused some to question whether tomboyism leads to lesbianism. Throughout history, there has been a perceived correlation between tomboyishness and lesbianism. For instance, Hollywood films would stereotype the adult tomboy as a &quot;predatory butch dyke&quot;. Lynne Yamaguchi and Karen Barber, editors of &quot;Tomboys! Tales of Dyke Derring-Do&quot;, argue that &quot;tomboyhood is much more than a phase for many lesbians&quot;; it &quot;seems to remain a part of the foundation of who we are as adults&quot;. Many contributors to &quot;Tomboys!&quot; linked their self-identification as tomboys and lesbians to both labels positioning them outside &quot;cultural and gender boundaries&quot;. Psychoanalyst Dianne Elise&#x27;s essay in 1995 reported that more lesbians noted being a tomboy than straight women.

==== Misconception ====
While some tomboys later reveal a lesbian identity in their adolescent or adult years, behavior typical of boys but displayed by girls is not a true indicator of one&#x27;s sexual orientation. With raising female liberation and gender-neutral playgrounds (at least in the US) in the 21st century, an increasing number of girls could technically be considered &quot;tomboys&quot; without being referred to as &quot;tomboys&quot; because it is considered normal for girls to engage in physical activities, play equally with boys, and wear pants, masculine or gender-neutral clothing. The association between lesbianism and tomboyism is not only outdated but can also be disrespectful to both heterosexual women and lesbians.

==Representations in media==
Tomboys in fictional stories are often used to contrast a more girly and traditionally feminine character. These characters are also often the ones that undergo a makeover scene in which they learn to be feminine, often under the goal of getting a male partner. Usually with the help of the more girly character, they transform from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan, ignoring past objectives and often framed in a way that they have become their best self. Doris Day&#x27;s character in the 1953 film &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; is one example of this. Tomboy figures who do not eventually go on to conform to feminine and heterosexual expectations often simply remain in their childhood tomboy state, eternally ambiguous. The stage of life where tomboyism is acceptable is very short and rarely are tomboys allowed to peacefully and happily age out of it without changing and without giving up their tomboyness.

Tomboyism in fiction often symbolizes new types of family dynamics, often following a death or another form of disruption to the nuclear family unit, leading families of choice rather than a descent. This provides a further challenge to the family unit, including often critiques of socially who is allowed to be a family – including critiques of class and often a women&#x27;s role in a family. Tomboyism can be argued to even begin to normalize and encourage the inclusion of other marginalized groups and types of families in fiction including, LGBT families or racialized groups. This is all due to the challenging of gender roles, and assumptions of maternity and motherhood that tomboys inhabit.

Tomboys are also used in patriotic stories, in which the female character wishes to serve in a war, for a multitude of reasons. One reason is patriotism and wanting to be on the front lines. This often ignores the many other ways women were able to participate in war efforts and instead retells only one way of serving by using one&#x27;s body. This type of story often follows the trope of the tomboy being discovered after being injured, and plays with the particular ways bodies get revealed, policed and categorized. This type of story is also often nationalistic, and the tomboy is usually presented as the hero that more female characters should look up to, although they still often shed some of their more extreme ways after the war.

<doc id="168932" wikidata="Q381157" url="?curid=168932" title="Orrin Hatch">
<text>Orrin Grant Hatch (March 22, 1934 – April 23, 2022) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Utah from 1977 to 2019. Hatch&#x27;s 42-year Senate tenure made him the longest-serving Republican U.S. senator in history, overtaking Ted Stevens, until Chuck Grassley surpassed him in 2023.

Hatch chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005. On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, he became president pro tempore of the Senate. He was chair of the Senate Finance Committee from 2015 to 2019, and led efforts to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

== Early life and education ==
Orrin Grant Hatch was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He was the son of Jesse Hatch (1904–1992), a metal lather, and his wife Helen Frances Hatch (née Kamm; 1906–1995). Hatch had eight brothers and sisters, two of whom died during infancy. Hatch was profoundly affected by the loss of his older brother Jesse, a U.S. Army Air Forces nose turret gunner with the 725th Bombardment Squadron who was killed on February 7, 1945, when the B-24 he was aboard was shot down over Austria.

Hatch, who grew up in poverty, was the first in his family to attend college; he attended Brigham Young University and earned a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1959. He also fought 11 bouts as an amateur boxer. In 1962, Hatch received a Juris Doctor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Hatch has stated that during law school, he and his young family resided in a refurbished chicken coop behind his parents&#x27; house. Hatch worked as an attorney in Pittsburgh and moved to Utah in 1969, where he continued to practice law.

== Elections ==

In 1976, in his first run for public office, Hatch was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democrat Frank Moss, a three-term incumbent. Hatch criticized Moss&#x27;s 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying, &quot;What do you call a Senator who&#x27;s served in office for 18 years? You call him home.&quot; Hatch ran on the promise of term limits and argued that many senators, including Moss, had lost touch with their constituents.
In 1982, Hatch won re-election, defeating Ted Wilson, the mayor of Salt Lake City, by 17 points. He defeated Brian Moss (Frank Moss&#x27; son) by 35 points in 1988 and was re-elected in 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2012.
In 2000, Hatch campaigned for the Republican Party nomination for president. After finishing last in the Iowa caucuses, Hatch withdrew his candidacy on January 27, 2000, and endorsed the eventual winner George W. Bush.

=== 2012 Senate election ===

After the defeat of Utah&#x27;s Senator Bob Bennett in 2010, conjecture began as to whether six-term Senator Hatch would retire in 2012. It was also speculated that Congressman Jason Chaffetz would run against Hatch, though Chaffetz would later decline. In January 2011, Hatch announced his campaign for re-election. Later, nine other Republicans, including former State Senator Dan Liljenquist and then-State Legislator Chris Herrod, declared campaigns for U.S. Senator.

Having elected state delegates in mid-March, both the Democratic and Republican parties held conventions on April 21, with the possibilities to determine their nominees for the November general election. At the Republican convention, Hatch failed to get the 60% vote needed to clinch the Republican nomination, so he faced Liljenquist (the second-place finisher) in the June 26 primary. Hatch won the primary easily. It was Hatch&#x27;s first primary competition since his election in 1976. The Democratic convention chose former state senator and IBM executive Scott Howell as the Democratic Party candidate. Hatch defeated Howell, receiving 65.2% of the vote to Howell&#x27;s 30.2%.

=== 2016 presidential endorsements ===
In the 2016 presidential election, Hatch originally supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and later endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio once Bush ended his campaign. On May 12, 2016, after Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Hatch endorsed him. On May 27, 2016, after Trump suggested that a federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, Hatch said: &quot;From what I know about Trump, he&#x27;s not a racist but he does make a lot of outrageous statements ... I think you can criticize a judge but it ought to be done in a formal way&quot; and said that Trump&#x27;s statements were not so inappropriate that he would rescind his support. On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy, Hatch described Trump&#x27;s comments as &quot;offensive and disgusting&quot; and said that &quot;[there] is no excuse for such degrading behavior. All women deserve to be treated with respect.&quot; Hatch maintained his endorsement of Trump&#x27;s candidacy.

== U.S. Senate tenure ==

Hatch took office as a U.S. senator on January 3, 1977. He chaired the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987. He also served as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.

In September 1989, Hatch was one of nine Republican senators appointed by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole to negotiate a dispute with Democrats over the financing of President George HW
Bush&#x27;s anti-drug plan that called for spending $7.8 billion by the following year as part of the president&#x27;s efforts to address narcotics nationwide and abroad.

Hatch long expressed interest in serving on the United States Supreme Court. It was reported that he was on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s short list of candidates to succeed Lewis F. Powell Jr. on the Supreme Court, but was passed over at least in part because of the Ineligibility Clause. Despite that, he vocally supported Robert Bork, who was nominated for the vacancy instead.
Hatch &quot;worked across the aisle to pass landmark legislation, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program&quot;. During the 1991 confirmation hearings regarding the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas, Hatch &quot;famously defended Thomas ... by reading aloud from &quot;The Exorcist&quot; to suggest Anita Hill lifted details of her sexual harassment allegations from the horror book&quot;.

On January 3, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in, Hatch became President pro tempore of the Senate.

Hatch was absent from the 2017 Inauguration Day festivities. At the request of President-elect Donald Trump, he agreed to serve as designated survivor during the inauguration and was kept at a secure, undisclosed location.

On December 25, 2017, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; published an editorial entitled &quot;Why Orrin Hatch is Utahn of the Year&quot;. The newspaper described its criteria for the designation as &quot;Utahn of the Year&quot; as &quot;the Utahn who, over the past 12 months, has done the most. Has made the most news. Has had the biggest impact. For good or for ill.&quot; The editorial criticized Hatch for his role in the size reduction of the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and accused him of lacking integrity.

Hatch announced on January 2, 2018, that he would retire from the Senate instead of seeking re-election that November. Hatch retired from the Senate on January 3, 2019, having served there for 42 years. At the time of his retirement announcement, he was the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Utah history (having eclipsed previous record-holder Reed Smoot in 2007), the longest-serving Republican U.S. Senator in the history of Congress, and also one of the longest-serving Republican members of Congress in the history of the United States. In the latter distinction, Hatch was surpassed in length of service by fellow senators Ted Stevens and Strom Thurmond, who joined the Republican Party in 1964, and was later surpassed by Chuck Grassley and Don Young.

=== Political positions and votes ===
====Abortion====
Hatch was strongly opposed to abortion and is the author of the Hatch Amendment proposed to the U.S. Constitution, which states that there is no constitutional right to abortion and would empower the states to restrict abortion as they see fit.

==== Anti-terrorism ====

In 1995, Hatch was the leading figure behind the Senate&#x27;s anti-terrorism bill, to a large extent a response to the Oklahoma City Bombing. Elements of the bill were criticised by the Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee on civil liberties grounds, especially the new limits imposed on habeas corpus in capital cases.

As a senior member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, Hatch was also instrumental in the 2008 extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He said, &quot;This bipartisan bill will help defeat terrorism and keep America safe. No, the legislation is not perfect, but it ensures that the increased expansion of the judiciary into foreign intelligence gathering doesn&#x27;t unnecessarily hamper our intelligence community.&quot;

==== Bailouts ====
Hatch voted in favor of the 2008 legislation that established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In 2011, Hatch said that he &quot;probably made a mistake voting for it&quot;, and also claimed &quot;at the time, we were in real trouble and it looked like we were ready for a depression. I believe we would have gone into a depression.&quot;
He voted against the renewal of TARP in 2009, and the renewal was voted down by 10 votes in the Senate.

Hatch voted in favor of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The bill authorized $300 billion to guarantee mortgages and restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

==== Balanced budget amendment ====
Hatch was a longtime advocate of amending the United States Constitution to require that total spending of the federal government for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts.

During his time in the Senate, Hatch sponsored a balanced budget amendment 17 times—4 times as lead sponsor and 13 times as a co-sponsor. He also voted in favor of passing a Balanced Budget Amendment on at least nine occasions. Hatch&#x27;s proposed amendment passed the House of Representatives in 1997, but failed to pass the Senate by the required two-thirds majority by one vote to move on the states for ratification.

==== Bank of Credit and Commerce International ====
In January 1990, the federal judge in a case against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) accepted a 1989 plea bargain offered to the bank by the U.S. Department of Justice. The bank was to pay $15 million in fines and only admit that it had laundered drug money. Afterward, Hatch presented an impassioned defense of the bank in a speech on the Senate floor. It had been largely written for him by the bank&#x27;s attorney Robert Altman. Hatch said, &quot;The case arose from the conduct of a small number of B.C.C.I.&#x27;s more than 14,000 employees.&quot; Since 1989, Hatch and his aide, Michael Pillsbury, had been involved in efforts to counter the negative publicity that surrounded the bank. Hatch had also solicited the bank to approve a $10 million loan to a close friend, Monzer Hourani. In 1991, B.C.C.I. was shut down after regulators accused it of one of the biggest international financial frauds in history. Law enforcement officials accused the bank of making bribes throughout the third world to arrange government deposits. Clark Clifford, a former presidential advisor and Defense Secretary, and Altman, his law partner, were charged with taking bribes from B.C.C.I., in exchange for concealing its illegal ownership of First American Bankshares, a Washington holding company which Clifford chaired. Both had denied the charges, which were filed in New York State and Federal courts. In 1992, in a &quot;Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate&quot;, prepared by committee members, U.S. Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and Hank Brown (R-CO), noted that a key strategy of &quot;BCCI&#x27;s successful secret acquisitions of U.S. banks in the face of regulatory suspicion was its aggressive use of a series of prominent Americans,&quot; Clifford amongst them. The relationship with Hourani included the receipt of campaign contributions laundered through his employees, for which Hourani was fined $10,000, as well as his purchase of 1,200 CDs of Hatch&#x27;s songs, for which Hatch received $3 to $7 each, and the management of a blind trust for Hatch. These led to a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, by which Hatch was eventually cleared.

==== Health care reform ====
Hatch opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Hatch argued that the insurance mandate found in the legislation was not in the category that can be covered by the interstate commerce clause since it regulates the decision to engage in commercial activity rather than regulating the activity itself. He therefore regarded the Act as unconstitutional. NPR called Hatch a &quot;flip-flopper&quot; on this issue since in 1993 Hatch co-sponsored a bill along with 19 other Senate Republicans that included an individual insurance mandate as a means to combat healthcare legislation proposed by New York Senator Hillary Clinton. In 2018, Hatch said that Obamacare supporters were &quot;the stupidest, dumbass people I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;.

Hatch was one of the first senators to suggest that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and promised to work on dismantling it when he becomes the Finance Committee Chairman. Hatch was part of the group of 13 senators drafting the Senate version of the AHCA behind closed doors.
In 2003, Hatch supported the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan known as Medicare Part D. Responding to criticism of the legislation during the 2009 debate on health care reform, Hatch said that in 2003 &quot;it was standard practice not to pay for things&quot; and that although there was concern at the time about increasing the deficit, supporting the bill was justified because it &quot;has done a lot of good&quot;.

On March 25, 2014, Hatch cosponsored the Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act of 2014 in the Senate. The bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children Program through FY2019. The bill would authorize appropriations of about $20 million in 2015 and $101 million over the 2015–2019 period. Hatch argued that &quot;children require specialized medical care, and that specialized care comes with unique challenges. The EMSC program helps ensure that some of our country&#x27;s most vulnerable have access to the care they need, and I&#x27;ve been proud to support it all these years.&quot;

==== Immigration ====
Hatch was one of the architects and advocates of the expansion of H-1B visas and has generally been an advocate of tougher enforcement immigration policy including voting for 1,500 new law enforcement agents to patrol the United States&#x27; borders. His 2010 Immigration Bill titled Strengthening Our Commitment to Legal Immigration and America&#x27;s Security Act has received the support of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). He also proposed the DREAM Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, who were children when their parents came to the United States.

Hatch critiqued President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from seven Muslim countries until better screening methods are devised. He reflected on his own family&#x27;s immigration history and described the order as placing &quot;unnecessary burdens&quot; on families.

==== Judicial nominations ====

As ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Hatch fought hard to get conservative judges nominated to the Supreme Court. He took a leading role in the Senate confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas in October 1991. He was also a strong supporter of Jay Bybee during Bybee&#x27;s confirmation hearings for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people around and a lot of judges and I don&#x27;t know of anybody who has any greater qualifications or any greater ability in the law than you have.&quot;

Nevertheless, in 1993, Hatch recommended Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom he knew personally, to President Bill Clinton to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, even as he knew she was a political liberal. Clinton had not previously considered Ginsburg, and Hatch, as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, assured him that a Ginsburg confirmation would go smoothly. Ginsburg was ultimately confirmed 96–3 in the Senate.

With regards to the Senate filibuster being used to stall President Barack Obama&#x27;s judicial appointments, Hatch voted against the November 2013 reforms, which eliminated the use of the filibuster on executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the Supreme Court. In September 2014, Hatch argued that the filibuster should be restored, saying: &quot;We should get it back to where it was. You can see the destruction that has happened around here.&quot; In November 2014, after the Republicans retook control of the Senate following the 2014 elections, Hatch wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that &quot;if Republicans re-establish the judicial-nomination filibuster, it would remain in place only until the moment that a new Democratic majority decided that discarding the rule again would be useful&quot; and called for &quot;the next Republican president to counteract President Obama&#x27;s aggressive efforts to stack the federal courts in favor of his party&#x27;s ideological agenda&quot; by nominating conservative judges.

As an opponent of the confirmation of Merrick Garland, Hatch submitted to the &quot;Deseret News&quot; an opinion piece stating that, after meeting with Garland, his opinion on blocking Garland had not changed; the piece was published prior to Hatch&#x27;s meeting with Garland. On March 13, 2016, regarding the nomination of Supreme Court candidates by Obama, Hatch stated &quot;a number of factors have led me to conclude that under current circumstances the Senate should defer the confirmation process until the next president is sworn in.&quot;

==== Intellectual property ====
Hatch was long a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights and in 1997 introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act. Hatch believed that intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators.

Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003, by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that &quot;This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.&quot; In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch&#x27;s official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that &quot;We&#x27;ve had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.&quot; Shortly after the publication of that story in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, the company that runs Hatch&#x27;s website contacted Milonic to start registration.

On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA). This bill would authorize the United States Department of Justice to blacklist and censor all websites that the department deemed to be dedicated to &quot;infringing activities&quot;.

==== LGBT rights ====
&quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; reported that in 1977, Hatch told students from the University of Utah, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to see homosexuals teaching school anymore than I&#x27;d want to see members of the American Nazi Party teaching school.&quot; Hatch supported the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.

In 2012, Hatch recommended and supported District Court Judge Robert Shelby, a Barack Obama appointee, though Utah Senator Mike Lee voted against him in the Judiciary Committee. In 2013 Shelby overturned Utah&#x27;s ballot Amendment 3, which constitutionally defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

In April 2013, Hatch stated that he viewed same-sex marriage as &quot;undermining the very basis of marital law&quot;, but declined to support a Federal Marriage Amendment and endorsed same-sex couples&#x27; right to form a civil union, stating that the law should &quot;give gay people the same rights as married people&quot;. Later that same year, Hatch voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, legislation creating protected classes for those identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. In 2018, Hatch &quot;honored Pride&quot; by giving a speech in support of programs to help and serve LGBT youth.

==== Nuclear testing ====
During Hatch&#x27;s first year in the Senate in 1977, reporter Gordon Eliot White of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; published the first of what would be a lengthy series of articles detailing government malfeasance in atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs at the Nevada Test Site. Over the next 13 years White&#x27;s articles detailed how the government determined to proceed with the tests, and with mining and refining, without adequate safeguards for innocent citizens whose health would be damaged. Though Hatch feared an investigation would endanger the nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrence versus the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, by 1979 he was pushing for hearings on the issue before the Senate Labor Committee. Hatch prevailed on Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy to hold field hearings in Utah in 1980. At the end of 1980, Hatch was positioned to chair the committee himself.

By 1984, Hatch had held a dozen hearings, passed legislation requiring scientific investigation of the injuries, and enlisted the aid of the National Science Foundation and National Cancer Institute, but still could not muster the votes to get a bill passed. When a vote was obtained in the Senate in 1985 (as an amendment to a bill to compensate affected Pacific Islanders for nuclear tests in the 1950s), it failed by a handful of votes. Hatch discovered a clause in the proposed Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Kiribati and Tuvalu to pay at least $100 million to residents of the Marshall Islands for injuries similar to those of Utahns, and Hatch took the treaty hostage. His hold on consideration of the treaty eventually got agreement from the Reagan administration to agree not to oppose radiation compensation for Utah citizens, but it still took another five years to get the bill through. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 provided compensation for citizens injured by radioactive fallout from the tests.

In December 2010, Hatch was one of twenty-six senators who voted against the ratification of New Start, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

==== Opioid crisis ====

Hatch introduced the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, narrowing the broad authority of the DEA to suspend drug &quot;manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers&quot;. Hatch stated the bill was also written to protect patients from disruptions in the production and delivery of their prescription drugs, saying that ...&quot;The fact that prescription drugs can be abused should not prevent patients from receiving the medications they need. This bill takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse by clarifying penalties for manufacturing or dispensing outside approved procedures while helping to ensure that supply chains to legitimate users remain intact&quot;. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and Tom Marino passed a version of the bill in the House. It was then signed by President Barack Obama.

Critics of the bill claim the new law fuels the opioid crisis by limiting the DEA&#x27;s ability to halt production and distribution by predatory drug companies. DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney II wrote in the Marquette Law Review that ...&quot;At a time when, by all accounts, opioid abuse, addiction and deaths were increasing markedly, this new law imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency&#x27;s authority. It is now all but logically impossible for the DEA to suspend a drug company&#x27;s operations for failing to comply with federal law.&quot; Donald Trump&#x27;s Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was &quot;dubious&quot; about the law when it passed and joined 44 state attorneys general calling for &quot;repeal or amendment of the law to restore some of the DEA&#x27;s authority.&quot; Jim Geldhof, a former DEA program manager who spent 43 years with the DEA called the bill &quot;outrageous. It basically takes any kind of action DEA was going to do with a distributor or manufacturer as far as an immediate suspension off the table. And then the other part of that really infuriates me is that corrective action plan.&quot; Mulrooney compared the corrective action plan to one that would &quot;allow bank robbers to round up and return inkstained money and agree not to rob any more banks—all before any of those wrongdoers actually admit fault and without any consequence that might deter such behavior in the future.&quot;

Hatch responded to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; investigation into the bill by writing a &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion article calling the investigation &quot;misleading&quot; and asking to &quot;leave conspiracy theories to Netflix&quot;. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a co-sponsor of the senate bill, also defended the bill: &quot;This bill was drafted in consultation with the DEA to offer better guidance for companies working to safely and responsibly supply prescription drugs to pharmacies, and to promote better communication and certainty between companies and regulators.&quot; Republican Pat Toomey expressed doubts that a conspiracy existed, but still suggested amending the bill: &quot;I&#x27;m a little surprised that it passed unanimously in both houses, was signed by President Obama and got no opposition from the DEA at the time. That&#x27;s not the way controversial legislation usually ends up, but hey, if there&#x27;s problems, then we ought to revisit them.&quot;

Hatch received $177,000 in donations from the drug industry while pushing the bill through and has received $2,178,863 from the Pharmaceuticals/Health Products industry from 1989 to 2014 according to required filings by the Federal Election Commission.

==== Religious freedom ====
Hatch was the main author of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which protected all religions&#x27; right to build church facilities on private property. In 2010, Hatch defended the right of a private organization to build a mosque on private property in downtown Manhattan, citing this law and defense of the freedom of religion.

==== Presidential Medal of Freedom ====

On November 16, 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Hatch the highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==== Other issues ====
Hatch sponsored the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which &quot;all but eliminated government regulation of the dietary and herbal supplements industry.&quot; The bill has resulted in the unregulated sale of supplements with misleading labeling that have no beneficial health effects at all, or may have adverse health effects. It was intended to enable the marketing of quack medicine.

In 1999, Hatch called for a federal probe into manufacturers of violent video games, and proposed making the existing voluntary rating system for video games (ESRB) mandatory by federal law.

Hatch pushed legislation for the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment, which would amend Article 2, Section I, Clause 5 of the United States Constitution. This amendment would allow anyone who has been a U.S. citizen for twenty years to seek the presidency or vice-presidency.

A vocal supporter of stem cell research, Hatch was one of 58 senators who signed a letter directed to President George W. Bush, requesting the relaxing of federal restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. In 2010, Hatch&#x27;s bill was reauthorized which allowed stem cells from umbilical cords to be used to find treatment options.

In June 2013, Hatch commented on a G8 proposal that tax authorities in the world&#x27;s largest economies openly share information among themselves in order to fight tax evasion. The proposal has strong suggestions about ways to make companies more transparent and governments more accountable for their tax policies. Hatch stated that transparency is always a good thing, but he would like to see a bill before giving any support.

In 2017, Hatch was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Hatch received over $470,000 from oil, gas, and coal interests from 2012 on.

In 2018, over the Judge Brett Kavanaugh U.S. Supreme Court controversy, Hatch said that it did not matter even if Kavanaugh did what his accusers alleged was true. Hatch said, &quot;If that was true, I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today. That&#x27;s the issue. Is this judge a really good man? And he is. And by any measure he is.”

Hatch voted for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1999, saying &quot;committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office ... This great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes. But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up. Any other citizen would be prosecuted for these crimes.&quot; In 2018, in the wake of court filings that implicated President Trump in campaign finance violations and in attempting to buy the silence of women who alleged affairs with Trump, Hatch said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care, all I can say is he&#x27;s doing a good job as president.&quot;

In April 2018, Hatch was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and acting U.S. Secretary of State John Sullivan expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; over a report by the United Nations exposing &quot;North Korean sanctions evasion involving Russia and China&quot; and asserting that the findings &quot;demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue, tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people&quot; while calling it &quot;imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by President Assad and his forces, and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement.&quot;

=== Lobbying ties ===
Hatch&#x27;s son Scott Hatch was formerly a partner and registered lobbyist at Walker, Martin &amp; Hatch LLC, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm. The firm was formed in 2001 with Jack Martin, a staff aide to Hatch for six years, and H. Laird Walker, described as a close associate of the senator. In March 2003, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the firm was formed with Hatch&#x27;s personal encouragement and that he saw no conflict of interest in working on issues that involved his son&#x27;s clients. In 2009, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that Hatch said &quot;My son, Scott, does not lobby me or anyone in my office&quot;.

In March 2009, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that the pharmaceutical industry, which has benefited from Hatch&#x27;s legislative efforts, had previously unreported connections to Hatch. In 2007, five pharmaceutical companies and the industry&#x27;s main trade association, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), donated $172,500 to the Utah Families Foundation—a charitable foundation which Hatch helped start in the 1990s and continued to support. Walker, Martin &amp; Hatch LLC was paid $120,000 by PhRMA in 2007 to lobby Congress on pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration legislation. Hatch and his son also had close ties to the dietary supplement industry, which Hatch deregulated in 1994.

=== Electoral history ===























== Personal life ==
Hatch married Elaine Hansen on August 28, 1957. They had six children. In January 2024, his son, Brent, declared his candidacy to replace Mitt Romney as a United States Senator for Utah in the 2024 election.

Hatch was a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although he was born in Pennsylvania, his parents had been raised in Utah and he had ancestors who were members of the LDS Church in Nauvoo, Illinois. Hatch served as a Latter-day Saint missionary in what was called the &quot;Great Lakes States Mission&quot; essentially covering large parts of Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. Hatch later served in various positions in the church, including as a bishop.

Hatch was a founder and co-chair of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative lawyers.

Hatch served as a member of the board of directors of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In a 1996 interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Hatch said he wears a mezuzah necklace in order to remind himself that another Holocaust should never be allowed to occur.

Despite their political differences, Hatch was a longtime friend of fellow senator Ted Kennedy, spoke at his memorial service in 2009, and publicly suggested Kennedy&#x27;s widow, Victoria Reggie, as a replacement for Kennedy in the Senate.

===Death===
Hatch died in Salt Lake City on April 23, 2022, aged 88, from complications of a stroke he had the week prior. He was buried in Newton.

== Musical career and film appearances ==
Hatch played the piano, violin, and organ. Fueled by his interest in poetry, Hatch composed songs for many artists. One of his songs, &quot;Unspoken&quot;, went platinum after appearing on &quot;WOW Hits 2005&quot;, a compilation of Christian pop music. He co-authored &quot;Everything And More&quot;, sung by Billy Gilman. In addition to serving as a United States senator, Hatch earned over $10,000 as an LDS musical recording artist.

Hatch appeared as himself, alongside Chuck Grassley, in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s 2000 Oscar-winning drama &quot;Traffic&quot;, in a brief cameo in a scene set during a Washington, D.C. cocktail party. Soderbergh later featured one of Hatch&#x27;s songs, 
&quot;Souls Along The Way,&quot; in his film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 12&quot; as background music for a scene in Hatch&#x27;s home state of Utah.

Hatch and Janice Kapp Perry co-wrote the song &quot;Heal Our Land&quot;, which was performed at George W. Bush&#x27;s January 2005 inauguration.

Hatch, along with Lowell Alexander and Phil Naish, composed the 2006 song &quot;Blades Of Grass And Pure White Stones&quot;.

<text>Jūrmala (; &quot;seaside&quot;) is a state city in the Vidzeme region of Latvia, about west of Riga. Jūrmala is a resort town stretching and is sandwiched between the Gulf of Riga and the Lielupe River. It has a stretch of white-sand beach and is the fifth-largest city in Latvia.

While Latvia was under Soviet occupation, Jūrmala was a favorite holiday-resort and tourist destination for high-level Communist Party officials, particularly Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev. Although many amenities such as beach-houses and concrete hotels remain, some have fallen into disrepair. Jūrmala remains a tourist attraction with long beaches facing the Gulf of Riga and romantic wooden houses in the Art Nouveau style.

== Names and administrative history ==
The name Jūrmala stems from Latvian &quot;jūra&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;) and &quot;mala&quot; (&quot;edge&quot;, &quot;side&quot;, &quot;margin&quot;), thus &quot;seaside&quot; in English.

In 1920, soon after Latvian independence, the town of Rīgas Jūrmala (&quot;Seaside of Riga&quot;) was established. In German, it became known as Rigasche Strand and Riga-Strand (Beach of Riga), and advertised as part of &quot;Baltische Riviera&quot; (the Baltic Riviera)

During World War II, Jūrmala lost its autonomy, and by 1946, it was a district of Riga. In 1949, this district was enlarged to include Priedaine. Finally, in 1959, the district of Jūrmala was removed from the city of Riga and merged with the health resorts Sloka and Ķemeri to establish Jūrmalas pilsēta (City of Jūrmala). In publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as &quot;Yurmala&quot;, a back-transliteration from Russian &quot;Юрмала&quot;.

As a result of the administrative territorial reform of Latvia in 2009, Jūrmala became one of the republican cities of Latvia (&quot;Republikas pilsētas&quot;), and is currently (2011) the fifth largest by population. The republican cities were replaced with state cities (&quot;Valstspilsētas&quot;) after the 2021 administrative reform.

==History==

The city of Jūrmala actually consists of a string of small resorts. From west to east, these include Ķemeri, Jaunķemeri, Sloka, Kauguri, Vaivari, Asari, Melluži, Pumpuri, Jaundubulti, Dubulti, Majori, Dzintari, Bulduri and Lielupe and others.
Jūrmala&#x27;s reputation as a spa destination began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Wealthy landowners began the tradition of relaxing at the seaside, and Russian army officers came here to rest after the Napoleonic Wars, returning later with their families. The peak of the Jūrmala area&#x27;s development was the opening of the Riga - Tukums railway in 1877 (which still passes through Jūrmala) that gave a great boost to the numbers of visitors, and thus a boost to the development of the town as a resort. Jūrmala also gained a reputation as a health spa. The sea breeze, pine aroma, mineral springs, and sandy beach encouraged many sanatoriums to develop within the city.

In Soviet times Jūrmala was popular with the Communist officials because of its beach and sanatoriums - holidays were also given as rewards for top union members. It became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the whole Union. The spas offered facilities from mud baths to riding therapy and hiking in the woods. In summer there are many concerts.

Whereas Riga has advanced rapidly to embrace and cater for growing numbers of Western tourists, Jūrmala has lagged behind. Russians are now subject to strict visa requirements and its beaches have yet to attract significant numbers of Europeans, leaving the tourist industry with a hard task on its hands. However, during the past few years, Jūrmala has started to recover. Many Russian celebrities, successful businessmen and others buy houses near the beach, and a variety of festivals and other activities attract increasing crowds each summer. At the moment, Jūrmala has almost resumed the popularity that it had with the Soviet elite.

The main beach at Majori and another at Bulduri now bear blue eco-flags signalling the sea is clean and safe to swim in, and the Latvian Academy of Science boasts a hotel for its members in the town. There is also the Midsummer Festival in June, celebrating the longest day of the year. The &quot;Jaunais Vilnis&quot; New Wave (competition) music festival showcases the latest music from all over Europe. The Lonely Planet guide to the region states that it is one of the highlights of Latvia.

==Architecture==

The most distinguishing architectural feature in Jūrmala is the prevalence of wooden houses dating from the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were built by Baltic German and Latvian architects, but there are also works of Russian, Finnish and other architects. Jūrmala&#x27;s architecture typically falls into classicism, national romanticism, and modern styles. The town has an official list of 414 historical buildings under protection, as well as over 4,000 wooden structures.. Dubulti Station is an example of sculptural concrete shell Modernist architecture.
==Geography==

===Beach===

Jūrmala&#x27;s beach is long, covered with white quartz sand. The shallow coastal waters are suitable and safe for children. The beach is equipped with playgrounds, small benches, football fields and volleyball courts, as well as descents for prams and wheelchairs. In spring and autumn amber pieces can be found on the beach.

Each region&#x27;s beach has its own character. In Majori and Bulduri, where the Blue Flag flies, it is possible to rent water bicycles or relax in the beach cafe. In Dubulti and Dzintari competitions in beach football and volleyball take place, but on Pumpuri beach there is kite surfing and windsurfing.

International water sports contests, including rowing, sailing, and waterskiing that take place on the river Lielupe.

===Climate===
Jūrmala has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) closely bordering on a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), because it is on the coast of the Baltic Sea.
==Tourist attractions==
===Līvu Akvaparks===

Līvu Akvaparks in Jūrmala is one of the largest water amusement parks in Northern Europe. The 3 floors of Līvu Akvaparks include more than 20 slides, more than 10 pools of various depths and sizes, attractions for children, a SPA complex with 4 saunas, cold pool, salt chamber, bubble baths and air and underwater massage facilities. The park&#x27;s area is 11,000m2, but in summers an additional 7 000m2 becomes available to visitors, bringing the total area to 18 000m2 making this the largest closed-type water park in Northern Europe that operates throughout the year. It opened for visitors on 30 December 2003, after almost 2 years of construction and at a cost of more than 16 million euros. Each year it receives 300,000 visitors, of which roughly 45% are Latvians.

===Ķemeri National Park===

Ķemeri National Park () is a national park west of the city of Jūrmala, Latvia. Established in 1997, Ķemeri is the third largest national park in the country by area, covering an area of 381.65 km2. The territory of the park is mostly occupied by forests and mires, the most significant of them being The Great Ķemeri Bog (). The Great Kemeri Bog Boardwalk is a popular tourist destination in Ķemeri National Park, Latvia, offering visitors a chance to explore the bog and its inhabitants. A small boardwalk arc (1.4 km) and a great boardwalk arc (3.4 km) is present, with an observation platform that is a popular place with photographers for sunrise and sunset scenes in Latvia, regardless of the season or weather.

===Jomas Street===
Jomas street () is one of the central and oldest streets of Jūrmala, which during its existence has undergone various changes and transformations. Most of the street is a walking boulevard closed to vehicle traffic, and is populated with restaurants, bars, souvenir booths, fruit stalls and a small shopping complex containing a cinema.

===Dzintari Forest Park===

The Dzintari Forest Park () is located near the centre of Jūrmala, with 200 year old pine groves surrounding the park. For leisure there are walkways that weave within the park connecting a skate park, 3 children playgrounds, a cafe, a roller-skate path (with skiing available in winter), basketball courts and a free-to-enter watchtower.

The Dzintari watchtower at 33.5 meters high, soars past the pine trees with a large viewing platform at the top allowing tall distant objects to be seen such as the Riga Radio and TV Tower. Throughout the entire height of the watchtower a total of 12 platforms are formed, overlooking all directions.

It also includes a paid obstacle course in the trees with 5 routes and a 250m zip line.

===Jūrmala Open Air Museum and Ragakapa Nature Park===
Jūrmala Open Air Museum () located east of Bulduri celebrates the cities fishing heritage. A fisherman&#x27;s court has been set up, and its nearly 2,000 exhibits portray the fishermen&#x27;s work and life in Jūrmala in the 19th and 20th centuries. Nearby Ragakāpa Nature Park (), this is a natural 800 m long and 100 m wide dune formed out of wind-activity, with viewing platforms and an eco-trail present.

===Lielupe===
The 116 km long river Lielupe flows within Jūrmala. It is popular amongst canoeists and kayakers as Lielupe flows through and connects populated municipalities including Bauska, Mežotne, Jelgava, Kalnciems and Riga. In addition waterskiing, fishing, boat cruising and taking summer ferry trips are popular.

===Ķemeri Sanatorium===

Ķemeri hotel (sanatorium) building () is one of the most prominent neo-attraction examples in Latvian architecture. In 1936, President Kārlis Ulmanis officially opened one of the most prestigious buildings in Latvia at the time, Hotel &quot;Ķemeri&quot; with 100 comfortable rooms and a luxurious hall. The building was designed by Latvian architect Eižens Laube and was built by public funds.

After World War II, it was transformed into a sanatorium with 300 beds for treating problems with nervous systems, as well as patients with joint, bones and musculoskeletal and gynaecological diseases from the Soviet republics with a very wide range of health resorts and medical services. After the restoration of Latvia&#x27;s independence, the building was privatised and its reconstruction started, but the project has been largely unsuccessful and reconstruction has still not been completed.

==Sports events and clubs==

== Transport ==
=== Railway ===

The railway Riga-Tukums was built in 1875–1877. The route chosen included the narrow isthmus between Lielupe and the Gulf of Riga. A stretch of 13 km of the line runs within a kilometre of the sea, and there are ten stations within easy walking distance from the beach. This was a big boost to the development of Jūrmala as a series of resorts along the coast. In 1912 a direct train connection was established with Moscow. The railway through Jūrmala is currently double-track and electrified. The current railway stations in Jūrmala, sorted from east to west, are Priedaine, Lielupe, Bulduri, Dzintari, Majori, Dubulti, Jaundubulti, Pumpuri, Melluži, Asari, Vaivari, Sloka and Ķemeri.

=== Roads ===
A six lane road, designated A10 and E22, connects Riga to Jūrmala. A road toll is required from non-residents to pass the 4-lane bridge over Lielupe (built in 1962) and drive into Jūrmala. A railway overpass was built at Dzintari Station in 1976, giving a fast four-lane traffic flow into central Jūrmala.

=== Air ===
Riga International Airport is only 18 km from central Jūrmala (Majori). Confusingly, Jūrmala Airport, a former Soviet air base, is further away (39 km) from central Jūrmala, near Tukums.
