<text>Freedonia, Fredonia or Fredon is the name given to several fictional countries. The name was used for some aspects of the United States in the 19th century, and later popularized by the 1933 Marx Brothers film &quot;Duck Soup&quot; where it was the name of the fictional country in which the film was set. Over time, the word has come to have a more generic meaning, anything from a noun describing a plausible yet fictional country, to an adjective (&quot;Freedonian&quot;) used to characterize a place &quot;like&quot; the Freedonia of &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. Because the Marx Brothers&#x27; film had so many qualities—autocracy, diminutiveness, and obscurity, to name but a few—a place can be described as &quot;Freedonian&quot; for having any one of these qualities.

== Usage ==

=== 19th century ===

==== As a name for the United States ====
Samuel Mitchill suggested that &#x27;Fredonian&#x27; be used by citizens of the United States (&quot;Fredon&quot;) after the American Revolution in place of the demonym &quot;American&quot;, which was then being used as a pejorative term by the metropolitan English to refer to &quot;their inferior and far-removed colonists&quot;. In Vol. VI, Part IV, of the Medical Repository, 1803, pp. 449–50, Mitchill, wrote the following under the heading of &quot;Medical and Philosophical News&quot;:

==== As a name for Liberia ====
&#x27;Fredonia&#x27; was one of the names proposed by the American Colonization Society for Liberia.

==== Republic of Fredonia ====

In December 1826, a group of Anglo-American settlers and filibusters led by Empresario Haden Edwards in what is now Texas, declared the &quot;Republic of Fredonia&quot; centered in the town of Nacogdoches. This was the first attempt by Anglo settlers in Texas to secede from Mexico and form an independent state. The republic was short-lived however, lasting only from December 21, 1826 – January 23, 1827, when Mexican soldiers and Anglo militia men from Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colony put the rebellion down.

==== Masonic Lodge ====

From about 1810 to 1834, a Lodge of Freemasons under the jurisdiction of The Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts was in existence in the town of Northborough, Massachusetts. It was named Fredonia Lodge.

=== 1930s ===

In the Marx Brother&#x27;s film &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, the tiny fictitious country of Freedonia (&quot;Land of the Brave, and Free&quot;) is suffering from severe financial problems; government leaders request a $20 million loan from wealthy Freedonian widow Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) to keep the nation afloat. Mrs. Teasdale agrees to lend the money only on the condition that Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx), be appointed leader of Freedonia. In the musical number that accompanies Firefly&#x27;s appointment to office, Firefly informs the audience on how the government will be run, singing lyrics such as &quot;The last man nearly ruined this place, he didn&#x27;t know what to do with it / If you think this country&#x27;s bad off now, just wait &#x27;til I get through with it.&quot; Firefly insults and angers Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) from the neighboring nation of Sylvania, which leads Freedonia into war.

When &quot;Duck Soup&quot; was released in 1933, the village of Fredonia, New York, complained about the possible negative impact the film might have on the town. The Marx Brothers replied &quot;Change the name of your town. It is hurting our picture.&quot; The satirical depiction of Freedonia is said to have led Benito Mussolini to ban &quot;Duck Soup&quot; in Italy.

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, Woody Allen, working on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, used Freedonia as a practical joke by asking passersby what they thought of the bid for independence for Freedonia.

=== 1970s ===
In the film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977), Freedonia is one of the kingdoms conquered by the King Bruno the Questionable.

=== 1980s ===
The American game publisher FASA&#x27;s name was originally supposed to stand for &quot;Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;. In their first publication (a set of starship deck plans for the game &quot;Traveller&quot;), the accompanying introduction was signed &quot;Rufus T Firefly, Director&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In the Sierra Entertainment PC game Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire (1990), the character &quot;Ali Chica&quot; is a parody of Chico Marx. If a non-player character is asked about &quot;Ali Chica&quot; after his disappearance, the player is told that he went to &quot;Fredonia&quot;.

In the 1990s, the satirical magazine &quot;Spy&quot; pulled a practical joke on several members of the United States Congress. Impersonating a New York radio host (Henry Rose), the magazine successfully convinced several newcomers to Congress to comment on the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in Freedonia, without their realizing that Freedonia was a fictional country. Nick Smith urged caution; James Talent supported action; Jay Inslee warned that inaction would be unacceptable. The story drew commentary elsewhere.

====Principality of Freedonia====

The Principality of Freedonia was a micronation based on libertarian principles. It was created as a &quot;hypothetical project&quot; by a group of teenagers in the United States in 1992. The project was formalized as a new country project in 1997, which included attempts in 2001 to lease territory in Somaliland. The attempt to lease land was rejected.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;Duck Soup&quot; is used as an in-joke amongst characters portrayed as knowledgeable about the film in a Season 3 (2001–2002) episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, while another episode in Season 6 (2004–2005) recalls the general plot details of &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. In &quot;Enemies Foreign and Domestic&quot;, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn, and Toby Ziegler are discussing the relevancy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in a post-Soviet world. C.J., being briefed by Sam on a number of countries she has to mention as possible new candidates for NATO membership, wonders why Freedonia is being left out of the mix. She goes on to reference Groucho Marx by singing &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; (which was his character in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;) under her breath. When upbraided by Toby for not taking the briefing seriously, she asks why her attempt at humor is less valid than Sam&#x27;s or his. Toby responds that he&#x27;s heard her joke before, implying that he has seen &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. Determined that her Marx Brothers references be respected, she ends the sequences of references by offering to pay Toby $500 if he will sing &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot; (a song sung by J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho) in &quot;At the Circus&quot;). During Season 6 the question of the &quot;situation in Freedonia&quot; was asked of a candidate in a Senate debate, and after the candidate said he was studying it, there was no allowed time for the other candidates to challenge him about the existence of the country.

United Kingdom games &quot;Democracy&quot; (2005) and &quot;Democracy 2&quot; (2007) featured Freedonia as a playable country.

In the game &quot;Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek&quot; (2007), the character Yanni Volkstaia is an Olympic skier from Fredonia.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot; (2007), the Doctor claims his companion Martha Jones is from Freedonia. He also claims this in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;Sting of the Zygons&quot; (2007). Although the usage may be intended simply as a plausible name for a country of which the listener (William Shakespeare in the former case) has not heard, it is specifically linked to &quot;Duck Soup&quot; in at least one official reference work.

=== 2010s ===
In the Australian animated series &quot;The Flamin&#x27; Thongs&quot; (2014), the leader of Freedonia declares war on Australia after Holden Thong&#x27;s soccer ball lands in his birthday cake and destroys it.
In the film &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot; (2017), Gru&#x27;s brother Dru lives in Freedonia, and the place was shown to have a cheese festival.

== Use in general English ==
&quot;Freedonia&quot; is sometimes used in political editorials and news stories to illustrate a point about another, real country. Sometimes the point being made is that a particular country is so small or remote as to be unknown to its readers. Other times, the term may negatively connote that a real country is run by an autocratic leader who is out of step with his or her people. Still other times the author may simply use &quot;Freedonia&quot; to mean &quot;a fictitious country for the purposes of illustration&quot;.
Freedonia is the name of the locale where the fictitious lending zoo in Frank Asch&#x27;s 2016 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Lending Zoo&quot; takes place.

<doc id="173834" wikidata="Q83812" url="?curid=173834" title="Edward G. Robinson">
<text>Edward G. Robinson (born Emanuel Goldenberg; December 12, 1893January 26, 1973) was an American actor of stage and screen, who was popular during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. He appeared in 30 Broadway plays, and more than 100 films, during a 50-year career, and is best remembered for his tough-guy roles as gangsters in such films as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;Key Largo&quot;. During his career, Robinson received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;House of Strangers&quot;.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Robinson was an outspoken public critic of fascism and Nazism, which were growing in strength in Europe in the years which led up to World War II. His activism included contributing over $250,000 to more than 850 organizations that were involved in war relief, along with contributions to cultural, educational, and religious groups. During the 1950s, he was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare, but he was cleared of any deliberate Communist involvement when he claimed that he was &quot;duped&quot; by several people whom he named (including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo), according to the official Congressional record, &quot;Communist infiltration of the Hollywood motion-picture industry&quot;. As a result of being investigated, he found himself on Hollywood&#x27;s graylist, people who were on the Hollywood blacklist maintained by the major studios, but could find work at minor film studios on what was called Poverty Row.

Robinson&#x27;s roles included an insurance investigator in the film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, Dathan (the adversary of Moses) in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, and his final performance in the science-fiction story &quot;Soylent Green&quot;. Robinson received an Academy Honorary Award for his work in the film industry, which was awarded two months after he died in 1973. He is ranked number 24 in the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classic American cinema. Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited him as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

==Early years and education==
Robinson was born Emanuel Goldenberg () on December 12, 1893, in a Yiddish-speaking Romanian Jewish family in Bucharest, the fifth son of Sarah (née Guttman) and Yeshaya Moyshe Goldenberg (later called Morris in the U.S.), a builder.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, one of his brothers was attacked by an anti-semitic gang during a &quot;schoolboy pogrom&quot;. In the wake of that violence, the family decided to emigrate to the United States. Robinson arrived in New York City on February 21, 1904. &quot;At Ellis Island I was born again,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Life for me began when I was 10 years old.&quot; In America, he assumed the name of Edward. He grew up on the Lower East Side, and had his Bar Mitzvah at First Roumanian-American Congregation. He attended Townsend Harris High School and then the City College of New York, planning to become a criminal attorney. An interest in acting and performing in front of people led to him winning an American Academy of Dramatic Arts scholarship, after which he changed his name to &quot;Edward G. Robinson&quot; (the G. standing for his original surname).

He served in the United States Navy during World War I, but was not sent overseas.

==Career==
===Theatre===
In 1915, Robinson made his Broadway debut in Roi Cooper Megrue&#x27;s &quot;Under Fire&quot;. Because of his physical features he was often cast as foreign characters in plays on the Broadway stage; including a Swede in Henning Berger&#x27;s &quot;The Deluge&quot; (1917), a Filipino in Azelle M. Aldrich and Joseph Noll&#x27;s &quot;The Pawn&quot; (1917), and a French-Canadian in Harry James Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Little Teacher&quot; (1918).

He made his film debut in &quot;Arms and the Woman&quot; (1916).

In 1923, he made his named debut as &quot;E. G. Robinson&quot; in the silent film, &quot;The Bright Shawl&quot;.

===&quot;The Racket&quot;===
He played a snarling gangster in the 1927 Broadway police/crime drama &quot;The Racket&quot;, which led to his being cast in similar film roles, beginning with &quot;The Hole in the Wall&quot; (1929) with Claudette Colbert for Paramount.

One of many actors who saw their careers flourish rather than falter in the new sound film era, he made only three films prior to 1930, but left his stage career that year and made 14 films between 1930 and 1932.

Robinson went to Universal for &quot;Night Ride&quot; (1930) and MGM for &quot;A Lady to Love&quot; (1930) directed by Victor Sjöström. At Universal he was in &quot;Outside the Law&quot; and &quot;East Is West&quot; (both 1930), then he did &quot;The Widow from Chicago&quot; (1931) at First National.

===&quot;Little Caesar&quot;===
At this point, Robinson was becoming an established film actor. What began his rise to stardom was an acclaimed performance as the gangster Caesar Enrico &quot;Rico&quot; Bandello in &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931) at Warner Bros.

Robinson signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros., casting him in another gangster film, &quot;Smart Money&quot; (1931), his only movie with James Cagney. He was reunited with Mervyn LeRoy, director of &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, in &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1931), playing a journalist, and played a Tong gangster in &quot;The Hatchet Man&quot; (1932).

Robinson made a third film with LeRoy, &quot;Two Seconds&quot; (1932) then did a melodrama directed by Howard Hawks, &quot;Tiger Shark&quot; (1932).

Warner Bros. tried him in a biopic, &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; (1932), where Robinson played Horace Tabor; a comedy, &quot;The Little Giant&quot; (1933); and a romance, &quot;I Loved a Woman&quot; (1933).

Robinson was then in &quot;Dark Hazard&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Man with Two Faces&quot; (1934).

He went to Columbia for &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1935), a comedy directed by John Ford. Sam Goldwyn borrowed him for &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935), again directed by Hawks.

Back at Warner Bros., he did &quot;Bullets or Ballots&quot; (1936) then he went to Britain for &quot;Thunder in the City&quot; (1937). He made &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; (1937) with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. MGM borrowed him for &quot;The Last Gangster&quot; (1937), then he did a comedy &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot; (1938). Again with Bogart in a supporting role, he was in &quot;The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse&quot; (1938) and then he was borrowed by Columbia for &quot;I Am the Law&quot; (1938).

===World War II===
At the time World War II broke out in Europe, he played an FBI agent in &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; (1939), the first American film that portrayed Nazism as a threat to the United States.

He volunteered for military service in June 1942 but was disqualified due to his age which was 48, although he became an active and vocal critic of fascism and Nazism during that period.

MGM borrowed him for &quot;Blackmail&quot;, (1939). Then, to avoid being typecast, he played the biomedical scientist and Nobel laureate Paul Ehrlich in &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&#x27;s Magic Bullet&quot; (1940), and played Paul Julius Reuter in &quot;A Dispatch from Reuters&quot; (1940). Both films were biographies of prominent Jewish public figures. In between, he and Bogart starred in &quot;Brother Orchid&quot; (1940).

Robinson was teamed up with John Garfield in &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), and George Raft in &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941). He went to MGM for &quot;Unholy Partners&quot; (1942), and made a comedy &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942).

===Post-Warner Bros.===
Robinson was one of several stars in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942) and &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943).

He did war films: &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1943) at Columbia, and &quot;Tampico&quot; (1944) at Fox. At Paramount, he was in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck, where his riveting soliloquy on insurance actuarial tables (written by Raymond Chandler) is considered a career showstopper; and at Columbia, he was in &quot;Mr. Winkle Goes to War&quot; (1944). He then performed with Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944), and &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945), where he played a criminal painter.

At MGM, he was in &quot;Our Vines Have Tender Grapes&quot; (1945), and then Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), with Welles and Loretta Young. Robinson followed it with another thriller, &quot;The Red House&quot; (1947), and starred in an adaptation of &quot;All My Sons&quot; (1948).

Robinson appeared for director John Huston as the gangster Johnny Rocco in &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), the last of five films that he made with Humphrey Bogart, and the only one in which Robinson played a supporting role to Bogart&#x27;s character in the film. It is also the only film with Bogart where Bogart&#x27;s character killed Robinson&#x27;s character in a gunfight, instead of the opposite. Around the same time, he was cast in starring roles for &quot;Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot; (1948) and &quot;House of Strangers&quot; (1949).

===Greylisting===
Robinson found it hard to get work after his greylisting. He starred in modest-budget films: &quot;Actors and Sin&quot; (1952), &quot;Vice Squad&quot; (1953), with brief appearances by second-billed Paulette Goddard, &quot;Big Leaguer&quot; (1953) with Vera-Ellen, &quot;The Glass Web&quot; (1953) with John Forsythe, &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; (1954) with Peter Graves, &quot;The Violent Men&quot; (1955) with Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck, in the well-received &quot;Tight Spot&quot; (1955) with Ginger Rogers and Brian Keith, &quot;A Bullet for Joey&quot; (1955) with George Raft, &quot;Illegal&quot; (1955) with Nina Foch, and in &quot;Hell on Frisco Bay&quot; (1956) with Alan Ladd.

His career&#x27;s rehabilitation received a boost in 1954, when the anti-communist film director Cecil B. DeMille cast him as the traitorous Dathan in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. The film was released in 1956, as was his psychological thriller &quot;Nightmare&quot;. After a subsequent short absence from the screen, Robinson&#x27;s film career – augmented by an increasing number of television roles – re-started in 1958/1959, when he was second-billed, after Frank Sinatra, in the 1959 release &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot;.

===Supporting actor===
Robinson went to Europe for &quot;Seven Thieves&quot; (1960). He had support roles in &quot;My Geisha&quot; (1962), &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962), &quot;Sammy Going South&quot; (1963), &quot;The Prize&quot; (1963), &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; (1964), &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964), &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Outrage&quot; (1964).

He was second-billed, under Steve McQueen, with his name above the title, in &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965). McQueen had idolized Robinson while growing up, and opted for him when Spencer Tracy insisted on top billing for the same role. Robinson was top-billed in &quot;The Blonde from Peking&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Grand Slam&quot; (1967), starring Janet Leigh and Klaus Kinski.

Robinson was originally cast in the role of Dr. Zaius in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) and he even went so far as to film a screen test with Charlton Heston. However, Robinson dropped out of the project before its production began due to heart problems and concerns over the long hours that he would have needed to spend under the heavy ape makeup. He was replaced by Maurice Evans.

His later appearances included &quot;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&quot; (1968) starring Robert Wagner and Raquel Welch, &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; (1968) with Dick Van Dyke, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; (1968), &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969) starring Gregory Peck and Omar Sharif, and the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode “The Messiah on Mott Street&quot; (1971).

The last scene that Robinson filmed was a euthanasia sequence, with his friend and co-star Charlton Heston, in the science fiction film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973); he died 84 days later.

Heston, as president of the Screen Actors Guild, presented Robinson with its annual award in 1969, &quot;in recognition of his pioneering work in organizing the union, his service during World War II, and his &#x27;outstanding achievement in fostering the finest ideals of the acting profession.&#x27;&quot;

Robinson was never nominated for an Academy Award, but in 1973 he was awarded an honorary Oscar in recognition that he had &quot;achieved greatness as a player, a patron of the arts and a dedicated citizen ... in sum, a Renaissance man&quot;. He had been notified of the honor, but he died two months before the award ceremony took place, so the award was accepted by his widow, Jane Robinson.

===Radio===
From 1937 to 1942, Robinson starred as Steve Wilson, editor of the &quot;Illustrated Press&quot;, in the newspaper drama &quot;Big Town&quot;. He also portrayed hardboiled detective Sam Spade for a Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. During the 1940s he performed on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;Cadena de las Américas&quot; network broadcasts to South America in collaboration with Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s cultural diplomacy program at the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.

==Political activism==
During the 1930s, Robinson was an outspoken public critic of fascism and Nazism, donating more than $250,000 to 850 political and charitable organizations between 1939 and 1949. He was host to the &quot;Committee of 56,&quot; which gathered at his home on December 9, 1938, signing a &quot;Declaration of Democratic Independence,&quot; which called for a boycott of all German-made products. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, while he was not a supporter of Communism, he appeared at Soviet war relief rallies in order to give moral aid to America&#x27;s new ally, which he said could join &quot;together in their hatred of Hitlerism&quot;.

Although he attempted to enlist in the military when the United States formally entered World War II, he was unable to do so because of his age; instead, the Office of War Information appointed him as a Special Representative based in London. From there, taking advantage of his multilingual skills, he delivered radio addresses in over six languages to European countries that had fallen under Nazi domination. His talent as a radio speaker in the U.S. had previously been recognized by the American Legion, which had given him an award for his &quot;outstanding contribution to Americanism through his stirring patriotic appeals&quot;. Robinson was also an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee, serving on its executive board in 1944, during which time he became an &quot;enthusiastic&quot; campaigner for Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection that same year. During the 1940s, Robinson also contributed to the cultural diplomacy initiatives of Roosevelt&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in support of Pan-Americanism through his broadcasts to South America on the CBS &quot;Cadena da las Américas&quot; radio network.

In early July 1944, less than a month after the Invasion of Normandy by Allied forces, Robinson traveled to Normandy to entertain the troops, becoming the first movie star to go there for the USO. He personally donated $100,000 (equal to $ today) to the USO. After returning to the U.S., he continued his active involvement in the war effort by going to shipyards and defense plants in order to inspire workers, in addition to appearing at rallies in order to help sell war bonds.

After the war ended, Robinson publicly spoke out in support of democratic rights for all Americans, especially in demanding equality for Black workers in the workplace. He endorsed the Fair Employment Practices Commission&#x27;s call to end workplace discrimination. Black leaders praised him as &quot;one of the great friends of the Negro and a great advocator of Democracy&quot;. Robinson also campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans, helping many to overcome segregation and discrimination.

During the years when Robinson spoke out against fascism and Nazism, he was not a supporter of Communism, but he did not criticize the Soviet Union, which he saw as an ally against Hitler. However, the film historian Steven J. Ross observes &quot;activists who attacked Hitler without simultaneously attacking Stalin were vilified by conservative critics as either Communists, Communist dupes, or, at best, as naive liberal dupes.&quot; In addition, Robinson learned that 11 out of the more than 850 charities and groups that he had helped over the previous decade were listed as Communist front organizations by the FBI. As a result, he was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1950 and 1952, and he was also threatened with blacklisting.

As shown in the full House Un-American Activities Committee transcript for April 30, 1952, Robinson repudiated some of the organizations that he had belonged to in the 1930s and 1940s. and stated that he felt he had been duped or made use of unawares &quot;by the sinister forces who were members, and probably in important positions in these [front] organizations.&quot; When asked whom he personally knew who might have &quot;duped&quot; him, he replied, &quot;Well, you had Albert Maltz, and you have Dalton Trumbo, and you have ... John Howard Lawson. I knew Frank Tuttle. I didn&#x27;t know [Edward] Dmytryk at all. There are the Buchmans, that I know, Sidney Buchman and all that sort of thing. It never entered my mind that any of these people were Communists.&quot; Despite accusing these persons of being duplicitous towards him about their political aims, Robinson never directly accused anyone of being a Communist. His own name was cleared, but in the aftermath, his career noticeably suffered; he was offered smaller roles infrequently. In October 1952, he wrote an article titled &quot;How the Reds made a Sucker Out of Me&quot;, and it was published in the &quot;American Legion Magazine.&quot; The chair of the committee, Francis E. Walter, told Robinson at the end of his testimonies that the Committee &quot;never had any evidence presented to indicate that you were anything more than a very choice sucker.&quot;

==Personal life==
Robinson married stage actress Gladys Lloyd Cassell in 1927. The couple had a son, Edward G. Robinson, Jr., known as Manny, (1933–1974), and a daughter from Robinson&#x27;s wife&#x27;s first marriage. The couple divorced in 1956. In 1958, Robinson married Jane Bodenheimer, a dress designer professionally known as Jane Arden. He lived in Palm Springs, California.

In contrast to the gangsters he portrayed in film, Robinson was a soft-spoken and cultured man. He was a passionate art collector, eventually building up a significant private collection. In 1956, however, he was forced to sell his collection to pay for his divorce settlement with Gladys Robinson; his finances had also suffered due to underemployment in the early 1950s.

==Death==
Robinson died of bladder cancer at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on January 26, 1973, just weeks after finishing &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, and months before he was to be given an honorary Academy Award later that year. He was 79. Services were conducted at Temple Israel in Los Angeles where Charlton Heston delivered the eulogy. More than 1,500 friends of Robinson attended, with another 500 people outside. His body was flown to New York where it was entombed in a crypt in his family&#x27;s mausoleum at Beth-El Cemetery in Queens. His pallbearers were Jack L. Warner, Hal B. Wallis, Mervyn Leroy, George Burns, Sam Jaffe, Frank Sinatra, Jack Karp and Alan Simpson.

==In popular culture==
In October 2000, Robinson&#x27;s image was imprinted on a U.S. postage stamp, the sixth in its Legends of Hollywood series.

Robinson has been the inspiration for a number of animated television characters, usually caricatures of his most distinctive &#x27;snarling gangster&#x27; guise. An early version of the gangster character Rocky, featured in the Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot;, shared his likeness. This version of the character also appears briefly in &quot;Justice League&quot;, in the episode &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot;, as an alien with Robinson&#x27;s face and non-human body, who hovers past the screen as a background character.

Similar caricatures also appeared in &quot;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&quot;, &quot;Thugs with Dirty Mugs&quot; and &quot;Hush My Mouse&quot;. Another character based on Robinson&#x27;s tough-guy image was The Frog (Chauncey &quot;Flat Face&quot; Frog) from the cartoon series &quot;Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse&quot;. The voice of B.B. Eyes in &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot; was based on Robinson, with Mel Blanc and Jerry Hausner sharing voicing duties. The &quot;Wacky Races&quot; animated series character &#x27;Clyde&#x27; from the Ant Hill Mob was based on Robinson&#x27;s Little Caesar persona.

Voice actor Hank Azaria has noted that the voice of &quot;Simpsons&quot; character police chief Clancy Wiggum is an impression of Robinson.

Robinson was portrayed by actor Michael Stuhlbarg in the 2015 biographical drama film &quot;Trumbo&quot;.

<text>Ashtead is a village in the Mole Valley district of Surrey, England, approximately south of central London. Ashtead is on the single-carriageway A24 between Epsom and Leatherhead. The village is on the northern slopes of the North Downs and is in the catchment area of The Rye, a tributary of the River Mole.

The earliest archaeological evidence for human activity in the village is from the Stone Age. At several points in its history, including during the early Roman period, Ashtead has been a centre for brick and tile manufacture. From medieval times until the late 19th century, Ashtead was primarily an agricultural settlement. Residential development was catalysed by the opening of the railway line between and in 1859 and by the breakup of the Ashtead Park estate in the 1880s. Housebuilding continued into the 20th century, reaching a peak in the 1930s. Future expansion is now constrained by the Metropolitan Green Belt, which encircles the village.

There are two nature reserves in the village: Ashtead Common, to the north west of the centre, forms part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is owned by the Corporation of London; Ashtead Park, to the east of the centre is a Local Nature Reserve owned by the District Council.

==Toponymy==
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Ashtead is recorded as &quot;Stede&quot;, which simply means &quot;place&quot;. In later documents, the village appears as &quot;Estede&quot;, &quot;Akestede&quot; and &quot;Aschestede&quot; (13th century), &quot;Asshstede&quot; (1370s), &quot;Ashstede&quot; (14th century), &quot;Asshested&quot; (15th century), &quot;Asted&quot; (1790) and &quot;Ashsted&quot; (1820). The name is generally agreed to mean &quot;place of ash trees&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Ashtead is a large village in the Mole Valley district of Surrey, approximately south of central London. It lies on the southern edge of the London Basin and the highest point in the parish is above ordnance datum. Both the Epsom to Leatherhead railway line and the A24 run from northeast to southwest through the settlement, broadly parallel to The Rye, a tributary of the River Mole.

The historic core of Ashtead is known locally as &quot;The Village&quot; and is focused around the main shopping area along The Street (A24). The residential area to the north west, closer to the railway station, is known as &quot;Lower Ashtead&quot; and incorporates secondary shopping centres on Craddocks Parade and Barnett Wood Lane.

There are two protected nature reserves in Ashtead: Ashtead Common, a woodland, is owned and managed by the City of London Corporation and is to the north west of Lower Ashtead; the Ashtead Park is to the east of The Village and is owned by Mole Valley District Council.

===Geology===
Like many of the villages between Croydon and Guildford, Ashtead is a spring line settlement. It is positioned at the point where the chalk of the North Downs dips beneath the London Clay. The chalk is a natural aquifer and numerous wells have been bored into the ground to obtain drinking water. Springs rise at several points along the boundary between the permeable and impermeable ground, some of which feed The Rye and its tributaries, while others feed the ponds on the Common and in the Park.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The earliest evidence of human activity is from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods. A backed blade made of flint, dating from 50,000 to 12,000 years before present (BP), was found during pipeline excavations in Lower Ashtead, near Barnett Wood Lane and tranchet axes, dating from 15,000 to 5000 BP, have been discovered in Ottways Lane and Glebe Road. During the demolition of Parsons Mead School in 2009, pottery from the Neolithic was found which contained charcoal that was radiocarbon dated to 3775-3659 BP. Bronze Age artefacts discovered in the village include a spearhead and pottery sherds.

===Roman and Saxon===
Ashtead was the site of a major Roman brickworks in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The site on Ashtead Common consisted of a corridor villa and kilns adjacent to a series of claypits. A bath house was also provided for the use of the workers. The complex was excavated in the 1920s and it is now protected by scheduled monument status.

Bricks and tiles produced in Ashtead were most likely transported via a short branch road to Stane Street, the Roman road that runs to the south east of the village centre. Remains of a building close to St Giles&#x27; Church, suggest that Roman occupation of Ashtead continued into the 4th century.

Although there is no archaeological evidence of Anglo-Saxon occupation in the village, Ashtead would have been administered as part of the Copthorne Hundred. There may have been a small chapel, likely to have been controlled by a minster at Leatherhead, which was a royal vill. In 1984, an Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered on the site of the former Goblin factory in Ermyn Way, Leatherhead (now the location of the offices of Esso). Excavations uncovered the remains of at least 40 individuals and the artefacts found, including knives, buckles and necklaces, suggest that they were pagan burials.

===Medieval===
Ashtead appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Stede&quot; and was held by the Canons of Bayeux from the Bishop of Bayeux. Its assets were: three hides and one virgate; 16 ploughs, woodland for seven hogs and of meadow. In total, it rendered £12 per year.

The de Warenne Family, the Earls of Surrey, held the manor in the 12th century. In the second half of the 13th century, it passed to the de Montfort family. During the Second Barons&#x27; War (1264–1267), Ashtead men are known to have fought on the side of Simon de Montfort. The de Montforts and their descendants continued to own the manor until the death of Baldwin de Freville in 1419, when it passed to his brother-in-law, Sir Roger Aston. Ashtead passed through several generations of the Aston family until 1543, when Edward Aston returned the manor to the Crown in exchange for land in Stafford and Derby.

During the late 14th century, tile manufacturing was again taking place on Ashtead Common. Records from the Manor of Banstead indicate that a &quot;Henry the Tyler of Asshstede&quot; supplied over 10,000 roof tiles in 1372–3, and in 1384 the same individual also supplied the lord of the manor of Ashtead with tiles for &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Kitchen.&quot; It is possible that, during the 1290s, the tiles for the building of Pacchesham Manor, Leatherhead, were also manufactured on Ashtead Common. There is no mention of Henry the Tyler after 1400, and it seems likely that the medieval tileworks closed around this time.

The area now bordered by Barnett Wood Lane, Agates Lane, Ottways Lane and Harriots Lane, was formerly a separate manor called Little Ashtead, which was held by Merton Priory in the Middle Ages. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, the area was known as Prior&#x27;s Farm.

===Early modern===
Documents surviving from the mid-17th century, detail the organisation of the manor during the reign of Charles II: Two common fields, together totalling and representing around 30% of the cultivatable land in the village, were divided into strips of around 1 acre each. The strips were distributed between 52 families and the planting would have been regulated by the manor court. In 1656, 17 of these strips were held by the rector and provided an income for the parish priest. The remainder of the cultivatable land had already been enclosed and was either held by the Lords of the Manor or by other prominent individuals, including the Stydolf family of Norbury Park.

Ashtead is mentioned twice in Samuel Pepys&#x27; diaries. Part of his reads:
:&quot;I went towards Ashted, my old place of pleasure... and there we got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in, but rather than go further to look we staid there, and while supper was getting ready I took him to walk up and down behind my cozen [cousin] Pepys&#x27;s house... and so up and down in the closes, which I know so well methinks, and account it good fortune that I lie here that I may have opportunity to renew my old walks.&quot;

For much of the early modern period, Ashtead was owned by the Howard family. Sir Robert Howard purchased the manor from his cousin Henry Howard, the 6th Duke of Norfolk, in 1680 and is credited with transforming the land into a Gentleman&#x27;s country seat. Sir Robert built a new mansion and also enclosed the surrounding park to create a formal garden. The diarist, John Evelyn, visited the house shortly after it was completed in 1684, admiring the paintings by the Italian-born artist Antonio Verrio and remarking upon the &quot;swete park upon the Downe.&quot; Celia Fiennes described the brick-built mansion as having &quot;an abundance of pictures&quot; and &quot;very good tapestry hangings&quot;. Sir Robert&#x27;s guests also included Charles II, James II and William III.
The turnpike road between Epsom and Horsham, which ran through Ashtead, was authorised by Parliament in 1755. By the end of the century, stagecoaches were passing through the village several times a day, although it is unlikely that many stopped to pick up passengers and local residents probably walked or rode to Epsom if they wished to use them.

===19th century===
For the first seven decades of the 19th century, Ashtead remained a predominantly farming community. The manor continued to be owned by members of the Howard family and was inherited by Mary Howard in 1818. Mary Howard was a major benefactor to the village and was responsible for founding St Giles&#x27; School. She endowed the almshouses and, together with her husband, Fulk Greville Howard, initiated a major redevelopment of the parish church.

In 1825 George Rennie and his brother, John, proposed the construction of The Grand Imperial Ship Canal, between Deptford and Portsmouth, to reduce the transit time from the capital to the south coast from 12 days to 24 hours and to avoid hostile waters in the event of war. The canal would have run across Ashtead Common, along the course of The Rye.

The two common fields were enclosed in 1838, bringing to an end the open-field system in the manor. The land was divided into forty rectangular fields, each of around , which were leased to local farmers. The glebe strips were taken over by the Howards and the rector was given land to the south of the village centre in compensation. In around 1850, the comprising the remaining core of Little Ashtead manor was sold for development, marking the start of a long period of housebuilding in the village.

The railway line through Ashtead was built by the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway Company and opened on 1 February 1859. It was constructed as a single-track line and, on opening, Ashtead railway station had only one platform and trains only stopped by request. Initially all services were operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and, for the first two months, only ran as far as . The completion of the line through enabled these trains to be extended to from April of the same year. In August 1859, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) began to run trains from Leatherhead to , but did not begin stopping at Ashtead until the following year.

After the death of Mary Howard in 1877, much of the village was offered for sale. Ashtead Common was purchased by Thomas Lucas, who sold it four years later, in 1889, to the banker Pantia Ralli. The rest of the land, much of it farmland, was split into eight separate lots. Since the sale coincided with a period of depression in British agriculture, the land sold cheaply. The lot containing Ashtead Park and Home Farm was withdrawn from sale when it failed to meet its reserve price and was acquired by Pantia Ralli in 1889.

By 1887 the majority of the farms in Ashtead had been broken up and the land was in the hands of eight major owners and many smaller ones. New houses began to be built on the east side of Woodfield Lane and to the north of Barnett Wood Lane. The area west of the station (including Links Road and Ashtead Woods Road) had been marked out for housing by 1894, but construction was delayed by difficulties in securing access over the railway. Elsewhere building work was also slow and the population of the village increased from 906 in 1871 to 1,881 in 1901.

===20th century===

Development continued in the first decade of the 20th century and the population had reached 2,921 by 1911. Many of the new homes were in the west of the parish and housebuilding took place along Skinners Lane, Ottways Lane and Oakfield Road. By 1914, new houses had also appeared along Leatherhead Road, Woodfield Road and The Marld. Many of the new residents were professionals who commuted to London by train.

During the First World War, several hundred men from the 21st Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers were billeted in the village and were responsible for constructing a convalescent hospital at Woodcote Park in Epsom. George V visited the village by train in October 1914 to inspect the troops. By January 1915, there were around 1500 soldiers based in Ashtead. The war memorial at St George&#x27;s Church was dedicated in 1920.

The inter-war years saw the most rapid period of residential development, stimulated in part by the final breakup of the Ashtead Park estate, following the death of Pantia Ralli in 1924. The electrification of the railway line in 1925 also made the village more attractive to potential homeowners. The population increased from 3,226 in 1921 to 9,336 in 1939.
In September 1939, children were evacuated to Ashtead from Streatham and Dulwich. A unit of the Royal Norfolk Regiment was stationed in the village at the start of the war and, from 1941, Canadian soldiers were billeted locally. Land bordering Craddocks Avenue was taken over for war allotments and pigs were reared on vacant building plots on the Overdale estate. In 1940 a company of the Home Guard was formed.

In 1940 and 1941, several buildings in Ashtead suffered damage as a result of enemy bombing during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, including St Andrew&#x27;s School, which was almost completely destroyed. In the final year of the war, two V-1 flying bombs landed in the village and a V-2 rocket landed to the south of Ashtead Park in February 1945.
The 1944 Greater London Plan placed much of the land surrounding Ashtead in the protected Metropolitan Green Belt, which severely limited the scope for urban expansion. The northern half of Ashtead Park was threatened with development from the late 1940s and so it was purchased by Surrey County Council in 1957, before being passed to the ownership of the Leatherhead Urban District Council. In 1988, three conservation areas were designated in the village.

== Government and politics ==
Since 1997, Ashtead has been part of the parliamentary constituency of Epsom and Ewell.

For much of the 19th century, local infrastructure and services were overseen by the vestry, but the Local Government Act 1888 transferred many administrative responsibilities to the newly formed Surrey County Council. A parish council was established under the Local Government Act 1894 when the village became part of Epsom Rural District. The parish council was abolished in 1933, when Ashtead became part of Leatherhead Urban District. Ashtead thus became an urban parish. In 1951 the parish had a population of 9852. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. Mole Valley District Council was created in 1974 by combining the Urban Districts of Dorking and Leatherhead with the Rural District of Dorking.

Although Ashtead does not have a parish council today, stakeholder engagement is conducted through a number of bodies, including Ashtead Residents&#x27; Association.

==Demography and housing==
In the 2011 Census, the combined population of the Ashtead Common, Park and Village wards was 14,169.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
Until the late 18th century, villagers obtained drinking water from The Rye or from wells. In 1884, the first piped supply was installed by the Leatherhead and District Water Company and was fed from a borehole at Waterway Road in Leatherhead. The gas main from Epsom was installed in the 1880s, to supply gas for street lighting. The first sewerage system was completed in 1900 and electricity reached Ashtead in the same year.

===Emergency services===
In the early 19th century a constable was employed by the vestry and the Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower public house doubled as the village prison, where the accused could be held before trial. Policing in the village became the responsibility of the Surrey Constabulary on its creation in 1851.

Ashtead Fire Brigade was founded in 1901. At first the horse-drawn fire cart was housed at the Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower, but it moved to a site in Agates Lane in 1908. The village Brigade was merged with that of Leatherhead in October 1926. In 2021, the fire authority for the village is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Local ambulance services are run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===
Ashtead Hospital, a private hospital not run by the NHS, opened in the old chalk quarry site to the south of the village in September 1984. The nearest hospital with an A&amp;E is Epsom Hospital, away. As of 2021, the village has two GP practices, both on Woodfield Lane.

==Industry and business==
Brick and tile manufacture has taken place at Ashtead at several points in the village&#x27;s history. Clay pits on Ashtead Common were active in the 1st, 2nd, 13th and 14th centuries and, in the mid-19th century, there was a brick kiln and drying shed in Newton Wood. In around 1880, the Sparrow brothers opened a works to the north of Barnett Wood Lane and their company was active for around 30 years. Houses were built on the site in the 1950s and part of the old clay pit is now the Floral Pond, adjacent to The Chase. Ashtead Brickworks, to the west of the Sparrow Works, was established in 1896 and closed in 1909.
Ashtead Potters Ltd was established in the village in 1923 by Sir Lawrence Weaver and Kathleen Purcell, Lady Weaver. The firm was based in the Victoria Works in West Hill and produced a wide range of products in a variety of styles. The clay was delivered by train to Ashtead station. The company ceased trading in 1935 after sales fell during the Great Depression.

The construction company Longcross had its head office in Ashtead but entered administration in 2015.

The Ashtead Group was founded in 1947 as &quot;Ashtead Plant and Tool Hire&quot;. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986. The company operates internationally and serves customers in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Transport==
===Road===
The A24 single-carriageway road runs through the centre of the village. In October 1985, Ashtead was joined to the UK motorway system, when the M25 motorway was opened between Wisley and Reigate.

===Bus===
Route 408 (Epsom – Leatherhead – Cobham) is run by Falcon Buses and Route 479 (Epsom – Leatherhead – Guildford) is run by Arriva Kent &amp; Sussex and Stagecoach.

===Railway===

Ashtead railway station is to the northwest of the village centre and is managed by Southern. The main ticket office building was rebuilt in 2013. It is served by trains to via , to via , to via and via .

===Long-distance footpath===
The Thames Down Link long-distance footpath between Kingston upon Thames and Box Hill runs through Ashtead Park.

==Schools==
===Maintained schools===

The first school in Ashtead was established by the Howard family in 1815 and was located close to the almshouses in Park Lane. On opening it catered for around 60 children, but numbers had grown to around 100 by 1850. St Giles&#x27; Infant School was established in 1852 by Mary Howard to replace the Park Lane school. Originally boys and girls were taught separately, but the two halves were amalgamated in 1900. By 1904 there were 317 children enrolled.

Barnett Wood Infant School was opened as Ashtead Council School in 1906. Initially it was housed in temporary facilities, but moved to its present brick building in 1914. The Greville Primary School was opened in 1958 and is thought to have been named after Fulk Greville Howard, husband of Mary Howard. West Ashtead Primary School was opened in 1964 and underwent an expansion in the mid-1970s.

St Andrew&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School is in Leatherhead, close to the southern boundary of the village.

===Independent schools===
The City of London Freemen&#x27;s School was founded in 1854 by the Corporation of London to educate orphans of the freemen of the city. Originally located in Brixton, the school taught both boys and girls from the outset and it is one of the oldest coeducational establishments in the world. In 1926, the school moved to its present site in Ashtead Park and began to admit fee-paying pupils.

Downsend Lodge (Ashtead) was founded as Ryebrook School in 1948. It was acquired by Downsend School in 1983 and is run as a pre-prep feeder school. The main Downsend School site is in Leatherhead, close to the border with Ashtead.

===Former schools===
Parsons Mead School was an independent school founded by Jessie Elliston in 1897. In 1904 it moved to its permanent site in Ottways Lane and by the outbreak of the First World War it had 95 female pupils, aged between 10 and 18. A decline in school numbers forced the school to close in 2006 and the site was sold for housing a year later.

==Places of worship==
===St Giles&#x27; Church===

St Giles&#x27; Church is first recorded in a charter of the Bishop of Winchester that dates from the early 12th century. It was built around 1115 with an endowment from Laurence of Rouen, probably as a private chapel for the nearby manor house. The oldest surviving part is the east end of the nave, the south wall of which includes some Roman tiles.

The chancel was added in the 13th century and St Giles&#x27; became a church in its own right, with a rector and vicar. A substantial rebuilding took place in the 15th and 16th centuries, during which the tower was added. The east window, which is attributed to the 16th-century artist Lambert Lombard of Liège was transferred from Herkenrode Abbey, Belgium in the mid-18th century. The stone reredos and panelled-cedar chancel ceiling date from the same period. The ring of six bells dating from 1725, was recast as a peal of eight in 1873.

A major redevelopment took place in the 1890s, which included the renewal of the roof, pews and pulpit. A new organ chamber was built at the same time and new arches were opened in the walls of the chancel and north aisle. The lychgate was erected in 1903 in memory of Sir Thomas Lucas. The churchyard contains 16 Commonwealth war graves of service personnel of both World Wars.

===St George&#x27;s Church===

A small church built of corrugated iron was built in Lower Ashtead in 1882, funded by a donation from Sir Thomas Lucas. The foundation stone for the permanent replacement was laid in 1905 and St George&#x27;s Church was consecrated in April of the following year. The brick building was designed by Arthur Conran Blomfield and, on opening, consisted of a nave, chancel, north aisle and transept. An organ chamber and vestry were added in 1908 and the church hall was constructed in 1954. A new east window, designed by Christopher Webb, was installed in 1961 and the south aisle was built three years later.

A major redevelopment took place in the late 1990s, during which the old hall was demolished and a two-storey extension to the church was constructed. The church was reopened in 2001.

===St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Church===

The first regular Catholic masses to be held in Ashtead since Elizabethan times took place in the Constitutional Hall in Barnett Wood Lane in 1942. Two years later a bombed-out house in Woodfield Lane was purchased and the congregation began meeting in the corrugated iron garage on the site, replaced in 1947 by a wooden building.

The foundation stone of St Michael&#x27;s Catholic Church was laid on 1 July 1967 and construction work was completed in October of the same year. The architect was Eduardo Dodds and the altar and font were designed by Joseph Cribb. The church hall was opened in 1983.

===Ashtead Baptist Church===
The Baptist Church has its origins in the Ashtead Gospel Church, which was a temporary building, constructed of corrugated iron in 1895. It became the Ashtead Free Church in 1913 and was replaced by a permanent brick building in 1924.

==Culture==

Ashtead Choral Society was founded in 1949 and performs regularly in local venues, including the Dorking Halls. In 2008, the society commissioned &quot;The Ashtead Psalms&quot; by Robert Steadman to mark its 50th anniversary.

==Sport==

Ashtead Cricket Club was founded in 1887. The home ground is at Woodfield Lane and in 2020 the club played in the Premier league of the Surrey Championship. The Old Freemen&#x27;s Cricket Club also plays cricket in Ashtead. Its home fixtures are split between the grounds of the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School in Ashtead Park and at Headley Cricket Club to work around term time use by the School.

Ashtead Football Club was founded in 1894. Initially it played its home games at Woodfield Lane, but since the Second World War it has used the Recreation Ground.

The Old Freemen&#x27;s Ladies&#x27; hockey team play on the artificial pitch in Ashtead Park every Saturday, with training in Clapham. Rugby Union has been played in Ashtead Park since 1930 as the home of the Old Freemen&#x27;s RFC.

==Parks and open spaces==
===Ashtead Common===

In medieval times, Ashtead Common was the waste land of the manor. It was used extensively for grazing of livestock, trees were harvested for timber and many of the older oaks show signs of pollarding. Following the end of the Second World War, the Common was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and was protected as part of the Metropolitan Greenbelt. It was purchased by Mole Valley District Council (MVDC) in 1988 and was passed to the Corporation of London in 1991. Today the total area of the Common is approximately and access is provided by public footpaths and bridleways. It provides a habitat for 90 different bird species, including tawny owls and green woodpeckers, as well as 130 rare species of beetle.

===Ashtead Park===
Ashtead Park was conceived as a 200-acre deer park, by Sir Robert Howard, who became Lord of the Manor in 1680. Following the death of Pantia Ralli in 1924, the southern half was bought by the Corporation of London. The northern part, which includes oak woodland and two large ponds has been designated a local nature reserve and is managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust on behalf of MVDC.

===Ashtead Rye Meadows===
The privately owned Ashtead Rye Meadows, to the west of the village, was designated a Site of Nature Conservation Interest in 2013. The site runs along the banks of The Rye, downstream of Ashtead Common. In the early Middle Ages, part of the area was known as &quot;The Great Marsh&quot; and the court roll of 1483 records its clearance and conversion into pasture. The system of drainage was also installed around this time and the oldest hedges date from at least 1638. The course of The Rye through the meadows was straightened during the 1950s when the adjacent housing was constructed, leading to a loss of wildlife habitats. Volunteers restored the stream in the 2010s, reinstating the original meanders. In 2017, one area of the meadows was designated a &quot;Centenary Field&quot; to commemorate the 62 residents of Ashtead who died in the First World War.

===Recreation Ground===
The Recreation Ground in Barnett Wood Lane was opened in 1932.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===Ashtead Park House===
Ashtead Park House was designed by Joseph Bonomi the Elder in the classical style and was completed in 1790. It is constructed from yellow stock bricks with Portland stone dressings. It was enlarged and altered in around 1880 for Sir Thomas Lucas. Notable features include the c. 1790 circular saloon, which has scagliola columns and a plaster frieze. The interiors of the Jacobean-style entrance hall and other principal rooms date from the late 19th century. The main staircase features an Adam-style bronze balustrade. The building is now Grade II* listed and is part of the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School.

===Coal-tax posts===

Six surviving coal-tax posts are positioned at intervals along the northern boundaries of Ashtead. These posts marked the limits of the tax jurisdiction of the Corporation of London and were erected under the provisions of the London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Act 1861. The majority of the posts are classified as &#x27;Type 2&#x27; and are made of cast iron, painted white. The post adjacent to the railway line is a taller &#x27;Type 4&#x27; design, made of unpainted stone.

===Feilding House===

The almshouses in The Street were established following a bequest from Lady Diana Howard, who lived at Ashtead Park until her death in 1733. They are thought to take their name from that of her second husband, the Whig politician, William Feilding. Originally the building accommodated six widows, but in 1852, alterations were carried out to increase the number of residents to eight.

===Grey Wings===
Grey Wings is a detached house that was designed by the architects Giles Gilbert Scott and his brother Adrian. It was built in 1913 and has been Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England since January 1999. It was occupied by the Boustead family shortly after completion. It has been subject to very few alterations since its construction.

Grey Wings was put up for sale for £2.1 million in September 2015. It was listed as having 4 reception rooms and 6 bedrooms.

===Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower pub===
The oldest parts of the Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower pub date from the late 17th century and an innkeeper is first recorded as working there in 1707. The building has a timber-framed core, but the frontage was extended in the early 20th century. It is protected by a Grade II listing.

===Memorial fountain===

The Memorial Fountain was erected by the parishioners of Ashtead in 1879 in memory of Mary Howard. It is built from sandstone ashlar in the form of a medieval cross.

===Peace Memorial Hall===
The Peace Memorial Hall in Woodfield Lane was built to celebrate the end of the First World War. The single-storey building was opened in 1924 by Sir Rowland Blades and functions as a village hall.

===Public Library===
The library in Woodfield Lane is run by Surrey County Council. The brick building was designed by the county architect RJ Ash and was opened in 1968.

===Village Club===
Ashtead Village Club was founded in 1887 as a church social club for men of the parish, to provide an alternative source of entertainment to the local pubs. The club moved to its present site in 1888, but the premises were bombed in 1941 and a partial rebuilding took place in the early 1950s. The current two-storey building was opened in 1966. Women were allowed to become full members of the club in 2008.

===Whittaker&#x27;s Cottages===

Whittaker&#x27;s Cottages were constructed adjacent to the railway line in the mid-1860s and are named after a farm labourer who had owned the land before they were built. Each two-storey, semi-detached cottage measures wide and deep. Although the shared chimney and foundations are made from brick, the cottages are built primarily of timber. Imported softwood from the Baltic was used for the walls, floors, roof and cladding and hardwood was used for the infill framing. The cottages were dismantled in 1987 and were relocated to the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex.

<text>Leatherhead is a town in the Mole Valley district of Surrey, England, about south of Central London. The settlement grew up beside a ford on the River Mole, from which its name is thought to derive. During the late Anglo-Saxon period, Leatherhead was a royal vill and is first mentioned in the will of Alfred the Great in 880 AD. The first bridge across the Mole may have been constructed in around 1200 and this may have coincided with the expansion of the town and the enlargement of the parish church.

For much of its history, Leatherhead was primarily an agricultural settlement, with a weekly market being held until the mid-Elizabethan era. The construction of turnpike roads in the mid-18th century and the arrival of the railways in the second half of the 19th century attracted newcomers and began to stimulate the local economy. Large-scale manufacturing industries arrived following the end of the First World War and companies with factories in the town included Ronson and Goblin Vacuum Cleaners. Several organisations working with disabled people also opened treatment and training facilities, including The Royal School for the Blind, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Foundation and the Ex-services Welfare Society.

Towards the end of the 20th century, manufacturing in Leatherhead had begun to decline and the town was instead starting to attract service sector employers. The former industrial areas were converted to business parks, which attracted multinational companies, including Esso and Unilever. A controversial redevelopment took place in the town centre in the early 1980s, which included the construction of the Swan Centre. The work, which also included the pedestrianisation of the main shopping area, was widely blamed for a decline in the local retail economy. In 2002, the BBC identified Leatherhead as having one of the worst High Streets in England, but in 2007, the local press described the town centre as &quot;bustling&quot;.

==Toponymy==
The origins and meaning of the name &#x27;Leatherhead&#x27; are uncertain. Early spellings include &quot;Leodridan&quot; (880), &quot;Leret&quot; (1086), &quot;Lereda&quot; (1156), &quot;Ledreda&quot; (1160) and &quot;Leddrede&quot; (1195).

The name is usually thought to derive from the Old English &quot;lēode&quot; (people) + &quot;rida&quot; (a riding path or ford that can be ridden), and thus meaning &#x27;a public ford&#x27;. Richard Coates has suggested a derivation from the primitive Welsh &quot;lēd-rïd&quot; (Brittonic *letorito-) meaning &#x27;grey ford&#x27;, where the lexical field of lēd (grey) can also extend to brown, but this is not widely accepted.

==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Leatherhead is a town in central Surrey, around south of the centre of London. It lies on the southern edge of the London Basin and the highest point in the parish, at Leatherhead Downs, is above ordnance datum. The High Street runs roughly west to east and was part of the Guildford to Epsom road, which crossed the River Mole at the Town Bridge. The Mole, which passes to the west of the centre, has cut a steep-sided valley through the North Downs, south of the town.

===Geology===
Leatherhead is at the southern edge of the London Basin, where the permeable upper chalk of the North Downs dips beneath the impermeable London Clay. The difference in properties between the two formations results in a high water table and springs are found at regular intervals along the boundary between them. Several settlements were established along this spring line in Anglo-Saxon and early medieval times, including the villages of Ashtead, Fetcham and Effingham, which are linked to Leatherhead by the Guildford to Epsom road.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence of human activity in Leatherhead comes from the Iron Age. Flints, a probable well and two pits were discovered in 2012 during building work on Garlands Road and the finds suggest that the site was also used in the early Roman period. Traces of Iron Age field systems and settlement activity have been observed at Hawks Hill, Fetcham (about southwest of the town centre) and on Mickleham Downs (about to the south). Also to the south, the Druid&#x27;s Grove at Norbury Park may have been used for pre-Christian pagan gatherings.

An Anglo-Saxon settlement at Leatherhead was most likely founded on the east side of the River Mole in the second half of the 6th century. A burial ground, dating to the same period, has been identified on the west side at Hawks Hill. A second cemetery was discovered in 1984 on the site of the former Goblin factory in Ermyn Way (now the location of the offices of Esso). Excavations uncovered the remains of at least 40 individuals and the artefacts found, including knives, buckles and necklaces, suggest that they were pagan burials.

From the mid-9th century, Leatherhead was the centre of a royal vill, which encompassed Ashtead, Fetcham and Bookham. The first known reference to the settlement is in the will of Alfred the Great in 880, in which land at &quot;Leodridan&quot; was bequeathed to his son, Edward the Elder. By the 10th century, there was a minster church in Leatherhead, and the town was administered as part of the Copthorne Hundred.

===Governance===
The medieval history of Leatherhead is complex, since the parish was divided into a number of manors. The town appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Leret&quot; and was held by Osbern de Ow as a mesne lord to William I. Its Domesday assets were one church, belonging to Ewell, and of land. It was valued at an annual income of £1. To the south was the manor of Thorncroft, which was held by Richard son of Gilbert as tenant-in-chief. To the north was the manor of Pachesham, subdivided into two parts, each of which was held by a mesne lord to the tenant-in-chief, Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Finally there are sporadic mentions in surviving documents of a manor called &quot;Minchin&quot;, which may have belonged to Kilburn Priory in Middlesex.

For the majority of its history, Thorncroft Manor appears to have remained as a single, intact entity, with the exception of the subinfeudation of Bocketts Farm, which took place before 1300. In 1086, the manor was held by Richard fitz Gilbert and it passed through his family (the Clares) to his granddaughter, Margaret de Clare, who married into the de Montfitchet family of Essex. Her great-grandson, Richard de Montfichet, sold the manor to John de Cheresbure in around 1190 and it was next purchased by Philip Basset and his second wife, Ela, Countess of Warwick in around 1255. In 1266, they granted Thorncroft (which provided an income of £20 per year) to Walter de Merton, who used it to endow the college in Oxford that he had founded in 1264. Merton College remained the lords of the manor until 1904 and the continuity of ownership ensured that an almost complete set of manorial rolls from 1278 onwards has been preserved. In 1497, Richard FitzJames, the Warden of the College, authorised the expenditure of £37 for a new manor house, which was used until the Georgian era.

In contrast, the manor of Pachesham became fragmented as the Middle Ages progressed. By the time of the Domesday Book, it was already divided into two parts, the smaller of which was later referred to as &quot;Pachenesham Parva&quot;. No written record of either part of the manor survives from the subsequent 200 years, but in 1286 land belongong to Pachesham was recorded as passing to Eustace de Hacche. De Haache rebuilt the manor house in around 1293, which he enclosed with a moat. Excavations of the manor house site (now known as The Mounts) in the mid-20th century provided evidence of several medieval buildings, including a hall, a chapel and a probable stable block. The value of the manor appears to have declined in the mid-14th century and, in 1386, it was let to William Wimbledon for an annual sum of £20. In 1393, one year after a serious fire had destroyed much of Leatherhead, Wimbledon defaulted on the rent and was accused of dismantling several of the manor buildings. From the start of the 15th century, the land was divided between twelve lessees and the manor then disappears from the historical record.

Surviving records of Pachenesham Parva from around 1330 suggest that it covered an area of on the east bank of the River Mole, to the north west of the town centre. The manor appears to have remained intact through the Middle Ages and land was added to the estate as the remainder of Pachesham was broken up. By the early 17th century, the area was known as Randalls Farm and, in 1805, the associated land totalled .

Reforms during the Tudor period replaced the day-to-day administration of towns such as Leatherhead in the hands of the vestry of the parish church. The vestry was charged with appointing a parish constable, maintaining a lock-up and organising a basic fire service. Until 1834, it also administered poor relief and was responsible for building a workhouse on Kingston Road in 1808.
During the 19th century, local government reforms gradually removed the duties of running of the town&#x27;s infrastructure and services from the vestry. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 placed the workhouse in the care of a board of guardians at Epsom and the Local Government Act 1888 transferred many administrative responsibilities to the newly formed Surrey County Council. The Leatherhead Urban District Council (UDC) was formed six years later and in 1903 the county council was placed in charge of the town&#x27;s National schools. The Local Government Act 1972 created Mole Valley District Council, by combining the UDCs of Leatherhead and Dorking with the majority of the Dorking and Horley Rural District.

===Transport and communications===
Leatherhead developed at a crossing point of the River Mole at the intersection between the north–south Kingston–Dorking and east–west Epsom–Guildford roads. The original position of the ford is unclear, but it may have been around upstream of the present Leatherhead Bridge at a point where a continuation of Elm Road would meet the river.

The first indication of a bridge at Leatherhead is a local deed dated to 1250, which was witnessed by a &quot;Simon of the Bridge&quot;. Later that century, in around 1286, a Peter Dryaw of Fetcham is recorded as mortgaging the annual rent of a house &quot;at the bridge in the town of Ledderede&quot; to Merton College, Oxford. It is possible that the construction of the first bridge coincided with an expansion of the town and the enlargement of the parish church, which took place around 1200.

It is not clear to what extent the Mole was used for navigation in the past, but in the early Middle Ages, it is likely that shallow-bottomed craft were able to reach Leatherhead from the Thames for much of the year. In the late 13th century, Thorncroft Manor purchased a &quot;shout&quot;, a type of boat up to in length, used to transport produce to market. Several schemes were proposed to make the Mole navigable in the 17th and 18th centuries, but none were enacted.

The turnpike road between Epsom and Horsham, which ran through Leatherhead, was authorised by Parliament in 1755. Turnpikes to Guildford and Kingston were opened in 1758 and 1811 respectively and one of the tollhouses was sited near to the present Leatherhead Institute. Stagecoaches, which had begun to run through Leatherhead to London in the 1680s, increased in frequency after the building of the turnpikes. By 1838 there were daily coaches to Arundel, Bognor and Worthing, which typically stopped at the Swan Inn in the High Street. With the arrival of in 1847, the long-distance coaches were discontinued and horse-drawn omnibuses took over local journeys.

The first railway to arrive in Leatherhead was built by the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway Company. The line, which terminated at a station in Kingston Road, opened on 1 February 1859. Initially all trains were operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and, for the first two months, only ran as far as . The completion of the line through enabled these services to be extended to from April of the same year and, in August 1859, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) began to run trains from Leatherhead to .

The Mole Gap through the North Downs had been identified as a potential railway corridor as early as the 1830s, but the line south from Leatherhead to was not opened until 1867. The Kingston Road station, which had been laid out as a terminus, was closed and two new adjacent stations (either side of the present Station Approach) were opened. The LBSCR station, which was closer to the town centre, was initially the only one connected to the line to Dorking. It was designed by C. H. Driver in a fine Gothic Revival style and is the station that survives today. The LSWR built its station as a terminus, but its line was extended westwards to in 1885. The two railway companies were amalgamated in 1923, when the Southern Railway was formed. All railway lines through Leatherhead were electrified in 1925 and the LSWR station was closed in 1927. In the late 1930s, a southward extension of the Chessington branch line was proposed, but the creation of the Metropolitan Green Belt prevented the scheme from being enacted.
The construction of the A24 bypass (between Givons Grove and Leatherhead Common) started in 1931 and the final section opened in May 1934. Young Street (the A246 between Bocketts Farm and Givons Grove) was built by the Corps of Royal Canadian Military Engineers between June 1940 and May 1941. In October 1985, the town was joined to the UK motorway system when the M25 was opened between Wisley and Reigate.

===Commerce===
The right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair was granted to Leatherhead in 1248 by Henry III. The market place is thought to have been at the junction of Bridge Street, North Street and High Street and the town stocks were probably in the same area. The market appears to have ended in the mid-Elizabethan era, however the annual fair continued and in the late 17th century was held on 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of Mary.

The construction of the turnpikes, and later the railways, attracted wealthier residents to Leatherhead. Many of these incomers had accumulated their wealth as entrepreneurs in London and had no previous connection to the area. By the start of the Victorian era, they were beginning to influence the local economy. Small, family-based manufacturing firms began to grow, engaged in industries such as brick-making, milling of logs, tanning, shoemaking, malting and brewing. In the 1841 census, 18.5% of the town&#x27;s inhabitants were employed in agriculture-related trades, but forty years later, the proportion had fallen to 5.4%.

Larger-scale industries arrived in Leatherhead in the first half of the 20th century. In 1928, the Rayon manufacturing company opened a factory in Ermyn Way, close to the border with Ashtead parish and was replaced ten years later by the manufacturing plant for Goblin Vacuum Cleaners. Also in the 1930s, a silk-making farm and electrical cable factory were established in the town. Following the end of the Second World War, Ronson, the US-based manufacturer of cigarette lighters, opened a manufacturing plant at Dorincourt, to the north of the town. The factory moved to Randalls Road in 1953, but it closed in 1981 when the company went into liquidation. A business park opened in its place.

The Ex-services Welfare Society purchased Long House on Ermin Way following the end of the First World War. The charity constructed a factory in the grounds to provide employment for disabled veterans, producing electrical items, such as electric blankets. In 1933, the organisation opened a treatment centre at Tyrwhitt House in Oaklawn Road, named after Reginald Tyrwhitt, its president at the time. In 1981, the factory was purchased by Remploy. It continued to manufacture electrical goods, but under the new ownership, its operations expanded to include the assembly and packaging of mechanical equipment. The Remploy factory closed in 2007, with the loss of 43 jobs. The Ex-services Welfare Society, now known as Combat Stress, continues to operate its treatment centre at Tyrwhitt House in north Leatherhead.

Large-scale manufacturing in Leatherhead was short lived and, as the 20th century progressed, the town started to attract service sector industries. Among the research institutes formerly based in the town, Leatherhead Food Research was founded in 1919 and the Central Electricity Research Laboratories (CERL) opened in 1950. Both organisations left the town in the early 2000s. The Ronson and Goblin factories closed in the early 1980s and their sites were redeveloped, in the latter case for the UK headquarters of Esso. The UK head offices of Unilever (on the site of the former CERL) and Hyundai were opened in Leatherhead in 2008 and 2020 respectively.

A controversial redevelopment of the road network in the town centre took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The project began with the demolition of the Prince of Wales pub in 1979 and the Swan Centre, a covered shopping centre with a multistorey car park, was constructed in its place. At the same time a one-way system was created and the High Street was pedestrianised. By September 1981, the scheme was already attracting criticism from local traders and residents, who blamed the traffic alterations for a steep decline in footfall. In January 1983, the County Planning Officer admitted that the &quot;complexity of present routes undoubtedly detracts from the appeal of the town to car-borne shoppers.&quot; In 2002, BBC News named Leatherhead as having one of the worst High Streets in the country. Five years later, in 2007, the local press reported that the town was &quot;bustling with people, and packed full with an abundance of shops, entertainment facilities and job opportunities.&quot; The revival in fortunes was attributed to a variety of community initiatives, including a new drama festival.

===Residential development===
Leatherhead began to expand at the start of the 20th century and the population grew from in 4,694 in 1901 to 5,491 in 1911. New housing developments were built between 1900 and 1905 in Fairfield, Highlands and Kingston Roads, and Queen Anne&#x27;s Garden. Later in the decade, houses were constructed in Copthorne, Clinton, Reigate and Woodville Roads, Kingston Avenue and St Nicholas Hill.

The first council housing in the town, a development of 59 houses in Poplar Road, was built by Leatherhead UDC in 1921. Preference for rehousing was given to ex-servicemen and their families. In 1925, 90 council houses were constructed in Kingston Road. Private residential developments also occurred around the same time, including the construction of the St Mary&#x27;s Road estate, on the site of the former Elm Bank mansion, south of the town centre.

The Givons Grove estate, to the south of the town, was developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Originally a constituent of Thorncroft Manor, it was an area of arable land, known as &quot;Gibbons Farm&quot;, named after a prominent local family. In 1919, the estate was bought by the aircraft manufacturer, Humphrey Verdon Roe, whose wife, Marie Stopes, would live at Norbury Park for 20 years from 1938. It was sold to a consortium of developers in 1927, who divided the land into plots for housing. Similarly in 1935, Yarm Court was sold and the estate developed for housing.

Following the end of the Second World War, new housing was constructed to the north of the town centre, along Cleeve, Kingston and Copthorne Roads, to replace properties damaged by bombing.

===Leatherhead in the world wars===
At the start of the First World War, members of the 20th Battalion of the University and Public Schools Brigade of the Royal Fusiliers were billeted with local residents. The recruits were primarily drawn from the Manchester area and underwent training at Randalls Farm. The Kensington Rifles of the London Regiment were also garrisoned in the town in the month before their deployment to the Western Front in April 1915. Later that year, the first of 63 Belgian refugees arrived in Leatherhead, remaining in the town until the end of the war.

Concerns that the town&#x27;s water supply might be poisoned by enemy spies, prompted the authorities to arrange a guard on the waterworks on Guildford Road. Many of the duties were undertaken by the local Scout troop and members of the Boys&#x27; Brigade, which was affiliated with St Mary&#x27;s Church. Many local men joined the Dorking and Leatherhead Battalion of the Volunteer Training Corps, which was formed with the intention to defend the local area in the event of invasion. In October 1914, a Red Cross Hospital opened on Bull Hill. By March 1915 it had 33 beds and was fully occupied. It closed in February 1919. Elsewhere in the town, the Forty Foot recreation ground was used to grow wheat and Venthams, a local firm of coachbuilders, began to manufacture munitions.
Leatherhead was again a garrison town in the Second World War. Troops from the Royal Corps of Signals were billeted in late 1939 and a year later, the first Canadian soldiers began to arrive in the local area. From September 1939, children from Streatham and Dulwich were evacuated to Leatherhead and the Royal School for the Blind was taken over by King&#x27;s College Hospital. The cottage hospital on Poplar Road opened in May 1940 and by June of that year was treating 78 members of the British Expeditionary Force, who had been evacuated from Dunkirk. The Goblin factory in Ermyn Way was used to make munitions, including mine sinkers, shell fuses and camouflage netting.

From the outbreak of war, the defence of Leatherhead was coordinated by the XII Corps of Eastern Command, reinforced from July 1940 by VII Corps GHQ Mobile Reserve. The 3rd Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division was posted to Dorking and Leatherhead, and was responsible for completing the construction of Young Street between Givons Grove and Fetcham. The local unit of the Home Guard, Company F of the 6th Battalion of South Eastern Command, was formed with 200 recruits in May 1940. The training centres for the company included the Drill Hall on Kingston Road and an anti-tank obstacle was installed at the east end of the High Street, close to the Leatherhead Institute. The Home Guard company was disbanded four years later, once the threat of invasion had passed.

Leatherhead experienced two main periods of bombing during the war. The first wave of attacks took place from late 1940 until early 1941. During the first raid, early in the morning on 27 August 1940, 20 high-explosive bombs were dropped along the border with Ashtead. The clubhouse of the golf club suffered a direct hit, but the civilians taking cover in the shelter beneath it were fully protected and survived without injury. In October of the same year, the oil storage tanks next to the waterworks were set alight by an incendiary bomb. The resulting fires could not be extinguished until more than 24 hours later. In March 1941, St Andrew&#x27;s Catholic School was almost completely destroyed by a bomb. During the second period of bombing, in the summer of 1944, 16 V-1 flying bombs landed in the Leatherhead area, including one at Thorncroft Manor.

== National and local government ==
===UK Parliament===
Leatherhead is in the Epsom and Ewell parliamentary constituency.

===County council===
Councillors are elected to Surrey County Council every four years. The town is part of the &#x27;Leatherhead and Fetcham East&#x27; ward.
===District council===

Five councillors represent the town on Mole Valley District Council (the headquarters of which are in Dorking):
Leatherhead is represented by a swan on the crest of the Mole Valley District Council coat of arms.

===Twin town===
Since 2004, Leatherhead has been twinned with Triel-sur-Seine (Île-de-France, France).

==Demography and housing==

Region-wide, 28% of dwellings were detached houses and 22.6% were apartments.

The proportion of households who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Public services==
===Utilities===
The town gasworks, close to the junction of Kingston Road and Barnett Wood Lane, were built in 1850 by the Leatherhead Gas Company. The first gas was produced in February 1851 and was primarily used for street lighting, but was also supplied to some private houses. Until the railway was opened in 1859, coal was delivered by road from Epsom. In 1911, the Leatherhead company acquired that of Cobham and, from 1929, also supplied gas to Woking via a connection at . In 1936, the company was acquired by the Wandsworth Gas Company and the Leatherhead gasworks closed two years later.
The first public water supply in Leatherhead was created in 1884, when a stream-driven pumping station was constructed in Waterways Road. The works, designed by John William Grover, were capable of lifting per hour to a reservoir on Reigate Road. A second diesel-powered station was constructed alongside the first in 1935 and was later converted to electric power. The steam-powered works were demolished in 1992.

An electricity generating station was opened in Bridge Street in 1902. Initially it was capable of generating 75 kW of power, but by the time of its closure in 1941, its installed capacity was 2.2 MW. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, Leatherhead was connected to the National Grid, initially to a 33 kV supply ring, which linked the town to Croydon, Epsom, Dorking and Reigate. In 1939, the ring was connected to the Wimbledon-Woking main via a 132 kV substation at Leatherhead.

===Emergency services===
Leatherhead Police Station was on Kingston Road, to the north of the town centre. It closed in 2011. The building was demolished and retirement apartments were built on the site. In 2021, the local police force is Surrey Police and the nearest police station to the town is at Reigate. The headquarters of the Police Federation of England and Wales is in Leatherhead.
The Vestry was responsible for organising the local fire service in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The west door of the parish church was enlarged in 1759, in order to accommodate the town fire engine, which was housed in the tower. In 1821, the engine was moved to an existing building on North Street and a new fire station was built on the same road in 1859. The first motor fire engine was delivered to the town in 1926 and was housed in a new building close to the river. In 2021, the local fire authority is Surrey County Council and the statutory fire service is Surrey Fire and Rescue Service. Leatherhead Ambulance Station, in Kingston Road, is run by the South East Coast Ambulance Service.

===Healthcare===
The first hospital in Leatherhead was opened in Clinton Road in 1893. As a small cottage hospital, it only had seven or eight beds and was supervised by a matron. It closed in 1902, having accrued a debt of £130. A replacement facility, the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital (QVMH), on Epsom Road, was opened in 1905. It was built on land donated by Walter Cunliffe, who lived at Tyrells Wood. Initially it had 6 beds for adults and one cot for infants, but by 1928, it had expanded to 17 beds. The QVMH closed at the end of the Second World War.

Leatherhead Community Hospital, on Poplar Road, was opened in 1940 and was built on land donated by Charles Leach. Initially it had 40 beds and came under the management of Epsom Hospital, although it had its own medical committee. By 1960, the hospital had expanded to 52 beds, but in 2014, the in-patient wards were closed to allow the improvement of outpatient services. The NHS has retained ownership of the hospital, but many services are now run by CSH, a not-for-profit organisation. The X-ray radiography department is run by the Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust.

The nearest hospital with an A&amp;E is Epsom Hospital, away. As of 2021, the town has two GP practices, on Kingston Road and Upper Fairfield Road.

== Transport ==

Leatherhead railway station is to the west of the town centre and is managed by Southern. It is served by trains to via , to via , to via and to via .

===Buses===
Route 21 (Epsom – Leatherhead – Crawley) is run by Metrobus and route 408 (Epsom – Cobham) is run by Falcon Buses. Route 465 from Kingston upon Thames to Dorking via Leatherhead is run by London United. Route 478 to Guildford is run by Reptons Coaches and Route 479 from Epsom to Guildford via Leatherhead is run by Arriva Kent &amp; Sussex and Stagecoach.

===Long-distance footpaths===
Leatherhead station is the northern terminus of the Mole Gap Trail, which rus south through Norbury Park to Dorking station.

==Education==
===Early schools===
The earliest record of a school in Leatherhead is from 1596, when reference is made to a charity school for ten boys, which was probably held in the tower of the parish church. By 1712, the school had expanded to included eleven girls and, later that century, two bequests to fund the[salary of a schoolmaster are recorded.

In 1838 a boys&#x27; school was established in Highlands Road by the then Vicar, Benjamin Chapman, and a girls&#x27; school followed a year later. The two institutions were National schools and were funded by a combination of local subscriptions and grants from the National Society for Promoting Religious Education.

===Maintained schools===
Leatherhead Trinity School opened in 2010, having been created by a merger of three existing schools. It traces its origins to the All Saints’ School, which opened in 1877 in Kingston Road. Trinity School is a primary school and educates children up to the age of eleven.

St Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School was founded in September 1947 and was initially located next to St Peter&#x27;s Church in Garlands Road. The school&#x27;s present site in Grange Road was opened in 1958.

Therfield School was founded in Kingston Road in 1913 as the County Upper Mixed Senior School. It moved to Dilston Road in 1953 and was renamed in 1964 after John de Therfield, a former lord of the manor of Pachesham, who was awarded the land in 1205 by King John.

St Andrew&#x27;s Catholic School was founded in Grange Road in 1935 by five nuns from the Order of St Andrew. The main building was constructed in 1952 and, in 1971, the school became a co-educational comprehensive.

West Hill School is a special school for children with learning needs. It was founded at West Hill, Epsom in 1960 and moved to Leatherhead three years later. Fox Grove School, a second school for pupils with special Education Needs, opened in September 2021 in Molesey. It is due to move to Leatherhead, to a site adjacent to West Hill School, in Spring 2022.

===Independent schools===
Downsend School was founded in Hampstead in 1898 and moved to its current site in stages between 1918 and 1940. The school underwent a period of expansion in the late 1970s and 1980s, which included the purchase of pre-preparatory departments in Leatherhead, Ashtead and Epsom. In 2002, the school was sold by the Linford family (who had owned it since its opening) to Asquith Court Schools Ltd and it was bought by Cognita in 2006. In 2017, the school announced that it would build a new study centre to accommodate students studying for GCSEs.
St John&#x27;s School was founded in St John&#x27;s Wood in 1851 by Ashby Haslewood and moved to Leatherhead in 1872. Initially intended for the sons of poor clergymen, the school began to accept fee-paying pupils at the start of the 20th century. In 1989, girls were accepted into the sixth form and the school became fully coeducational from 2012. Several parts of the school are Grade II listed, including the library, formerly the chapel, which was built in 1876.

===Royal School for the Blind===
The School for the Indigent Blind was founded at St George&#x27;s Fields, Southwark in 1799 and, for the first 102 years of its existence, was based in London. In 1900, it purchased 15 acres of land in Leatherhead and construction of a new building, in Highlands Road, began the following year. The new school, capable of accommodating up to 250 students, opened in 1904. The school was granted royal patronage by George V in 1911, at which point it became known as the Royal School for the Blind.

By the mid-1930s, the focus of the school had changed from classroom-based learning to the teaching of practical skills in a workshop setting. During the Second World War, the building was requisitioned by King&#x27;s College Hospital and, although part of the premises were returned to the school in 1946, a group of Chelsea Pensioners continued to live on the site until the 1950s. A redevelopment took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which included converting the dormitories into apartments. Students were increasingly encouraged to take responsibility for their everyday living, with the aim of facilitating their integration into wider society.

The charity adopted the name &quot;SeeAbility&quot; as its operating identity in 1994 and, later in the same decade, began to transition away from offering residential education and towards providing community-based support. In the early 2000s, the main school building was sold and converted to apartments. It is now known as Lavender Court. The headquarters of the charity has since moved to Epsom.

==Places of worship==
===Anglo-Saxon minster===
The church mentioned in Domesday Book is thought to have been an Anglo-Saxon minster, a large church with a small team of priests who ministered to the royal vill and its dependent parishes. It is described as a belonging to Ewell and being held by Osbern of Eu, a prebend at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Its location in the town is unknown, but an enclave of land in the north west of the parish is recorded as belonging to Ewell in the 13th century and this may be the remnant of the glebe lands of the former minster. The church was probably a constructed from wood and, like other similar minsters, likely lost influence as Norman manors superseded the Anglo-Saxon hundreds as the principal division of local administration.

===St Mary and St Nicholas Church===

The Church of St Mary and St Nicholas is thought to have originally been built as the estate chapel for the manor of Thorncroft. Although it is not mentioned in Domesday book, the oldest parts date from around 1080 and it may have superseded the Anglo-Saxon minster as the parish church at the start of the 12th century. Shortly after 1100, it was granted to Colchester Abbey, which held it until 1279. The earliest parts of the building that survive are from the 1240s, when the church is thought to have undergone a major expansion that included the addition of side aisles. Much of the chancel dates from the first half of the 14th century and this work may have been commissioned by Leeds Priory in Kent, which was given the church by Edward III in 1341. The dedication to Mary and Nicholas, who were the joint patrons of the Priory, probably occurred at this time.

The tower was built in around 1500 and is set at an angle to the rest of the building, so that its east wall protrudes into the nave. It originally had a tall spire, which was blown down in the Great storm of 1703. A major rebuilding of the church took place in the second half of the 19th century, during which much of the roof was replaced. Renovation works between 2018 and 2020, uncovered several vaults beneath the floor including one belonging to the Boulton Family who had lived at Thorncroft Manor in the 18th century.

The churchyard contains the Commonwealth war graves of 12 British service personnel of the First and Second World Wars.

===Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Peter===
The Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Peter was constructed in 1923 and was partly financed by the newspaper proprietor, Sir Edward Hulton. The Gothic Revival building was designed by Joseph Goldie and the stained glass windows were installed in the 1930s. The Stations of the Cross were designed in Caen stone by the sculptor Eric Gill.

===Methodist Church===

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, visited Leatherhead only once in his lifetime. On 23 February 1791, he preached his final sermon in a house on Bull Hill, one week before his death. Despite his visit, there appears to have been no significant Methodist community in the town until the mid-19th century, when a small group of worshipers began meeting in Bridge Street. The first purpose-built place of worship, the &quot;Iron Chapel&quot;, so-named because it was primarily constructed of metal, was erected in 1887 on Church Road. The following year, the congregation numbered around 50, but grew rapidly to over 400 by 1891. Two years later, a new brick building, the present church, was constructed. The Iron Chapel, behind the new church, remained standing and was used for the Sunday school, but was replaced in 1903 by a new hall.

===Disciples Church===
The Disciples Church is part of the Calvary Chapel Association of evangelical churches. It was formed in 2007 and adopted its present name in 2012. It meets at the Woodlands School on Forty Foot Road.

==Culture==
===Art===
J. M. W. Turner (17751851) is among the artists who have been inspired to paint scenes of the town and local area. His pencil and watercolour composition &quot;Leatherhead, Surrey, from across the River Mole, with cattle watering in the foreground&quot; was probably created in the summer of 1797, when he staying at Norbury Park. The painting was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2014 for £35,000. Other artists who have worked in the town include John Hassell (1825) and John Varley (17781842).

The works of public art in the town include ornamental ironwork at the King George V Memorial Park and at the junction between the High Street, North Street and Bridge Street.

===Theatres and cinemas===
The first presentation of a cinematograph film in the town took place at the Leatherhead Institute in October 1898. The following year, a second screening took place at the Victoria Hall in the High Street, which had been built in 1890. By 1914, the Victoria Hall was renamed to become the Grand Theatre and was operating as a cinema with a capacity of 550. Further name changes took place before 1946, around which time the venue became known as the Ace Cinema.

In 1949, the Ace Cinema was converted to a 300-seat theatre and a year later, the Leatherhead Theatre was established at the venue. The theatre operated until 1969, but as its popularity increased, its size became restrictive and there was a need for a new and better-equipped performing arts venue in the town.

The Thorndike Theatre, in Church Street, was designed by Roderick Ham in the modernist style and was opened in 1969 by Princess Margaret. Named for the actor Sybil Thorndike, its construction was primarily paid for by private donations, with some additional funding from the Leatherhead UDC and the Arts Council. Although it was initially popular, the theatre regularly ran operating deficits and, following several years of cuts in public subsidy, it closed in 1997 with a total debt of almost £1.2 million. It reopened in 2001 as a part-time theatre, cinema, community space and meeting place for the evangelical group, Pioneer People. The annual Leatherhead Drama Festival, for amateur theatre groups, was launched at the theatre in 2004 and ran for 16 years.

===Literature===
Leatherhead features in the novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells, first published in 1897. On about the tenth day following the Martian invasion of Earth, the entire town (where the narrator has sent his wife for safety) is obliterated: &quot;it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian. He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any provocation, as a boy might crush an ant-hill, in the mere wantonness of power.&quot;

The Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; is partly set near the town. During the story, Holmes and Watson travel to Leatherhead from Waterloo station by train. It was first published in 1892 and is one of 12 featured in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle. The 1984 interactive fiction video game &quot;Sherlock&quot;, developed by Beam Software, is partly set in Leatherhead.

===Music===
The Leatherhead Operatic Society was founded as the Leatherhead Pierrots in 1904. Two years later, the group was reformed as the Leatherhead &amp; District Amateur Dramatics &amp; Operatic Society and gave its first performance, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan. The group performed at the Victoria Hall until 1922, when the venue was turned into a cinema. For the next seventeen years, the society used a number of venues in the local area, until the Crescent Cinema opened in 1939. Since 1970, the group has staged its summer performances at the Thorndike Theatre and the Leatherhead Theatre, with a brief hiatus between 1996 and 2002.

The Leatherhead Choral Society (LCS) was formed in 1907, but its early history is unclear. It was refounded in 1928 to take part in the Leith Hill Musical Festival. Kathleen Riddick conducted the group in 1939 and LCS continued to perform during the Second World War. A musical work was composed by William Blezard to celebrate the society&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1978. In recent years, the LCS has typically given concerts in the summer and in early December, as well as participating in the Leith Hill Musical Festival around Easter.

The Leatherhead Orchestra traces its origins to an adult education class established , but was formally founded in around 1958 by Kathleen Riddick. Since 2015, the group has given three concerts each year.

The Leatherhead Town Band was founded in 1887. Its activities ceased during the First and Second World Wars and, on its reformation in 1947, it was known as the Bookham and District Silver Band. In 1974, it changed its name again to the Mole Valley Silver Band, to reflect the formation of the new local authority area. The band performs regularly in and around the towns of Leatherhead and Dorking.

The band John&#x27;s Children, which included sometime frontman Marc Bolan, was formed in the town in 1963 by Andy Ellison and Chris Townson, former pupils of nearby Box Hill School. They occasionally appeared at the Chuck Wagon Club on Bridge Street.

Surrey Sound recording studio was established in 1974 by producer Nigel Gray in a former village hall in the north of the town. Early demo pieces for, among others, the Wombles and Joan Armatrading were followed, by the recording of much of the early repertoire of the Police. Other groups recording there included Godley &amp; Creme, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Rick Astley, the Lotus Eaters, Alternative TV and Bros. The studio was sold by Gray in 1987.

Robyn Hitchcock refers to Leatherhead in the song &quot;Clean Steve&quot;.

===Television and film===
Leatherhead has been mentioned in a number of films and television programmes. The film &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, released in March 2007, is partly set in the town. Brooklands College, Weybridge was used as the filming location for the fictional &quot;Leatherhead University&quot;.

Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus refers to Leatherhead in the &quot;Red Indian in Theatre&quot; sketch. Eric Idle, in Native American costume says, &quot;When moon high over prairie, when wolf howl over mountain, when mighty wind roar through Yellow Valley, we go Leatherhead Rep - block booking, upper circle - whole tribe get it on three and six each.&quot; The television sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot; took a jab at Leatherhead in series two, episode four. In one sketch, a librarian comments to a customer that she is &quot;possibly one of the stupidest people I&#x27;ve ever met. And I lived in Leatherhead for six miserable years.&quot; The house that was used as the filming location for Arthur Dent&#x27;s residence for the TV series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, is in Leatherhead.

==Sport==
===Leisure Centre===

The Leisure Centre was opened in 1975 by the Leatherhead Urban District Council and was extended in the 1980s with the addition of the Mole Barn. Plans to build a new centre on the site were drawn up by Mole Valley District Council prior to 2006, but instead the facility was given a 20-month, £12.6m refit and a further extension, which was opened by the Duke of Kent in March 2011. The upgraded centre includes a redesigned reception and entrance area, a new gym, aerobics studio, sauna and play areas. In July 2023, a report to the cabinet committee of Mole Valley District Council stated that 750,000 visits were made each year to Leatherhead Leisure Centre.

===Cricket===
Cricket has been played at Leatherhead since at least 1840, when a match is recorded against a team from Dorking. The Leatherhead Cricket Club was founded in 1850 and initially played its home games at the Kingston Road recreation ground. It moved to Fetcham Grove in the 1930s.

===Football===

Leatherhead F.C., commonly known as &quot;The Tanners&quot;, was formed in 1946 as a result of the merger of two existing clubs, Leatherhead Rose and Leatherhead United. Leatherhead Rose, founded , drew the majority of its players from the Leatherhead Common area and was named after the Rose Coffee Rooms on Kingston Road; Leatherhead United was formed in 1924 and the following season were Division One Champions of the Sutton and District League.

Following the merger, the new club adopted Fetcham Grove as its home ground and, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were champions of the Surrey County Senior League for four consecutive years. In 1969, the team won the Surrey County FA Senior Challenge Cup, the Senior Shield and the Intermediate Cup. They were semi-finalists in the 1971 and 1974 FA Amateur Cup competitions. The Tanners achieved national press coverage in the 1974–75 season, when they were drawn against First Division Leicester City at home in the FA Cup Fourth Round Proper. In the 2017–18 FA Cup they reached the second round proper, in which they played against Wycombe Wanderers.

===Golf===
The Leatherhead Club was founded as the Surrey Golf Club, but adopted its present name in 1908. The 18-hole course was designed by the Scottish golfer, Peter Paxton, and the first nine holes opened in October 1903. The Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, was one of those who played at the course in 1907. In 1928, Alf Perry joined as Club Professional and, seven years later, he won the 1935 Open Championship at Muirfield. The clubhouse suffered bomb damage during the Second World War. The construction of the M25 motorway in the late 1970s, necessitated changes to the layout of the southern part of the course.

The 18-hole Tyrells Wood Golf Course was designed by James Braid in the grounds of Tyrells Wood House in 1922. The Club opened two years later.

Pachesham Golf Centre opened in 1989 as a nine-hole course, but was remodelled in 2014 to a six-hole course. The centre has a 28-bay, floodlit driving range, which is the longest in Surrey.

Beaverbrook golf course, to the south of Leatherhead, was designed by David McLay-Kidd and Tom Watson. The 7,100 yard, 72-par course opened in the grounds of Cherkley Court in 2016. The construction of the course was opposed by local residents and environmental campaigners, who mounted a series of legal challenges to the development. Construction of the clubhouse was completed in 2018.

==Tourist attractions==
===Bocketts Farm===

Bocketts Farm covers an area of to the southwest of the town. Formerly part of the manor of Thorncroft, it was subinfeudated around 1170. Both the farmhouse and the timber-framed granary date from around 1800 and are Grade II listed. The farm was purchased by the Gowing family in 1990 and was opened to the public two years later.

===Leatherhead Museum===

Leatherhead Museum was opened in 1980 by the Leatherhead &amp; District Local History Society. It houses a wide range of historical artefacts and permanent displays explain the history of the town from its origins to the present day. Hampton Cottage, the building in Church Street in which the museum is based, dates from before 1682.

===River Mole local nature reserve===
The River Mole local nature reserve is a protected corridor that stretches along the banks for the river from Young Street (in the south) to Waterway Road (in the north). It was designated in 2005 for its diversity of plant and animal species.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
===All Saints&#x27; community café and hub===

All Saints&#x27; Church on Kingston Road was consecrated in February 1889 as a daughter church to St Mary&#x27;s. It was designed by the architect, Arthur Blomfield, and was built to serve a new area of housing under construction to the north of the town centre. On opening, the church could accommodate 300 people, but was later extended with the addition of a lady chapel. By 1980, the congregation had dwindled and the building was in need of repair. A decision was taken to convert the nave of the church to a community space, while retaining the chancel as a place of worship. The dual-purpose facility was rededicated by the Bishop of Dorking in March 1982. In 2005, the nave of the church was converted to a Youth Project Café, known as &quot;B Free&quot;, to be a space for young people to meet and socialise. In 2014, the Leatherhead Youth Project, launched a new social enterprise at the church called &quot;AllSaints&quot;. The project supports disadvantaged young people, especially those not in education, employment or training, and provides opportunities for participants to gain employment and life skills.

===Cherkley Court===

Cherkley Court was constructed in around 1870 for Abraham Dixon, a wealthy industrialist from the Midlands. It was substantially rebuilt after a fire in 1893 and was sold in 1910 to Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, the Canadian-born owner of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Following the death of Beaverbrook&#x27;s son in 1985, the estate was owned by the Beaverbrook Foundation until 2011, when it was bought by a consortium of private investors. Despite considerable local opposition, the house was converted to a luxury hotel, spa and golf course, which opened in 2017.

===Cradlers===

The building at 33 and 35 High Street, commonly known as &quot;Cradlers&quot;, is a late-medieval open hall house, formerly owned by the Manor of Thorncroft. It most likely originated as a farmhouse and was built on the edge of one of the common fields. Although the earliest surviving records of the building date from 1527, the construction methods used suggest that it was built in the 13th or 14th century (most likely between 1320 and 1360). The western part of the building (now number 33) was constructed as a single-storey hall, but the height of the walls was later raised and an upper floor inserted. The larger eastern part (number 35) was built as two storeys from the outset. In the late medieval period, the rooms closest to the street were probably used as living quarters, but the northernmost third of the wing may have contained a workshop and hayloft.

Although much of its original timber frame survives, Cradlers has been altered at several points in its history. In the 17th century, a chimney stack and internal staircase were added and the roof was rebuilt around the same time, probably reusing used timbers from other buildings. In the early modern period, Cradlers may have served as a tavern or hostelry and at different times in the 19th and 20th centuries, it housed a butchers, a fruiterers and a ladies&#x27; outfitters. As part of a renovation project carried out in the mid-1980s, the modern shopfronts were removed and the street-facing frontage was restored to its original position.

===Leatherhead Institute===

The Leatherhead Institute was built in 1892. It was given to the town by Abraham Dixon, who wanted the building to be used to provide educational, social and recreational opportunities to local residents. During the Second World War, it housed the local Food and Fuel Offices. A major restoration project was completed in 1987.

===Running Horse pub===

The Running Horse pub, at the east end of Leatherhead Bridge, is one of the oldest buildings in the town. It is a late-medieval open hall house and was part of the Manor of Thorncroft. Much of the timber frame is original and probably dates from the late 15th century, although the roof was later rebuilt. Later alterations include the insertion of the first floor in the 17th century and installation of interior panelling in the 18th century.

===Sweech House===
The timber-framed Sweech House, on Gravel Hill, is one of the oldest buildings in Leatherhead. Its name is thought to derive from &quot;switch&quot;, indicating that it stood close to a road junction. The land on which it stands may have belonged to the manor of Minchin during the late-medieval period. The southernmost part of the building is the oldest and dates from the 15th century. It was probably constructed as a farmhouse and originally it had an open hall structure. In the late 16th century, it was extended to the north in two separate phases. At different points in its history, the building has been divided into up to four cottages, most likely to provide accommodation for farm labourers. Sweech House was donated to the Leatherhead Countryside Protection Society in the 1940s.

===The Mansion===

The Mansion, in Church Street, houses the public library, register office and council offices. A map of the town from 1600 shows a house on the site, which may formerly have been the manor house for the manor of Minchin. During the late Elizabethan period, it was the home of Edmund Tylney, Master of the Revels, in effect the official censor of the time. and Elizabeth I is thought to have dined with him in Leatherhead in August 1591.

The external appearance of The Mansion largely dates from 1739, when the house was rebuilt in red brick, although a partial remodelling took place . From 1846 until some point in the 1870s, the building was used as a boarding and day school for around 50 boys, who were taught using the Jacotot education system. In 1949, The Mansion was subject to a compulsory purchase order and was acquired by Surrey County Council and Leatherhead UDC for use as a health clinic and the public library. During a refurbishment in 2000, the library was moved from the ground floor to the south range and the space released was repurposed for the Registry Office.

===Thorncroft Manor house===
The current Thorncroft Manor house was designed by the architect, Robert Taylor, for the politician and businessman, Henry Crabb-Boulton. It is built in a Neo-Palladian style, influenced by the early Rennaissence, with light Rococo ornamentation. The building was enlarged with the addition of a rear wing in 1789, possibly designed by George Gwilt. The engineering firm, Howard Humphreys &amp; Sons, purchased the house in 1971 and subsequently constructed additional office space, glazed with reflective glass.

===War memorial===

The war memorial in North Street was designed by Stock, Page and Stock, a London firm of architects and was dedicated in April 1921. It consists of a long, single-storey building with 11 open arches, constructed of brick and flint. The arches face a terraced garden, in which there is a free-standing cross made of Portland stone. The land on which the memorial stands was given to the town by Charles Leach, who funded much of the building work and whose son had been a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards. In total, 186 names are inscribed on stone tablets inside the cloister-like structure, of whom 117 died in the First World War. The memorial is protected by a Grade II listing.

===Wesley House===
The Art Deco Wesley House, on Bull Hill, was built in 1935 as the offices of the Leatherhead Urban District Council (UDC). It was designed by the architects C. H. Rose and H. R. Gardner and was constructed of red brick. The original council chamber is preserved at the rear of the property. Wesley House was vacated by the UDC in 1983, when it became part of Mole Valley District Council.

==Parks and open spaces==
===King George V memorial gardens===
The memorial gardens on Bull Hill, to the north of the town centre, were opened in 1936, following the death of George V. The site is managed by Mole Valley District Council and has been protected by the Fields in Trust charity since 1938.

===Leach Grove Wood===
Leach Grove Wood is a area of woodland, adjacent to Leatherhead Hospital, owned by the NHS. It is named after Charles Leach, who donated the land on which the hospital is built, to the town. In 2013, a group of local residents applied to register the wood as a village green, to guarantee public access to the site in perpetuity. The registration was upheld by the High Court in 2018. The NHS subsequently successfully appealed against the registration at the Supreme Court and the village green status was removed.

===Mansion Gardens===

The Mansion Gardens is a small formal garden between The Mansion and the River Mole.

===Park Gardens===
The Park Gardens form the frontage to St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church at the north end of Gimcrack Hill. The site has been protected by the Fields in Trust charity since 2018. In the gardens, there is a memorial stone to Harold Auten, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in September 1918.

===Recreation grounds===
There are two recreation grounds in Leatherhead. The Fortyfoot ground contains a children&#x27;s playground and a football pitch, as well as the bowling green for Leatherhead Bowling Club. The playground was upgraded in 2017 and includes a sensory garden, a trampoline and a zip line.
The Kingston Road ground has a children&#x27;s playground, football pitch, pavilion and a sensory garden. A new skatepark was installed at the ground in 2017–18, part-funded by a £20,000 donation by the London Marathon Charitable Trust. The skatepark adjacent to Leatherhead Leisure Centre was refurbished in 2020.

<text>A Thorne–Żytkow object (TŻO or TZO), also known as a hybrid star, is a conjectured type of star wherein a red giant or red supergiant contains a neutron star at its core, formed from the collision of the giant with the neutron star. Such objects were hypothesized by Kip Thorne and Anna Żytkow in 1977. In 2014, it was discovered that the star HV 2112, located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), was a strong candidate, though this view has since been refuted. Another possible candidate is the star HV 11417, also located in the SMC.

== Formation ==

A Thorne–Żytkow object would be formed when a neutron star collides with another star, often a red giant or supergiant. The colliding objects can simply be wandering stars, though this is only likely to occur in extremely crowded globular clusters. Alternatively, the neutron star could form in a binary system when one of the two stars goes supernova. Because no supernova is perfectly symmetric, and because the binding energy of the binary changes with the mass lost in the supernova, the neutron star will be left with some velocity relative to its original orbit. This kick may cause its new orbit to intersect with its companion, or, if its companion is a main-sequence star, it may be engulfed when its companion evolves into a red giant.

Once the neutron star enters the red giant, drag between the neutron star and the outer, diffuse layers of the red giant causes the binary star system&#x27;s orbit to decay, and the neutron star and core of the red giant spiral inward toward one another. Depending on their initial separation, this process may take hundreds of years. When the two finally collide, the neutron star and red giant core will merge. If their combined mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, then the two will collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, the two will coalesce into a single neutron star.

If a neutron star and a white dwarf merge, this could form a Thorne–Żytkow object with the properties of an R Coronae Borealis variable.

== Properties ==

The surface of the neutron star is very hot, with temperatures exceeding 109 K, hotter than the cores of all but the most massive stars. This heat is dominated either by nuclear fusion in the accreting gas or by compression of the gas by the neutron star&#x27;s gravity. Because of the high temperature, unusual nuclear processes may take place as the envelope of the red giant falls onto the neutron star&#x27;s surface. Hydrogen may fuse to produce a different mixture of isotopes than it does in ordinary stellar nucleosynthesis, and some astronomers have proposed that the rapid proton nucleosynthesis that occurs in X-ray bursts also takes place inside Thorne–Żytkow objects.

Observationally, a Thorne–Żytkow object may resemble a red supergiant, or, if it is hot enough to blow off the hydrogen-rich surface layers, a nitrogen-rich Wolf–Rayet star (type WN8).

A TŻO has an estimated lifespan of 105–106 years. Given this lifespan, it is possible that between 20 and 200 Thorne-Żytkow objects currently exist in the Milky Way.

The only way to unambiguously determine whether or not a star is a TŻO is a multi-messenger detection of both the gravitational waves of the inner neutron star and an optical spectrum of the metals atypical of a normal red supergiant. It is possible to detect pre-existing TŻOs with current LIGO detectors; the neutron star core would emit a continuous wave.

== Dissolution ==

It has been theorized that mass loss will eventually end the TŻO stage, with the remaining envelope converted to a disk, resulting in the formation of a neutron star with a massive accretion disk. These neutron stars may form the population of isolated pulsars with accretion disks. The massive accretion disk may also collapse into a new star, becoming a stellar companion to the neutron star. The neutron star may also accrete sufficient material to collapse into a black hole.

== Observation history ==

In 2014, a team led by Emily Levesque argued that the star HV 2112 had unusually high abundances of elements such as molybdenum, rubidium, lithium, and calcium, and a high luminosity. Since both are expected characteristics of Thorne–Żytkow objects, this led the team to suggest that HV 2112 might be the first discovery of a TZO. However, this claim was challenged in a 2018 paper by Emma Beasor and collaborators, who argued that there is no evidence for HV 2112 having any unusual abundance patterns beyond a possible enrichment of lithium and that its luminosity is too low. They put forth another candidate, HV 11417, based on an apparent over-abundance of rubidium and a similar luminosity as HV 2112.

<text>In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal;
that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix by producing another matrix, often denoted by (among other notations). 

The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. In the case of a logical matrix representing a binary relation R, the transpose corresponds to the converse relation RT.

== Transpose of a matrix ==

=== Definition ===

The transpose of a matrix , denoted by , , , formula_1, , , or , may be constructed by any one of the following methods:
#Reflect over its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right) to obtain 
#Write the rows of as the columns of 
#Write the columns of as the rows of 

Formally, the -th row, -th column element of is the -th row, -th column element of :

:formula_2

If is an matrix, then is an matrix. 

In the case of square matrices, may also denote the th power of the matrix . For avoiding a possible confusion, many authors use left upperscripts, that is, they denote the transpose as . An advantage of this notation is that no parentheses are needed when exponents are involved: as , notation is not ambiguous.

In this article, this confusion is avoided by never using the symbol as a variable name.

==== Matrix definitions involving transposition ====

A square matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a &quot;symmetric matrix&quot;; that is, is symmetric if
:formula_3

A square matrix whose transpose is equal to its negative is called a &quot;skew-symmetric matrix&quot;; that is, is skew-symmetric if
:formula_4

A square complex matrix whose transpose is equal to the matrix with every entry replaced by its complex conjugate (denoted here with an overline) is called a &quot;Hermitian matrix&quot; (equivalent to the matrix being equal to its conjugate transpose); that is, is Hermitian if
:formula_5

A square complex matrix whose transpose is equal to the negation of its complex conjugate is called a &quot;skew-Hermitian matrix&quot;; that is, is skew-Hermitian if
:formula_6

A square matrix whose transpose is equal to its inverse is called an &quot;orthogonal matrix&quot;; that is, is orthogonal if
:formula_7

A square complex matrix whose transpose is equal to its conjugate inverse is called a &quot;unitary matrix&quot;; that is, is unitary if
:formula_8

=== Examples ===
*formula_9

*formula_10

* formula_11

=== Properties ===

Let and be matrices and be a scalar. 

* formula_12
*:The operation of taking the transpose is an involution (self-inverse).
*formula_13
*:The transpose respects addition.
*formula_14
*:The transpose of a scalar is the same scalar. Together with the preceding property, this implies that the transpose is a linear map from the space of matrices to the space of the matrices.
*formula_15
*:The order of the factors reverses. By induction, this result extends to the general case of multiple matrices, so 
*formula_16
*:The determinant of a square matrix is the same as the determinant of its transpose.
*The dot product of two column vectors and can be computed as the single entry of the matrix productformula_17
*If has only real entries, then is a positive-semidefinite matrix.
*formula_18
*: The transpose of an invertible matrix is also invertible, and its inverse is the transpose of the inverse of the original matrix.&lt;br&gt;The notation is sometimes used to represent either of these equivalent expressions.
*If is a square matrix, then its eigenvalues are equal to the eigenvalues of its transpose, since they share the same characteristic polynomial.
*formula_19 for two column vectors formula_20 and the standard dot product.
*Over any field formula_21, a square matrix formula_22 is similar to formula_23.
*:This implies that formula_22 and formula_23 have the same invariant factors, which implies they share the same minimal polynomial, characteristic polynomial, and eigenvalues, among other properties.
*:A proof of this property uses the following two observations.
*:* Let formula_22 and formula_27 be formula_28 matrices over some base field formula_21 and let formula_30 be a field extension of formula_21. If formula_22 and formula_27 are similar as matrices over formula_30, then they are similar over formula_21. In particular this applies when formula_30 is the algebraic closure of formula_21.
*:*If formula_22 is a matrix over an algebraically closed field in Jordan normal form with respect to some basis, then formula_22 is similar to formula_23. This further reduces to proving the same fact when formula_22 is a single Jordan block, which is a straightforward exercise.

=== Products ===
If is an matrix and is its transpose, then the result of matrix multiplication with these two matrices gives two square matrices: is and is . Furthermore, these products are symmetric matrices. Indeed, the matrix product has entries that are the inner product of a row of with a column of . But the columns of are the rows of , so the entry corresponds to the inner product of two rows of . If is the entry of the product, it is obtained from rows and in . The entry is also obtained from these rows, thus , and the product matrix () is symmetric. Similarly, the product is a symmetric matrix.

A quick proof of the symmetry of results from the fact that it is its own transpose:
:formula_42

=== Implementation of matrix transposition on computers ===
On a computer, one can often avoid explicitly transposing a matrix in memory by simply accessing the same data in a different order. For example, software libraries for linear algebra, such as BLAS, typically provide options to specify that certain matrices are to be interpreted in transposed order to avoid the necessity of data movement.

However, there remain a number of circumstances in which it is necessary or desirable to physically reorder a matrix in memory to its transposed ordering. For example, with a matrix stored in row-major order, the rows of the matrix are contiguous in memory and the columns are discontiguous. If repeated operations need to be performed on the columns, for example in a fast Fourier transform algorithm, transposing the matrix in memory (to make the columns contiguous) may improve performance by increasing memory locality.

Ideally, one might hope to transpose a matrix with minimal additional storage. This leads to the problem of transposing an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix in-place, with O(1) additional storage or at most storage much less than &quot;mn&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; ≠ &quot;m&quot;, this involves a complicated permutation of the data elements that is non-trivial to implement in-place. Therefore, efficient in-place matrix transposition has been the subject of numerous research publications in computer science, starting in the late 1950s, and several algorithms have been developed.

== Transposes of linear maps and bilinear forms ==
As the main use of matrices is to represent linear maps between finite-dimensional vector spaces, the transpose is an operation on matrices that may be seen as the representation of some operation on linear maps.

This leads to a much more general definition of the transpose that works on every linear map, even when linear maps cannot be represented by matrices (such as in the case of infinite dimensional vector spaces). In the finite dimensional case, the matrix representing the transpose of a linear map is the transpose of the matrix representing the linear map, independently of the basis choice.

=== Transpose of a linear map ===
Let denote the algebraic dual space of an -module . 
Let and be -modules. 
If is a linear map, then its algebraic adjoint or dual, is the map defined by . 
The resulting functional is called the pullback of by . 
The following relation characterizes the algebraic adjoint of 
: for all and 
where is the natural pairing (i.e. defined by ). 
This definition also applies unchanged to left modules and to vector spaces.

The definition of the transpose may be seen to be independent of any bilinear form on the modules, unlike the adjoint (below).

The continuous dual space of a topological vector space (TVS) is denoted by . 
If and are TVSs then a linear map is weakly continuous if and only if , in which case we let denote the restriction of to . 
The map is called the transpose of . 

If the matrix describes a linear map with respect to bases of and , then the matrix describes the transpose of that linear map with respect to the dual bases.

=== Transpose of a bilinear form ===
Every linear map to the dual space defines a bilinear form , with the relation . 
By defining the transpose of this bilinear form as the bilinear form defined by the transpose i.e. , we find that . 
Here, is the natural homomorphism into the double dual.

=== Adjoint ===
If the vector spaces and have respectively nondegenerate bilinear forms and , a concept known as the adjoint, which is closely related to the transpose, may be defined:

If is a linear map between vector spaces and , we define as the adjoint of if satisfies
:formula_43 for all and .

These bilinear forms define an isomorphism between and , and between and , resulting in an isomorphism between the transpose and adjoint of . 
The matrix of the adjoint of a map is the transposed matrix only if the bases are orthonormal with respect to their bilinear forms. 
In this context, many authors however, use the term transpose to refer to the adjoint as defined here.

The adjoint allows us to consider whether is equal to . 
In particular, this allows the orthogonal group over a vector space with a quadratic form to be defined without reference to matrices (nor the components thereof) as the set of all linear maps for which the adjoint equals the inverse.

Over a complex vector space, one often works with sesquilinear forms (conjugate-linear in one argument) instead of bilinear forms. 
The Hermitian adjoint of a map between such spaces is defined similarly, and the matrix of the Hermitian adjoint is given by the conjugate transpose matrix if the bases are orthonormal.

<text>Tottenham Court Road is an interchange station in the West End of London for London Underground and Elizabeth line services. 

The London Underground station is served by the Central and Northern lines. On the Central line, the station is between Oxford Circus and Holborn stations. On the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, it is between Goodge Street and Leicester Square stations. The Elizabeth line station is between Bond Street and Farringdon stations.

The station is located at St Giles Circus, the junction of Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road and is in Travelcard Zone 1, with a second entrance at Dean Street.

==History==

===Central London Railway===
The station opened as part of the Central London Railway (CLR) on 30 July 1900. From that date until 24 September 1933, the next station eastbound on the Central line was the now-defunct ; the next stop in that direction is now . The platforms are under Oxford Street west of St Giles&#x27; Circus and were originally connected to the ticket hall via lifts at the east end of the platforms. The original station building was on the south side of Oxford Street and was designed in common with other CLR stations by Harry Bell Measures. The building and its neighbours were demolished in 2009.

===Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway===
The Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR, now part of the Northern line) arrived here on 22 June 1907 but used the name Oxford Street until an interchange (linking the eastbound Central line with the southbound Northern line via the ends of the platform) was opened on 3 September 1908 from when the present name was used for both lines. The next station north on the Northern line was originally called Tottenham Court Road, but was renamed to at this time.

The original ticket office was directly beneath St Giles circus and was accessed from stairs on three street corners around the Circus. Its original lift shafts and emergency stairs are still extant. A set of emergency stairs can be used as access down to the ends of the Northern line platform. The lift shafts are used for offices and station facilities.

===Early improvements===
Like a number of other central area stations, Tottenham Court Road underwent improvements during the 1920s to replace the original sets of lifts with escalators. Works commenced in 1923; a new subsurface ticket hall, under St Giles Circus, was constructed and the escalators came into service on 28 September 1926 (upper set) and 1 February 1926 (lower set). A shaft for three escalators was driven from the ticket hall under the junction down to the east end of the Central line platforms ending at an intermediate circulation space. A further pair of escalators descend from this level to the north end of the Northern line platforms. The lifts were removed and the redundant shafts were used as ventilation ducts. In 1938 a chiller plant began operating at the station. This was decommissioned in 1949.

Passenger congestion entering and leaving the Northern line platforms was partially eased by the addition of a short single escalator at the centre of the platform leading up to a passageway linking to the intermediate circulation area. However, this was in itself a cause of congestion, as traffic trying to leave the station from the Northern line found itself in the path of traffic entering and travelling to the Central line.

In the early 1980s, the entire station was redecorated, losing the distinctive Leslie Green-designed platform tiling pattern of the Yerkes tube lines (which included the CCE&amp;HR), and the plain white platform tiles of the CLR. It was replaced by distinctive mosaics by Eduardo Paolozzi, located on platforms, passages and escalator entrances.

===Initial plans for station expansion ===
The station had four entrances to the sub-surface ticket hall from the north-east, south-west and north-west corners of the junction and from a subway beneath the Centre Point building which starts on Andrew Borde Street. The entrances were frequently congested leading to occasions during peak periods of the day when they were briefly closed to prevent overcrowding in the station.

In the aftermath of the King&#x27;s Cross fire in 1987, London Underground was recommended to investigate &quot;passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action&quot;. A Parliamentary bill was tabled in 1991 to permit London Underground to improve and expand the frequently congested station, however this was not proceeded with. In 2000, London Underground consulted on a station upgrade including a new larger ticket hall, new escalators and step free access, which would have taken 4 years to construct.

=== Expansion as part of Crossrail ===

The station was eventually reconstructed and upgraded in the mid 2010s as part of the Crossrail project to construct the Elizabeth line, with the £500million station upgrade taking eight years. To enable the station expansion work to occur, both the Astoria theatres and the original Central line entrance were demolished. During construction, the Central and Northern lines were alternately closed for several months to allow for upgrade works to take place.

Upon completion in 2017, the project delivered:

* A new ticket hall six times larger than previous, located below St Giles Circus and the forecourt of Centre Point
* New public plaza outside Centre Point, with station entrances designed by Hawkins\Brown
* New dedicated set of escalators to access the Northern line
* New and expanded passageways underground
* Escalators down to the eastern end of the future Elizabeth line station.
* Step-free access throughout the station
* Restoration of existing artwork by Eduardo Paolozzi, and a new artwork in the ticket hall by Daniel Buren

On Dean Street, a dedicated western entrance and ticket hall was built to access the new Elizabeth line platforms. These platforms stretch for between the two ticket halls, underneath Soho Square. The completed western entrance and Crossrail platforms were handed over to TfL in early 2021. Crossrail links Tottenham Court Road to Canary Wharf, Abbey Wood, Stratford, and Shenfield in the east with Paddington, Heathrow and Reading in the west. The central section of the Elizabeth line opened on 24 May 2022 between Paddington and Abbey Wood. Direct service to Reading, Heathrow, Stratford and Shenfield commenced on 6 November 2022.

As part of a plan to raise £500million from development above new Crossrail stations, a residential development of 92 homes as well as retail units will be built above the western ticket hall by developer Galliard Homes and a new West End theatre as well as retail and office space will be built above the eastern ticket hall by developer Derwent London. The new theatre will be the first West End theatre to open in over 50 years.

== Artworks ==

In the mid 1980s, Eduardo Paolozzi was commissioned to create an artwork for the station. The design includes panels of tessellated and hand-cut smalti mural mosaic, and is a distinct and noticeable feature of the station. The frenetic design was intended to reflect the station&#x27;s position adjacent to Tottenham Court Road&#x27;s large concentration of hi-fi and electronics shops. During the expansion of the station for Crossrail, sections of the mosaic were restored, moved or replaced while other section were destroyed, some sections of which have been removed to be conserved at the University of Edinburgh.

As part of the expansion of the Eastern ticket hall, Art on the Underground commissioned an artwork by Daniel Buren, a French conceptual artist. This work, &quot;″Diamonds and Circles&#x27;, works &#x27;in situ″&quot;, was Buren&#x27;s first permanent public commission in the UK. It comprises colourful diamond and circle shapes, which contrast with Buren&#x27;s trademark stripes in black and white, fixed to internal glass walls throughout the ticket hall. The artwork was completed in 2017.

As part of the Crossrail project, two artworks were commissioned by Turner Prize–winning artists, one for each ticket hall. At the eastern ticket hall, Richard Wright created a mural of geometric patterns in gold leaf on the concrete ceiling above the Crossrail escalators. At the western ticket hall, Douglas Gordon installed a video artwork above the escalators, involving Gordon&#x27;s giant blinking eye with names of Soho establishments that no longer exist reflected in it.

== Services ==
Services at Tottenham Court Road are operated by the Elizabeth line, and London Underground&#x27;s Central and Northern lines.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

The station also served by a night service on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Tube. The station is served by Central line trains every 10 minutes in each direction and Northern line trains every 7-8 minutes in each direction.

== Future developments ==
=== Crossrail 2 ===
The Crossrail 2 project proposed a station at Tottenham Court Road, the only planned interchange between the Elizabeth line and Crossrail 2. The expanded station built as part of the Crossrail project took the future demands of Crossrail 2 into account, which will allow for less construction disruption if the line is built. The proposals involve a new Crossrail 2 ticket hall on the site of Curzon Soho on Shaftesbury Avenue. This has been criticised by campaigners. The station and ticket hall site were first safeguarded as part of the route during the development of the Chelsea-Hackney line in 1991. In November 2020, plans for Crossrail 2 were shelved.

==In popular culture==

* The station was used for a sequence in the 1981 film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;.
* A scene in the 2008 film &quot;The Bank Job&quot; is set in the station, though it was shot at Aldwych tube station.
* A scene in the musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; is set in the station; the musical played across the street at the Dominion Theatre from 2002 to 2014.

==Connections==
London Buses day and night routes serve the station.

<text>The Bluebell Railway is an heritage line in West Sussex in England. It is managed by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society. It uses steam trains which operate between and , with intermediate stations at and .

It is the first preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world to operate a public service. The society ran its first train on 7 August 1960, less than three years after the line from East Grinstead to Lewes had been closed by British Railways.

On 23 March 2013, the Bluebell Railway started to run through to its new terminus station. At East Grinstead there is a connection to the national rail network, the first connection of the Bluebell Railway to the national network in 50 years, since the Horsted Keynes – line closed in 1963.

Today the railway is managed and run largely by volunteers. Having preserved a number of steam locomotives even before steam stopped running on British mainline railways in 1968, today it has over 30 steam locomotives, the 2nd largest collection in the UK after the National Railway Museum. The Bluebell also has almost 150 carriages and wagons, most of them pre-1939.

== History ==

In 1877 an act of Parliament authorised construction of the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway (L&amp;EGR). The line was sponsored by local landowners, including the Earl of Sheffield. A year later another act enabled the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company (LB&amp;SCR), chaired by Samuel Laing, to acquire and operate the line.

The line had six stations, but only Barcombe was within walking distance of a village. Chailey parish had two stations, one at and the other at . It was customary for a rural line supported by a company or individuals to have stations close to the residences of its sponsors. Thus Sheffield Park station was built for the Earl of Sheffield, and Newick and Chailey for Newick Park and Reedens, the homes of two other sponsors. The other stations were at , and . A branch ran from a junction at Horsted Keynes to and on the LB&amp;SCR main line.

The 1877 and 1878 acts included a clause that:

This imposed a legal requirement to provide a service, and the only way to remove this obligation was to pass another act.

Designed under instructions from LB&amp;SCR Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the line was constructed to take double track. However, only the section between East Grinstead and Horsted Keynes (and thence to Haywards Heath via Ardingly) was laid as such; south of the junction at Horsted Keynes the line was single track with passing loops at stations. The line was opened in 1882.

Goods traffic on the line consisted of local produce; milk: farm products and coal, and timber to and from Albert Turner &amp; Son, a sawmill. The only time Sheffield Park received a substantial number of passengers was when Lord Sheffield entertained the Australian cricket team, with a match between them and Lord Sheffield&#x27;s own team.

===Accident===
On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing were killed when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead. The couple walked along the railway on a dark rainy night. When the train got to Horsted Keynes, the guard found a raincoat covered with blood on the engine. Another coat was found near two bodies in the middle of the tracks. The ganger who found them told the inquest the couple must have been walking with their backs to the train.

&quot;There was a very heavy squall at the time and the couple would probably have not heard a thing,&quot; he said. The coroner said Ronald and Winifred were trespassing and no blame could be attached to any railway worker. Little more than a week after they were married, the couple&#x27;s funeral was at St Giles&#x27; Church, Horsted Keynes, where they are buried together in a grave marked by a War Graves Commission headstone.

===Closure===
In 1954, long before the Beeching Axe, the branch line committee of British Railways proposed closing the line from East Grinstead to Culver Junction near Lewes. This was challenged by local residents, but closure was agreed in February 1955 for 15 June 1955, although the line closed on 29 May due to a rail strike. An acrimonious battle between British Railways and the users of the Bluebell Line then ensued, and lasted three years.

Shortly after closure, Margery Bessemer of Chailey discovered in the 1877 and 1878 acts the clause relating to the &quot;Statutory Line&quot;, and demanded British Railways reinstate services. On 7 August 1956 British Railways reopened the line, with trains stopping at stations mentioned in the acts. British Railways took the case to the House of Commons in 1957, resulting in a public inquiry. British Railways were censured, but later the Transport Commission persuaded Parliament to repeal the special section of the act. By this means the line was finally closed on 17 March 1958.

==Preservation==

On 15 March 1959 a group that included the future president of the society, Bernard Holden, met in Ardingly and formed the &quot;Lewes and East Grinstead Railway Preservation Society&quot;. The society elected John Leroy as the first chairman, and £940 was raised in donations to start the society. On a vote at the meeting, the society changed its name to the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society.

The society&#x27;s initial aim was to reopen the whole line from East Grinstead to Culver Junction as a commercial service, using a two-car DMU. The plans came to nothing: the society failed to buy the whole line, and most local residents were not interested. The committee then recommended that the stretch of track between Sheffield Park and Horsted Keynes could be run as a tourist attraction, with vintage locomotives and stock operated by unpaid volunteer staff.

===Sheffield Park to Horsted Keynes===
As BR still ran an electrified line from Horsted Keynes to Ardingly, the society leased a stretch of track from BR just south of this. In 1960, the interim line was opened, running from Sheffield Park to Bluebell Halt, south of Horsted Keynes. In 1962, the society extended services to Horsted Keynes. Also in 1962, a halt was opened at Holywell (Waterworks). However, this was closed the following year. BR withdrew passenger services from Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath in 1963; and with complete closure of the line north of Horsted Keynes, the Bluebell Line was severed from the BR system.

===Horsted Keynes to Kingscote===
In 1974 the society purchased the freehold of the demolished West Hoathly station, allowing the first steps to be taken towards an extension northwards towards East Grinstead station. It then purchased the freehold of the site of Kingscote station in January 1985. These efforts culminated in a public inquiry, with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and Transport giving planning permission and a Light Railway Order for an extension to East Grinstead in 1985.

The Bluebell Railway Preservation Society completed the extension from Horsted Keynes to Kingscote in April 1994, re-laying track through Sharpthorne Tunnel, which at is the longest on a UK heritage railway. At the north end of Sharpthorne Tunnel, the line passes through the site of the former West Hoathly railway station. It was demolished in 1967, but remains of the platforms and goods dock are still visible.

2010 marked the Bluebell&#x27;s 50th anniversary of running trains. To mark the event, the railway held a gala over 6–8 August 2010 with all available home engines and two visitor engines. Some of the society&#x27;s founder members gathered at Horsted Keynes to mark the arrival of a commemorative LB&amp;SCR A1X class No.55 &quot;Stepney&quot;-hauled steam train. The entourage then travelled towards Sheffield Park.

===Kingscote to East Grinstead via Imberhorne===

From its inception, the society had always planned to work northwards towards East Grinstead, where the line would connect with the national network. BR donated Imberhorne Viaduct to the railway in 1992, but the purchase of the final pieces of the by then privately owned track bed north to East Grinstead was only completed in 2003, allowing physical civil engineering activity to be undertaken from that year.

A major problem was the former landfill site in the cutting just south of Imberhorne Viaduct. It had been filled with domestic waste by East Grinstead Town Council in the 1960s and 1970s, but tests undertaken by contractors working for both the society and the borough council found the of waste within the cutting were not toxic.

The excavated clay-cap covering the landfill site was taken south by rail, to fill the site of a removed viaduct and embankment on the old Ardingly spur. In January 2008 agreement was given to start clearing foliage on the section of the tip between Imberhorne Lane and Hill Place bridges. In a public launch event, BBC newsreader Nicholas Owen—a local resident and society volunteer—started removal of the actual waste on 25 November 2008.

Initially rubbish was removed from the site by lorry, but, due to the substantial volume and cost of about £45/tonne, in 2009 a trial removal of spoil by rail was carried out by DB Schenker Rail (UK). At £25,000 per train and now undertaken by GB Railfreight, this practice continued periodically as funds became available. However, an increase in the landfill tax was announced in 2008, and this was due to take effect from April 2012. It would increase the cost of removal from £25/tonne to £90/tonne. So the society formed an appeal to complete the removal of the landfill waste by the end of March 2012. With the receiving site changed to Appleford, Oxfordshire and thanks to the &quot;tenner for the tip&quot; appeal, the cash target was met and the rubbish was removed by rail in time.

In autumn 2008 work started on site clearance at East Grinstead for construction of the new station about south of the national rail station. At the railway&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration weekend in 2010, East Sussex resident Dame Vera Lynn launched a £3.8 million appeal; the greater part of this amount would be put towards reconnecting the line to East Grinstead. Mid Sussex District Council responded with a one-off donation of £50,000 towards the reconnection.

On 7 March 2013, the last section of track was formally joined using a white fishplate, with the honour of tightening the four bolts being given to Barbara Watkins, a long-standing Bluebell Railway volunteer. The extension to East Grinstead was officially opened on Saturday 23 March, with a two-week opening festival starting that day.

===West: Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath via Ardingly===
Originally built as a double-track line, it was electrified in the 1930s, with 2-NOL units used for the Seaford-Horsted Keynes service. The line between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly was operated as single-track in its final years, with 2-BIL/Class 401 and 2-HAL/Class 402 units. The second track was left in place and used for carriage storage, most notably the new Kent Coast electric stock prior to its introduction and later the steam-hauled stock that it replaced.

After the line&#x27;s closure in 1963, the trackbed was purchased in its entirety by a member of the local gentry. In the 1990s the society bought the abandoned trackbed west between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly from his estate. This included up to the Hanson Aggregates depot built on the former Ardingly railway station site.

The society plans to reconnect the line with Network Rail at Copyhold Junction, to allow access to the London to Brighton Main Line. Stations could either be located at Copyhold or Haywards Heath. There is a proposal that the line could be restored as third rail electrified, allowing operation of the society&#x27;s electric stock.

While the Lywood Tunnel remains in good condition, there are two major areas of work that would be required to re-open the line, these being the replacement of a short girder-bridge span bridge and the Sheriff Mill Viaduct, which was demolished in 1969. The removed clay-cap from Imberhorne cutting has been deposited on the banks of the former Sherriff Mill viaduct to allow later bridging of the gap. Also in 2013, the former Tewkesbury and Malvern Railway bridge that crossed over the M50 motorway were donated to the railway for eventual installation in the replacement bridge.

===South: Sheffield Park to Lewes===
By the late Victorian era, Lewes station was the convergence point of three lines from the East Sussex coast and three lines to the north all of which reached London via Croydon. Today, Lewes has a line to the north which joins the Brighton main Line at Burgess Hill and from there on to Gatwick Airport, East Croydon and London, a line west towards Brighton, a line south to Newhaven and Seaford, and a line east to Eastbourne, Hastings and Ashford.

Originally the Bluebell Line was the straightest and quickest route from Lewes to London. The Bluebell Railway ran directly south from Sheffield Park to Culver Junction (at Culver Farm just south of Barcombe Mills), with intermediate stations at and . At Culver Junction it joined the 1858 Wealden Line (part of which is now restored as the nearby Heritage Lavender Line), thereby gaining access to Lewes. The section from East Grinstead to Culver Junction was closed in 1958, and the Lewes to Uckfield line in 1969 by British Rail.

Bluebell supporters and committee members have expressed interest in re-building the line south by three more stations to Lewes. However, a substantial number of large civil engineering obstacles and intrusions onto the former trackbed make this a difficult project to envisage the completion of. For execution, the project would require:
*The bridging of the raised, widened and re-aligned A275 road immediately south of Sheffield Park
*The re-excavation of waste-infill under the former road bridges just south of Sheffield Park and Barcombe stations
*The in-filling since of the cutting and former route under the A272 road
*The re-excavation of waste-infill at the former , which includes industrial waste producing large amounts of methane gas discharges
*The fact that a large private housing estate has been built on and surrounding the former Newick and Chailey site
The remaining undeveloped line from Lewes to Sheffield Park has been safeguarded as a bridleway and footpath.

== Stations ==

The various stations have been restored to show different periods of the railway&#x27;s life:
*Sheffield Park has been restored to a Victorian ambience, as it would have appeared during the time of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (up to 1922)
*Horsted Keynes emulates the Southern Railway from 1923 to 1947
*West Hoathly (if built) will emulate the British Railways of the late 1940s
*Kingscote echoes the British Railways of the 1950s
* East Grinstead is an amalgam of British Railways of the 1950s and 1960s

== Rolling stock ==
The Bluebell Railway preserved a number of steam locomotives before the cessation of steam service on British mainline railways in 1968. Today it has the largest collection - over 30 - of steam locomotives in the UK after the National Railway Museum (NRM). The society also has a collection of almost 150 carriages and wagons, most of them pre-war. A project is under way to recreate a long-lost type of locomotive (LB&amp;SCR H2 class Atlantic) from a few surviving parts.

In April 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund provided a £2.8M grant towards new buildings next to , to provide weatherproof shelter for up to 17 carriages. The funds were also used to: create a museum and interpretation area; create new facilities for locomotive crews; create a rainwater catchment system from the roof of the carriage building, which is then processed and used to fill the steam engines&#x27; boilers; restore the railway&#x27;s historic platform buildings.

==Twinning==
The Bluebell Railway is twinned with the Museumstoomtram Hoorn – Medemblik, which links Hoorn and Medemblik, North Holland, the Netherlands.

<doc id="173848" wikidata="Q268305" url="?curid=173848" title="Anna Laetitia Barbauld">
<text>Anna Laetitia Barbauld (, by herself possibly , as in French, Aikin; 20 June 1743 – 9 March 1825) was a prominent English poet, essayist, literary critic, editor, and author of children&#x27;s literature. A prominent member of the Blue Stockings Society and a &quot;woman of letters&quot; who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career that spanned more than half a century. 

She was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative writer of works for children. Her primers provided a model for more than a century. Her essays showed it was possible for a woman to be engaged in the public sphere; other women authors such as Elizabeth Benger emulated her. Barbauld&#x27;s literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of the enlightenment and of sensibility, while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of British Romanticism. Barbauld was also a literary critic. Her anthology of 18th-century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today.

The publication of &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; in 1812, which criticised Britain&#x27;s participation in the Napoleonic Wars, received negative reviews after which she continued to write poetry but not publish in the public sphere. Barbauld&#x27;s reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children&#x27;s writer in the 19th century, and largely forgotten in the 20th, until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.

==Sources==
Much of what is known about Barbauld&#x27;s life comes from two memoirs, the first published in 1825 and written by her niece, Lucy Aikin, and the second published in 1874, written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist. However, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the London Blitz in 1940.

==Early life==

Barbauld was born on 20 June 1743 at Kibworth Harcourt in Leicestershire to Jane and John Aikin. She was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as &quot;Nancy&quot; (a nickname for Anna). She was baptised by her mother&#x27;s brother, John Jennings, in Huntingdonshire two weeks after her birth. Barbauld&#x27;s father was headmaster of the Dissenting academy in Kibworth Harcourt and minister at a nearby Presbyterian church. 

She spent her childhood in what Barbauld scholar William McCarthy describes as &quot;one of the best houses in Kibworth and in the very middle of the village square&quot;. She was much in the public eye, as the house was also a boys&#x27; school. The family had a comfortable standard of living. McCarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders, well-to-do tradesmen, and manufacturers. At Barbauld&#x27;s father&#x27;s death in 1780, his estate was valued at more than £2,500.

Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773: &quot;For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with.&quot; Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin&#x27;s memoir, what resulted was &quot;a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve&quot; in Barbauld&#x27;s character. Barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would focus on issues central to women, and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the 18th century.

Barbauld demanded that her father teach her the classics and after much pestering, he did. She had the opportunity to learn not only Latin and Greek, but French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unnecessary for women at the time. Barbauld&#x27;s penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism. The two were never so close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld&#x27;s mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter, &quot;I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall&quot;.

Barbauld&#x27;s brother, John Aikin, described their father as &quot;the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every thing that could command love and veneration&quot;. Barbauld&#x27;s father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her only sibling during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship: &quot;How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years!&quot;.

In 1758, the family moved to Warrington Academy, halfway between the growing industrial cities of Liverpool and Manchester, where Barbauld&#x27;s father had been offered a teaching position. Some of the founders of the academy were members of Octagon Chapel, whose creedless and liberal &quot;Liverpool Liturgy&quot; formed a starting point for her beliefs and writings The Academy drew many luminaries of the day, such as the natural philosopher and Unitarian theologian Joseph Priestley, and came to be known as &quot;the Athens of the North&quot; for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere. 

Another instructor may have been the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. School records suggest he taught French there in the 1770s. He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld – he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and marry her. Archibald Hamilton Rowan also fell in love with Barbauld, describing her later as &quot;possessed of great beauty, distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health; her features regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy.&quot;

==First literary successes and marriage==

In 1773, Barbauld brought out her first book of poems, after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish them. The collection, entitled simply &quot;Poems&quot;, went through four editions in a single year and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of &quot;Poems&quot; alone. In the same year, she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published &quot;Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose&quot;, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to those of Samuel Johnson.

In May 1774, despite some &quot;misgivings&quot;, Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld (1749–1808), the grandson of a French Huguenot and a former pupil at Warrington. According to Barbauld&#x27;s niece, Lucy Aikin:
After the wedding, the couple moved to Suffolk, near where Rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys. Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the Psalms, a common pastime in the 18th century, publishing them as &quot;Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job&quot;. Attached to this work is her essay &quot;Thoughts on the Devotional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments&quot;, which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in institutionalising religion.

It seems that Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own, and in 1775, after only a year of marriage, Barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children:

After a time, her brother conceded and the couple adopted Charles. It was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books: &quot;Lessons for Children&quot; (1778–79) and &quot;Hymns in Prose for Children&quot; (1781). He studied surgery in Norwich under the tutelage of Philip Meadows Martineau, the son of Barbauld&#x27;s friend Sarah Martineau whose granddaughter, Harriet Martineau, recalled that as a child, Barbauld, a &quot;comely elderly lady&quot;, had visited the Martineau family home.

==Palgrave Academy==
Barbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk which had benefitted from the financial support of Philip Meadows (1719–83), a solicitor from nearby Diss. Early on, Barbauld was responsible not only for running her own household, but also the school&#x27;s, to which she served as accountant, maid, and housekeeper. The school opened with only eight boys, but the number had risen to about forty by the time the Barbaulds left in 1785, which reflects the excellent reputation the school had acquired. 

The Barbaulds&#x27; educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of &quot;fines and jobations&quot; and even, it seems likely, &quot;juvenile trials&quot;, that is, trials run by and for the students themselves. Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundation subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys, and geography, history, composition, rhetoric and science to higher grade levels. 

She was a dedicated teacher, producing a &quot;weekly chronicle&quot; for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform. Barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students. One who went on to great success was William Taylor, a pre-eminent scholar of German literature, who referred to Barbauld as &quot;the mother of his mind&quot;.

==Political involvement and Hampstead==
In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave for a tour of France. By this time Rochemont&#x27;s mental health was deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. 

Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often boarded one or two pupils recommended by personal friends. Barbauld lived on Hampstead&#x27;s Church Row in the early 1800s, though it is not known exactly which house she occupied.

During this time, the heyday of the French Revolution, Barbauld published her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, &quot;An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts&quot; (see Test Act). Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. 

In 1791, after William Wilberforce&#x27;s attempt to abolish the slave trade had failed, Barbauld published her &quot;Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade&quot;, which not only lamented the fate of the enslaved, but warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British people could expect if they did not abolish slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled &quot;Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation&quot; which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: &quot;We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them&quot;.

==Stoke Newington and later life==
In 1802, the Barbaulds moved to Stoke Newington, where they lived at 113 Church Street. Rochemont took over the pastoral duties of the Unitarian Chapel at Newington Green, a mile away. Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother, John, as her husband&#x27;s mind was rapidly failing. Rochemont developed a &quot;violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her. One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window.&quot; 

Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld&#x27;s great sadness and real danger, but she refused to leave him. Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby New River in 1808 and his widow was overcome with grief. When she returned to writing, she produced the radical poem &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; (1812), which depicted England as a ruin. 

It was reviewed so viciously that according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, there &quot;were no further separate publications from her pen&quot;, and Lucy Aikens went so far as to say, erroneously, that Barbauld gave up writing altogether. 

McCarthy explains that Barbauld &quot;did not entirely withdraw from print or from writing&quot;, but that she withdrew into &quot;the waters of a deep and long depression&quot;. Barbauld confessed that her pen had been lazy in 1813, but after that year she wrote as many as three &quot;dialogues&quot; and an &quot;Ode to Remorse&quot;. Until the 2010s, &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; was considered to have ended Barbauld&#x27;s career, but recent scholarship has reinstated it to the Literature of Romantic literature as well as Barbauld&#x27;s reputation as a poet of the period. It is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement. 

Barbauld died in 1825, a renowned writer, and was buried in the family vault in St Mary&#x27;s, Stoke Newington. After her death, a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription:
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
In Memory of
ANNA LETITIA BARBAULD,
Daughter of John Aikin, D.D.
And Wife of
The Rev. Rochemont Barbauld,
Formerly the Respected Minister of this Congregation.
She was born at Kibworth in Leicestershire, 20 June 1743,
and died at Stoke Newington, 9 March 1825.
Endowed by the Giver of all Good
With Wit, Genius, Poetic Talent, and a Vigorous Understanding
She Employed these High Gifts
in Promoting the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice,
of Civil and Religious Liberty,
of Pure, Ardent, and Affectionate Devotion.
Let the Young, Nurtured by her Writings in the Pure Spirit
of Christian Morality;
Let those of Maturer Years, Capable of Appreciating
the Acuteness, the Brilliant Fancy, and Sound Reasoning
of her Literary Compositions;
Let the Surviving few who shared her Delightful
and Instructive Conversation,
Bear Witness
That this Monument Records
No Exaggerated Praise.
&lt;/poem&gt;


==Legacy==
At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; as &quot;unquestionably the first [&quot;i.e.&quot;, best] of our female poets, and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers&quot; and the &quot;Imperial Magazine&quot; declared &quot;so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so long will the name of this lady be respected&quot;. She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson. 

By 1925, however, she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism in the academic world of the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.

Young poets such as Norwich&#x27;s Amelia Opie greatly admired Barbauld, sending her poetry in 1787 for her to critique. However, by the early 19th century, Barbauld&#x27;s remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape had taken place. This is due to a number of reasons. One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, poets who in their youthful, radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration, but in their later, conservative years dismissed her work. 

Once these poets had become canonised, their opinions held sway. Moreover, the intellectual ferment of which Barbauld was an important part of – particularly at the Dissenting academies – had by the end of the 19th century come to be associated with the &quot;philistine&quot; middle class, as Matthew Arnold put it. The reformist 18th-century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age. Finally, the Victorians viewed Barbauld as &quot;an icon of sentimental saintliness&quot; and &quot;erased her political courage, her tough mindedness, [and] her talent for humor and irony&quot;, to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised.

As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it. According to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman – one who was angry, who resisted the gender roles of her time, and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories. Indeed, it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that Barbauld had contributed. 

H. P. Lovecraft praised her Gothic fragment &quot;The Story of Sir Bertrand&quot; in his essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; (composed 1925–34), describing it as a story &quot;in which the strings of genuine terror were truly touched with no clumsy hand&quot; and praises &quot;the real vibration to the note of outer darkness and mystery which distinguishes Mrs. Barbauld’s fragment.&quot;

Barbauld&#x27;s works fell out of print and no full-length scholarly biography of her was written until William McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Letitia Barbauld: Voice of the Enlightenment&quot; in 2009.

Barbauld&#x27;s adopted son Charles married a daughter of Gilbert Wakefield. Their child, Anna Letitia Le Breton, wrote literary memoirs, which included a &quot;Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, including Letters and Notices of her Family and Friends&quot; in 1874.

In 2008, the National Portrait Gallery in London presented Barbauld&#x27;s portrait alongside a number of other celebrated Bluestockings.

==Literary analysis==
===Poetry===

Barbauld&#x27;s wide-ranging poetry has been read primarily by feminist literary critics interested in recovering women writers important in their own time, but forgotten in literary history. Isobel Armstrong&#x27;s work represents one way to do such a study; she argues that Barbauld, like other Romantic women poets:

In her subsequent analysis of &quot;Inscription for an Ice-House&quot; Armstrong points to Barbauld&#x27;s challenge of Edmund Burke&#x27;s characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and Adam Smith&#x27;s economic theories in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; as evidence for this interpretation.

The work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers. They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere. As a woman and a dissenter, Barbauld had a unique perspective on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary. Ross points out, however, that women were in a double bind: &quot;They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable &#x27;feminine&#x27; decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda&quot;. So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote occasional poems. These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, but by the end of the 18th century were increasingly serious and personal. Women wrote sentimental poems, a style then much in vogue, on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life, they would establish a moral foundation for the nation. Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine Romanticism.

===Political essays and poems===
According to 18th century studies scholar Harriet Guest, Barbauld&#x27;s most significant political texts are: &quot;An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts&quot; (1790), &quot;Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade&quot; (1791), &quot;Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation&quot; (1793), and &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; (1812). As Harriet Guest explains, &quot;The theme Barbauld&#x27;s essays of the 1790s repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms&quot;.

For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters had been attempting to convince Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which limited the civil rights of Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after &quot;nine years of silence&quot;. Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone. It opens, &quot;We thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them&quot;. She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: &quot;We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects&quot;. Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British nationalism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip Britons in extending liberty.

In the following year, after one of William Wilberforce&#x27;s many abolitionist legislation failed to pass in the British Parliament, Barbauld wrote the &quot;Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade&quot; (1791). In the work, Barbauld lambasted Parliament for their rejection of abolitionist legislation, along with castigating the slave trade; the work focused on the supposed degeneracy of a West Indian planter and his wife which revealed the failings of the &quot;colonial enterprise: [an] indolent, voluptuous, monstrous woman&quot; and a &quot;degenerate, enfeebled man&quot;.

In 1793, when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: &quot;Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?&quot;. Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, &quot;Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation&quot;, on the moral responsibility of the individual. For her, each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state, and while she argues that &quot;insubordination&quot; can undermine a government, she admits there are lines of &quot;conscience&quot; that cannot be crossed in obeying a government. 

In &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; (1812), written after Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars, Barbauld presented a shocking Juvenalian satire; she argued that the British Empire was waning and the American Empire waxing. It is to America that Britain&#x27;s wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become a mere empty ruin. She tied this decline directly to Britain&#x27;s participation in the Napoleonic Wars:
Not surprisingly, this pessimistic view of the future was poorly received: &quot;Reviews, whether in liberal or conservative magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive&quot;. E. J. Clery states that Barbauld deliberately invited controversy to stir up public debate over the &quot;government war policy and ... specifically [over] the system of trade blockades&quot;. The blockade policy was indeed changed in 1812, with a resulting improvement in trade. Clery&#x27;s 2017 study of &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Eleven&quot; recognizes Barbauld as contributing to this outcome and calls for replacing the image of her as a victim of reviewers with an image of her as an agent of change. But Barbauld was always mindful of the human cost of politics. Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war, she wrote to a friend, &quot;I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte, when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s literature===

Barbauld&#x27;s &quot;Lessons for Children&quot; and &quot;Hymns in Prose for Children&quot; made a revolution in children&#x27;s literature. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them, and even more importantly, she developed a style of &quot;informal dialogue between parent and child&quot; that would dominate children&#x27;s literature for a generation. In &quot;Lessons for Children&quot;, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. It is more than likely that many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld&#x27;s experience of teaching her own son, Charles. The series is far more than a way to acquire literacy – it also introduces the reader to &quot;elements of society&#x27;s symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility&quot;. Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of &quot;botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy.&quot; The series was relatively popular. Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, &quot;Practical Education&quot; (1798): it is &quot;one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared&quot;.

Some at the time saw Barbauld&#x27;s work as marking a shift in children&#x27;s literature from fantasy to didacticism. Sarah Burney, in her popular novel &quot;Traits of Nature&quot; (1812), has the 14-year-old Christina Cleveland remark, &quot;Well, then; you know fairy-tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school-rooms. Mrs. Barbauld, and Mrs. Trimmer, and Miss Edgeworth, and a hundred others, have written good books for children, which have thrown poor Mother Goose, and the Arabian Nights, quite out of favour; – at least, with papas and mamas.&quot; A more strident criticism was made by the Lambs, telling of Mary&#x27;s abortive search for a copy of &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot;, which her brother claimed was because &quot;Mrs. Barbauld&#x27;s stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery&quot;.

&quot;Lessons for Children&quot; and &quot;Hymns in Prose&quot; had, for children&#x27;s books, an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Jane Taylor, they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren. Children&#x27;s literature scholar William McCarthy states, &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still quote the opening lines of &quot;Lessons for Children&quot; at age thirty-nine&quot;. Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld&#x27;s children&#x27;s books and believed that she was wasting her talents, Barbauld herself saw such writing as noble and encouraged others to follow her. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, &quot;She gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard&quot;. In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large-scale Sunday school movement, Ellenor Fenn to write and design a series of readers and games for middle-class children, and Richard Lovell Edgeworth to begin one of the first systematic studies of child development, which would culminate in an educational treatise authored by Maria Edgeworth and him, and in a large body of children&#x27;s stories by Maria.

Barbauld also collaborated with her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series &quot;Evenings at Home&quot; (1793). It is a miscellany of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: &quot;curiosity, observation, and reasoning&quot;. For example, the stories encourage the learning of science through hands-on activities: in &quot;A Tea Lecture&quot; the child learns that tea-making is &quot;properly an operation of &quot;chemistry&quot;&quot; and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow. The text also emphasises rationality: in &quot;Things by Their Right Names&quot;, a child demands that his father tell him a story about &quot;a bloody murder&quot;. The father does so, using some of the fictional tropes of fairy tales such as &quot;once upon a time&quot;, but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all &quot;had steel caps on&quot;. In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments &quot;I do not know of any &quot;murders&quot; half so bloody&quot;. Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally, along with the anti-war message of this tale, prevail throughout &quot;Evenings at Home&quot;. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, argued that the series encouraged readers to &quot;become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority&quot;. This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, &quot;&quot;Evenings at Home&quot;... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family&quot;. 

According to Lucy Aikin, Barbauld&#x27;s niece, Barbauld&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Evenings at Home&quot; consisted of the following pieces: &quot;The Young Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Wasp and Bee&quot;, &quot;Alfred, a drama&quot;, &quot;Animals and Countries&quot;, &quot;Canute&#x27;s Reproof&quot;, &quot;The Masque of Nature&quot;, &quot;Things by their right Names&quot;, &quot;The Goose and Horse&quot;, &quot;On Manufactures&quot;, &quot;The Flying-fish&quot;, &quot;A Lesson in the Art of Distinguishing&quot;, &quot;The Phoenix and Dove&quot;, &quot;The Manufacture of Paper&quot;, &quot;The Four Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Live Dolls&quot;.

===Editorial work===
Barbauld edited several major works towards the end of her life, all of which helped to shape the canon as known today. First, in 1804, she edited Samuel Richardson&#x27;s correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the 18th century. Her &quot;212-page essay on his life and works [was] the first substantial Richardson biography&quot;. The following year she edited &quot;Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay&quot;, a volume of essays emphasising &quot;wit&quot;, &quot;manners&quot; and &quot;taste&quot;. In 1811, she assembled &quot;The Female Speaker&quot;, an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls. Because, according to Barbauld&#x27;s philosophy, what one reads when one is young is formative, she carefully considered the &quot;delicacy&quot; of her female readers and &quot;direct[ed] her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties, the employments, and the dispositions of the softer sex&quot;. The anthology is subdivided into sections such as &quot;moral and didactic pieces&quot; and &quot;descriptive and pathetic pieces&quot;; it includes poetry and prose by, among others, Alexander Pope, Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, Samuel Johnson, James Thomson and Hester Chapone.

Barbauld&#x27;s 50-volume series of &quot;The British Novelists&quot;, published in 1810 with a broad introductory essay on the history of the novel, allowed her to place her mark on literary history. It was &quot;the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims&quot; and was in every respect &quot;a canon-making enterprise&quot;. In an insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For her, a good novel is &quot;an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery&quot;. Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits. Not only is it a &quot;domestic pleasure&quot;, but it is also a way to &quot;infus[e] principles and moral feelings&quot; into the population. Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series.

<text>The Dominion Theatre is a West End theatre and former cinema on Tottenham Court Road, close to St Giles Circus and Centre Point, in the London Borough of Camden. Planned as primarily a musical theatre, it opened in 1929, but the following year became a cinema—it hosted the London premiere of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;City Lights&quot; with Chaplin in attendance—and in 1933 after liquidation of the controlling company was sold to Gaumont cinema chain, which later became part of the Rank Organisation. It was a major premiere cinema until the 1970s, when it began to host live concerts.

In January 1981 it once more became primarily a live performance venue, and has since hosted many musicals, notably &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; which ran from 2002 to 2014. It also hosted the Royal Variety Performance seven times in the 1990s and early 2000s. It became a listed building in 1988 and after being saved from redevelopment, was sold to Apollo Leisure Group and subsequently to the Nederlander Organization. In the 21st century it has been extensively refurbished and renovated, including reclaiming spaces that had been turned into offices.

On Sundays Hillsong Church London holds services in the theatre.

==Building==
Construction of the Dominion Theatre began in March 1928 with a design by W and TR Milburn and a budget of £460,000. The site was the location of the 1911 Court Cinema and the 1746 Horse Shoe Brewery, established in 1746. The Horse Street Brewery was the site of the 1814 London Beer Flood. The first performance was on 3 October 1929. The theatre is Renaissance revival in style; the Tottenham Court Road façade features a ground level entry sheltered by a broad marquee with the second through fourth levels framed by large pilasters. The central portion is concave and faced with Portland stone. A three-bay bow window extends the height of the second and third storeys and is surmounted by a sculpture of two gryphons, behind which are three square openings with decorative iron grates.

The theatre was intended primarily for musical comedies and secondarily as a cinema. It originally had a seating capacity of 2,835: 1,340 in the stalls, 818 in the dress circle and 677 in the balcony (upper circle). The balcony was closed in the 1950s; , capacity is 2,069 in two tiers of galleries. The theatre retains its 1920s light fittings and art deco plasterwork. A café was originally above the entrance.

==History==
The first production at the Dominion was the Broadway musical &quot;Follow Through&quot;, which closed after 148 performances. The first film was the British premiere of 1925&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with added sound, on 21 July 1930, which was attended by H. G. Wells. Associated British Cinemas took over the theatre in October 1930 and subsequently leased it to United Artists, and in February 1931 it hosted the London premiere of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;City Lights&quot;, with Chaplin himself attending and speaking from the stage, but a financial slide led to liquidation of the company on 30 May 1932.

The Dominion had already been somewhat adapted to cinema use, with removal of cloakrooms and bars. In January 1933 it was sold to Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, which in 1940 was acquired by Rank. Gaumont installed a three-manual, 12-rank Compton organ; Frederic Bayco, principal organist for Gaumont, was organist in residence and other organists who played there included Felton Rapley and William Davies. During the Second World War, the building was damaged in the Blitz; it reopened in 1941, but the organ was not restored until October 1945, when Jackie Brown became resident organist. John Logie Baird made the first demonstration of his system for transmitting live television to cinemas over a landline at the Dominion in 1937, and in December that year began regular large-screen colour transmissions that formed part of the Dominion&#x27;s variety shows.

After the war, the carpenter&#x27;s shop, the upper floors of dressing rooms and the café were converted to office space. Live shows recommenced in the late 1950s: Bill Haley and the Comets opened their UK tour there in February 1957, and &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; ran for a month in late 1957. But it remained primarily a cinema. It closed in February 1958 for the installation of a Todd-AO system with two Philips 70 mm / 35 mm projectors and a wide screen; at this time the upper circle was closed and also became offices. The film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; opened on 21 April 1958 and played for four years and 22 weeks, grossing $3.9 million. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor appeared at the European opening of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, which played for almost two years. From 29 March 1965 to 29 June 1968, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was screened at the Dominion, the longest run of screenings of the film at any venue in the world. George Lucas″ &quot;Star Wars&quot; had its UK premiere jointly at the Dominion and the then Leicester Square Theatre in 1977, and its sequels &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; also premiered at the Dominion.
In the 1970s, the Dominion returned to hosting concerts; since 8 November 1981 it has been primarily used for live performances. It was where Tangerine Dream recorded the album &quot;Logos&quot; in 1982, which contains a tribute tune called &quot;Dominion&quot;. Dolly Parton filmed her 1983 concert at the Dominion and released it as a television special, &quot;Dolly in London&quot;. Other performers to appear during this era included Duran Duran, Adam and The Ants, Billy Bragg, Bon Jovi, The Boomtown Rats, Boy George, David Bowie, Ian Drury and the Blockheads, Manfred Mann, Ricky Skaggs, Sinead O&#x27;Connor, The Stranglers, Thin Lizzy, U2 and Van Morrison. In 1986, the interior was painted black for the musical &quot;Time&quot;, which ran for two years. After a legal dispute, Rank sold the theatre to developers who sought to demolish it; in 1988 it became a Grade II listed building, and following protests, a public enquiry halted the demolition in 1990. Rank leased the theatre back from the developers and then sold it to Paul Gregg Apollo Leisure Group; in 1992 it was acquired by the New York-based Nederlander Organization, with Apollo Leisure retaining a financial interest and operating the theatre on behalf of Nederlander Dominion Ltd.

Since the early 1990s the Dominion has hosted several musicals including a new production of &quot;Grease&quot; by David Ian and Paul Nicholas, &quot;&quot;, Matthew Bourne&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, a return of &quot;Grease&quot;, and &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;. The Dominion also hosted the Royal Variety Performance from 1992 through 1996 and in 2000 and 2001.

The stage musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, based on the songs of Queen and created by guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor together with British comedian Ben Elton, opened at the Dominion on 14 May 2002. Scheduled to close in October 2006 before embarking on a UK tour, it was extended indefinitely by popular demand and ultimately ran for 12 years, closing on 31 May 2014. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the production, in 2012 the theatre converted an area previously devoted to Judy Garland memorabilia into the &quot;Freddie Mercury Suite&quot;, which displays pictures from the Queen singer&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1999, SFX Entertainment acquired Apollo Leisure and in 2001 Clear Channel Entertainment, part of the US-based multinational, purchased SFX. Clear Channel spun-off its venues as Live Nation UK, who operated them on behalf of Nederlander. On 23 October 2009 the Nederlander Organization took full control of the Dominion, buying out Live Nation.

An extensive programme of refurbishment and restoration of the theatre was begun in the 21st century. In 2008 the area above the main foyer was reclaimed as &#x27;The Studio&#x27;, a rehearsal and audition space. In 2011 the original link to the building on Great Russell Street now known as Nederlander House was restored, providing theatre management offices and creating boardroom or conference space on the top floor where the 1929 plans had indicated a boardroom. In 2014, during a 15-week closure after the end of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, both the interior and the exterior were extensively refurbished, including restoring architectural features on the Tottenham Court Road façade, such as the gryphons, which are believed to have been removed in 1932, cleaning and replacing stonework and windows at the rear and updating much of the backstage facilities, including the flying system. In 2017, renovations were completed with the unveiling of a new double-sided LED screen, the largest and highest-resolution projecting screen on the exterior of a West End theatre.

Since re-opening on 16 September 2014 for the completion of renovations, the Dominion Theatre has been home to a number of short run musicals and spectaculars, including &quot;Evita&quot; (September 2014) and the London premiere of &quot;Elf&quot; (October 2015). From February to April 2016, it hosted a &quot;re-imagined&quot; production of Jeff Wayne&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. From March 2017 to January 2018, it housed &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.

In addition to hosting musicals in recent years, the theatre was home to the London auditions of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and has hosted a number of regular charity events, including MADTrust&#x27;s West End Eurovision (2012, 2013, 2014) and &quot;West End Heroes&quot; (2013, 2014, 2015), which brought together stars from current West End Shows, with musicians, from all the armed forces. The second event, in 2014, was hosted by Michael Ball.

The organ was separated from its console and for some years was in a church in Llanelli. It was purchased by a collector in 2002 and is to form part of the collection of The Music Palace, a museum of cinema organs in Porth.

<text>Tottenham Court Road (occasionally abbreviated as TCR) is a major road in Central London, almost entirely within the London Borough of Camden.

The road runs from Euston Road in the north to St Giles Circus in the south; Tottenham Court Road tube station lies just beyond the southern end of the road. Historically a market street, it became known for selling electronics and white goods in the 20th century.

The street takes its name from the former manor (estate)which was the location of a royal court at timesof Tottenham Court, whose lands lay toward the north and west of the road, in the parish of St Pancras. Tottenham Court had no direct connection with the district of Tottenham (which is now in the London Borough of Haringey).

==Geography==

Tottenham Court Road runs from Euston Road in the north to St Giles Circus (the junction of Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road) at its southern end, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km). The road lies almost entirely within the London Borough of Camden near its boundary with the City of Westminster.

South of Torrington Place (originally Francis Street) the road marks the traditional boundary of the parishes of St Pancras (of which the manor of Tottenham Court was part) to the west, and St Giles to the east (due to longstanding shared administrative arrangements, St Giles is often described as a part of Bloomsbury). North of Torrington Place, both sides of the road are in St Pancras.

The term &quot;Fitzrovia&quot; was first coined in the late 1930s as an informal description for some of the surrounding area. Tottenham Court Road is sometimes used to distinguish Fitzrovia to the west from Bloomsbury to the east (St Giles often being thought of as part of Bloomsbury). Fitzrovia has never had any formal limits applied, and its informal extent is sometimes also said to extend further east to Gower Street, thus potentially overlapping with the more formal definitions applied to St Giles and Bloomsbury.

The south end of the road is close to the British Museum and to Centre Point, the West End&#x27;s tallest building. There are a number of buildings belonging to University College London along the road, and University College Hospital is near the north end of the road.

==History==
The origin of the road&#x27;s name is that it is the road to the Manor of Tottenham Court. The manor house lay just to the north of the road&#x27;s junction with Euston Road.

===Manor of Tottenham Court===
The first surviving record of the manor is, as Þottanheale, from a charter from around AD 1000. The initial &#x27;Þ&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;th&#x27;) may have been a mistake by the scribe, who should perhaps have used a &#x27;T&#x27;: all subsequent records use an initial &#x27;T&#x27;. The manor was subsequently described as &quot;Totehele&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The area was described as &quot;Totenhale&quot; in 1184 and &quot;Totenhale Court&quot; by 1487. Although the road&#x27;s name has a similar word root to Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey, the two are not directly related.



The manor occupied the south-western part of the parish of St Pancras, whose boundaries are now used to delineate most of the south-west of the wider modern London Borough of Camden, of which St Pancras is the principal component. South of Torrington Place, &quot;Tottenham Court&quot; (and therefore St Pancras) lay between Tottenham Court Road and what is now the borough boundary with the City of Westminster. North of Torrington Place, &quot;Tottenham Court&quot; (and hence also St Pancras) occupied both the east and west sides of the road. The manor house lay just to the north of what is now Euston Road (which was not built until 1756).

The manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In the time of Henry III (1216–1272), a manor house slightly north-west of what is now the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Euston Road belonged to one William de Tottenhall. In about the 15th century, the area was known variously as &quot;Totten&quot;, &quot;Totham&quot;, or &quot;Totting Hall&quot;. After changing hands several times, the manor was leased for 99 years to Queen Elizabeth I, and it came to be popularly called &quot;Tottenham Court&quot;. In 1639, the land was leased to Charles I; following his execution ten years later, it was sold to Ralph Harrison.

It regained Crown ownership upon the Restoration of the monarchy, where it was given a 41-year lease to Charles II.

===Urbanisation===
The manor became the property of the Fitzroys, who built Fitzroy Square on a part of the manor estate towards the end of the 18th century. There was a manor house at the northwest end of the road, which subsequently became the Adam and Eve pub. This was demolished to build the Euston Tower.

Tottenham Court Road had become a place of entertainment by the mid-17th century. In 1645, three people were fined for drinking on a Sunday. A Gooseberry Fair was held sporadically throughout the century, and featured numerous booths with street entertainers. 

The Horse Shoe Brewery was established in 1764 on the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. The current Horseshoe pub was built in the 19th century. Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle was built in 1756 for the Reverend George Whitefield, and subsequently became the world&#x27;s largest Methodist church after it was extended in 1760. It was rebuilt in 1857 after being destroyed by fire, and again in 1888 after the building collapsed. It was bombed during the Second World War and rebuilt as the Memorial Chapel. 

Tottenham Court Road was predominantly rural in nature until well into the 19th century. When Heal&#x27;s was established on former farmland, the lease stipulated there must be appropriate accommodation for 40 cows. These cowsheds were destroyed in a fire in 1877. A 17th-century farmhouse at the rear of No. 196 Tottenham Court Road was demolished in 1917.

===Fairyland shooting range===

During the period leading up to and during the First World War, an amusement arcade that contained a miniature rifle-shooting range called Fairyland was at No. 92 Tottenham Court Road. In 1909, Madan Lal Dhingra practised shooting here prior to his assassination of Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie. Other residents of India House and members of Abhinav Bharat practised shooting at the range and rehearsed assassinations they planned to carry out. Also in 1909, it was reported in a police investigation that the range was being used by two Suffragettes in a possible conspiracy to assassinate prime minister H. H. Asquith. It was also where Donald Lesbini shot Alice Eliza Storey. &quot;R v Lesbini&quot; (1914) was a case establishing in common law that with regard to voluntary manslaughter a reasonable man always has reasonable powers of self-control and is never intoxicated. The shooting range was owned and run by Henry Stanton Morley (1875–1916).

==Transport==
The road was, for many years, a one-way street: all three lanes were northbound only; the corresponding southbound traffic used the parallel Gower Street, to the east. The new two-way traffic flows on Tottenham Court Road and the surrounding streets were fully completed in March 2021.

The road is served by three stations on the London Underground—from south to north these are Tottenham Court Road, Goodge Street and Warren Street—and by numerous bus routes.

The Elizabeth line, which opened in 2022, is expected to increase passenger traffic at Tottenham Court Road station by 40 per cent.

On 3 June 2014, Camden Council announced plans to reserve the road for buses and bicycles only, during daylight hours from Monday to Saturday. The council claimed it would make the street safer and boost business ahead of the opening of the new Elizabeth line station. The current one-way system would be replaced with two-way traffic flows. Wider pavements, cycle lanes and safer pedestrian crossings would also be installed as part of the £26m plan. As of spring 2019, Tottenham Court Road has been two-way, with buses, cycles and motorbikes permitted to use the southbound road towards the junction towards (New) Oxford Street.

==Economy==
===Entertainment===
The Dominion Theatre opened in 1929, on the site of the old Horseshoe Brewery on Tottenham Court Road. It became a cinema in 1932, before reverting to being a theatre. It has a capacity of 2,000. The UK flagship location of the Spearmint Rhino is located in this street.

===Retail===

Tottenham Court Road is a significant shopping street, best known for its high concentration of consumer electronics shops, which range from shops specialising in cables and computer components to those dealing in package computers and audio-video systems. Further north there are several furniture shops, including Habitat and Heal&#x27;s. Another well-known store was the furniture maker Maple &amp; Co.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Tottenham Court Road and a few of the adjoining streets became well known for stores selling Second World War surplus radio and electronics equipment and all kinds of electro-mechanical and radio parts. Shops such as Proops Brothers (established in 1946) lined both sides of the road at that time. By the 1960s they were also selling Japanese transistor radios, audio mixers and other electronic gadgets. Many British-made valve stereos were offered too.

In the early twenty-first century, the growth of e-commerce has reduced the importance of electronics retailing in the area, and cafes and fashion stores like Primark have become more prevalent.

Whilst Tottenham Court Road still has some specialist furniture and electronics retailers, it is becoming more of a general business district. However, some of the original electronics stores on Tottenham Court Road still trade, such as House of Computers, well-known in the area for offering a range of computers and accessories.

==Whitfield Gardens==
Opposite Habitat and Heal&#x27;s is a small public open space called Whitfield Gardens, occupying the former site of a chapel. On the side of a house is a painting, the &quot;Fitzrovia Mural&quot;, which is about 20 metres (over 60 feet) high and shows many people at work and at leisure. It was painted in 1980 in a style resembling that of Diego Rivera. The mural has suffered from neglect and has been daubed with graffiti. There is a proposal to restore the mural after the current works to renovate the gardens are completed. In 2005, 12 so-called &quot;Our Glass&quot; panels were erected in the gardens. Each is about five feet (1.5 m) high, with two sides showing a collage of people associated with the area, from satirical cartoonist William Hogarth to the popular singer Boy George. There is a 13th panel showing an index of the people depicted.

<doc id="173851" wikidata="Q4530036" url="?curid=173851" title="Lucy Aikin">
<text>Lucy Aikin (6 November 1781 – 29 January 1864) was an English historical writer, biographer and correspondent. She also published under pseudonyms such as Mary Godolphin. Her literary-minded family included her aunt Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a writer of poetry, essays and children&#x27;s books.

==Early life==
Aikin was born at Warrington, then Lancashire, in 1781. She was the fourth child of a physician, John Aikin (1747–1822), and his wife, Martha Jennings (died 1830). Theirs was a literary family of prominent Unitarians. Lucy&#x27;s father was also a historian, and her grandfather, likewise called John Aikin (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy. Lucy&#x27;s aunt was Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a prominent children&#x27;s writer, while her brother Arthur Aikin (1773–1854) was a chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer, and their brother Charles Rochemont (1775–1847) was adopted by Barbauld and became a doctor and chemist. Another brother, the architect Edmund Aikin (1780–1820), wrote influential works about architecture.

Lucy Aikin lived with her parents in Great Yarmouth and Stoke Newington until the death of her father in 1822, when she moved to Hampstead. There, apart from a short interval in Wimbledon, she spent the remainder of her life.

She briefly attended a day school in Yarmouth, but was largely educated privately by her father and her aunt, an early critic of the education system. She &quot;read widely in English, French, Italian, and Latin literature and history,&quot; began publishing for magazines at the age of 17, and was soon assisting her father as an editor of his writings.

==Works==
Aikin&#x27;s works delve into the artistic, social, and literary sides of her period, rather than its religious, military or parliamentary history.

In 1810 appeared her first considerable work, &quot;Epistles on Women, Exemplifying their Character and Condition in Various Ages and Nations, with Miscellaneous Poems&quot;, and in 1814 her only work of fiction, entitled &quot;Lorimer, a Tale&quot;. Those were just early efforts, but her reputation was gained wholly by historical works published between 1818 and 1843: &quot;Memoirs of the Court of Queen Elizabeth&quot; (1818); &quot;Memoirs of the Court of James I.&quot; (1822); &quot;Memoirs of the Court of Charles I.&quot; (1833); and the &quot;Life of Addison&quot; (1843). The last of these, containing many letters of Addison never before published, was the subject of an essay by Macaulay, who while praising Aikin&#x27;s other works, and especially her &quot;Memoirs of the Court of James I&quot;, observed that she was &quot;far more at home among the ruffs and peaked beards of Theobalds than among the steenkirks and flowing periwigs which surrounded Queen Anne&#x27;s tea table at Hampton.&quot;

Of her other memoirs, she herself wrote on completing her Charles I, &quot;I am resolved against proceeding farther with English sovereigns. Charles II is no theme for me: it would make me condemn my species.&quot; Aikin also wrote a life of her father, and of her aunt, Mrs Barbauld, and many minor pieces.

Like Barbauld, Aikin was interested in early education, and as such published several works to assist young readers: &quot;Poetry for Children: Consisting of Short Pieces to be Committed to Memory&quot; (1801), &quot;Juvenile Correspondence or Letters, Designed as Examples of the Epistolary Style, for Children of Both Sexes&quot; (1811), &quot;An English Lesson Book, for the Junior Classes&quot; (1828), and &quot;The Acts of Life: of Providing Food, of Providing Clothing, of Providing Shelter&quot; (1858). Under the pseudonym Mary Godolphin, Aikin also contributed as an editor to versions of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, &quot;Evenings at Home&quot; (by her father and aunt), and &quot;Sandford and Merton&quot; written &quot;in Words of One Syllable&quot;.

==Letters and translations==
Aikin&#x27;s conversational powers were remarkable, and she was a graceful and graphic letter writer. Her letters to her relatives and intimate friends showed her relish for society, and were full of wit and lively anecdotes of distinguished literary persons. She maintained for almost 16 years (1826–1842) a graver correspondence with the Rev. Dr William Ellery Channing, an American Unitarian theologian in Boston, on religion, philosophy, politics, and literature.

Aikin&#x27;s letters were known for criticizing leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, and for criticisms of various authors, male and female. Her letters also showed an appreciation for classic and contemporary literature.

Aikin also translated French texts: Louis Francois Jauffret&#x27;s &quot;The Travels of Rolando&quot; (publication around 1804), and Jean Gaspard Hess&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Ulrich Zwingli&quot; (1812), on a leader of the Reformation in Switzerland.

==Personal life==
Aikin never married or had children. She lived her whole life with family, notably her parents and her niece, although she did briefly live with her nephew in London.

Politically Aikin was a staunch feminist, and religiously she was a Unitarian.

==Death and legacy==
Lucy Aikin died of influenza in 1864 in Hampstead, then just north of London, where she had lived for 40 years. At the time of her death, Aikin had less than €9,000. Her niece Anna Letitia Le Breton took over her literary legacy. Aikin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs, Miscellanies, and Letters&quot; were published in 1864, as was an edited version of her correspondence with Channing ten years later, in 1874 (London and Edinburgh: Williams and Norgate).

<text>Mary Osborne, Duchess of Leeds (23 November 1723 – 3 August 1764), born Lady Mary Godolphin, was a daughter of Henrietta Godolphin, &quot;née&quot; Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, and Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, making her granddaughter to the powerful government trio during the reign of Queen Anne of Great Britain: the famous general and politician John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and his wife Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, through her mother; and Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin, through her father.

Lady Mary was considered to be the illegitimate child of the famous playwright William Congreve, with whom Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, was having a long-term relationship. She was, however, recognised by Francis as his own daughter, and was raised by him with the other Godolphin children. Despite this, gossip spread rapidly about Lady Mary&#x27;s paternity, and her maternal grandmother did not recognise her until 1740, when the two reconciled their differences. It was at this time that Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, arranged Lady Mary&#x27;s marriage to Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds; they were married on 26 June 1740. They had one surviving child, Francis Godolphin Osborne (styled Marquess of Carmarthen, later 5th Duke of Leeds and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), who was born on 29 January 1751.

Mary, Duchess of Leeds, died in 1764, aged 41.

<text>The Harvard Mark I, or IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC), was one of the earliest general-purpose electromechanical computers used in the war effort during the last part of World War II.

One of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on 29 March 1944 by John von Neumann. At that time, von Neumann was working on the Manhattan Project, and needed to determine whether implosion was a viable choice to detonate the atomic bomb that would be used a year later. The Mark I also computed and printed mathematical tables, which had been the initial goal of British inventor Charles Babbage for his analytical engine in 1837.

According to Edmund Berkeley, the operators of the Mark I often called the machine &quot;Bessy, the Bessel engine&quot;, after Bessel functions.

The Mark I was disassembled in 1959; part of it was given to IBM, part went to the Smithsonian Institution, and part entered the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. For decades, Harvard&#x27;s portion was on display in the lobby of the Aiken Computation Lab. About 1997, it was moved to the Harvard Science Center. In 2021, it was moved again, to the lobby of Harvard&#x27;s new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston, Massachusetts.

==Origins==
The original concept was presented to IBM by Howard Aiken in November 1937. After a feasibility study by IBM engineers, the company chairman Thomas Watson Sr. personally approved the project and its funding in February 1939.

Howard Aiken had started to look for a company to design and build his calculator in early 1937. After two rejections, he was shown a demonstration set that Charles Babbage’s son had given to Harvard University 70 years earlier. This led him to study Babbage and to add references to the Analytical Engine to his proposal; the resulting machine &quot;brought Babbage’s principles of the Analytical Engine almost to full realization, while adding important new features.&quot;

The ASCC was developed and built by IBM at their Endicott plant and shipped to Harvard in February 1944. It began computations for the US Navy Bureau of Ships in May and was officially presented to the university on August 7, 1944.

Although not the first working computer, the machine was the first to automate the execution of complex calculations, making it a significant step forward for computing.

==Design and construction==
The ASCC was built from switches, relays, rotating shafts, and clutches. It used 765,000 electromechanical components and hundreds of miles of wire, comprising a volume of – in length, in height, and deep. It weighed about . The basic calculating units had to be synchronized and powered mechanically, so they were operated by a drive shaft coupled to a electric motor, which served as the main power source and system clock. From the IBM Archives:

The Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) was the first operating machine that could execute long computations automatically. A project conceived by Harvard University’s Dr. Howard Aiken, the Mark I was built by IBM engineers in Endicott, N.Y. A steel frame 51 feet long and 8 feet high held the calculator, which consisted of an interlocking panel of small gears, counters, switches and control circuits, all only a few inches in depth. The ASCC used of wire with three million connections, 3,500 multipole relays with 35,000 contacts, 2,225 counters, 1,464 tenpole switches and tiers of 72 adding machines, each with 23 significant numbers. It was the industry’s largest electromechanical calculator.

The enclosure for the Mark I was designed by futuristic American industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes at IBM&#x27;s expense. Aiken was annoyed that the cost ($50,000 or more according to Grace Hopper) was not used to build additional computer equipment.

==Operation==
The Mark I had 60 sets of 24 switches for manual data entry and could store 72 numbers, each 23 decimal digits long. It could do 3 additions or subtractions in a second. A multiplication took 6 seconds, a division took 15.3 seconds, and a logarithm or a trigonometric function took over one minute.

The Mark I read its instructions from a 24-channel punched paper tape. It executed the current instruction and then read the next one. A separate tape could contain numbers for input, but the tape formats were not interchangeable. Instructions could not be executed from the storage registers. Because instructions were not stored in working memory, it is widely claimed that the Harvard Mark I was the origin of the Harvard architecture. However, this is disputed in &quot;The Myth of the Harvard Architecture&quot; published in the &quot;IEEE Annals of the History of Computing&quot;, which shows the term &#x27;Harvard architecture&#x27; did not come into use until the 1970s (in the context of microcontrollers) and was only retrospectively applied to the Harvard machines, and that the term could only be applied to the Mark III and IV, not to the Mark I or II.

The main sequence mechanism was unidirectional. This meant that complex programs had to be physically lengthy. A program loop was accomplished by loop unrolling or by joining the end of the paper tape containing the program back to the beginning of the tape (literally creating a loop). At first, conditional branching in Mark I was performed manually. Later modifications in 1946 introduced automatic program branching (by subroutine call). The first programmers of the Mark I were computing pioneers Richard Milton Bloch, Robert Campbell, and Grace Hopper. There was also a small technical team whose assignment was to actually operate the machine; some had been IBM employees before being required to join the Navy to work on the machine. This technical team was not informed of the overall purpose of their work while at Harvard.

==Instruction format==
The 24 channels of the input tape were divided into three fields of eight channels each. Each storage location, each set of switches, and the registers associated with the input, output, and arithmetic units were assigned a unique identifying index number. These numbers were represented in binary on the control tape. The first field was the binary index of the result of the operation, the second was the source datum for the operation and the third field was a code for the operation to be performed.

==Contribution to the Manhattan Project==
In 1928 L.J. Comrie was the first to turn IBM &quot;punched-card equipment to scientific use: computation of astronomical tables by the method of finite differences, as envisioned by Babbage 100 years earlier for his Difference Engine&quot;. Very soon after, IBM started to modify its tabulators to facilitate this kind of computation. One of these tabulators, built in 1931, was The Columbia Difference Tabulator.

John von Neumann had a team at Los Alamos that used &quot;modified IBM punched-card machines&quot; to determine the effects of the implosion. In March 1944, he proposed to run certain problems regarding implosion on the Mark I, and he arrived at Harvard together with two mathematicians to write a simulation program to study the implosion of the first atomic bomb.

The Los Alamos group completed its work in a much shorter time than the Cambridge group. However, &quot;the punched-card machine operation computed values to six decimal places, whereas the Mark I computed values to eighteen decimal places&quot;. Additionally, Mark I &quot;integrated the partial differential equation at a much smaller interval size [or smaller mesh] and so...achieved far greater precision&quot;.

&quot;Von Neumann joined the Manhattan Project in 1943, working on the immense number of calculations needed to build the atomic bomb. He showed that the implosion design, which would later be used in the Trinity and Fat Man bombs, was likely faster and more efficient than the gun design.&quot;

==Aiken and IBM==
Aiken published a press release announcing the Mark I listing himself as the sole inventor. James W. Bryce was the only IBM person mentioned, even though several IBM engineers including Clair Lake and Frank Hamilton had helped to build various elements. IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson was enraged, and only reluctantly attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 1944. Aiken, in turn, decided to build further machines without IBM&#x27;s help, and the ASCC came to be generally known as the &quot;Harvard Mark I&quot;. IBM went on to build its Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) to both test new technology and provide more publicity for the company&#x27;s efforts.

==Successors==
The Mark I was followed by the Harvard Mark II (1947 or 1948), Mark III/ADEC (September 1949), and Harvard Mark IV (1952) – all the work of Aiken. The Mark II was an improvement over the Mark I, although it still was based on electromechanical relays. The Mark III used mostly electronic components—vacuum tubes and crystal diodes—but also included mechanical components: rotating magnetic drums for storage, plus relays for transferring data between drums. The Mark IV was all-electronic, replacing the remaining mechanical components with magnetic core memory. The Mark II and Mark III were delivered to the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia. The Mark IV was built for the US Air Force, but it stayed at Harvard.

The Mark I was disassembled in 1959, and portions of it went on display in the Science Center, as part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. It was relocated to the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston in July 2021. Other sections of the original machine had much earlier been transferred to IBM and the Smithsonian Institution.

<text>Keeping Up Appearances is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke. It originally aired on BBC1 from 1990 to 1995. The central character is an eccentric and snobbish middle-class social climber, Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge), who insists that her surname is pronounced &quot;Bouquet&quot;. The show consisted of five series and 44 episodes, four of which were Christmas specials. Production ended in 1995 after Routledge decided to move on to other projects. All 44 episodes have since been released on video, DVD and streaming media.

The sitcom follows Hyacinth in her attempts to prove her social superiority, and to gain standing with those she considers upper class. Her attempts are constantly hampered by her lower class extended family, whom she is desperate to hide. Much of the humour comes from the conflict between Hyacinth&#x27;s vision of herself and the reality of her underclass background. In each episode, she lands in a farcical situation as she battles to protect her social credibility.

&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; was an immense success in the UK, and also captured large audiences in the United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. By February 2016, it had been sold nearly a thousand times to overseas broadcasters, making it BBC Worldwide&#x27;s most exported television programme ever. In a 2004 BBC poll it placed 12th in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Hyacinth was ranked 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. The show has been syndicated on Gold and Drama in the UK, on PBS member stations in the United States and on 7TWO and 9Gem in Australia.

==Premise==

Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge) – who insists her surname is pronounced &quot;Bouquet&quot; (although her husband Richard has said, &quot;It was always &#x27;Bucket&#x27; until I met you!&quot;) – is an overbearing, social-climbing snob, originally from a lower-class background, whose main mission in life is to impress others with her refinement and pretended affluence.

She is terrified that her background will be revealed and goes to great lengths to hide it. Hyacinth likes to spend her days visiting stately homes (convinced she will meet and strike up a friendship with the upper-class owners, especially if they are part of the landed gentry or peerage) and hosting &quot;executive-style&quot; candlelight suppers (with her Royal Worcester double-glazed Avignon china and Royal Doulton china with &quot;the hand-painted periwinkles&quot;).

She ostentatiously brags about her possessions, including her &quot;white slimline telephone with automatic redial&quot;, which she always answers with &quot;The Bouquet residence, the lady of the house speaking.&quot; She frequently receives misdialled numbers for a Chinese takeaway, angering her. She speaks in an exaggerated RP-style accent with northern undertones, while her relatives speak in broad northern accents. Her neighbours speak in milder RP accents. When flustered, Hyacinth reverts to her native accent.

Hyacinth&#x27;s attempts to impress makes the lives of those around her difficult; her continual efforts to improve her social position usually involve inviting her unwilling neighbours and friends to &quot;exclusive candlelight suppers&quot;. Although Hyacinth is not deterred by the lack of response to her attempts, her friends, neighbours, and acquaintances live in fear of being invited, and usually make frantic attempts to excuse themselves.

Her husband Richard (Clive Swift) bears the brunt of the suffering. He initially worked for the council in &quot;Finance and General Purposes&quot;, but at the beginning of series three, reluctantly accepts early retirement. Though Hyacinth describes his role as &quot;a power in local authority&quot;, he appears to be no more than a bureaucratic functionary. Although he loves her with a long-suffering endurance, he is notably exasperated by her plans and her habit of making extravagant and unnecessary purchases.

Although she lives to impress others, Hyacinth regularly competes with her middle-class neighbours (whom she considers snobbish showoffs) such as Sonia Barker-Finch, Delia Wheelwright and Lydia Hawksworth (who alone of Hyacinth&#x27;s rivals seems to be an actual snob, as she disdains kiwifruit as &quot;lower middle class&quot;). Hyacinth sometimes says things like &quot;I haven&#x27;t a snobbish bone in my body&quot; or &quot;I can&#x27;t abide such snobbery like that&quot; when talking about those she considers her competition.

Always hindering Hyacinth&#x27;s best efforts to impress, and providing an unwelcome reminder of her less-than-refined roots, are her working-class sisters Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and Rose (Shirley Stelfox in series one; Mary Millar thereafter), and Daisy&#x27;s proudly &quot;bone idle&quot; husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes). They, along with Hyacinth&#x27;s senile father, frequently turn up inconveniently (usually in their clapped-out Ford Cortina – which always makes a characteristic backfire when it arrives), with Hyacinth going to great lengths to avoid them (saying: &quot;Richard, you know I love my family, but that&#x27;s no reason why I should have to acknowledge them in broad daylight!&quot;). Rose is very sexually aggressive and promiscuous, adding to Hyacinth&#x27;s embarrassment. Although Hyacinth is embarrassed by Onslow&#x27;s laziness and unkempt character, Richard and Onslow get along very well, while Daisy&#x27;s cheerful nature wins over anyone she meets from Hyacinth’s preferred social circle.

Hyacinth&#x27;s senile father frequently has flashbacks to the Second World War, and often exhibits bizarre behaviour, sometimes involving embarrassing situations with women (Onslow describes him as &quot;barmy&quot;). Two relatives of whom Hyacinth is not ashamed are her wealthy sister Violet (Anna Dawson) and her unseen son Sheridan. Violet frequently telephones Hyacinth for advice, allowing her to loudly announce to anyone in earshot, &quot;It&#x27;s my sister Violet – the one with a Mercedes, swimming pool/sauna and room for a pony&quot;. However, Violet&#x27;s social acceptability is damaged by the eccentric behaviour of her cross-dressing, equestrian-loving turf accountant husband Bruce, whom she attacks because of his behaviour.

Hyacinth also tries to impress people with the intellectual prowess of her beloved son Sheridan (who actually only takes a course in needlework at a polytechnic). Hyacinth boasts about the &quot;psychic&quot; closeness of their relationship and how often he writes and telephones her, although he never writes and only telephones his mother to ask for money, much to the despair of Richard. Hyacinth is blissfully oblivious of the seemingly obvious hints that Sheridan, who lives with a man named Tarquin (who makes his own curtains, wears silk pyjamas, and has won prizes for embroidery), is gay, but Richard appears to have realised this, asking Hyacinth if she has ever wondered why Sheridan shows no interest in girls.

Hyacinth&#x27;s neighbour Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Warden (Josephine Tewson) is frequently invited round for coffee. Though she is ordinarily calm, Elizabeth&#x27;s nerves go to pieces in Hyacinth&#x27;s house, causing her to smash Hyacinth&#x27;s china and spill coffee and biscuits on Hyacinth&#x27;s Burmese rug or table. She is married with a daughter away at university, yet her husband works abroad and, like Sheridan, neither character ever appears. While everyone else usually addresses her simply as &quot;Liz&quot;, Hyacinth almost always calls her by her full name.

Elizabeth is occasionally able to &quot;one-up&quot; Hyacinth herself by reminding her neighbour that her daughter is at university, while Sheridan is studying at a mere polytechnic. Liz&#x27;s brother Emmet (David Griffin) moves in with her at the beginning of series two, after a messy divorce. Hyacinth, upon learning that Emmet is a musician, frequently and abruptly sings out-of-key at him to try to get a part in one of his productions, making him terrified of leaving the house, lest she see him (&quot;She&#x27;ll sing at me!&quot;). Emmet&#x27;s problems are made worse by Hyacinth&#x27;s mistaken belief that his frightened reactions indicate that he is infatuated with her, which, in fact, could not be further from the truth.

Hyacinth frequently confronts the postman with complaints, harassing him to the point that he will go to extreme lengths not to face her; she often forces workmen and other visitors to her home to remove their shoes before entering. Michael, the vicar of the local church (Jeremy Gittins) is also loath to face the overbearing Hyacinth, to whom he refers (behind her back) as &quot;the Bucket woman&quot;. The vicar and his wife sometimes exact comic revenge on Hyacinth for her snobbishness; on one occasion, when she was one of a group of volunteer helpers at the church, the vicar&#x27;s wife saw to it that Hyacinth&#x27;s hand went up prematurely and assigned her the job of cleaning the church hall toilets.

==Episodes==
&quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; aired for five series, four Christmas specials, and one short &quot;Children in Need&quot; special from 29 October 1990 to 25 December 1995. The series officially ended after the episode &quot;The Pageant&quot;, because Patricia Routledge wanted to focus on other TV and theatre work, including &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;, which began airing in 1996. Clive Swift, who portrayed Richard, stated in a BBC interview that Routledge &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be remembered as simply &#x27;Mrs. Bucket&#x27;&quot;. Despite the series&#x27; ongoing popularity, she wished to pursue other roles as an actress. In a 2017 interview, Routledge said: &quot;I always thought of the great, great Ronnie Barker. He always left something when he was on a high, and it&#x27;s much better to have people say now &#x27;Oh, why didn&#x27;t you do some more?&#x27; than having them say &#x27;Oh, is that still on?&#x27;&quot; Another reason she wished to leave the role was that she felt that the writer Roy Clarke was &quot;recycling some old ideas that we&#x27;d already dealt with&quot;.

==Production==
===Locations===
Exterior shots around Hyacinth&#x27;s house were recorded at a privately owned residence at 117 Heather Road, Binley Woods, Warwickshire, east of Coventry.

Exterior shots around Daisy&#x27;s and Onslow&#x27;s council terrace were taken in the Stoke Aldermoor district of Coventry. 

The opening sequence shows Hyacinth writing an invitation to one of her trademark candlelight suppers; this invitation lists Hyacinth&#x27;s address as &quot;Waney Elm, Blossom Avenue, Fuddleton&quot;. In the same sequence, the invitation is eventually sent to an address in Eddleton. Neither town actually exists. However, there are several references to the characters being in the West Midlands throughout the series, such as when Hyacinth said that she could become the &quot;Barbara Cartland of the West Midlands Social Circuit Scene&quot; in the episode &quot;The Hostess&quot;. In another episode, police officers wearing West Midlands Police jumpers escort Richard home and several West Midlands Travel buses are also seen throughout the series.

==Legacy==
Various spin-off shows and specials related to the programme were broadcast.

===&quot;Mr Blobby Meets Hyacinth Bucket&quot;===
In 1993, a short sketch aired during an episode of &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;. The clip featuring Mr Blobby, saw the character causing havoc in Hyacinth&#x27;s home. This clip was also featured in the &quot;Blobbyvision&quot; VHS release in 1994.

===&quot;Daddy&#x27;s Dead&quot; (Children in Need special)===
In 1995, a special six-minute sketch was broadcast as part of Children in Need. Hyacinth dreams Daddy has died, and demands the coffin be brought to her house.

===&quot;The Memoirs of Hyacinth Bucket&quot;===
In 1996, BBC Worldwide Americas approached Harold Snoad about writing and producing a one-off special compilation episode.
Snoad was then tasked with reviewing all 44 episodes and choosing suitable clips and making notes for relatable dialogue for a script. Geoffrey Hughes and Judy Cornwell both reprised their roles as Onslow and Daisy respectively.

The plot centred around Daisy and Onslow finding Hyacinth&#x27;s personal diary which was accidentally left to Daisy by Hyacinth with some other belongings she had lent to her sister. It was first broadcast in March 1997, in the United States. With later reruns on PBS. The show sees the pair introduce clips from the series using Hyacinth&#x27;s diary. The special was also released on VHS and DVD.

===&quot;Comedy Connections&quot;===
In 2004, the documentary series &quot;Comedy Connections&quot; featured an episode dedicated to &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. Stars Clive Swift, Josephine Tewson, Judy Cornwell and David Griffin, along with writer Roy Clarke and producer/director Harold Snoad, all discussed the series. Clips from an interview with Patricia Routledge from 2002 were also included.

The episode revealed that there were serious artistic differences between Clarke and Snoad. Specifically, Clarke refused to act as anything but a writer and rarely visited the set or location shoots, necessitating that Snoad make minor rewrites to accommodate the realities of taping. This infuriated Clarke, who disliked any tampering of his work, and Snoad thought Clarke was being unreasonable. The situation was mitigated in later series by the hiring of a script editor whose sole job was to keep Clarke apprised of Snoad&#x27;s changes, and to keep Snoad informed of Clarke&#x27;s opinion of them.

===&quot;Life Lessons from Onslow&quot;===
In early 2008, Geoffrey Hughes reprised his role as Onslow once again for a clipshow of the series; this was for broadcast on American television and sees him teaching a credit course at the Open University having selected &quot;successful relationships&quot; as his subject matter. The programme was also released on Region 1 DVD.

===&quot;Mind Your Manors&quot;===
When &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; did not return, after Patricia Routledge announced that she no longer wished to play Hyacinth, Roy Clarke proposed a spin-off series called &quot;Mind Your Manors&quot;. The series was referenced in BBC in-house literature during 1997 and 1998 and later described by both Clarke and Geoffrey Hughes as part of a discussion of the character of Onslow in Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Archive on 4: On Northern Men&quot;, broadcast in 2009.

The spin-off would have seen Onslow forced to take a supposedly &quot;easy&quot; job tending the gardens of a large manor house estate owned by a doddery and rather forgetful old Lord. When the Lord dies suddenly, Onslow, Daisy and Rose (who it is implied was having a fling with the Lord, causing the heart attack which led to his death) end up &quot;temporarily&quot; moving into the manor house to mind it, due to a legal dispute with the deceased Lord&#x27;s estranged brother (who Rose immediately starts lusting after), who wants the land.

A mislaid deeds paper left by the forgetful old Lord would supposedly clarify who has rights to the estate, buried somewhere in the gardens that Onslow is left to ineptly try and keep in shape. Most of the conflict would have come from the Lord&#x27;s brother and the manor&#x27;s snooty neighbours, the wealthy Hyde-Whytes, who are not happy about the &quot;commoners&quot; who have taken up residence next door (although it later transpires that Mr. Hyde-Whyte used to know Onslow in their youth and is indebted to him after Onslow once took the fall for him to stop him being arrested). Su Pollard was approached to play the role of Miss Dorothy &quot;Dotty&quot; Henshaw, the Lord&#x27;s eccentric and easily flustered cook/housekeeper who remains with the estate, and some preliminary location shooting was reportedly undertaken. This proposed spin-off series was ultimately not commissioned.

===&quot;Comedy Classics: Keeping Up Appearances – 30 Years of Laughs&quot;===
In January 2023, Channel 5 aired a 67-minute special retrospective for their &quot;Comedy Classics&quot; series. Cast, crew and celebrities pay tribute to the show. The documentary features an interview with Routledge, who was 93 at the time, sharing her memories of the show, along with supporting cast members Judy Cornwell, Jeremy Gittins and David Janson.

===&quot;Roy Clarke...Remembers Keeping Up Appearances&quot;===
In July 2024, BBC Four aired a 15-minute special interview with the sitcom&#x27;s writer and creator Roy Clarke.

===&quot;Dame Patricia Routledge...Remembers Keeping Up Appearances&quot;===
On 3 September 2024, BBC Four aired a second retrospective 15-minute special interview with Patricia Routledge. In the short documentary, Routledge recalled how the character of Hyacinth Bucket entered her life, how she was cast in the role as one of television&#x27;s most formidable comedy characters. Routledge also explained her found pleasures of working with her fellow cast members. Routledge shared her thoughts of why the character of Richard Bucket endured many years of his marriage with Hyacinth. Routledge explains why – despite her fondness for every element of the sitcom, that it was her own personal decision, to call time on the show, when the BBC and all of the other cast and crew members would have loved for it to have continued.

==Merchandise==

In 1998, the BBC released three episodes of the show: &quot;Hyacinth tees off&quot;, &quot;Rural Retreat&quot;, and &quot;Sea Fever&quot; on audio cassette. Clive Swift reprised his role as Richard recording a narrative to compensate for the lack of images.

In Australia the complete series was made available for streaming on Stan in 2018.

In 2022, in the United Kingdom, the entire series was made available on the BBC iPlayer.

===Books===
Three books related to the series have been released in the UK. Two were written by Jonathan Rice and published by BBC Books and the other one was written by Harold Snoad (the director of Keeping Up Appearances) and was published by Book Guild Publishing.

*&quot;Hyacinth Bucket&#x27;s book of etiquette for the socially less fortunate&quot;
This was first published in 1993, and is a light-hearted guide to manners, as seen through Hyacinth Bucket&#x27;s eyes. It is based on the TV series&#x27; scripts and contains many black-and-white photos of scenes from the show.

*&quot;Hyacinth Bucket&#x27;s Hectic Social Calendar&quot;
This was published in 1995 and is presented in a diary format chronicling a year in Hyacinth Bucket&#x27;s life, with typical comments about her relations and neighbours.

*&quot;It&#x27;s Bouquet – Not Bucket&quot;
This was published in late 2009, the book includes rare photos which were taken during the filming of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. The book contains full plot synopses for all episodes, main cast details, filming locations for all episodes which used outside shots, and stories of some entertaining events which happened during filming.

====Overseas books====
Due to the popularity of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; in the United States, books about the series have also been published across the Atlantic.

*&quot;Keeping Up Appearances: A Companion to the Series&quot;
This comical series guidebook was published in the late 1990s by WLIW21. It was co-authored by mother-and-daughter writers Georgene and Mary Lee Costa. It features summary descriptions of each episode, cast and crew biographies, series photographs and an interview with Harold Snoad.

Since it was written during the filming of the final series of episodes, Snoad included the co-authors of the guide as extras in the episode &quot;The Fancy Dress Ball&quot;.

==Theatre adaptation==
In 2010, the television show was adapted into a play entitled &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; that toured theatres in the UK. The cast included Rachel Bell as Hyacinth, Kim Hartman as Elizabeth, Gareth Hale as Onslow, Steven Pinder as Emmet, Debbie Arnold as Rose, David Janson (who had previously appeared in the TV show as the postman) as Mr Edward Milson, a new character created for the stage show, Christine Moore as Daisy and Sarah Whitlock as Mrs Debden.

Main character Richard Bucket, Hyacinth&#x27;s husband, does not appear in the production, but is frequently referred to: Hyacinth addresses him off stage and talks to him on the phone. The main plot of the show revolves around Emmet directing a play at the local village hall, but when Hyacinth is cast in the play&#x27;s leading role, disaster is in the making.

This adaptation, directed by playwright Johnny Culver, made its American premiere in New York City in March 2015, at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church Theater Fellowship/Jones Auditorium. Culver directed an additional production of this adaptation with performances on 5 August 2017 and 6 August 2017 at Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Forest Hills, Queens.

==Prequel==

In 2015, it was announced that a prequel to the series entitled &quot;Young Hyacinth&quot; would be made, with original writer Roy Clarke returning to pen the script, following a 19-year-old Hyacinth Bucket during the early postwar years and set some forty years before the events of &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. The cast were announced on 11 April 2016. Hyacinth was played by Kerry Howard; Rose by Katie Redford; Daisy by Katherine Pearce; Violet by Tamla Kari and Daddy by Mark Addy. It was broadcast on BBC One on 2 September 2016.

The prequel sees Hyacinth working as a maid and attempting to manage her family, so they appear well above their means. In the special, Hyacinth is in a relationship with a Mr. William Hitchcock, whom Hyacinth forces to dress up and wear a hat when they walk. The special ends with her drunken Daddy falling into the canal, which Hyacinth&#x27;s employers see, causing her great embarrassment. However, she blames Daddy&#x27;s behaviour on &quot;an old war injury&quot;.

Approximately 4.14 million viewers watched the show within seven days of its broadcast, making it the 22nd-most-watched BBC One show for the week ending 4 September. A total of 4.39 million viewers watched the show within 28 days of its initial broadcast.

<doc id="173863" wikidata="Q484020" url="?curid=173863" title="Mr. Bean">
<text>Mr. Bean is a British sitcom created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis, produced by Tiger Aspect Productions and starring Atkinson as the eponymous title character. The sitcom consists of 15 episodes that were co-written by Atkinson alongside Curtis and Robin Driscoll; the pilot episode was co-written by Ben Elton. The series originally aired on ITV, beginning with the pilot episode on 1 January 1990 and ending with &quot;The Best Bits of Mr. Bean&quot; on 15 December 1995.

Based on a character developed by Atkinson while he was studying for his master&#x27;s degree at the University of Oxford, the series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as &quot;a child in a grown man&#x27;s body&quot;, as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes disruption in the process. The series has been influenced by physical comedy actors such as Jacques Tati and those from early silent films.

During its original five-year run, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; was met with widespread acclaim and attracted large television audiences. The series was viewed by 18.74 million viewers for the episode &quot;The Trouble with Mr. Bean&quot; and has received a number of international awards, including the Rose d&#x27;Or. The series has since been sold in 245 territories worldwide. It has inspired an animated spin-off and two theatrical feature-length films along with Atkinson reprising his role as Mr. Bean for a performance at the London 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, television commercials and several sketches for Comic Relief. The programme carries strong appeal in hundreds of territories worldwide because, in addition to the acclaim from its original run, it uses very little intelligible dialogue, making it accessible to people who know little or no English.

== Origin ==
The character of Mr. Bean was developed while Rowan Atkinson was studying for his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. A sketch featuring Bean was shown at the Edinburgh Fringe in the early 1980s. A similar character called Robert Box, also played by Atkinson, appeared in the one-off 1979 ITV sitcom &quot;Canned Laughter&quot; which also featured routines used in the motion picture in 1997.

One of Bean&#x27;s earliest appearances occurred at the &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; comedy festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1987. When programme coordinators were scheduling him into the festival programme, Atkinson insisted that he perform on the French-speaking bill rather than the English-speaking programme. Having no French dialogue in his act at all, programme coordinators could not understand why Atkinson wanted to perform on the French bill instead. As it turned out, Atkinson&#x27;s act at the festival was a test platform for his character and he wanted to see how his character&#x27;s physical comedy would fare on an international stage with a non-English speaking audience.

The character&#x27;s name was not decided until after the first episode had been produced; a number of other vegetable-influenced names such as &quot;Mr. Cauliflower&quot; were explored. Atkinson cited the earlier comedy character Monsieur Hulot, created by French comedian and director Jacques Tati, as an influence on the character. Atkinson also cited the influence of Peter Sellers, who had previously played similar &quot;fumbling fool&quot; characters, notably Hrundi Bakshi in &quot;The Party&quot; (1968) and Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; films. Stylistically, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; is also similar to early silent films, relying purely upon physical comedy with Mr. Bean speaking very little dialogue (although like other live-action sitcoms during this period, it featured a laugh track). This has allowed the series to be sold worldwide without any significant changes to dialogue. In November 2012, Atkinson told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of his intentions to retire the character, stating that &quot;someone in their fifties being childlike becomes a little sad.&quot; In 2016, however, Atkinson changed his mind by saying that he would never retire playing Mr. Bean.

== Characters and recurring props ==
=== Mr. Bean ===
The title character and protagonist, played by Rowan Atkinson, is a childish buffoon who brings various unusual schemes and contrivances to everyday tasks. He lives alone at the address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, Highbury, and is almost always seen in his trademark tweed jacket and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital calculator watch. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. His first name (he names himself &quot;Bean&quot; to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the first film adaptation, &quot;Mr.&quot; appears on his passport in the &quot;first name&quot; field and he is shown employed as a guard at London&#x27;s National Gallery.

Mr. Bean often seems unaware of basic aspects of the way the world works, and the programme usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, and his pettiness and occasional malevolence.

In the title sequence of episode two, Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light accompanied by a choir singing &quot;Ecce homo qui est faba&quot; (&quot;Behold the man who is a bean&quot;) which was sung by the Southwark Cathedral choir in 1990. The opening sequence was initially in black and white in episodes two and three, which was intended by the producers to show his status as an &quot;ordinary man cast into the spotlight&quot;. However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. At the end of episodes three and six, he is also shown being sucked right back up into the sky in the respective background scenes (the black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Regarding the opening credits, Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean &quot;has a slightly alien aspect to him&quot;. In the &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with aliens who look exactly like him and even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.

=== Irma Gobb ===
Mr. Bean&#x27;s long-suffering girlfriend, Irma Gobb (played by Matilda Ziegler), appears in three episodes. In &quot;The Curse of Mr. Bean&quot; and &quot;Mr. Bean Goes to Town&quot;, the character is simply credited as &quot;the girlfriend&quot;. She is treated relatively inconsiderately by Bean, who appears to regard her more as a friend and companion rather than as a love interest. However, he does become jealous when she dances with another man at a disco in &quot;Mr. Bean Goes to Town&quot;, and she certainly expects him to propose to her on Christmas Day in &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean&quot;; his failure to do so results in her leaving him for good. Despite this, she later reappears in &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot;. It is revealed in the book &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Diary&quot; that her name is Irma Gobb and she works as a librarian at the local library.

In the Comic Relief sketch &quot;Torvill &amp; Bean&quot;, Bean is accompanied by a female companion portrayed by Sophie Thompson whose overall appearance resembles Gobb&#x27;s.

=== Teddy ===
Teddy is Mr. Bean&#x27;s teddy bear and, apparently, best friend. This little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs which invariably end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive: he always buys it a Christmas present or tries not to wake it up in the morning. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotizes Teddy, he snaps his fingers and the bear&#x27;s head falls backwards as if it had fallen asleep instantly. (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy&#x27;s head up.) Teddy is often privy to Mr. Bean&#x27;s various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated (&quot;Mr. Bean in Room 426&quot;), used as his paint brush (&quot;Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean&quot;) and shrunk in the wash (&quot;Tee Off, Mr. Bean&quot;). Teddy is also Mr. Bean&#x27;s &quot;pet&quot; in &quot;Hair by Mr. Bean of London&quot; where he is used to win a pet show.

Over the years, Teddy has undergone several changes. When it debuted on &quot;The Trouble with Mr. Bean&quot;, it had a smaller head. Two episodes later, its head reached its current size but its &quot;eyes&quot; were not present until Bean placed gold thumb tacks on its face. The &quot;eyes&quot; have since been replaced with two small white buttons sewn over Teddy&#x27;s face, giving it a distinctive image.

After filming ended, Teddy was donated by Atkinson to Gyles Brandreth&#x27;s Teddy bear museum in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 2008 upon the museum&#x27;s closing, Teddy was sold at auction for £180.

=== The Mini ===

Mr. Bean&#x27;s vehicle, a citron-green 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000 Mark 4 with a matte black bonnet, was central to several antics such as Bean getting dressed in it, driving while sitting in an armchair strapped to the roof or attempting to avoid a car park fee by driving out through the entrance. In the pilot episode, Bean&#x27;s vehicle was an orange 1969 BMC Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 (registration RNT 996H) but was destroyed in an off-screen crash at the end. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and padlock rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a running gag in several episodes; in two episodes, he demonstrated an additional and innovative security measure in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key which in one episode deterred a car thief. In &quot;Back to School Mr. Bean&quot;, Bean&#x27;s Mini is crushed by a tank as part of a demonstration after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V) meant for the demonstration with his own to secure a parking space. After losing it, he removes his padlock and bolt-latch from the remains. Although the Mini has been crushed, it nonetheless reappears in subsequent episodes with the same colours and registration number (SLW 287R) as the car that has been crushed.

There were three Minis painted green and black used in the series, as well as two others painted with the same colour scheme but with no engine that got crushed by the tank. One of the main cars was also crushed by the tank. During filming many parts were swapped from car to car throughout production, including bonnets, wheel trims, grilles, steering wheels, rear lights, occasionally the driver&#x27;s door, and the seat covers.

After filming ended, one of the original Minis was sold to Kariker Kars to be hired for various events whereupon it was temporarily displayed as a major attraction at the Rover Group&#x27;s museum. In 1997, it was purchased by the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum and displayed for a number of years, later being sold on to a museum in the United States. The main Mini is privately owned and nearing the end of restoration in the south of England.

To promote &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot;, a replica of the Mini with the registration number DRW 221T was used. This Mini is currently on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. The London Motor Museum also has a replica on display.

The Mini was going to appear in the first film adaptation of the series under the registration C607 EUW. In the film, Mr. Bean drives his Mini through Harrods in order to avoid a traffic jam. Although the sequence was filmed, it was not included in the final cut. In June 2018, the Mini from the first film was sold for US$70,000. The Mini had its debut on the big screen in the film &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; under the registration YGL 572T. Unlike the previous Minis (which were Austin Citron green), it is &#x27;Nissan Amarillo Yellow&#x27;. The film also features a second version of the Mini with the same colour scheme but with left-hand drive, driven by Bean&#x27;s friend Sabine, and registered 207 UHD 75.

The Mini reappeared in &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; under the registration STE 952R. In 2015, Mr. Bean returned in a sketch for Comic Relief in which he drives his Mini to attend a funeral. This Mini bore the same registration as the one in the animated spin-off.

=== The Reliant ===
Since the pilot episode, Mr. Bean has had a long-running feud with the unseen driver of a three-wheeled, light-blue 1972 Reliant Regal Supervan III (registration GRA 26K), which would usually get turned over, crashed out of its parking space and so forth by Bean in his Mini, who is usually oblivious to the results. These mishaps also became a running gag throughout the series. In &quot;Tee Off, Mr. Bean&quot;, Bean is hitchhiking and the Reliant pulls over for him but Bean, who recognizes the car, pretends to not see it until it leaves.

The Reliant reappears in &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; under the registration &quot;DUW 742&quot;, again victimized by Mr. Bean in his Mini. In the episode &quot;Young Bean&quot;, the identity of the Reliant driver is revealed for the first time. In the episode &quot;Car Wars&quot;, after being abused by Mr. Bean for many years, the driver becomes angry and fed up, and decides to get his revenge by chasing Mr. Bean and trying to outmaneuver him in various situations, ultimately resulting in Mr. Bean&#x27;s Mini being crushed by a car crusher.

=== Other characters ===
Although Mr. Bean is the only significant character in the programme, others appear usually as foils for his various antics. Other than his girlfriend Irma Gobb (Matilda Ziegler), there are more characters in each episode. However several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in the series as various one-off supporting characters, including Owen Brenman, Richard Briers, Roger Sloman, Angus Deayton, Stephen Frost, Nick Hancock, Christopher Ryan, Paul Bown, Caroline Quentin, Danny La Rue, Roger Brierley, Roger Lloyd-Pack, Rupert Vansittart, David Battley, David Schneider, Richard Wilson and Rudolph Walker. Vansittart and Walker later appeared alongside Atkinson in &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;.

== Episodes ==

All 15 episodes of &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; were produced by Tiger Aspect Productions. Additionally, the character has been used in one-off sketches, guest appearances and television commercials.

The fourteenth episode, &quot;Hair by Mr. Bean of London&quot;, was originally released as a direct-to-video VHS exclusive in 1995, and was not broadcast on television until 25 August 2006 on Nickelodeon.

== Broadcast ==
&quot;Mr. Bean&quot; originally aired in the United Kingdom on ITV from 1990 to 1995, with reruns later shown on the British variant of Comedy Central, ITV3 and ITV4. Due to its widespread popularity, the series aired in many other countries; in the United States, it aired on HBO starting on 2 April 1992, and also ran on PBS television stations across the United States. Reruns of the series were also shown on Fox Family during the late 1990s, both as segments in the variety series &quot;Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents&quot; and as stand-alone episodes.

== Music ==
&quot;Mr. Bean&quot; features a choral theme tune in the key of C major written by Howard Goodall (adapted from a passage of &quot;Locus iste&quot; by Anton Bruckner) and performed by the Choir of Southwark Cathedral (episodes 2–11 and 14; opening of episode 15) and Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford (episodes 12 and 13; closing of episode 15). The words sung during the title sequences are in Latin:
* &quot;Ecce homo qui est faba&quot;&quot;Behold the man who is a bean&quot; (sung at beginning)
* &quot;Finis partis primae&quot;&quot;End of part one&quot; (sung before the commercial break)
* &quot;Pars secunda&quot;&quot;Part two&quot; (sung after the commercial break and rarely)
* &quot;Vale homo qui est faba&quot;&quot;Farewell, the man who is a bean&quot; (sung at end)

The theme was later released on Goodall&#x27;s album &quot;Choral Works&quot;. Goodall also wrote an accompanying music track for many episodes. The first episode of &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; did not feature the choral theme tune, but instead an up-beat instrumental piece also composed by Goodall, which was more an incidental tune than a theme. It was used while Bean drove between locations intimidating the blue Reliant, and as such, was sometimes heard in later episodes whenever Bean&#x27;s nemesis is seen. The instrumental of the theme tune was used in the original series finale of &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; titled &quot;Double Trouble&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Tee Off, Mr. Bean&quot;, Goodall&#x27;s choral theme tune for another Richard Curtis comedy, &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;, is heard playing on a car stereo. In &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean&quot;, while playing with Queen&#x27;s Royal Guards figurines and the nativity set, he hums &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;, which was quoted in the theme to &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;.

Mr. Bean appeared in the music video of a 1991 fundraising single for Comic Relief, fronted by Hale and Pace, entitled &quot;The Stonk&quot;. Mr. Bean also appeared in the music video for the Boyzone single &quot;Picture of You&quot;, which was the main theme song for the first film adaptation.

Mr. Bean also made a Comic Relief record in 1992, entitled &quot;(I Want To Be) Elected&quot; and which was credited to &quot;Mr. Bean and Smear Campaign featuring Bruce Dickinson&quot;. It was a cover of the Alice Cooper song of the same name, and reached number 9 in the UK singles chart.

== Awards ==

The first episode won the Golden Rose, as well as two other major prizes at the 1991 Rose d&#x27;Or Light Entertainment Festival in Montreux. In the UK, the episode &quot;The Curse of Mr. Bean&quot; was nominated for a number of BAFTA awards; &quot;Best Light Entertainment Programme&quot; in 1991, &quot;Best Comedy&quot; (Programme or Series) in 1991, and Atkinson was nominated three times for &quot;Best Light Entertainment Performance&quot; in 1991 and 1994.

== In other media ==
=== &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; ===

Seven years following the end of the original live-action series, Mr. Bean reappeared in an animated television series with Rowan Atkinson reprising his role as the title character as well as providing references for all of Bean&#x27;s animated actions. Much like the original live-action series, the animated spin-off contains little dialogue; although some words are spoken most is either little soundbites or mumbling. The series introduced a list of new characters alongside regulars in the original series (such as Teddy and Irma Gobb), including an unpleasant landlady of Mr. Bean named Mrs. Wicket and her evil one-eyed cat Scrapper. Other characters&#x27; voices are provided by Jon Glover, Rupert Degas, Gary Martin and Lorelei King.

From 2002 to 2004, 52 episodes were originally broadcast on ITV1 each consisting of two 11-minute segments. In 2015, CITV commissioned a brand new series of episodes. The new series amended the format in which it featured episodes that had much more dialogue than normal. 78 new episodes began broadcasting from 6 February 2015.

=== Feature films ===

Two theatrical feature-length films featuring Mr. Bean have been released, with Atkinson reprising his role as the character in each. The first film, &quot;Bean&quot;, was directed by Mel Smith, released in 1997 and followed the misadventures of Mr. Bean as he oversaw the transfer of &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; to a Los Angeles art gallery. The film broke from the programme&#x27;s traditional narrative by using a subplot with more developed characters, whereby Bean was not the sole centre of attention but interacted with a suburban Californian family that he stays with during the film. The film was commercially successful, grossing more than US$250 million globally ($45 million in the USA) on a budget estimated at $18 million, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics and holding a 41% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The second film, &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, was directed by Steve Bendelack and released in 2007. The film follows Bean on an eventful journey across France for a holiday in the French Riviera which, after a number of mishaps, culminates in an unscheduled screening of his video diary at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. The setting was despite an earlier rumour in February 2001 stating that an unused script by Richard Curtis would see him on an Australian misadventure. Production on the film occurred during 2006 and saw its first release in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007; it premiered in North America on 17 July that year at the Just for Laughs festival in Canada, where the character had been launched 20 years earlier, before being released nationwide over a month later on 24 August. The film is notable for featuring a mixture of traditional film photography and home-shot video camera photography. The film garnered improved critical reception (with a 52% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and was also commercially successful, grossing nearly US$230 million globally ($33 million in the United States) against a $25 million budget. &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; was originally the last live-action appearance of the character, before reappearing at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony five years later.

=== London 2012 Olympic Summer Games opening ceremony ===
In 2012, Atkinson reprised his character for a live performance as part of the London 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the London Symphony Orchestra in its performance of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, conducted by Simon Rattle. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed sports jacket but the traditional clothing of the musician – white tie and tails. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the synthesiser and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the grand piano. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with his serviette, he throws it into the grand piano.

He then falls asleep continuing to play the note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding that the rest of the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound then stops.

Director Danny Boyle later explained: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his character was Derek&quot;
In 2021&#x27;s &quot;Happy Birthday Mr. Bean&quot; documentary, Atkinson and Curtis also stated that the performance wasn&#x27;t actually intended to be the character Mr. Bean, although the official Olympic YouTube channel and the live commentary promoted it as such.

Two books tied-in to the original live-action series were released: &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Diary&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Pocket Diary&quot; in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format in which they are printed. The content of both is a template diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in Highbury and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.

They confirm the name of Mr. Bean&#x27;s girlfriend as &quot;Irma Gobb&quot; and also give the name of the other man she actually dances with in &quot;Mr. Bean Goes to Town&quot; (Giles Gummer). An additional book also called &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Diary&quot; was released in 2002 to accompany &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot;; this book was also graded as a children&#x27;s reader.

Two further books, &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Scrapbook: All About Me in America&quot; (1997) and &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Definitive and Extremely Marvelous Guide to France&quot; (2007), were released to tie-in with the feature films &quot;Bean&quot; and &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; respectively.

=== Other appearances ===

Rowan Atkinson has appeared in character as Mr. Bean in many television broadcasts, sometimes as a publicity stunt to promote a new episode, DVD or film. A number of short sketches for the Comic Relief telethon have also been produced and Bean also starred in various commercials, music videos and in YouTube videos such as Handy Bean. In 2017 Atkinson appeared in the Chinese film &quot;Top Funny Comedian: The Movie&quot; a spin-off film of a variety show of the same name; the plot involves a number of Chinese people getting involved in a series of misadventures during a visit to Macau at the same time as Mr. Bean. One of the film&#x27;s stars, comedian Guo Degang, informed media outlet &quot;The Beijinger&quot; that due to Atkinson being unable to speak Mandarin, the cast used mainly body language to speak to each other saying that &quot;with facial expressions and gestures we seemed to understand each other, [it] was really an interesting experience, which proves that comedy can cross boundaries.&quot; The film was distributed in Chinese territories, but as of 2017, had yet to receive an American or European release.

== Home media ==
The series was available on a number of Thames Television VHS compilations. In the United Kingdom (Region 2), episodes of &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; were released on a yearly basis by Universal Pictures UK from 2004. The complete collection is now available, including the two feature films and other extras. The episodes were released on VHS by A&amp;E Home Video in the United States in the 2000s. These releases are unique in that they contain the original opening credits for the first three episodes, as seen when originally broadcast on television. In addition, they contain extra scenes which were edited into certain episodes at the request of PBS, in order to extend the run-time for a commercial-free airing. In Canada and the United States, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; was released on VHS by Polygram Home Video in the 1990s. In the United States (Region 1), the complete series has been available since 2003 on A&amp;E Home Video as &quot;The Whole Bean&quot;. The documentary &quot;The Story of Mr. Bean&quot; is edited on both the UK and USA DVD sets: it was originally 52 minutes when broadcast on television. However, it is 48 minutes on the UK DVD while only 40 on the American DVD. Most notably, in the UK version, the section detailing &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; has humorous clips from the film removed. The American DVD features the same edits as the British DVD but is also missing comments by Burt Reynolds on the set of &quot;Bean&quot;, comments by Jeff Goldblum, some clips from the show &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; and many others. The record-selling UK videos were withdrawn shortly before the release of &quot;Bean&quot;, and the DVDs were released on an annual basis since 2004.

In August 2009, an official YouTube channel of the series was launched featuring content from both the original live-action and animated series.

The series was re-released by Shout Factory in North America on 24 March 2015 on DVD to coincide with its 25th anniversary. This set contains digitally remastered episodes (similar to the 2010 British release), the 40-minute &quot;The Story of Mr. Bean&quot;, additional scenes: &quot;Turkey Weight&quot;, &quot;Armchair Sale&quot;, &quot;Marching&quot;, and &quot;Playing With Matches&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot; and &quot;Library&quot; sketches, a trailer for &quot;Mr. Bean: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;The Best Bits of Mr. Bean&quot;, a 72-minute clip show.

== In popular culture ==

Various politicians have been mocked for a supposed facial resemblance to Mr. Bean, including Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Sam Dastyari, Ed Miliband and Michael Gove.

In &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode 52 – &quot;Mind Control&quot;, the idea of painting a room with explosives placed in a tin of paint, as seen in &quot;Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean&quot;, was tested and deemed impossible as adequate coverage was not achieved.

An image of Mr. Bean grinning mischievously has been used as an internet meme for highlighting sexual double entendres, usually accompanied by the statement &quot;If you know what I mean.&quot;

In Tetsuo Hara and Buronson&#x27;s manga &quot;Souten no Ken&quot;, a parody of Mr. Bean can be found.

<text>In organic chemistry, the Swern oxidation, named after Daniel Swern, is a chemical reaction whereby a primary or secondary alcohol () is oxidized to an aldehyde () or ketone () using oxalyl chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and an organic base, such as triethylamine. It is one of the many oxidation reactions commonly referred to as &#x27;activated DMSO&#x27; oxidations. The reaction is known for its mild character and wide tolerance of functional groups.

The by-products are dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and—when triethylamine is used as base—triethylammonium chloride (Et3NHCl). Of the volatile by-products, dimethyl sulfide has a strong, pervasive odour and carbon monoxide is acutely toxic, so the reaction and the work-up needs to be performed in a fume hood. Dimethyl sulfide is a volatile liquid (B.P. 37 °C) with an unpleasant odour at even low concentrations.

==Mechanism==
The first step of the Swern oxidation is the low-temperature reaction of DMSO, 1a, formally as resonance contributor 1b, with oxalyl chloride, 2. The first intermediate, 3, quickly decomposes giving off carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and producing chloro(dimethyl)sulfonium chloride, 4.

After addition of the alcohol 5, the chloro(dimethyl)sulfonium chloride 4 reacts with the alcohol to give the key alkoxysulfonium ion intermediate, 6. The addition of at least 2 equivalents of base — typically triethylamine — will deprotonate the alkoxysulfonium ion to give the sulfur ylide 7. In a five-membered ring transition state, the sulfur ylide 7 decomposes to give dimethyl sulfide and the desired carbonyl compound 8.

==Variations==
When using oxalyl chloride as the dehydration agent, the reaction must be kept colder than −60 °C to avoid side reactions. With cyanuric chloride or trifluoroacetic anhydride instead of oxalyl chloride, the reaction can be warmed to −30 °C without side reactions. Other methods for the activation of DMSO to initiate the formation of the key intermediate 6 are the use of carbodiimides (Pfitzner–Moffatt oxidation), a sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (Parikh–Doering oxidation) or acetic anhydride (Albright-Goldman oxidation). The intermediate 4 can also be prepared from dimethyl sulfide and &quot;N&quot;-chlorosuccinimide (the Corey–Kim oxidation).

In some cases, the use of triethylamine as the base can lead to epimerisation at the carbon alpha to the newly formed carbonyl. Using a bulkier base, such as diisopropylethylamine, can mitigate this side reaction.

==Considerations==
Dimethyl sulfide, a byproduct of the Swern oxidation, is one of the most notoriously unpleasant odors known in organic chemistry. Humans can detect this compound in concentrations as low as 0.02 to 0.1 parts per million. A simple remedy for this problem is to rinse used glassware with bleach or oxone solution, which will oxidize the dimethyl sulfide back to dimethyl sulfoxide or to dimethyl sulfone, both of which are odourless and nontoxic.

The reaction conditions allow oxidation of acid-sensitive compounds, which might decompose under the acidic oxidation conditions such as Jones oxidation. For example, in Thompson &amp; Heathcock&#x27;s synthesis of the sesquiterpene isovelleral, the final step uses the Swern protocol, avoiding rearrangement of the acid-sensitive cyclopropanemethanol moiety.

<text>Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) is random-access memory that retains data without applied power. This is in contrast to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM), which both maintain data only for as long as power is applied, or forms of sequential-access memory such as magnetic tape, which cannot be randomly accessed but which retains data indefinitely without electric power.

Read-only memory devices can be used to store system firmware in embedded systems such as an automotive ignition system control or home appliance. They are also used to hold the initial processor instructions required to bootstrap a computer system. Read-write memory such as NVRAM can be used to store calibration constants, passwords, or setup information, and may be integrated into a microcontroller.

If the main memory of a computer system were non-volatile, it would greatly reduce the time required to start a system after a power interruption. Current existing types of semiconductor non-volatile memory have limitations in memory size, power consumption, or operating life that make them impractical for main memory. Development is going on for the use of non-volatile memory chips as a system&#x27;s main memory, as persistent memory. A standard for persistent memory known as NVDIMM-P has been published in 2021.

Some early computers used magnetic drum which was non-volatile as a byproduct of its construction. The industry moved to magnetic-core memory in the later 1950s, which stored data in the polarity of small magnets. Since the magnets held their state even with the power removed, core memory was also non-volatile. Other memory types required constant power to retain data, such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops, Williams tube, and semiconductor memory (static or dynamic RAM).

Advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density. Today dynamic RAM forms the vast majority of a typical computer&#x27;s main memory. Many systems require at least some non-volatile memory. Desktop computers require permanent storage of the instructions required to load the operating system. Embedded systems, such as an engine control computer for a car, must retain their instructions when power is removed. Many systems used a combination of RAM and some form of ROM for these roles.

Custom ROM integrated circuits were one solution. The memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit, and so could not be modified once completed.

PROM improved on this design, allowing the chip to be written electrically by the end-user. PROM consists of a series of diodes that are initially all set to a single value, 1 for instance. By applying higher power than normal, a selected diode can be &quot;burned out&quot; (like a fuse), thereby permanently setting that bit to 0. PROM facilitated prototyping and small-volume manufacturing. Many semiconductor manufacturers provided a PROM version of their mask ROM part so that development firmware could be tested before ordering a mask ROM.

Currently, the best-known form of both NV-RAM and EEPROM memory is flash memory. Some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address, and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles (as of January 2010 most consumer flash products can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate). Another drawback is the performance limitations preventing flash from matching the response times and, in some cases, the random addressability offered by traditional forms of RAM. Several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles, and some even claim to be a truly universal memory, offering the performance of the best SRAM devices with the non-volatility of flash. As of June 2018 these alternatives have not yet become mainstream.

Those who required real RAM-like performance and non-volatility typically have had to use conventional RAM devices and a battery backup. For example, IBM PC&#x27;s and successors beginning with the IBM PC AT used nonvolatile BIOS memory, often called &quot;CMOS RAM&quot; or &quot;parameter RAM&quot;, and this was a common solution in other early microcomputer systems like the original Apple Macintosh, which used a small amount of memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume. (The original IBM PC and PC XT instead used DIP switches to represent up to 24 bits of system configuration data; DIP or similar switches are another, primitive type of programmable ROM device that was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s for very small amounts of data—typically no more than 8 bytes.) Before industry standardization on the IBM PC architecture, some other microcomputer models used battery-backed RAM more extensively: for example, in the TRS-80 Model 100/Tandy 102, all of the main memory (8 KB minimum, 32 KB maximum) is battery-backed SRAM. Also, in the 1990s many video game software cartridges (e.g. for consoles such as the Sega Genesis) included battery-backed RAM to retain saved games, high scores, and similar data. Also, some arcade video game cabinets contain CPU modules that include battery-backed RAM containing keys for on-the-fly game software decryption. Much larger battery-backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases that require a performance level newer NVRAM devices have not yet managed to meet.

==Floating-gate MOSFET==

A huge advance in NVRAM technology was the introduction of the floating-gate MOSFET transistor, which led to the introduction of &quot;erasable programmable read-only memory&quot;, or EPROM. EPROM consists of a grid of transistors whose &quot;gate&quot; terminal (the switch) is protected by a high-quality insulator. By pushing electrons onto the base with the application of higher-than-normal voltage, the electrons become trapped on the far side of the insulator, thereby permanently switching the transistor on (1). EPROM can be reset to the &quot;base state&quot; (all 1s or 0s, depending on the design) by applying ultraviolet light (UV). The UV photons have enough energy to push the electrons through the insulator and return the base to a ground state. At that point the EPROM can be re-written from scratch.

An improvement on EPROM, EEPROM, soon followed. The extra E stands for &quot;electrically&quot;, referring to the ability to reset EEPROM using electricity instead of UV, making the devices much easier to use in practice. The bits are re-set with the application of even higher power through the other terminals of the transistor (&quot;source&quot; and &quot;drain&quot;). This high-power pulse, in effect, sucks the electrons through the insulator, returning it to the ground state. This process has the disadvantage of mechanically degrading the chip, however, so memory systems based on floating-gate transistors in general have short write-lifetimes, on the order of 105 writes to any particular bit.

One approach to overcoming the rewrite count limitation is to have a standard SRAM where each bit is backed up by an EEPROM bit. In normal operation the chip functions as a fast SRAM and in case of power failure the content is quickly transferred to the EEPROM part, from where it gets loaded back at the next power up. Such chips were called NOVRAMs by their manufacturers.

The basis of flash memory is identical to EEPROM and differs largely in internal layout. Flash allows its memory to be written only in blocks, which greatly simplifies the internal wiring and allows for higher densities. Memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems, and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest-cost solid-state memory devices available. Starting around 2000, demand for ever-greater quantities of flash have driven manufacturers to use only the latest fabrication systems in order to increase density as much as possible. Although fabrication limits are starting to come into play, new &quot;multi-bit&quot; techniques appear to be able to double or quadruple the density even at existing line widths.

==Commercialized Alternatives==

Flash and EEPROM&#x27;s limited write-cycles are a serious problem for any real RAM-like role. In addition, the high power needed to write the cells is a problem in low-power roles, where NVRAM is often used. The power also needs time to be &quot;built up&quot; in a device known as a charge pump, which makes writing dramatically slower than reading, often as much as 1,000 times. A number of new memory devices have been proposed to address these shortcomings.

===Ferroelectric RAM===

To date, the only such system to enter widespread production is ferroelectric RAM, or F-RAM (sometimes referred to as FeRAM). F-RAM is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but (instead of a dielectric layer like in DRAM) contains a thin ferroelectric film of lead zirconate titanate [], commonly referred to as PZT. The Zr/Ti atoms in the PZT change polarity in an electric field, thereby producing a binary switch. Unlike RAM devices, F-RAM retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted, due to the PZT crystal maintaining polarity. Due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced, F-RAM offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options, including extremely high endurance (exceeding 1016 access cycles for 3.3 V devices), ultra low power consumption (since F-RAM does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories), single-cycle write speeds, and gamma radiation tolerance. Ramtron International has developed, produced, and licensed ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM), and other companies that have licensed and produced F-RAM technology include Texas Instruments, Rohm, and Fujitsu.

===Magnetoresistive RAM===

Another approach to see major development effort is magnetoresistive random-access memory, or MRAM, which uses magnetic elements and in general operates in a fashion similar to core, at least for the first-generation technology. Only one MRAM chip has entered production to date: Everspin Technologies&#x27; 4 Mbit part, which is a first-generation MRAM that utilizes cross-point field induced writing. Two second-generation techniques are currently in development: Thermal Assisted Switching (TAS), which is being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working. STT-MRAM appears to allow for much higher densities than those of the first generation, but is lagging behind flash for the same reasons as FeRAM – enormous competitive pressures in the flash market.

===Phase-change RAM===

Another solid-state technology to see more than purely experimental development is Phase-change RAM, or PRAM. PRAM is based on the same storage mechanism as writable CDs and DVDs, but reads them based on their changes in electrical resistance rather than changes in their optical properties. Considered a dark horse for some time, in 2006 Samsung announced the availability of a 512 Mbit part, considerably higher capacity than either MRAM or FeRAM. The areal density of these parts appears to be even higher than modern flash devices, the lower overall storage being due to the lack of multi-bit encoding. This announcement was followed by one from Intel and STMicroelectronics, who demonstrated their own PRAM devices at the 2006 Intel Developer Forum in October.

Intel and Micron Technology had a joint venture to sell PRAM devices under the names 3D XPoint, Optane and QuantX, which was discontinued in July 2022.

STMicroelectronics manufactures phase-change memory devices for automotive applications.

==Researched Alternatives==

===Millipede memory===

Perhaps one of the more innovative solutions is millipede memory, developed by IBM. Millipede is, in essence, a punched card rendered using nanotechnology in order to dramatically increase areal density. Although it was planned to introduce Millipede as early as 2003, unexpected problems in development delayed this until 2005, by which point it was no longer competitive with flash. In theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 Tbit/in2 (≈155 Gbit/cm2), greater than even the best hard drive technologies currently in use (perpendicular recording offers 636 Gbit/in2 (≈98.6 Gbit/cm2) as of Dec. 2011), but future heat-assisted magnetic recording and patterned media together could support densities of 10 Tbit/in2 (≈1.55 Tbit/cm2). However, slow read and write times for memories this large seem to limit this technology to hard drive replacements as opposed to high-speed RAM-like uses, although to a very large degree the same is true of flash as well.

===FeFET memory===

An alternative application of (hafnium oxide based) ferroelectrics is Fe FET based memory, which utilises a ferroelectric between the gate and device of a field-effect transistor. Such devices are claimed to have the advantage that they utilise the same technology as HKMG (high-L metal gate) based lithography, and scale to the same size as a conventional FET at a given process node. As of 2017 32Mbit devices have been demonstrated at 22 nm.

<doc id="173882" wikidata="Q28195035" url="?curid=173882" title="Expo (Magnus Lindberg)">
<text>EXPO is an orchestral composition by the Finnish composer Magnus Lindberg. It was the first work commissioned by the New York Philharmonic under the conductor Alan Gilbert, and was Lindberg&#x27;s first commission as the orchestra&#x27;s composer-in-residence. The piece was first performed on September 16, 2009 at Avery Fisher Hall, New York City, during Alan Gilbert&#x27;s inaugural concert with the New York Philharmonic. &quot;EXPO&quot; was the first newly commissioned work to open the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s concert season since the premiere of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Connotations&quot; under Leonard Bernstein on September 23, 1962.

==Composition==
&quot;EXPO&quot; has a duration of roughly 10 minutes and is composed in a single movement.

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, harp, and strings.

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere, Anthony Tommasini of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an urgent, inventive 10-minute piece&quot; and wrote, &quot;as Mr. Lindberg, a pragmatic composer, surely realized, this occasion did not warrant a gnarly, intimidating modern piece. Not that &#x27;EXPO&#x27; was some easygoing crowd pleaser. It is an intense, complex and elusive piece, yet somehow celebratory.&quot; Jeff Dunn of the &quot;San Francisco Classical Voice&quot; called it &quot;a terrific curtain raiser, 10 minutes of alternating string whooshes (reminiscent of Lindberg&#x27;s Finnish countrymen Sibelius and Rautavaara) and brass chorales.&quot;&quot; David Patrick Stearns of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; similarly observed, &quot;Part fanfare, part concerto for orchestra, &quot;Expo&quot; is an aerobic workout for all sections of the orchestra and [...] an exhilarating showcase. Though far from Lindberg&#x27;s best work, &quot;Expo&quot; is a fine curtain-raiser. And if ever you felt lost in the high-traffic orchestration, you could at least glom onto the near-quotations of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in the brass writing.&quot;

<doc id="173889" wikidata="Q6407553" url="?curid=173889" title="Killer heuristic">
<text>In competitive two-player games, the killer heuristic is a move-ordering method based on the observation that a strong move or small set of such moves in a particular position may be equally strong in similar positions at the same move (ply) in the game tree.
Retaining such moves obviates the effort of rediscovering them in sibling nodes.

This technique improves the efficiency of alpha–beta pruning, which in turn improves the efficiency of the minimax algorithm. Alpha–beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first. This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a &quot;cutoff&quot;, a condition where the game-playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further. I.e. the game-playing program will always make its best available move for each position. It only needs to consider the other player&#x27;s possible responses to that best move, and can skip evaluation of responses to (worse) moves it will not make.

The killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position. By trying the &quot;killer move&quot; before other moves, a game-playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position.

In practical implementation, game-playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves. If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth. This idea can be generalized into a set of refutation tables.

A generalization of the killer heuristic is the &quot;history heuristic&quot;. The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; squares or piece moving and the &quot;to&quot; square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding &quot;d&quot; or &quot;d²&quot; where &quot;d&quot; is the current search depth.

<text>Grue is a municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Solør. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Kirkenær. Other villages in the municipality include Bergesida, Grinder, Namnå, Risberget, Rotberget, Skasenden, and Svullrya.

The municipality is the 136th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Grue is the 189th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 4,572. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 8.5% over the previous 10-year period.

Economy: One private company (a lamp factory) has 51 employees; as of June 2024, there is less than a year until the production gets moved to an EU country.

==General information==
The parish of Grue was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1867, the southern district of Grue (population: 3,946) was separated to become the new municipality of Brandval. This left Grue municipality with 6,464 residents. In 1941, a small area of Grue (population: 68) was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Brandval. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1969, the Rotberget farm area (population: 23) was transferred from Åsnes Municipality to Grue. On 1 January 1974, an unpopulated part of the Lystad area was transferred from Grue to the neighboring municipality of Kongsvinger.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Grue&quot; farm ( or ) since the first Grue Church was built there. The name is identical with the word or which means &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;hollow&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 30 October 1992. The official blazon is &quot;Per bend sinister rayonny of wolf-teeth argent and vert&quot; (). This means the arms have are divided with a diagonal line that is rayonny, meaning it looks like curved wolf teeth rather than a straight line. The field (background) below the line has a tincture of Vert (green). Above the line, the field has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The flame-like line represents the clearance of farms in the woods by the use of fire and is also a remembrance of the gruesome church fire of 1822. The colors symbolize the forests and the Glomma river. The arms were designed by Harald Hallstensen. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Grue. It is part of the Solør, Vinger og Odal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar.
==Geography==

Grue is situated around the Glomma river and the geography is dominated largely by forests and some agricultural areas around Glomma. Grue is located in the southeast part of Innlandet county. It is bordered on the south by the municipality of Kongsvinger, on the north by the municipality of Åsnes, and on the west by Nord-Odal. To the east, it borders Sweden.

Grue was the early center for the Finnish migration which today populates the Finnskogen, a belt about wide and running continuously along the frontier in the districts of Brandval, Grue, Hof, Åsnes, and Våler. Their first population center in Norway was located around the lake of Røgden.

The rivers Løvhaugsåa and Rotna both run through the area. The lakes Hukusjøen, Skasen, Gardsjøen.

==Government==
Grue Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Romerike og Glåmdal District Court and the Eidsivating Court of Appeal.

<text>Glomma or Glåma is Norway&#x27;s longest and most voluminous river. With a total length of , it has a drainage basin that covers 13% of Norway&#x27;s surface area, all in the southern part of the country.

==Geography==
At its fullest length, the river runs from the lake Aursunden in Røros Municipality in Trøndelag county and runs into the Oslofjord at the town of Fredrikstad in Fredrikstad Municipality in Østfold county. Major tributaries include the Vorma River, which drains Lake Mjøsa, joining the Glomma River at Årnes in Nes Municipality. The large river Lågen drains into Lake Mjøsa, collecting drainage from the large Gudbrandsdalen valley and significantly increasing the Glomma&#x27;s flow.

Because it flows through some of the richest forest districts, it has historically been Norway&#x27;s leading log-floating river. The combination of raw materials, water power, and easy transport has over the centuries encouraged industry along the Glomma. Some of the country&#x27;s largest manufacturing and processing concerns are found around its mouth, where supplies of timber and hydropower have been backed by excellent port facilities.

The upper limit of the Glomma valley farms is variable, but typically runs about in Østerdalen, slightly lower than in the Gudbrandsdalen, which reflects the colder climate. The treeline, with a light birch forest, rises to about in Østerdalen. North of Røros, the forested areas are only on the valley floor.

The upper river valleys of Norwegian rivers have distinctive names which are vestiges of earlier cultural distinctions such as building styles, traditional clothing or bunad and domestic crafts. The upper valley of the Glomma is the Østerdalen ().

Upon entering Lake Øyeren at Fetsund, the Glomma has formed Europe&#x27;s largest inland delta which reaches the opposite side of the lake, across its short axis. Some of the vast amount of silt that the Glomma deposits in Lake Øyeren is extracted to manufacture LECA building blocks widely used for in the construction of foundations in Norway.

==Name==
The form &quot;Glomma&quot; is used in Østfold and Akershus counties, while in Innlandet and Trøndelag counties the river is called (and written) &quot;Glåma&quot;. An older form was &quot;Glaumr&quot;; another, in Old Norse, was &quot;Raumelfr&quot;, meaning a &quot;loud noise&quot; or &quot;thunder&quot; + &quot;river&quot;.

Several places are named after the river, for instance Glåmdal and Glåmos.

<text>The epicenter (), epicentre, or epicentrum in seismology is the point on the Earth&#x27;s surface directly above a hypocenter or focus, the point where an earthquake or an underground explosion originates.

==Determination==

The primary purpose of a seismometer is to locate the initiating points of earthquake epicenters. The secondary purpose, of determining the &#x27;size&#x27; or magnitude must be calculated after the precise location is known.

The earliest seismographs were designed to give a sense of the direction of the first motions from an earthquake. The Chinese frog seismograph would have dropped its ball in the general compass direction of the earthquake, assuming a strong positive pulse. We now know that first motions can be in almost any direction depending on the type of initiating rupture (focal mechanism).

The first refinement that allowed a more precise determination of the location was the use of a time scale. Instead of merely noting, or recording, the absolute motions of a pendulum, the displacements were plotted on a moving graph, driven by a clock mechanism. This was the first seismogram, which allowed precise timing of the first ground motion, and an accurate plot of subsequent motions.

From the first seismograms, as seen in the figure, it was noticed that the trace was divided into two major portions. The first seismic wave to arrive was the P wave, followed closely by the S wave. Knowing the relative &#x27;velocities of propagation&#x27;, it was a simple matter to calculate the distance of the earthquake.

One seismograph would give the distance, but that could be plotted as a circle, with an infinite number of possibilities. Two seismographs would give two intersecting circles, with two possible locations. Only with a third seismograph would there be a precise location.

Modern earthquake location still requires a minimum of three seismometers. Most likely, there are many, forming a seismic array. The emphasis is on precision since much can be learned about the fault mechanics and seismic hazard, if the locations can be determined to be within a kilometer or two, for small earthquakes. For this, computer programs use an iterative process, involving a &#x27;guess and correction&#x27; algorithm. As well, a very good model of the local crustal velocity structure is required: seismic velocities vary with the local geology. For P waves, the relation between velocity and bulk density of the medium has been quantified in Gardner&#x27;s relation.

==Surface damage==
Before the instrumental period of earthquake observation, the epicenter was thought to be the location where the greatest damage occurred, but the subsurface fault rupture may be long and spread surface damage across the entire rupture zone. As an example, in the magnitude 7.9 Denali earthquake of 2002 in Alaska, the epicenter was at the western end of the rupture, but the greatest damage was about away at the eastern end. Focal depths of earthquakes occurring in continental crust mostly range from . Continental earthquakes below are rare whereas in subduction zone earthquakes can originate at depths deeper than .

==Epicentral distance==

During an earthquake, seismic waves propagates in all directions from the hypocenter. Seismic shadowing occurs on the opposite side of the Earth from the earthquake epicenter because the planet&#x27;s liquid outer core refracts the longitudinal or compressional (P waves) while it absorbs the transverse or shear waves (S waves). Outside the seismic shadow zone, both types of wave can be detected, but because of their different velocities and paths through the Earth, they arrive at different times. By measuring the time difference on any seismograph and the distance on a travel-time graph on which the P wave and S wave have the same separation, geologists can calculate the distance to the quake&#x27;s epicenter. This distance is called the &quot;epicentral distance&quot;, commonly measured in ° (degrees) and denoted as Δ (delta) in seismology. The Láska&#x27;s empirical rule provides an approximation of epicentral distance in the range of 2,000−10,000 km.

Once distances from the epicenter have been calculated from at least three seismographic measuring stations, the point can be located, using trilateration.

Epicentral distance is also used in calculating seismic magnitudes as developed by Richter and Gutenberg.

==Fault rupture==

The point at which fault slipping begins is referred to as the focus of the earthquake. The fault rupture begins at the focus and then expands along the fault surface. The rupture stops where the stresses become insufficient to continue breaking the fault (because the rocks are stronger) or where the rupture enters ductile material. The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the total area of its fault rupture. Most earthquakes are small, with rupture dimensions less than the depth of the focus so the rupture doesn&#x27;t break the surface, but in high magnitude, destructive earthquakes, surface breaks are common. Fault ruptures in large earthquakes can extend for more than . When a fault ruptures unilaterally (with the epicenter at or near the end of the fault break) the waves are stronger in one direction along the fault.

==Macroseismic epicenter==
The macroseismic epicenter is the best estimate of the location of the epicenter derived without instrumental data. This may be estimated using intensity data, information about foreshocks and aftershocks, knowledge of local fault systems or extrapolations from data regarding similar earthquakes. For historical earthquakes that have not been instrumentally recorded, only a macroseismic epicenter can be given.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Neo-Latin noun &quot;epicentrum&quot;, the latinisation of the ancient Greek adjective ἐπίκεντρος (), &quot;occupying a cardinal point, situated on a centre&quot;, from ἐπί (&quot;epi&quot;) &quot;on, upon, at&quot; and κέντρον (&quot;kentron&quot;) &quot;&quot;. The term was coined by Irish seismologist Robert Mallet.

It is also used to mean &quot;center of activity&quot;, as in &quot;Travel is restricted in the Chinese province thought to be the epicentre of the SARS outbreak.&quot; &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot; gives several examples of use in which &quot;epicenter&quot; is used to mean &quot;center&quot;. Garner also refers to a William Safire article in which Safire quotes a geophysicist as attributing the use of the term to &quot;spurious erudition on the part of writers combined with scientific illiteracy on the part of copy editors&quot;. Garner has speculated that these misuses may just be &quot;metaphorical descriptions of focal points of unstable and potentially destructive environments.&quot;

<text>Einar Benediktsson, often referred to as Einar Ben (31 October 1864 – 12 January 1940) was an Icelandic poet and lawyer.

Einar Benediktsson&#x27;s poetry was a significant contribution to the nationalistic revival which led to Iceland&#x27;s independence. To this end, he was active both in founding the Landvarnarflokkurinn in 1902, and as the editor of Iceland&#x27;s first daily newspaper, Dagskrá, from 1896 to 1898. 
As a poet, he may be classified as a Neo-Romantic. He advocated for Greenland to become part of an independent Iceland.

He pioneered as a strong advocate of inward foreign investment to utilize Iceland&#x27;s natural resources. 
In 1906 he joined the management of two companies, Skjálfanda and Gigant, formed to build and operate hydroelectric power plants, particularly the northern waterfalls of the Skjálfandafljót and Jökulsá á Fjöllum rivers.
Fund raising began, but there was opposition from people who objected to foreign involvement.
In 1914 Einar Benediktsson was one of the founders of Fossafélagið Títan and three sister companies Sirius, Orion and Taurus, established to harness the power of the Þjórsá waterfalls.

His translations include English, and American poetry, and a masterpiece in rendering Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s epic, Peer Gynt, into Icelandic. Einar Benediktsson was buried at Iceland&#x27;s national shrine, Þingvellir. He has descendants living today in Iceland, other European countries, and the United States, most notably including former ambassador and namesake Einar Benediktsson (b. 1931).

He resided at Höfði house in northern Reykjavík for twelve years between 1913 and 1925. Einar&#x27;s statue, made in 1964 by Ásmundur Sveinsson, was moved in 2015 from Miklatún park, in Reykjavik, and now stands near the house.

<text>David Baltimore (born March 7, 1938) is an American biologist, university administrator, and 1975 Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine. He is a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he served as president from 1997 to 2006. He founded the Whitehead Institute and directed it from 1982 to 1990. In 2008, he served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

At age 37, Baltimore won the Nobel Prize with Renato Dulbecco and Howard M. Temin &quot;for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumour viruses and the genetic material of the cell&quot;, specifically the discovery of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. He has contributed to immunology, virology, cancer research, biotechnology, and recombinant DNA research. He has also trained many doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, several of whom have gone on to notable and distinguished research careers. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he has received a number of awards, including the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1999 and the Lasker Award in 2021.

==Early life and education==

Baltimore was born on March 7, 1938, in New York City to Gertrude (Lipschitz) and Richard Baltimore. Raised in the Queens neighborhoods of Forest Hills and Rego Park, he moved with his family to suburban Great Neck, New York, while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate. His father had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and his mother was an atheist, and Baltimore observed Jewish holidays and would attend synagogue with his father through his Bar Mitzvah. He graduated from Great Neck North High School in 1956, and credits his interest in biology to a high-school summer spent at the Jackson Laboratory&#x27;s Summer Student Program in Bar Harbor, Maine. It was at this program that he met Howard Temin, with whom he would later share the Nobel Prize.

Baltimore earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree with high honors at Swarthmore College in 1960. He was introduced to molecular biology by George Streisinger, under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the Undergraduate Research Program in 1959. There he also met two new MIT faculty, future Nobel Laureate Salvador Luria and Cyrus Levinthal, who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology. They invited him to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Baltimore&#x27;s future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered MIT&#x27;s graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science, completing his PhD thesis work in two years. His early interest in phage genetics quickly yielded to a passion for animal viruses. He took the Cold Spring Harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to Richard Franklin&#x27;s (got his doctoral degree from Rockefeller Institute) lab at the Rockefeller Institute at New York City, which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology. There he made fundamental discoveries on virus replication and its effect on cell metabolism, including the first description of an RNA replicase.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, Baltimore returned to MIT for postdoctoral research with James Darnell in 1963. He continued his work on virus replication using poliovirus and pursued training in enzymology with Jerard Hurwitz at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1964/1965.

===Independent investigator===
In February 1965, Baltimore was recruited by Renato Dulbecco to the newly established Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla as an independent research associate. There he investigated poliovirus RNA replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists&#x27; early careers including Marc Girard, and Michael Jacobson. They discovered the mechanism of proteolytic cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors, pointing to the importance of proteolytic processing in the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins. He also met his future wife, Alice Huang, who began working with Baltimore at Salk in 1967. He and Alice together carried out key experiments on defective interfering particles and viral pseudo types. During this work, he made a key discovery that polio produced its viral proteins as a single large polyprotein that was subsequently processed into individual functional peptides.

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===
==== Reverse transcriptase ====
In 1968, he was recruited once more by soon-to-be Nobel laureate Salvador Luria to the department of biology at MIT as an associate professor of microbiology. Alice S. Huang also moved to MIT to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They became a couple, and married in October 1968. At MIT, Huang, Baltimore, and graduate student Martha Stampfer discovered that VSV replication involved an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the virus particle, and used a novel strategy to replicate its RNA genome. VSV entered a host cell as a single negative strand of RNA, but brought with it RNA polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more RNA.

Baltimore extended this work and examined two RNA tumor viruses, Rauscher murine leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus. He went on to discover reverse transcriptase (RTase or RT) – the enzyme that polymerizes DNA from an RNA template. In doing so, he discovered a distinct class of viruses, later called retroviruses, that use an RNA template to catalyze synthesis of viral DNA. This overturned the simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology that stated that genetic information flows unidirectionally from DNA to RNA to proteins. Reverse transcriptase is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses, allowing such viruses to turn viral RNA strands into viral DNA strands. The viruses that fall into this category include HIV.

The discovery of reverse transcriptase, made contemporaneously with Howard Temin, who had proposed the provirus hypothesis, showed that genetic information could traffic bidirectionally between DNA and RNA. They published these findings in back-to-back papers in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. This discovery made it easier to isolate and reproduce individual genes, and was heralded as evidence that molecular and virological approaches to understanding cancer would yield new cancer treatments. This may have influenced President Richard Nixon&#x27;s War on Cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease. In 1972, at the age of 34, Baltimore was awarded tenure as a professor of biology at MIT, a post that he held until 1997.

====Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA====
Baltimore also helped Paul Berg and Maxine Singer to organize the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, held in February 1975. The conference discussed possible dangers of new biotechnology, drew up voluntary safety guidelines, and issued a call for an ongoing moratorium on certain types of experiments and review of possible experiments, which has been institutionalized by recombinant DNA advisory committees established at essentially all US academic institutions conducting molecular biology research. Baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory: &quot;The whole Asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before.&quot;

===MIT Cancer Center===
In 1973, he was awarded an American Cancer Society Professor of Microbiology that provided substantial salary support. Also in 1973, he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized MIT Center for Cancer Research (CCR), capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase. The MIT CCR was led by Salvador E. Luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a group of faculty including Baltimore, Phillips Robbins, Herman Eisen, Philip Sharp, and Robert Weinberg, who all went on to illustrious research careers. Baltimore was honored as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. He returned to New York City in 1975, for a year-long sabbatical at Rockefeller University working with Jim Darnell.

=== Nobel Prize ===
In 1975, at the age of 37, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The citation reads, &quot;for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell.&quot; At the time, Baltimore&#x27;s greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase (Rtase or RT) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV and was discovered independently, and at about the same time, by Satoshi Mizutani and Temin.

After winning the Nobel Prize, Baltimore reorganized his laboratory, refocusing on immunology and virology, with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest. He tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of Abelson murine leukemia virus (AMuLV), lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology. In 1980, his group isolated the oncogene in AMuLV and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor. This type of enzymatic activity was also discovered by Tony Hunter, who has done extensive work in the area. He also continued to pursue fundamental questions in RNA viruses and in 1981, Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello, a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory, used recombinant DNA technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus, an animal RNA virus. The plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced. The infectious clone, DNA encoding the genome of a virus, is a standard tool used today in virology.

===Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research===
In 1982, with a charitable donation by businessman and philanthropist Edwin C. &quot;Jack&quot; Whitehead, Baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research. Baltimore persuaded Whitehead that MIT would be the ideal home for the new institute, convinced that it would be superior at hiring the best researchers in biology at the time, thus ensuring quality. Persuading MIT faculty to support the idea was far more difficult. MIT as an institution had never housed another before, and concerns were raised that the wealth of the institute might skew the biology department in directions faculty did not wish to take, and that Baltimore himself would gain undue influence over hiring within the department. The controversy was made worse by an article published by the Boston Globe framing the institute as corporate takeover of MIT. After a year of intensive discussions and planning, faculty finally voted in favor of the institute. Whitehead, Baltimore, and the rest of the planning team devised a unique structure of an independent research institute composed of &quot;members&quot; with a close relationship with the department of biology of MIT. This structure continues to this day to attract an elite interactive group of faculty to the Department of Biology at MIT and has served as a model for other distinguished institutes such as the Broad Institute.

The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (WIBR) was launched with $35 million to construct and equip a new building located across the street from the MIT cancer center at 9 Cambridge Center in Cambridge Massachusetts. The institute also received $5 million per year in guaranteed income and a substantial endowment in his will (for a total gift of $135 million). Under Baltimore&#x27;s leadership, a distinguished group of founding members including Gerald Fink, Rudolf Jaenisch, Harvey Lodish, and Robert Weinberg was assembled and eventually grew to 20 members in disciplines ranging from immunology, genetics, and oncology to fundamental developmental studies in mice and fruit flies. Whitehead Institute&#x27;s contributions to bioscience have long been consistently outstanding. Less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by Baltimore, the Whitehead Institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics, and over a recent 10-year period, papers published by Whitehead scientists, including many from Baltimore&#x27;s own lab, were the most cited papers of any biological research institute. The Whitehead Institute was an important partner in the Human Genome Project.

Baltimore served as director of the WIBR and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics. During this time, Baltimore&#x27;s own research program thrived in the new Institute. Important breakthroughs from Baltimore&#x27;s lab include the discovery of the key transcription factor NF-κB by Dr. Ranjan Sen and David Baltimore in 1986. This was part of a broader investigation to identify nuclear factors required for lg gene expression in B lymphocytes. However, NF-κB turned out to have much broader importance in both innate and adaptive immunity and viral regulation. NF-κB is involved in regulating cellular responses and belongs to the category of &quot;rapid-acting&quot; primary transcription factors. Their discovery led to an &quot;information explosion&quot; involving &quot;one of the most intensely studied signaling paradigms of the last two decades.&quot;

As early as 1984, Rudolf Grosschedl and David Weaver, postdoctoral fellows, in Baltimore&#x27;s laboratory, were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease. They suggested that &quot;control of lg gene rearrangement might be the only mechanism that determines the specificity of heavy chain gene expression within the lymphoid cell lineage.&quot; in 1987, they created transgenic mice with the fused gene that developed fatal leukemia.

David G. Schatz and Marjorie Oettinger, as students in Baltimore&#x27;s research group in 1988 and 1989, identified the protein pair that rearranges immunoglobulin genes, the recombination-activating gene RAG-1 and RAG-2. this was a key discovery in determining how the immune system can have specificity for a given molecule out of many possibilities, and was considered by Baltimore as of 2005 to be &quot;our most significant discovery in immunology&quot;.

In 1990, as a student in David Baltimore&#x27;s laboratory at MIT, George Q. Daley demonstrated that a fusion protein called bcr-abl is sufficient to stimulate cell growth and cause chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This work helped to identify a class of proteins that become hyperactive in specific types of cancer cells. It helped to lay the groundwork for a new type of drug, attacking cancer at the genetic level: Brian Druker&#x27;s development of the anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec), which deactivates bcr-abl proteins. Gleevec has shown impressive results in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and also promise in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

===Rockefeller University===
Baltimore served as the director of the Whitehead Institute until July 1, 1990, when he was appointed the sixth president of Rockefeller University in New York City. He moved his research group to New York in stages and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation. He also began important reforms in fiscal and faculty management and promoted the status of junior faculty at the university. After resigning on December 3, 1991 (see Imanishi-Kari case), Baltimore remained on the Rockefeller University faculty and continued research until the spring of 1994. He was invited to return to MIT and rejoined the faculty as the Ivan R. Cottrell Professor of Molecular Biology and Immunology.

===California Institute of Technology===

On May 13, 1997, Baltimore was appointed president of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He began serving in the office October 15, 1997 and was inaugurated March 9, 1998.

During Baltimore&#x27;s tenure at Caltech, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Baltimore the National Medal of Science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world. In 2004, Rockefeller University gave Baltimore its highest honor, Doctor of Science (&quot;honoris causa&quot;).

In 2003, as a postdoctoral fellow in David Baltimore&#x27;s lab at Caltech, Matthew Porteus was the first to demonstrate precise gene editing in human cells using chimeric nucleases.

In October 2005, Baltimore resigned the office of the president of Caltech, saying, &quot;This is not a decision that I have made easily, but I am convinced that the interests of the Institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history...&quot;. Former Georgia Tech Provost Jean-Lou Chameau succeeded Baltimore as president of Caltech. Baltimore was appointed President Emeritus and the Robert Andrews Milikan Professor of Biology at Caltech and remains an active member of the institute&#x27;s community. On January 21, 2021, Caltech president Thomas F. Rosenbaum announced the removal of the name of Caltech&#x27;s founding president and first Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan, from campus buildings, assets, and honors due to Millikan&#x27;s substantial participation in the eugenics movement. Baltimore&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Distinguished Professor of Biology.&quot;

=== Caltech Laboratory (1997–2019) ===
Baltimore&#x27;s laboratory at Caltech focused on two major research areas: understanding the development and functioning of the mammalian immune system and translational studies creating viral vectors to make the immune system more effective in resisting cancer. Their basic studies went in two directions: understanding the diverse activity of the NF-κB transcription factor, and understanding the normal and pathologic functions of microRNA.

==== Translational Science Initiatives ====
A primary focus of Baltimore&#x27;s lab was use of gene therapy methods to treat HIV and cancer. In the early 2000s one of Baltimore&#x27;s graduate students, Lili Yang, developed a lentivirus vector that allowed for the cloning of genes for two chains of TCR. Recognizing its potentially profound implications for enhancing immunity, Baltimore developed a translational research initiative within his laboratory called &quot;Engineering Immunity.&quot; The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded the program with a Grand Challenge Grant, and he used the funding to divide the initiative into four research programs and hire additional lab staff to lead each one. Two of the research programs sparked gene therapy start-up companies, Calimmune and Immune Design Corp, founded in 2006 and 2008 respectively. A third program focused on the development of an HIV vaccine, and eventually lead to clinical trials at NIH. In 2009 Baltimore became director of the Joint Center for Translational Medicine, a shared initiative between Caltech and UCLA aimed at developing bench to bedside medicine.

==== MicroRNA Research ====
A focus of Baltimore&#x27;s lab from his arrival at Caltech to the lab&#x27;s closure in 2018 was understanding the role of microRNA in the immune system. MicroRNAs provide fine control over gene expression by regulating the amount of protein made by particular messenger RNAs.
In recent research led by Jimmy Zhao, Baltimore&#x27;s team has discovered a small RNA molecule called microRNA-146a (miR-146a) and bred a strain of mice that lacks miR146a. They have used the miR146a(-) mice as a model to study the effects of chronic inflammation on the activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Their results suggest that microRNA-146a protects HSCs during chronic inflammation, and that its lack may contribute to blood cancers and bone marrow failure.

===== Splicing Control Research =====
Another concentration within Baltimore&#x27;s lab in recent years was control of inflammatory and immune responses, specifically splicing control of gene expression after inflammatory stimuli. In 2013 they discovered that ordered expression of genes following an inflammatory stimulus was controlled by splicing, not transcription as previously supposed. This led to further discoveries that delayed splicing was caused by introns, with the revelation that RNA-binding protein BUD13 acts at this intron to increase the amount of successful splicing (2 articles by Luke Frankiw published in 2019 and 2020).

In an autobiographical piece published in Annual Review Immunology in 2019, Baltimore announced that half of his lab space at Caltech would be taken over by a new assistant professor in Fall 2018, and his current lab group would be the last. &quot;I have been involved in research for 60 years, and I think it is time to leave the field to younger people.&quot;

===Public policy===
In the span of his career, Baltimore has profoundly impacted national science policy debates, including the AIDS epidemic and recombinant DNA research. His efforts to organize the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA were key to creating consensus within scientific and policy spheres.

In recent years Baltimore has joined with other scientists to call for a worldwide moratorium on use of a new genome-editing technique to alter inheritable human DNA. A key step enabling researchers to slice up any DNA sequence they choose was developed by Emmanuelle Charpentier, then at Umea University in Sweden, and Jennifer A. Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley. Reminiscent of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA in 1975, those involved want both scientists and the public to be more aware of the ethical issues and risks involved with new techniques for genome modification.

An early spokesperson for federal funding for AIDS research, Baltimore co-chaired the 1986 National Academy of Sciences committee on a National Strategy for AIDS. In 1986, he and Sheldon M. Wolff were invited by the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine to coauthor an independent report: &quot;Confronting AIDS&quot; (1986), in which they called for a $1 billion research program for HIV/AIDS. As of 1996 he was appointed head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Vaccine Research Committee (AVRC).

=== Biotechnology ===
Baltimore holds nearly 100 different biotechnology patents in the US and Europe, and has been preeminent in American biotechnology since the 1970s. In addition to Calimmune and Immune Design, he also helped found s2A Molecular, Inc. He has consulted at various companies including Collaborative Research, Bristol Myers Squibb, and most recently Virtualitics. He serves on the board of directors at several companies and non-profit institutions including Regulus Therapeutics and Appia Bio. He has also been a member of numerous Scientific Advisory Boards, and currently serves with PACT Pharma, Volastra Therapeutics, Vir Biotechnology, and the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Westlake University. He is the principal scientific advisor for the Science Philanthropy Alliance.

=== Awards and legacy ===
Baltimore&#x27;s honors include the 1970 Gustave Stern Award in Virology, 1971 Eli Lilly and Co. Award in Microbiology or Immunology, 1999 National Medal of Science, and 2000 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences USA (NAS) in1974; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1974; the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM), 1974; the American Association of Immunologists, 1984; the American Philosophical Society, 1997. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987; the French Academy of Sciences, 2000; and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). He is also a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 1978. In 2008, Baltimore was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

He has published over 700 peer-reviewed articles.

Baltimore is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board and an Xconomist (an editorial advisor for the tech news and media company, Xconomy). Baltimore also serves on The Jackson Laboratory&#x27;s board of trustees, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&#x27; Board of Sponsors, Amgen, Inc.&#x27;s board of directors, and numerous other organizations and their boards.

In 2019 Caltech named a graduate fellowship program in biochemistry and molecular biophysics in honor of Baltimore. The program combined a $7.5 million gift from the Amgen Foundation with an existing one-year Amgen fellowship and $3.75 million given by Caltech&#x27;s Gordon and Betty Moore Graduate Fellowship Match.

==Controversies==
=== Imanishi-Kari case ===
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a scientist who was not in Baltimore&#x27;s laboratory but in a separate, independent laboratory at MIT, was implicated in a case of scientific fraud. The case received extensive news coverage and a Congressional investigation. The case was linked to Baltimore&#x27;s name because of his scientific collaboration with and later his strong defense of Imanishi-Kari against accusations of fraud.

In 1986, while a professor of biology at MIT and director at Whitehead, Baltimore co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with Thereza Imanishi-Kari (an assistant professor of biology who had her own laboratory at MIT) as well as four others. A postdoctoral fellow in Imanishi-Kari&#x27;s laboratory, Margot O&#x27;Toole, who was not an author, reported concerns about the paper, ultimately accusing Imanishi-Kari of fabricating data in a cover-up. Baltimore, however, refused to retract the paper.

O&#x27;Toole soon dropped her challenge, but the NIH, which had funded the contested paper&#x27;s research, began investigating, at the insistence of Walter W. Stewart, a self-appointed fraud buster, and Ned Feder, his lab head at the NIH. Representative John Dingell (D-MI) also aggressively pursued it, eventually calling in U.S. Secret Service (USSS; U.S. Treasury) document examiners.

Around October 1989, when Baltimore was appointed president of Rockefeller University, around a third of the faculty opposed his appointment because of concerns about his behaviour in the Imanishi-Kari case. He visited every laboratory, one by one, to hear those concerns directly from each group of researchers.

In a draft report dated March 14, 1991, based mainly on USSS forensics findings, NIH&#x27;s fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity (OSI), accused Imanishi-Kari of falsifying and fabricating data. It also criticized Baltimore for failing to embrace O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s challenge. Less than a week later, the report was leaked to the press. Baltimore and three co-authors then retracted the paper; however, Imanishi-Kari and Moema H. Reis did not sign the retraction. In the report, Baltimore stated that he may have been &quot;too willing to accept&quot; Imanishi-Kari&#x27;s explanations and felt he &quot;did too little to seek an independent verification of her data and conclusions.&quot; Baltimore publicly apologized for not taking a whistle-blower&#x27;s charge more seriously.

Amid concerns raised by negative publicity in connection with the scandal, Baltimore resigned as president of Rockefeller University and rejoined the MIT Biology faculty.

In July 1992, the US Attorney for the District of Maryland, who had been investigating the case, announced he would not bring criminal or civil charges against Imanishi-Kari. In October 1994, however, OSI&#x27;s successor, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI; HHS) found Imanishi-Kari guilty on 19 counts of research misconduct, basing its conclusions largely on Secret Service analysis of laboratory notebooks, documents that these investigators had little experience or expert guidance in interpreting.

An HHS appeals panel began meeting in June 1995 to review all charges in detail. In June 1996, the panel ruled that the ORI had failed to prove any of its 19 charges. After throwing out much of the documentary evidence gathered by the ORI, the panel dismissed all charges against Imanishi-Kari. As their final report stated, the HHS panel &quot;found that much of what ORI presented was irrelevant, had limited probative value, was internally inconsistent, lacked reliability or foundation, was not credible or not corroborated, or was based on unwarranted assumptions.&quot; It did conclude that &quot;The Cell paper as a whole is rife with errors of all sorts ... [including] some which, despite all these years and layers of review, have never previously been pointed out or corrected. Responsibility ... must be shared by all participants.&quot; Neither OSI nor ORI ever accused Baltimore of research misconduct. The reputations of Stewart and Feder, who had pushed for the investigation, were badly damaged. The pair were reassigned to other positions at NIH because they failed to maintain productivity in their roles as scientists and questions were raised about the legitimacy of their self-appointed inquiries into scientific integrity.

The Imanishi-Kari controversy was one among several prominent scientific integrity cases of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. In nearly all cases, defendants were ultimately cleared. The case profoundly impacted the process for handling of scientific misconduct in the United States. Baltimore has been both defended and criticized for his actions in this matter. In 1993, Yale University mathematician Serge Lang strongly criticized Baltimore&#x27;s behavior. Historian of science Daniel Kevles, writing after the exoneration of Imanishi-Kari, recounted the affair in his 1998 book, &quot;The Baltimore Case&quot;. Horace Freeland Judson also gives a critical assessment of Baltimore&#x27;s actions in &quot;The Great Betrayal: Fraud In Science&quot;. Baltimore has also written his own analysis.

=== Luk van Parijs case ===
In 2005, at Baltimore&#x27;s request, Caltech began investigating the work that Luk van Parijs had conducted while a postdoc in Baltimore&#x27;s laboratory. Van Parijs first came under suspicion at MIT, for work done after he had left Baltimore&#x27;s lab. After van Parijs had been fired by MIT, his doctoral supervisor also noted problems with work van Parijs did at the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, before leaving Harvard to go to Baltimore&#x27;s lab. The Caltech investigation concluded in March 2007. It found van Parijs alone committed research misconduct, and that four papers co-authored by Baltimore, van Parijs, and others required correction.

=== COVID-19 and lab-leak theory ===
In May 2021, Baltimore was quoted in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; in an article about the origins of the COVID-19 virus, saying, &quot;When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus. These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2.&quot; This quote was widely shared and gave credence to the possibility of a Wuhan lab leak that has been discussed extensively as part of investigations into the origin of COVID-19.

A month later, Baltimore told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that he &quot;should have softened the phrase &#x27;smoking gun&#x27; because I don&#x27;t believe that it proves the origin of the furin cleavage site but it does sound that way. I believe that the question of whether the sequence was put in naturally or by molecular manipulation is very hard to determine but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out either origin.&quot;

<text>Sir Cyril Lodowic Burt, FBA (3 March 1883 – 10 October 1971) was an English educational psychologist and geneticist who also made contributions to statistics. He is known for his studies on the heritability of IQ.

Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance of intelligence were discredited after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data, inventing correlations in separated twins which did not exist, alongside other fabrications.

==Childhood and education==
Burt was born on 3 March 1883, the first child of Cyril Cecil Barrow Burt (b. 1857), a medical practitioner, and his wife, Martha Decina Evans. He was born in London (some sources give his place of birth as Stratford-upon-Avon, probably because his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; gave his father&#x27;s address as Snitterfield, Stratford; in fact the Burt family moved to Snitterfield when he was ten).

Burt&#x27;s father initially kept a chemist shop to support his family while he studied medicine. On qualifying, he became the assistant house surgeon and obstetrical assistant at Westminster Hospital, London. The younger Cyril Burt&#x27;s education began in London at a Board school near St James&#x27;s Park.

In 1890, the family briefly moved to Jersey then to Snitterfield, Warwickshire, in 1893, where Burt&#x27;s father opened a rural practice. Early in Burt&#x27;s life he showed a precocious nature, so much so that his father often took the young Burt with him on his medical rounds.

One of the elder Burt&#x27;s more famous patients was Darwin Galton, brother of Francis Galton. The visits the Burts made to the Galton estate not only allowed the young Burt to learn about the work of Francis Galton, but also allowed Burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences, two defining characters of the London School of Psychology whose membership includes both Galton and Burt.

He attended King&#x27;s (now known as Warwick) School, in the county town, from 1892 to 1895, and later won a scholarship to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, then located in London, where he developed his interest in psychology.

From 1902, he attended Jesus College, Oxford, where he studied Classics and took an interest in philosophy and psychology, the latter under William McDougall. McDougall, knowing Burt&#x27;s interest in Galton&#x27;s work, taught him the elements of psychometrics, thus helping Burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests, an interest that would last the rest of his life. Burt was one of a group of students who worked with McDougall, which included William Brown, John Flügel, and May Smith, who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology.

Burt graduated with second-class honours in Literae Humaniores (Classics) in 1906, taking a special paper in psychology in his Final Examinations. He subsequently supplemented his BA with a teaching diploma.

In 1907, McDougall invited Burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the British people, proposed by Francis Galton, in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests. This work brought Burt into contact with eugenics, Charles Spearman, and Karl Pearson.

In the summer of 1908, Burt visited the University of Würzburg, Germany, where he first met the psychologist Oswald Külpe.

==Work in educational psychology==
In 1908, Burt took up the post of Lecturer in Psychology and Assistant Lecturer in Physiology at Liverpool University, where he was to work under the famed physiologist Sir Charles Sherrington. In 1909 Burt made use of Charles Spearman&#x27;s model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests. This first research project was to define Burt&#x27;s life&#x27;s work in quantitative intelligence testing, eugenics, and the inheritance of intelligence. One of the conclusions in his 1909 paper was that upper-class children in private preparatory schools did better in the tests than those in the ordinary elementary schools, and that the difference was innate.

In 1913, Burt took the part-time position of a school psychologist for the London County Council (LCC), with the responsibility of picking out the &quot;feeble-minded&quot; children, in accordance with the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913. He notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence. The post also allowed him to work in Spearman&#x27;s laboratory, and receive research assistants from the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, including Winifred Raphael.

Burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in Great Britain and his 1925 publication &quot;The Young Delinquent&quot; led to opening of the London Child Guidance Clinic in Islington in 1927. In 1924 Burt was also appointed part-time professor of educational psychology at the London Day Training College (LDTC), and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises.

==Later career==
In 1931 Burt resigned his position at the LCC and the LDTC after he was appointed professor and Chair of Psychology at University College London, taking over the position from Charles Spearman, thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner. One of his students, Reuben Conrad, recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from London Zoo, though Conrad could not recall what point Burt was trying to make. While at London, Burt influenced many students, including Raymond Cattell and Hans Eysenck, and toward the end of his life, Arthur Jensen and Chris Brand. Burt was a consultant with the committees that developed the 11-plus examinations. This issue, and the allegations of fraudulent scholarship against him, are discussed in various books and articles listed below, including &quot;Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed&quot; and &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;.

Despite his lasting reputation as a statistical psychologist Cyril Burt was also involved in psychoanalysis. He was a member of the Tavistock Clinic Council in the early 1930s and of the British Psychoanalytical Society. In &quot;The Young Delinquent&quot;, he expressed the view that &quot;nearly every tragedy of crime is in its origin a drama of domestic life.&quot;

In 1942 Burt was elected president of the British Psychological Society. In 1946 he became the first British psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available, according to an account by J. Philippe Rushton. Burt was a member of the London School of Differential Psychology, and of the British Eugenics Society. Because he had suggested on radio in 1946 the formation of an organization for people with high IQ scores, he was made honorary president of Mensa in 1960. He officially joined Mensa soon thereafter.

Burt retired in 1951 at the age of 68, but continued writing articles and books. He died of cancer at age 88 in London on 10 October 1971.

==Scientific misconduct==
Burt published numerous articles and books on a host of topics ranging from psychometrics through philosophy of science to parapsychology. It is his research in behaviour genetics, most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence (as measured in IQ tests) using twin studies, that has created the most controversy, frequently referred to as &quot;the Burt Affair.&quot;

Shortly after Burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt, and he was accused of falsifying research data. From the late 1970s, it has been generally accepted that &quot;he had fabricated some of the data, though some of his earlier work remained unaffected by this revelation.&quot; This was due in large part to research by Oliver Gillie (1976) and Leon Kamin (1974).

The 2007 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted it is widely acknowledged that his later work was flawed and many academics agree that data were falsified, though his earlier work is generally accepted as valid.

The possibility of fabrication was first brought to the attention of the scientific community when Kamin noticed that Burt&#x27;s correlation coefficients of monozygotic and dizygotic twins&#x27; IQ scores were the same to three decimal places, across articles – even when new data were twice added to the sample of twins. Leslie Hearnshaw, a close friend of Burt and his official biographer, concluded after examining the criticisms that most of Burt&#x27;s data from after World War II were unreliable or fraudulent. William H. Tucker argued in a 1997 article that: &quot;A comparison of his twin sample with that from other well documented studies, however, leaves little doubt that he committed fraud.&quot;

Two other psychologists Arthur Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton, themselves involved in controversy for their views on race, have claimed that the contentious correlations reported by Burt are in line with the correlations found in other twin studies.

Rushton (1997) wrote that five different studies on twins reared apart by independent researchers corroborated Cyril Burt&#x27;s findings and had given almost the same heritability estimate (average estimate 0.75 vs. 0.77 by Burt). Jensen argued that &quot;[n]o one with any statistical sophistication, and Burt had plenty, would report exactly the same correlation, 0.77, three times in succession if he were trying to fake the data.&quot; Burt&#x27;s statistical sophistication was, however, called into question by his student Charlotte Banks, who in a foreword to Burt&#x27;s last book, published posthumously, wrote that he combined samples gathered from schoolchildren in different earlier years in his later papers without comment. A paper Burt published in 1943, Burt states an average IQ of 153.2 for the parents in the higher professional or administrative classes, at a time when there were no standardised IQ tests for adults in the upper ranges of IQ. In 1961, Burt revised this figure to 139.7 and, in other papers, noted that he had arrived at such figures by &quot;assessment&quot;, or guesswork, rather than testing.

According to Earl B. Hunt, it may never be found out whether Burt was intentionally fraudulent or merely careless. Noting that other studies on the heritability of IQ have produced results very similar to those of Burt&#x27;s, Hunt argues that Burt did not harm science in the narrow sense of misleading scientists with false results, but that in the broader sense science in general and behaviour genetics in particular were profoundly harmed by the Burt Affair, leading to a general rejection of genetic studies of intelligence and a drying up of funding for such studies.

Gillie&#x27;s 1976 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, reprinted in The Phi Delta Kappan in 1977, summarised attempts to trace two of Burt&#x27;s supposed collaborators, Margaret Howard and J. Conway. Publications attributed to these two were published in a journal edited by Burt between 1952 and 1959, including a joint paper of Burt and Howard, remarkable as one of the few, if not the only, research paper not authored solely by Burt. The papers in the names of Howard or Conway were published after Burt&#x27;s retirement from University College although their affiliations were said to be with University College, Howard&#x27;s specifically with its Psychology Department. No-one with these names was registered as a member of staff or student at University College between 1914 and 1976, or in any other institution within the University of London, and its Psychology Department could not trace either of them. Between 1952 and 1959, Burt lived in London and had two associates, Charlotte Banks and Gertrude Keir, neither of who ever met Howard or Conway. Although they suggested to Gillie that Burt may have corresponded with the two, there was no trace of any such correspondence in Burt&#x27;s papers. Burt&#x27;s housekeeper from 1950 recalled to Gillie that she had questioned Burt on why he had written papers in the names of Howard and Conway; his response was that they had done the research and should be credited. He explained their absence and lack of contact by adding that both had emigrated and he had lost their addresses. Based on his investigation, Gillie considered it likely that neither Howard nor Conway existed, but were a fantasy of the ageing Burt himself.

Arthur Jensen was given the opportunity to respond to Gillie&#x27;s article in the same issue of the same journal, and described the claims as libellous, without evidence and driven by opposition to Burt&#x27;s theories. However, he does not address the central issue, that Burt wrote scientific papers and published them as editor of a journal under false names and without the consent of the supposed authors.

In response to articles by Fletcher, claiming that his biography of Burt and attacks by others were motivated by ideological or political malice, Hernshaw added to Gillie&#x27;s claims by stating that Burt&#x27;s detailed records of visitors contained no records of visits by Howard or Conway in the years they were supposed to have collaborated with him on collecting and testing 32 pairs of separated monozygotic twins, that his papers contained no correspondence with or written material from them, and that no one close to Burt had met them. He added that testing separated twins was expensive: Burt had no research funds to pay research workers and his own finances were too stretched to pay for it himself. Further, he instanced two other example of what he terms Burt&#x27;s deviousness ignored by Fletcher. The first was Burt&#x27;s falsification of the early history of factorial analysis and his untruthful claim to have been the first to use that technique. The second was that Burt could not have obtained the results on the declining levels of scholastic attainments in the 1950s and 1960s that he claimed to have. Finally, Hernshaw claimed that Burt&#x27;s failings in his years of retirement went far beyond carelessness.

In his 1991 book, Fletcher questioned Gillie&#x27;s claim of the lack of independent articles published by Howard or Conway in scientific journals other than the &quot;Journal of Statistical Psychology&quot; edited by Burt, claiming Howard was also said to be mentioned in the membership list of the British Psychological Society, John Cohen was said to have remembered her well during the 1930s, and Donald MacRae had personally received an article from her in 1949 and 1950. According to Ronald Fletcher, there is documentary evidence of the existence of Conway . Other writers have suggested that Howard and Conway may have existed, but that Burt had simply used their names to support his research, as he had been shown to have done with another named so-called researcher.

Robert Joynson (in 1989) and Ronald Fletcher (in 1991) published books in support of Burt. However Joynson accepted that Burt frequently used assumed names to publish (in the journal Burt edited, the Journal of Statistical Psychology) papers that Burt had written himself: the names he used included those of Howard and Conway. Burt&#x27;s defenders have claimed that everyone knew that, after his retirement, Burt&#x27;s data was flawed and that he published articles under pseudonyms, adding that the British Psychological Society could have stopped this if it had violated accepted ethical norms of the time. However, although it is clear that some individual members of the British Psychological Society were aware of Burt&#x27;s questionable conduct, the reason why he was not censured were as likely to be that it would have been in bad taste to call such a great man to public account, a fault of a profession and its members that could tolerate at the time, and apologise later, for Burt&#x27;s behaviour.

Nicholas Mackintosh edited &quot;Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed?&quot;, which was presented by the publisher as arguing that &quot;his defenders have sometimes, but by no means always, been correct, and that his critics have often jumped to hasty conclusions. In their haste, however, these critics have missed crucial evidence that is not easily reconciled with Burt&#x27;s total innocence, leaving the perception that both the defence and prosecution cases are seriously flawed.&quot; W. D. Hamilton claimed in a 2000 book review shortly before Hamilton&#x27;s death that the claims made by his detractors in the so-called &quot;Burt Affair&quot; had been either wrong or grossly exaggerated.

However, Mackintosh himself, then emeritus professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge, summed up the evidence against Burt in 1995, saying that the data Burt presented were &quot;so woefully inadequate and riddled with error&quot;, that consequently &quot;no reliance (could) be placed on the numbers he present(ed)&quot;, and went on to confirm his agreement with Kamin&#x27;s original conclusion, that Burt had fabricated his data.

<doc id="173910" wikidata="Q7047480" url="?curid=173910" title="Noggin the Nog">
<text>Noggin the Nog is a fictional character appearing in a BBC Television animated series (of the same name, originally broadcast 1959–1965 and 1982) and a series of illustrated books (published 1965–1977), created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. The television series is considered a cult classic from the golden age of British children&#x27;s television. Noggin himself is the simple, kind and unassuming &quot;King of the Northmen&quot; in a roughly Viking Age setting, with various fantastic elements such as dragons, flying machines and talking birds.

Peter Firmin is said to have come up with the name of Noggin after travelling on the London Underground and seeing Neasden tube station, which made him think &quot;Noggin&quot;.

Some of the original artwork for the series is on display at the Rupert Bear Museum in Canterbury. The appearance of the characters was influenced by that of the Lewis chessmen in the British Museum.

==Plot and characters==
The stories were based around the central character of Noggin, the rather simple but good-natured son of Knut, King of the Nogs, and his queen Grunhilda. When King Knut dies, Noggin must find a queen to rule beside him or else forfeit the crown to his uncle, Nogbad the Bad. Noggin meets and marries Nooka of the Nooks (an Inuit princess), and becomes the new king. Noggin and Nooka have a son, Knut, who comes to the fore in later storylines. Other regular characters include:

* Thor Nogson - Noggin&#x27;s closest friend and Captain of the Royal Guard. As the &quot;Hero of a Thousand Battles&quot; Thor Nogson portrays himself as &quot;fierce&quot;, but is actually anything but fierce, and is a little lazy. But he is unfailingly loyal, and never hesitates to defend the honour of his king.
* Olaf the Lofty - an eccentric and occasionally arrogant, but well-meaning, inventor. Olaf&#x27;s inventions rarely work out exactly as he intends them to, although his most notable success is the Flying Machine.
* Graculus - a big green bird who arrives as Nooka&#x27;s messenger in the first episode. Later by chance they return to the place of his birth and meet his family, who unlike him are incapable of human speech.
* Grolliffe - a friendly ice dragon whom Noggin befriends, and who helps Noggin and his friends in a later episode.

Although the individual stories vary, any trouble encountered by the heroes is usually caused by Nogbad the Bad, who never gives up trying to claim Noggin&#x27;s throne for himself. Nogbad always loses in the end, though not always through the intervention of Noggin himself.

==Television series==
The original television series was first broadcast, beginning on 11 September 1959, by the BBC in the United Kingdom, and continued until 1965. Production company Smallfilms made 21 programmes in black and white, and six in colour, each with a running time of 10 minutes.

When the programme made a comeback in 1982 it ran for just six episodes and was made in colour. The new series comprised one new two-part story and a colour remake of the second saga, originally a six-parter, &quot;Noggin and the Ice Dragon&quot;. The level of stop-motion animation was basic, but did not detract from the popularity of the series.

The on-screen title is &quot;The Saga of Noggin the Nog&quot;, since the stories were based on the principle of a Norse saga, and episodes began with the words, &quot;Listen to me and I will tell you the story of Noggin the Nog, as it was told in the days of old&quot;, or &quot;In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long, the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale ... and those tales they tell are the stories of a kind and wise king and his people; they are the Sagas of Noggin the Nog. Welcome to Northlands, a tribute to Noggin, King of the Nogs and the People of the Northlands&quot;. These opening lines were accompanied by Vernon Elliott&#x27;s bassoon score.

Visually, the series was primarily inspired by the Lewis chessmen (of Norse origin); one of the stories is about Noggin playing chess with Nogbad the Bad.

A new series was rumoured in the late 1990s, but nothing came of it.

The complete series was released on DVD in 2005, in a package that also included DVD versions of the short story books.

==Books==
Various Noggin short stories were also published, and a visitor in one of them, &quot;Noggin and the Moon Mouse&quot;, provided the basis for the characters in the popular &quot;Clangers&quot; TV series. All the books were written by Oliver Postgate, illustrated in full colour by Peter Firmin, and published by Kaye &amp; Ward.

# &quot;Nogbad and The Elephants&quot; (1967)
# &quot;Noggin and The Money&quot; (1973)
# &quot;Noggin and The Storks&quot; (1973)

There was also a standard book series published in the 1960s and 1970s consisting of 12 illustrated hardback books:

# &quot;King of the Nogs&quot; (1968)
# &quot;The Ice Dragon&quot; (1968)

# &quot;The Monster&quot; (1972)
# &quot;The Black-Wash&quot; (1975)
# &quot;The Icebergs&quot; (1975)

A large book about Nog&#x27;s life, illustrated in black and white, was also published:

* &quot;Nogmania&quot; (1977) (reprinted by The Dragon&#x27;s Friendly Society in 2000)

Two omnibus books were published to tie in with the colour TV series:

# &quot;Three Tales of Noggin Volume 1&quot; (1981) (&quot;Noggin the King&quot; / &quot;Noggin and The Whale&quot; / &quot;Noggin and the Moon Mouse&quot;)
# &quot;Three Tales of Noggin Volume 2&quot; (1981) (&quot;Noggin and the Dragon&quot; / &quot;Nogbad and the Elephant&quot; / &quot;Noggin and the Storks&quot;)

In 1992, a fully illustrated 96-page colour book, &quot;The Sagas of Noggin the Nog&quot;, was published by HarperCollins. This volume contains four tales: &quot;King of the Nogs&quot;, &quot;The Ice Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Flying Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Omruds&quot;.

== Theatre ==
In 1971, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre produced a stage version: &quot;Noggin the Nog. - The Rings of Nudrug&quot;, with an Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin script. The show was designed by Firmin and included six Postgate songs, with music by Norman Dannatt. Directed by Michael Simpson, it premiered on 23 December and ran for 27 performances until 15 January 1972. Noggin was played by Piers Rogers, with Jane Sandbrook as Nooka, Paul Chapman as Nogbad and Stuart Knee as Prince Knut. A programme produced to accompany the production included this explanatory note:

&quot;The tale of &quot;The Rings of Nudrug&quot; is a hitherto unknown story. It tells how Noggin’s son, Prince Knut celebrates his birthday by taking a long and mainly unintentional journey. It tells how the Rings of the Black Sorcerer of Nudrug were brought together again, how the King of the trolls is transformed and how at last the evil power of the rings is broken&quot;.

A message to &quot;learned Nogophilists&quot; in the programme pointed out that there were certain discrepancies between the tale presented on stage and that seen on TV, but explained that this was a function of the frequent reinvention of mythical tales. Graculus was absent, and credit for the flying machine was here given to Olaf the Lofty. In fact, this machine was previously stated to have been invented before the birth of Prince Knut, who was seen as a youth in the stage version. 

==VHS and DVD releases==
Between 4 June 1990 and 5 August 1991, two &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot; videos were released by the BBC.

* &quot;The Saga of Noggin the Nog: Tales of the Northlands&quot; (BBCV 4359). Released: 4 June 1990. Two series:
** &quot;Noggin and the Ice Dragon&quot; (colour)
** &quot;Noggin and The Flying Machine&quot; (black and white)
* &quot;The Saga of Noggin the Nog: The Omruds/The Firecake&quot;&#x27; (BBCV 4651). Released: 5 August 1991. Two series:
** &quot;Noggin and the Omruds&quot; (black and white)
** &quot;Noggin and the Firecake&quot; (black and white)

==Recognition==

Noggin has received an accolade achieved by very few Norse characters – he appeared with the Ice Dragon reading him a note from Nogbad, on a British commemorative postage stamp (SG1804) in January 1994. The art work for the stamp was drawn by Peter Firmin, who also produced a series of illustrations for the advertising campaign to publicise the new stamps. The stamp was one of a set of ten on the theme of &quot;messages&quot;, featuring characters from British children&#x27;s literature. All the characters were pictured holding a letter, note or message. Noggin&#x27;s note reads: &quot;I, Nogbad &#x27;the Bad&#x27; do hereby promise to be &#x27;the Good&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Talisman City is an expansion to the &quot;Talisman&quot; board game. It was published in 1989 by Games Workshop.

==Description==
&quot;Talisman City&quot; provides 72 new Encounter cards, 7 new Adventure cards, 3 new Dungeon cards, 20 new Purchase cards, 10 new Spells, 6 new Characters, and an additional board that represents Talisman City.

The &quot;Talisman City&quot; expansion replaces the city space in the Outer Region on the original &quot;Talisman&quot; game board, where there are more places to visit and additional items to purchase.

===Special rules===
All characters visiting the city must always own at least one gold; an arrest warrant is issued for a penniless character, and if that character encounters the Patrol or Watch, the character is arrested and thrown into the Dungeon. Combat within the City also results in an arrest warrant.

==New characters==
Two of the new characters, the Minotaur and the Valkyrie, are regular characters. The four others (Sheriff, Archmage, King&#x27;s Champion and Master Thief) are &quot;titles&quot; or &quot;offices&quot; that a character can acquire. If the character accepts one of these titles, the player hands in the original character card and receives the new position with all its attributes and abilities. 

==Publication history==
In 1983, Robert Harris designed the fantasy board game &quot;Talisman&quot; and it was published by Games Workshop (GW) with black &amp; white cards. The game proved popular, and two years later, GW issued a second edition, which only differed in having full colour cards and new box cover art. In 1986, GW released an expansion set with new characters, spells and adventure cards. The expansion set also proved popular, and GW released more expansions: &quot;The Adventure&quot; (1986), &quot;Dungeon&quot; (1987), &quot;City&quot; (1989), and &quot;Dragons&quot; (1993). 

&quot;City&quot; was designed by Evan Friedman and Paul Morrow. 

==Reception==
In the September–October 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 9), Richard Ashley commented, &quot;&quot;If you enjoy &quot;Talisman&quot; this is well worth adding as it is fun, although I found the rich [characters] had an easier time.&quot; Ashley concluded by giving it an average rating of 3 out of 5.

In the January 1990 issue of &quot;Shadis&quot;, B.O. Felton thought that this expansion, the fifth for &quot;Talisman&quot;, &quot;raises the question of how far Games Workshop can take the Talisman system and retain the playability of the original game.&quot; Felton felt this game added too much time, noting, &quot;In our sessions, the &quot;City&quot; expansion seemed to double the normal playing time of an already time-devouring game. The game dragged on and on. Players became disinterested after a few hours and we were relieved when someone finally managed to claim victory.&quot; Despite this, Felton noted a positive aspect, commenting, &quot;Our group is renowned for its backstabbing sessions of &quot;Talisman&quot; and &quot;City&quot; has only fueled our nefarious gameplay. The presence of the Dungeon and the ability to frame other players has become our bread and butter and most of us have spent our share of time staring at the dungeon walls.&quot; Felton concluded that those that already enjoyed &quot;Talisman&quot; would be the beneficiaries of this game, saying, &quot;If you are an avid &quot;Talisman&quot; player you will no doubt enjoy this new offering. If, however, you only moderately liked the basic game, you will probably find that the expansion has only heightened the qualities of the game you didn&#x27;t like. Those drawbacks are mainly the time requirements needed to play and the length of time before your turn comes around.&quot; 

In the Italian edition of &quot;Videogame &amp; Computer World&quot;, Massimo De Lisio noted, &quot;The City is not exactly like the Dungeon or Timescape expansions, in the sense that it is not interspersed with the base game, but constantly supports it, increasing the potential for randomness and new events.&quot;

<doc id="173918" wikidata="Q381040" url="?curid=173918" title="Complex conjugate">
<text>In mathematics, the complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with an equal real part and an imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. That is, if formula_1 and formula_2 are real numbers, then the complex conjugate of formula_3 is formula_4 The complex conjugate of formula_5 is often denoted as formula_6 or formula_7.

In polar form, if formula_8 and formula_9 are real numbers then the conjugate of formula_10 is formula_11 This can be shown using Euler&#x27;s formula.

The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number: formula_12 (or formula_13 in polar coordinates).

If a root of a univariate polynomial with real coefficients is complex, then its complex conjugate is also a root.

== Notation ==

The complex conjugate of a complex number formula_5 is written as formula_15 or formula_16 The first notation, a vinculum, avoids confusion with the notation for the conjugate transpose of a matrix, which can be thought of as a generalization of the complex conjugate. The second is preferred in physics, where dagger (†) is used for the conjugate transpose, as well as electrical engineering and computer engineering, where bar notation can be confused for the logical negation (&quot;NOT&quot;) Boolean algebra symbol, while the bar notation is more common in pure mathematics.

If a complex number is represented as a formula_17 matrix, the notations are identical, and the complex conjugate corresponds to the matrix transpose, which is a flip along the diagonal.

== Properties ==

The following properties apply for all complex numbers formula_5 and formula_19 unless stated otherwise, and can be proved by writing formula_5 and formula_21 in the form formula_22

For any two complex numbers, conjugation is distributive over addition, subtraction, multiplication and division:
formula_23

A complex number is equal to its complex conjugate if its imaginary part is zero, that is, if the number is real. In other words, real numbers are the only fixed points of conjugation. 

Conjugation does not change the modulus of a complex number: formula_24

Conjugation is an involution, that is, the conjugate of the conjugate of a complex number formula_5 is formula_26 In symbols, formula_27

The product of a complex number with its conjugate is equal to the square of the number&#x27;s modulus: formula_28 This allows easy computation of the multiplicative inverse of a complex number given in rectangular coordinates: formula_29
* Imaginary part: formula_30
* Modulus (or absolute value): formula_31
* Argument: formula_32 so formula_33

Furthermore, formula_6 can be used to specify lines in the plane: the set
formula_35
is a line through the origin and perpendicular to formula_36 since the real part of formula_37 is zero only when the cosine of the angle between formula_5 and formula_39 is zero. Similarly, for a fixed complex unit formula_40 the equation
formula_41
determines the line through formula_42 parallel to the line through 0 and formula_43

These uses of the conjugate of formula_5 as a variable are illustrated in Frank Morley&#x27;s book &quot;Inversive Geometry&quot; (1933), written with his son Frank Vigor Morley.

==Generalizations==

The other planar real unital algebras, dual numbers, and split-complex numbers are also analyzed using complex conjugation.

For matrices of complex numbers, formula_45 where formula_46 represents the element-by-element conjugation of formula_47 Contrast this to the property formula_48 where formula_49 represents the conjugate transpose of formula_50

Taking the conjugate transpose (or adjoint) of complex matrices generalizes complex conjugation. Even more general is the concept of adjoint operator for operators on (possibly infinite-dimensional) complex Hilbert spaces. All this is subsumed by the *-operations of C*-algebras.

One may also define a conjugation for quaternions and split-quaternions: the conjugate of formula_51 is formula_52

All these generalizations are multiplicative only if the factors are reversed:
formula_53

Since the multiplication of planar real algebras is commutative, this reversal is not needed there.

There is also an abstract notion of conjugation for vector spaces formula_54 over the complex numbers. In this context, any antilinear map formula_55 that satisfies

# formula_56 where formula_57 and formula_58 is the identity map on formula_59
# formula_60 for all formula_61 and
# formula_62 for all formula_63

is called a , or a real structure. As the involution formula_9 is antilinear, it cannot be the identity map on formula_65

Of course, formula_66 is a formula_67-linear transformation of formula_68 if one notes that every complex space formula_69 has a real form obtained by taking the same vectors as in the original space and restricting the scalars to be real. The above properties actually define a real structure on the complex vector space formula_65 

One example of this notion is the conjugate transpose operation of complex matrices defined above. However, on generic complex vector spaces, there is no notion of complex conjugation.

<text>giFT Internet File Transfer (giFT) is a computer software daemon that allows several file sharing protocols to be used with a simple client having a graphical user interface (GUI). The client dynamically loads plugins implementing the protocols, as they are required.

== General ==

Clients implementing frontends for the giFT daemon communicate with its process using a lightweight network protocol. This allows the networking protocol code to be completely abstracted from the user interface. The giFT daemon is written using relatively cross-platform C code, which means that it can be compiled for and executed on a big variety of operating systems. There are several giFT GUI front-ends for Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, and Unix-like operating systems.

The name &quot;giFT&quot; (giFT Internet File Transfer) is a so-called recursive acronym, which means that it refers to itself in the expression for which it stands.

One of the biggest drawbacks of the giFT engine is that it currently lacks Unicode support, which prevents sharing files with Unicode characters in their file names (such as &quot;ø&quot;,&quot;ä&quot;, &quot;å&quot;, &quot;é&quot; etc.). Also, giFT lacks many features needed to use the gnutella network effectively.

==Available plugins==

== OpenFT protocol ==

giFT&#x27;s sibling project is OpenFT, a peer-to-peer file-sharing network protocol that has a structure in which nodes are divided into &#x27;search&#x27; nodes and &#x27;index&#x27; supernodes in addition to common nodes. Since both projects are related very closely, when one says &#x27;OpenFT&#x27;, one can mean either one of two different things: the OpenFT protocol, or the implementation in the form of a plugin for giFT.

Although the name &quot;OpenFT&quot; stands for &quot;Open FastTrack&quot;, the OpenFT protocol is an entirely new protocol design: only a few ideas in the OpenFT protocol are drawn from what little was known about the FastTrack protocol at the time OpenFT was designed.

=== OpenFT file-sharing protocol ===
Like FastTrack and Napster, OpenFT is a network where nodes submit lists of shared files to other nodes to keep track of which files are available on the network. This reduces the bandwidth consumed from search requests at the price of additional memory and processing power on the nodes that store that information. The transmission of shared lists is not fully recursive: a node will only transmit its list of shared files to a single search node randomly chosen as that node&#x27;s &quot;parent&quot;, and the list of those files will not be further transmitted to other nodes.

OpenFT is also similar to the gnutella network in that search requests are recursively forwarded in between the nodes that keep track of the shared files.

There are three different kinds of nodes on the OpenFT network:

; USER
: Most nodes are USER nodes; these have no special function.
; SEARCH
: These nodes handle search requests; they search the filelists their CHILD nodes (explained below) submit to them. These nodes must have a capable Internet connection and at least 128M RAM. A modern processor is highly recommended as well.
; INDEX
: Nodes with fast connections and much memory can be INDEX nodes, which keep lists of available search nodes, collect statistics, and try to maintain the structure of the network.

A node can be both a SEARCH and an INDEX node.
USER nodes will pick three SEARCH nodes to be their PARENT nodes. They will submit their shares list to them if the PARENT accepts the USER as its CHILD. By default, SEARCH nodes will be PARENTS for a maximum of 500 CHILD nodes.

<doc id="173926" wikidata="Q1074074" url="?curid=173926" title="Inductive bias">
<text>The inductive bias (also known as learning bias) of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs of given inputs that it has not encountered. Inductive bias is anything which makes the algorithm learn one pattern instead of another pattern (e.g., step-functions in decision trees instead of continuous functions in linear regression models). Learning involves searching a space of solutions for a solution that provides a good explanation of the data. However, in many cases, there may be multiple equally appropriate solutions. An inductive bias allows a learning algorithm to prioritize one solution (or interpretation) over another, independently of the observed data.

In machine learning, the aim is to construct algorithms that are able to learn to predict a certain target output. To achieve this, the learning algorithm is presented some training examples that demonstrate the intended relation of input and output values. Then the learner is supposed to approximate the correct output, even for examples that have not been shown during training. Without any additional assumptions, this problem cannot be solved since unseen situations might have an arbitrary output value. The kind of necessary assumptions about the nature of the target function are subsumed in the phrase &quot;inductive bias&quot;.

A classical example of an inductive bias is Occam&#x27;s razor, assuming that the simplest consistent hypothesis about the target function is actually the best. Here, &quot;consistent&quot; means that the hypothesis of the learner yields correct outputs for all of the examples that have been given to the algorithm.

Approaches to a more formal definition of inductive bias are based on mathematical logic. Here, the inductive bias is a logical formula that, together with the training data, logically entails the hypothesis generated by the learner. However, this strict formalism fails in many practical cases in which the inductive bias can only be given as a rough description (e.g., in the case of artificial neural networks), or not at all.

==Types==

The following is a list of common inductive biases in machine learning algorithms.

* Maximum conditional independence: if the hypothesis can be cast in a Bayesian framework, try to maximize conditional independence. This is the bias used in the Naive Bayes classifier.
* Minimum cross-validation error: when trying to choose among hypotheses, select the hypothesis with the lowest cross-validation error. Although cross-validation may seem to be free of bias, the &quot;no free lunch&quot; theorems show that cross-validation must be biased, for example assuming that there is no information encoded in the ordering of the data.
* Maximum margin: when drawing a boundary between two classes, attempt to maximize the width of the boundary. This is the bias used in support vector machines. The assumption is that distinct classes tend to be separated by wide boundaries.
* Minimum description length: when forming a hypothesis, attempt to minimize the length of the description of the hypothesis. 
* Minimum features: unless there is good evidence that a feature is useful, it should be deleted. This is the assumption behind feature selection algorithms.
* Nearest neighbors: assume that most of the cases in a small neighborhood in feature space belong to the same class. Given a case for which the class is unknown, guess that it belongs to the same class as the majority in its immediate neighborhood. This is the bias used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The assumption is that cases that are near each other tend to belong to the same class.

==Shift of bias==

Although most learning algorithms have a static bias, some algorithms are designed to shift their bias as they acquire more data. This does not avoid bias, since the bias shifting process itself must have a bias.

<doc id="173927" wikidata="Q836646" url="?curid=173927" title="Ladislaus Bortkiewicz">
<text>Ladislaus Josephovich Bortkiewicz (Russian Владислав Иосифович Борткевич, German &quot;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz&quot; or &quot;Ladislaus von Bortkewitsch&quot;) (7 August 1868 – 15 July 1931) was a Russian economist and statistician of Polish ancestry. He wrote a book showing how the Poisson distribution, a discrete probability distribution, can be useful in applied statistics, and he made contributions to mathematical economics. He lived most of his professional life in Germany, where he taught at Strassburg University (Privatdozent, 1895–1897) and Berlin University (1901–1931).

==Life and work==
Ladislaus Bortkiewicz was born in Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, to two ethnic Polish parents: Józef Bortkiewicz and Helena Bortkiewicz (née Rokicka). His father was a Polish nobleman who served in the Russian Imperial Army.

Bortkiewicz graduated from the Law Faculty in 1890. In 1898 he published a book about the Poisson distribution, titled &quot;The Law of Small Numbers&quot;. In this book he first noted that events with low frequency in a large population follow a Poisson distribution even when the probabilities of the events varied. It was that book that made the Prussian horse-kicking data famous. The data gave the number of soldiers killed by being kicked by a horse each year in each of 14 cavalry corps over a 20-year period. Bortkiewicz showed that those numbers followed a Poisson distribution. The book also examined data on child-suicides. Some have suggested that the Poisson distribution should have been named the &quot;Bortkiewicz distribution.&quot;

In political economy, Bortkiewicz is important for his analysis of Karl Marx&#x27;s reproduction schema in the last two volumes of &quot;Capital&quot;. Bortkiewicz identified a transformation problem in Marx&#x27;s work. Making use of Dmitriev&#x27;s analysis of Ricardo, Bortkiewicz proved that the data used by Marx was sufficient to calculate the general profit rate and relative prices. Though Marx&#x27;s transformation procedure was not correct—because it did not calculate prices and profit rate simultaneously, but sequentially—Bortkiewicz has shown that it is possible to get the correct results using the Marxian framework, i.e. using the Marxian variables constant capital and variable capital it is possible to obtain the profit rate and the relative prices in a three-sector model. This &quot;correction of the Marxian system&quot; has been the great contribution of Bortkiewicz to classical and Marxian economics but it was completely unnoticed until Paul Sweezy&#x27;s 1942 book &quot;Theory of Capitalist Development&quot;. Piero Sraffa (1960) has provided the complete generalization of the simultaneous method for classical and Marxian analysis.

Bortkiewicz died in Berlin, Germany. His papers, including a voluminous correspondence file (some 1,000 letters 1876–1931), were deposited at Uppsala University in Sweden, except for his correspondence with Léon Walras which went into the collection of the Walras scholar William Jaffé in the USA.

<doc id="173929" wikidata="Q1145652" url="?curid=173929" title="Fairport Convention">
<text>Fairport Convention are an English folk rock band, formed in 1967 by guitarists Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol, bassist Ashley Hutchings and drummer Shaun Frater (with Frater replaced by Martin Lamble after their first gig). They started out influenced by American folk rock, with a set list dominated by Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell songs and a sound that earned them the nickname &quot;the British Jefferson Airplane&quot;. Vocalists Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews joined them before the recording of their self-titled debut in 1968; afterwards, Dyble was replaced by Sandy Denny, and Matthews later left during the recording of their third album.

Denny began steering the group towards traditional British music for their next two albums, &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; and &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; (both 1969); the latter featured fiddler Dave &quot;Swarb&quot; Swarbrick, most notably on the song &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot;, which laid the groundwork for British folk rock by being the first time a traditional British song was combined with a rock beat. Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, a crash on the M1 motorway killed Lamble and Jeannie Franklyn, Thompson&#x27;s girlfriend; this resulted in the group retiring most of their prior material and turning entirely towards British folk music for their seminal album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;, released the same year. This style has been the band&#x27;s focus ever since. For this album Swarbrick joined full-time, alongside drummer Dave Mattacks. Both Denny and Hutchings left before the year&#x27;s end; the latter replaced by Dave Pegg, who has remained the group&#x27;s sole consistent member to this day; Thompson left after the recording of 1970&#x27;s &quot;Full House&quot;.

The 1970s saw numerous lineup changes around the core of Swarbrick and Pegg – Nicol being absent for the middle of the decade – and declining fortunes as folk music fell out of mainstream favour. Denny, whose partner Trevor Lucas had been a guitarist in the group since 1972, returned for the pop-oriented &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; album in 1975 in a final bid to crack America; this effort failed, and after three more albums minus Denny and Lucas, the group disbanded in 1979. They played a farewell concert in the village of Cropredy, Oxfordshire, where they had held small concerts since 1976, and this marked the beginning of the Cropredy Festival (since 2005 known as Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention) which has become the largest folk festival in Britain, with annual attendances of 20,000.

The band was reformed by Nicol, Pegg, and Mattacks in 1985, joined by Maartin Allcock (guitar, mandolin, keys, vocals) and Ric Sanders (fiddle, keyboards), and they have remained active since. Allcock was replaced by Chris Leslie (mandolin, violin, vocals) in 1996, and Gerry Conway replaced Mattacks in 1998. Their 29th studio album, &quot;Shuffle and Go&quot; was released in 2020, and they continue to headline Cropredy each year.

Despite little mainstream success – their only top 40 single being &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot;, a French-language cover of the Dylan song &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; from &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; – Fairport Convention remain highly influential in British folk rock and British folk in general. &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was named the &quot;Most Influential Folk Album of All Time&quot; at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2006, and Pegg&#x27;s playing style, which incorporates jigs and reels into his basslines, has been imitated by many in the folk rock and folk punk genres. Additionally, many former members went on to form or join other notable groups in the genre, including Fotheringay, Steeleye Span, and the Albion Band; along with solo careers, most notably Thompson and Denny. Sandy Denny, now regarded as being amongst Britain&#x27;s finest female singer-songwriters, died in 1978; her song &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; – recorded by Fairport on &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; – became a signature song for herself and the band.

==History==

===Origins===
Bassist Ashley Hutchings met guitarist Simon Nicol in North London in 1966 when they both played in the Ethnic Shuffle Orchestra. They rehearsed on the floor above Nicol&#x27;s father&#x27;s medical practice in a house called &quot;Fairport&quot; in Fortis Green in Muswell Hill – on the same street where Ray and Dave Davies of the Kinks grew up. The house lent its name to the group they formed together as Fairport Convention in 1967 with Richard Thompson on guitar and Shaun Frater on drums. After their initial performance at St Michael&#x27;s Church Hall in Golders Green on 27 May 1967, they had their first of many line-up changes as one member of the audience, drummer Martin Lamble, convinced the band that he could do a better job than Frater and replaced him. They soon added a female singer, Judy Dyble, which gave them a distinctive sound among the many London bands of the period.

===1967–69: The first three albums===
Fairport Convention were soon playing regularly at underground venues such as UFO and The Electric Garden, which later became the Middle Earth club. After only a few months, they caught the attention of manager Joe Boyd who secured them a contract with Polydor Records. Boyd suggested they augment the line-up with another male vocalist. Singer Iain Matthews (then known as Ian MacDonald) joined the band, and their first album, &quot;Fairport Convention&quot;, was recorded in late 1967 and released in June 1968. At this early stage Fairport looked to North American folk and folk rock acts such as Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and The Byrds for material and inspiration. The name &quot;Fairport Convention&quot; and the use of two lead vocalists led many new listeners to believe that they were an American act, earning them the nickname &#x27;the British Jefferson Airplane&#x27; during this period. Fairport Convention played at the first Isle of Wight Festival, in August 1968, when Jefferson Airplane headlined.

After disappointing album sales they signed a new contract with Island Records. Before their next recording Judy Dyble left – she described it as being &quot;unceremoniously dumped&quot; – and was replaced by the band with Sandy Denny, a folk singer who had previously recorded as a soloist and with Strawbs. Denny&#x27;s distinctive voice, described by Clive James as &quot;open space, low-volume, high-intensity&quot;, is one of the characteristics of two albums released in 1969: &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; and &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;. These recordings marked the growth of much greater musicality and song-writing ability among the band. The first of these featured the Thompson-penned &quot;Meet on the Ledge&quot;, which became their second single and eventually the band&#x27;s unofficial anthem.

During the recording of &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;, Matthews left after having sung on only one song, eventually to form Matthews Southern Comfort. He was not replaced; the other male members covered his vocal parts. The album featured a guest appearance by Birmingham folk fiddler Dave Swarbrick on a recording of &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot;, a traditional song brought to the band by Denny from her folk club days. The recording of this track marked an important turning point for the band, sparking an interest in traditional music in Ashley Hutchings that led him to detailed research in the English Folk Dance and Song Society Library at Cecil Sharp House; this theme would become the basis for their next, much more ambitious, recording project.

These two albums began to gain the band wider recognition. Radio DJ John Peel championed their music, playing their albums on his influential BBC shows. Peel also recorded a number of sessions which were later released as the album &quot;Heyday&quot; (1987). They enjoyed some mainstream success when they entered the singles charts with &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot;, a French-language version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot;. The record just missed the top twenty, but secured the band a slot on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Britain&#x27;s most popular television pop music programme at the time. In 1969 four members of the band, one uncredited and three under pseudonyms, featured as backing musicians on the album &quot;Love Chronicles&quot; by Scottish folk artist Al Stewart.

====Developing British folk rock====
On 12 May 1969, on the way home from a gig at Birmingham venue Mothers, Fairport&#x27;s van crashed on the M1 motorway. Martin Lamble, aged only nineteen, and Jeannie Franklyn, Richard Thompson&#x27;s girlfriend, were killed. The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity. They nearly decided to disband. 

However, they reconvened with Dave Mattacks taking over drumming duties and Dave Swarbrick, having made contribution to &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;, now joined as a full member. And Sandy Denny joined as singer, encouraging the band to consider the integration of British folk music into rock and roll. Boyd set the band up in a rented house in Farley Chamberlayne near Winchester in Hampshire, where they recuperated and worked on this integration, which would result in a new sound and style manifest on their fourth album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot;.

Usually considered the highpoint of the band&#x27;s long career, &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was a huge leap forward in concept and musicality. The album consisted of six traditional tracks and three original compositions in a similar style. The traditional tracks included two sustained epics: &quot;Tam Lin&quot;, which was over seven minutes in length, and &quot;Matty Groves&quot;, at over eight. There was a medley of four traditional tunes, arranged, and, like many of the tracks, enlivened, by Swarbrick&#x27;s energetic fiddle playing. The first side was bracketed by original compositions &quot;Come all ye&quot; and &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot;, which, in addition to information on the inside of the gatefold cover on Hutchings&#x27; research, explaining English folk traditions, helped give the record the feel of a concept album. &quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot; and the final track &quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot;, also saw the full emergence of the distinctive song writing talent of Thompson that was to characterize his contributions to the band and later solo career. The distinctive sound of the album came from the use of electric instruments and Mattacks&#x27; disciplined drumming with Swarbrick&#x27;s fiddle accompaniment in a surprising and powerful combination of rock with the traditional. The entire band had reached new levels of musicality, with the fluid guitar playing of Thompson and the &quot;ethereal&quot; vocal of Denny particularly characteristic of the sound of the album. As the reviewer from AllMusic put it, the album was characterised by the &quot;fusing [of] time-worn folk with electric instruments while honoring both&quot;.

A few British bands had earlier experimented with playing traditional English songs on electric instruments, (including Strawbs and Pentangle), but Fairport Convention was the first English band to do this in a concerted and focused way. Fairport Convention&#x27;s achievement was not to invent folk rock, but to create a distinctly English branch of the genre, which would develop alongside, and interact with, American inspired music, but which can also be seen as a distinctively national reaction in opposition to it. &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was launched with a sell-out concert in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall late in 1969. It reached number 17 in the UK album chart, where it spent fifteen weeks.

===1970s: A time of change===

Disagreements arose about the direction of the band in the wake of this success. Ashley Hutchings wanted to explore more traditional material and left to form two groups that would rival Fairport for significance in English folk rock: Steeleye Span and the Albion Band. Sandy Denny also left to found her own group Fotheringay. Dave Pegg took over on bass guitar and has been the group&#x27;s one constant ever since, in an unbroken membership of over four decades. The band made no serious attempt to replace Denny, and, although she would briefly return, the sound of the band would now be characterized by male vocals.

Despite these changes the band produced another album, &quot;Full House&quot; (1970), which was remarkably successful as a project. Like its predecessor, it combined traditional songs, including a powerful rendition of &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot;, with original compositions. The latter benefited from the writing partnership of Thompson and Swarbrick, most obviously on &quot;Walk Awhile&quot;, which would become a concert favourite. Despite the loss of Denny the band still possessed four vocalists, including the emerging voices of Nicol and Swarbrick, whose tones would dominate the sound of this period. It was favourably reviewed in Britain and America, drawing comparisons with the Band from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine who declared that &quot;Fairport Convention is better than ever&quot;. The album reached number 13 in the UK Chart and stayed in the chart for eleven weeks. The same year the band released a single, &quot;Now Be Thankful&quot;, and made its American debut, touring with Traffic and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.
In the recurring pattern, soon after the album&#x27;s release Thompson left the band to pursue other projects and eventually his solo career. This left Simon Nicol as the only original member, and Dave Swarbrick emerged as the leading force in the band. In 1970 the members and their families had moved into The Angel, a former pub in Hertfordshire, and this inspired the next album &quot;Angel Delight&quot; (1971) the band&#x27;s first to chart in the US, peaking at number 200 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and their only top ten album in the UK. The next project was an ambitious folk-rock opera developed by Swarbrick, based on the life of John &quot;Babbacombe&quot; Lee, &quot;the man they couldn&#x27;t hang&quot; and released with the title &quot;Babbacombe Lee&quot; (1971). The concept format, originally without clear tracks, excited considerable press interest, and it received good air play in the United States where it reached number 195. A version was produced by the BBC for TV in 1975 with narration by Melvyn Bragg. These two albums were also notable as the first time that Fairport had recorded consecutively with the same line-up, but inevitably stability did not last; Simon Nicol left early in late 1971 to join Ashley Hutchings&#x27; Albion Country Band, and he was soon followed by Mattacks.

Only Pegg and Swarbrick remained, and the following few years have been dubbed &#x27;Fairport confusion&#x27; as a bewildering sequence of band members came and went, but by 1973 Mattacks had returned and two former members of Sandy Denny&#x27;s Fotheringay had joined the band, Denny&#x27;s Australian husband Trevor Lucas on vocals and guitar, and American Jerry Donahue on lead guitar. From these line-ups the band produced two studio albums: &quot;Rosie&quot;, notable for the Swarbrick-penned title track (1973) and &quot;Nine&quot; (1974), the ninth studio album by the band. The last of these contained writing contributions by Lucas to five of the nine tracks, which together with Donahue&#x27;s country influences and outstanding guitar pyrotechnics gave the album a very distinctive feel.

Denny rejoined the band in 1974, and there were considerable expectations, both artistic and commercial, placed on this line-up. Denny was featured on the album &quot;Rising for the Moon&quot; (1975), which became the band&#x27;s highest US chart album when it reached number 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the first album to reach the top hundred in the UK since &quot;Angel Delight&quot;, reaching No. 52. During the &quot;Rising&quot; sessions, Mattacks fell out with producer Glyn Johns and was replaced by former Grease Band drummer Bruce Rowland. Poor UK sales for &quot;Rising&quot; did not aid morale and, despite the relative success of the line-up, Lucas and Donahue left the band, as did Denny in 1976. She died aged 31, in 1978, of a cerebral haemorrhage after falling down a flight of stairs.

Rowland, Pegg, and Swarbrick fulfilled their remaining contractual obligations to Island Records by turning what had originally been a Swarbrick solo effort into the album &quot;Gottle O&#x27;Geer&quot; (1976) under the name &#x27;Fairport&#x27; (as opposed to Fairport Convention) in the UK, and as &#x27;Fairport featuring Dave Swarbrick&#x27; in the US, and with various session players and production by Simon Nicol, who subsequently rejoined the band. They then signed with Vertigo, but record sales continued to decline; after producing the first two of four albums for which they were contracted, &quot;The Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tipplers Tales&quot; (1978), Vertigo bought them out of their contract. It is claimed by members of the band that this was the only recording money they had seen up to that point.

===1979–1985: The Cropredy era===
By 1979 the mainstream market for folk rock had largely disappeared, the band had no record deal, and Dave Swarbrick had been diagnosed with tinnitus, which made loud electric gigs increasingly difficult. Fairport decided to disband. They played a farewell tour and a final outdoor concert on 4 August in Cropredy, the Oxfordshire village where Dave and Christine Pegg lived. The finality of this occasion was mitigated by the announcement that the band would meet for a reunion.

In August 1979, the band played at Knebworth Festival in England. The headline act at both their appearances at the festival, over two consecutive Saturdays on 4 and 11 August, were Led Zeppelin.

No record company wanted to release the live recordings of the tour and concert, so the Peggs founded Woodworm Records, which would be the major outlet for the band in the future. Members continued to take part in occasional gigs, particularly in festivals in continental Europe, and after a year they staged a reunion concert in Cropredy which became the annual Cropredy Festival. Over the next few years, it grew rapidly and emerged as the major mechanism for sustaining the band. In August 1981, the band held their annual reunion concert at Broughton Castle, rather than the usual Cropredy location. The concert was recorded, and released on the 1982 album &quot;Moat on the Ledge&quot;.

The Peggs continued to record and release the Cropredy concerts as &#x27;official bootlegs&#x27;. These were supplemented by New Year&#x27;s gigs in minor locations including the Half Moon at Putney and the Gloucester Leisure Centre. In 1983 the magazine &quot;Fairport Fanatics&quot; (later &quot;Dirty Linen&quot;), was created: a testament to the continued existence of a dedicated fan base.

The &quot;Angel Delight&quot; lineup of Simon Nicol, Dave Swarbrick, Dave Pegg, and Dave Mattacks played a number of gigs in the UK in the early 80s, then toured extensively in the UK and the US in 1984 and 1985. Band alumni like Richard Thompson and Bruce Rowland would occasionally join in.

The remaining members pursued their own lives and careers outside of the band. Nicol, Pegg, and Mattacks had recorded and toured with Richard and Linda Thompson at times in the 1970s, and did so again during this period, culminating in their appearance on the &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; album and tour in 1982. Bruce Rowlands gave up the music business and moved to Denmark and as a result Dave Mattacks returned as drummer for Fairport&#x27;s occasional gigs. Dave Pegg was the first of several Fairporters to join Jethro Tull which gave him well-paying steady employment. Simon Nicol had teamed up with Dave Swarbrick in a highly regarded acoustic duo, but this partnership was made difficult by Swarbrick&#x27;s sudden decision to move to Scotland, where, from 1984, he began to focus on his new project Whippersnapper.

In 1985, Pegg, Nicol and Mattacks found that they all had some free time and an available studio belonging to Pegg. They decided that they needed some new material to add to the catalogue that had been suspended in 1978. As Swarbrick was unavailable, the selection of traditional tunes was more difficult than for past albums and there was a need for a replacement fiddle player and some vocals. Pegg and Nicol took over arranging duties on an instrumental medley and the band turned to sometime Albion Band members: jazz and folk violinist Ric Sanders and singer-songwriter Cathy Lesurf. They also had the help of ex-member Richard Thompson. Thompson and Lesurf contributed songs and took part in the recordings. Also important to the album was Ralph McTell who contributed one song and co-wrote one track each with Nicol and Mattacks; the latter of these, &quot;The Hiring Fair&quot;, would become a stage fixture of Fairport.

The resulting album &quot;Gladys&#x27; Leap&quot; (1985) was generally well received in the music and national press, but caused some tension with Swarbrick who refused to play any of the new material at the 1985 Cropredy Festival. Nevertheless, the decision to reform the band, without Swarbrick, was taken by the other three remaining members. Ric Sanders was invited to join, along with guitarist, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Maartin Allcock. Nicol, with his developing baritone voice, took over the main share of the vocal duties. This line-up was to last eleven years, the longest period of membership stability in the band&#x27;s history so far.

===1986–1997: Stability===
The new band began a hectic schedule of performing in Britain and the world and prepared material for a new album. The result was the all-instrumental &quot;Expletive Delighted!&quot; (1986). This showcased the virtuosity of Sanders and Allcock, but perhaps inevitably was not popular with all fans. This was followed by the recording &quot;In Real Time: Live &#x27;87&quot; which managed to capture the energy and power of the new Fairport on stage, despite the fact that it was recorded in the studio with audience reactions dubbed on.

In this period the band were playing to larger and larger audiences, both on tour and at Cropredy, and it was very productive in terms of recording. Fairport had the considerable composing and arranging skills of Allcock and, to fill the gap created by a lack of a songwriter in the band, they turned to some of the most talented available in the contemporary folk scene. The results were &quot;Red &amp; Gold&quot; (1989) &quot;The Five Seasons&quot; (1990) and &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; (1995), the last of which was judged &quot;their bestselling and undoubtedly finest album in years.&quot;

At this point, with Mattacks busy with other projects, the band shifted to an acoustic format for touring and released the unplugged &quot;Old New Borrowed Blue&quot; as &quot;Fairport Acoustic Convention&quot; in 1996. For a while the four-piece acoustic line-up ran in parallel with the electric format. When Allcock left the band, he was replaced by Chris Leslie on vocals, mandolin and fiddle, who formerly worked with Swarbrick in Whippersnapper, and had a one-off stint with the band replacing Ric Sanders for 1992 Cropredy Festival. This meant that for the first time since reforming, the band had a recognized songwriter who contributed significantly to the band&#x27;s output on the next album &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; (1997), particularly the rousing &quot;John Gaudie&quot;. By the time of the 30th anniversary Festival at Cropredy in 1997, the new Fairport had been in existence for over a decade and contributed a significant chapter to the history of the band.

===1998–present===

Dave Mattacks moved to the US in 1998, and Gerry Conway took over on drums and percussion. Fairport produced two more studio albums for Woodworm Records: &quot;The Wood and the Wire&quot; (2000) and &quot;XXXV&quot; (2002). Then, for &quot;Over the Next Hill&quot; (2004) they established a new label: Matty Grooves Records. In this period the band toured extensively in the UK, Europe, Australasia, Europe, the US and Canada, and staged a major fund raiser for Dave Swarbrick at the Birmingham Symphony Hall. In 1998, members of the band began their association with the Breton musician Alan Simon. Working in collaboration with numerous others, members of Fairport (predominantly Nicol and Leslie) have performed in and participated in the recordings of all Simon&#x27;s rock operas, including the &quot;Excalibur trilogy&quot; (1998, 2007, 2010) and &quot;Anne de Bretagne&quot; (2008).

2007 was their fortieth anniversary year and they celebrated by releasing a new album, &quot;Sense of Occasion&quot;. They performed the whole of the &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; album live at Cropredy, since 2004 renamed Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention, featuring the 1969 line-up of Dave Swarbrick, Ashley Hutchings, Dave Mattacks, Simon Nicol and Richard Thompson, with singer-songwriter Chris While taking the place of Sandy Denny. Footage of the festival, although not the &quot;Liege and Lief&quot; performance, was released as part of a celebratory DVD.

The band&#x27;s first official YouTube video appeared in April 2008. Edited from footage shot for the DVD, the nine-minute mini-documentary includes interviews with Lulu, Jools Holland, Seth Lakeman, Mike Harding, Geoff Hughes and Frank Skinner.

In 2011 the band released a new studio album Festival Bell, the first new album in four years. This was followed in 2012 by &quot;Babbacombe Lee Live Again&quot; recorded live during the 2011 tour revisiting the &quot;Babbacombe Lee&quot; album first issued in 1971. In 2012, the band also released &quot;By Popular Request&quot;, a reworking in the studio of a number of the most popular songs in the band&#x27;s repertoire (as determined by a mysterious consultation and voting process conducted by the band with its fans).

 the band continues to write and record music, regularly producing new studio albums, the most recent releases being 2015&#x27;s &quot;Myths and Heroes&quot;, 2017&#x27;s &quot;50:50@50&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Shuffle and Go&quot;. The Covid-19 Pandemic impacted significantly on their ability to tour, and their 2022 tour was initially cut short after several of the touring team developed Covid.

In 2022, Gerry Conway made the decision to leave the band after 24 years, and it was announced that the band would continue as a four piece. Conway did not make public that he left because he was suffering from motor neurone disease from which he was to die in April 2024.

On the bands Winter 2023 UK Tour, they were joined by a returning Mattacks on drums and percussion who also returned for the 2024 winter tour.

==Public recognition==
The mainstream media has increasingly recognized Fairport Convention&#x27;s historical importance. They received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In the same year Free Reed Records, an independent label, released &quot;Fairport Unconventional&quot;, a four-CD boxed set of rare and unreleased recordings from the band&#x27;s 35-year career. At the 2006 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards they received an award when their seminal album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was voted &#x27;Most Influential Folk Album of All Time&#x27; by Radio 2 listeners. At the 2007 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Fairport Convention received an award recognising the late Sandy Denny and the band for &quot;Favourite Folk Track of All Time&quot; for &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot;.

<text>Royal Inspector was the highest ranking colonial officer in Danish-ruled Greenland from 1782 until 1924. They were agents of the Royal Greenland Trading Department established by its Instruction of 1782 and reported to the Board of Managers of the company in Copenhagen.

As senior agents of the company, they were generally forbidden under the Instruction from marrying any non-European women, though Inspector Nicolai Zimmer&#x27;s wife was half-Inuit.

<text>In modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is the notion that the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is uniformly isotropic and homogeneous when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act equally throughout the universe on a large scale, and should, therefore, produce no observable inequalities in the large-scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.

== Definition ==
Astronomer William Keel explains:

The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as &#x27;Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.&#x27; This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.

The cosmological principle depends on a definition of &quot;observer&quot;, and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences.

&quot;Observers&quot; means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, &quot;the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are.&quot;

The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a &quot;foamy&quot; texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.

The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity – constant density
– means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe. Isotropy – same in all directions – means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe. Isotropy implies homogeneity, but an homogeneous universe could be anisotropic.

== Origin ==
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687) of Isaac Newton. In contrast to some earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of &quot;universal gravitation&quot; that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.

== Implications ==
Since the 1990s, observations assuming the cosmological principle have concluded that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy, which led to the development of the ΛCDM model.

Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium. Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by nucleosynthesis in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae and new star formation from the supernova remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well.

A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in mechanical equilibrium. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see timeline of the universe).

Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, Alexander Friedmann set out a variant of Albert Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe. Independently, Georges Lemaître derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations. Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to general relativity.

== Criticism ==
Karl Popper criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes &quot;our &quot;lack&quot; of knowledge a principle of &quot;knowing something&quot;&quot;. He summarized his position as:
: the &quot;cosmological principles&quot; were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.

== Observations ==
Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, according to the ΛCDM model it ought to be isotropic and statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. However, recent findings (the Axis of Evil for example) have suggested that violations of the cosmological principle exist in the universe and thus have called the ΛCDM model into question, with some authors suggesting that the cosmological principle is now obsolete and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric breaks down in the late universe.

=== Violations of isotropy ===
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is predicted by the ΛCDM model to be isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at. Data from the Planck Mission shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities), the collaboration noted that these features are not strongly statistically inconsistent with isotropy. Some authors say that the universe around Earth is isotropic at high significance by studies of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps. There are however claims of isotropy violations from galaxy clusters, quasars, and type Ia supernovae.

=== Violations of homogeneity ===
The &quot;cosmological principle&quot; implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is homogeneous. Based on N-body simulations in a ΛCDM universe, Yadav and his colleagues showed that the spatial distribution of galaxies is statistically homogeneous if averaged over scales of 260/&quot;h&quot; Mpc or more.

A number of observations have been reported to be in conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes:
* The Clowes–Campusano LQG, discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale.
* The Sloan Great Wall, discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc, which is only just consistent with the cosmological principle.
* U1.11, a large quasar group discovered in 2011, has a length of 780 Mpc, and is two times larger than the upper limit of the homogeneity scale.
* The Huge-LQG, discovered in 2012, is three times longer than, and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to these current models, and so challenges our understanding of the universe on large scales.
* In November 2013, a new structure 10 billion light years away measuring 2000–3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the Sloan Great Wall) was discovered, the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, putting further doubt on the validity of the cosmological principle.
* In September 2020, a 4.9&quot;σ&quot; conflict was found between the kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole and the measurement of the dipole in the angular distribution of a flux-limited, all-sky sample of 1.36 million quasars.
* In June 2021, the Giant Arc was discovered, a structure spanning approximately 1000 Mpc. It is located 2820 Mpc away and consists of galaxies, galactic clusters, gas, and dust.
* In January 2024, the Big Ring was discovered. It is located 9.2 billion light years away from Earth has a diameter of 1.3 billion light years or around the size of 15 full Moons as seen from Earth.

However, as pointed out by Seshadri Nadathur in 2013 using statistical properties, the existence of structures larger than the homogeneous scale (260/&quot;h&quot; Mpc by Yadav&#x27;s estimation) does not necessarily violate the cosmological principle in the ΛCDM model (see &quot;&quot;).

== CMB dipole ==

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a snapshot of a largely isotropic and homogeneous universe. The largest scale feature of the CMB is the dipole anisotropy; it is typically subtracted from maps due to its large amplitude. The standard interpretation of the dipole is that it is due to the Doppler effect caused by the motion of the solar system with respect to the CMB rest-frame.

Several studies have reported dipoles in the large scale distribution of galaxies that align with the CMB dipole direction, but indicate a larger amplitude than would be caused by the CMB dipole velocity. A similar dipole is seen in data of radio galaxies, however the amplitude of the dipole depends on the observing frequency showing that these anomalous features cannot be purely kinematic. Other authors have found radio dipoles consistent with the CMB expectation. Further claims of anisotropy along the CMB dipole axis have been made with respect to the Hubble diagram of type Ia supernovae and quasars. Separately, the CMB dipole direction has emerged as a preferred direction in some studies of alignments in quasar polarizations, strong lensing time delay, type Ia supernovae, and standard candles. Some authors have argued that the correlation of distant effects with the dipole direction may indicate that its origin is not kinematic.

Alternatively, Planck data has been used to estimate the velocity with respect to the CMB independently of the dipole, by measuring the subtle aberrations and distortions of fluctuations caused by relativistic beaming and separately using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. These studies found a velocity consistent with the value obtained from the dipole, indicating it is consistent with being entirely kinematic. Measurements of the velocity field of galaxies in the local universe show that on short scales galaxies are moving with the local group, and that the average mean velocity decreases with increasing distance. This follows the expectation if the CMB dipole were due to the local peculiar velocity field, it becomes more homogeneous on large scales. Surveys of the local volume have been used to reveal a low density region in the opposite direction to the CMB dipole, potentially explaining the origin of the local bulk flow.

== Perfect cosmological principle ==
The perfect cosmological principle is an extension of the cosmological principle, and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space &quot;and&quot; time. In this view the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. The perfect cosmological principle underpins steady state theory and emerges from chaotic inflation theory.

<text>Bhajan refers to any devotional song with a religious theme or spiritual ideas, specifically among Dharmic religions, in any language. The term bhajanam (Sanskrit: भजनम्) means &quot;reverence&quot; and originates from the root word &quot;bhaj&quot; (Sanskrit: भज्), which means &quot;to revere&quot;, as in &#x27;Bhaja Govindam&#x27; (&quot;Revere Govinda&quot;)&quot;. &quot;The term bhajana also means &quot;sharing&quot;.

The term bhajan is also commonly used to refer a group event, with one or more lead singers, accompanied with music, and sometimes dancing. Normally, bhajans are accompanied by percussion instruments such as &quot;tabla&quot;, dholak or a tambourine. Handheld small cymbals (&quot;kartals&quot;) are also commonly used to maintain the beat. A bhajan may be sung in a temple, in a home, under a tree in the open, near a river bank or a place of historic significance.

Having no prescribed form, or set rules, bhajans are normally lyrical and based on melodic ragas. It belongs to a genre of music and arts that developed during the Bhakti movement. It is found in the various traditions of Hinduism as well as Jainism. Within Hinduism, bhajans are particularly prevalent in Vaishnavism.

Ideas from scriptures, legendary epics, the teachings of saints and loving devotion to a deity are typical subjects in bhajans.

Bhajans have been widely composed anonymously and shared as a musical and arts tradition. Genres such as Nirguni, Gorakhanathi, Vallabhapanthi, Ashtachhap, Madhura-bhakti and the traditional South Indian form Sampradya Bhajan each have their own repertoire and methods of singing.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;bhajan&quot; or &quot;bhajana&quot; is derived from the root , which means &quot;divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to&quot;. The word also connotes &quot;attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation&quot;.

==Hinduism==

===Historical roots===
In Hinduism, &quot;Bhajan&quot; and its Bhakti term &quot;Kirtan&quot;, have roots in the ancient metric and musical traditions of the Vedic era, particularly the Samaveda. The Samaveda Samhita is not meant to be &quot;read&quot; as a text, but sung as it is like a musical score sheet that must be &quot;heard&quot;.

Other late Vedic texts mention the two scholars &quot;Shilalin&quot; (IAST: Śilālin) and &quot;Krishashva&quot; (IAST: Kṛśaśva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing and dance. The art schools of Shilalin and Krishashva may have been associated with the performance of Vedic rituals, which involved story telling with embedded ethical values. The Vedic traditions integrated rituals with performance arts, such as a dramatic play, where not only praises to gods were recited or sung, but the dialogues were part of a dramatic representation and discussion of spiritual themes.
The Vedas and Upanishads celebrate &quot;Nada-Brahman&quot;, where certain sounds are considered elemental, triggering emotional feelings without necessarily having a literal meaning, and this is deemed a sacred, liminal experience of the primeval ultimate reality and supreme truth. This supreme truth is considered as full of bliss and &quot;rasa&quot; (emotional taste) in the Hindu thought, and melodic sound is considered a part of human spiritual experience. Devotional music genres such as &quot;Bhajan&quot; are part of a tradition that emerged from these roots.

However, bhajans rose to prominence as a way of expressing fervent devotion to the divine, breaking down barriers of caste and society, during the Bhakti and Sant movements of medieval India (about the 6th to the 17th centuries).

By writing verses in a variety of regional languages, saints and poets like Kabir, Mirabai, Tulsidas, and Surdas played a crucial part in popularizing bhajans and making them understandable to a larger audience. Their Bhajan lyrics emphasized the universality of divine love while praising the intimate connection between the believer and the deity.

===Hindu Bhajans===
A &quot;Bhajan&quot; in Hindu traditions is an informal, loosely structured devotional song with music in a regional language. They are found all over India and Nepal, but are particularly popular among the Vaishnav traditions such as those driven by devotion to avatars of Vishnu such as Krishna, Rama, Vitthal and Narayana (often with their consorts). In Southern India, Bhajanais follow a tradition (Sampradaya) called the &quot;Dakshina Bharatha Sampradaya Bhajanai&quot;. This involves a tradition that has been followed for the last several centuries and includes Songs/Krithis/Lyrics from great composers all over India encompassing many Indian languages.

A &quot;Bhajan&quot; may be sung individually, but more commonly together as a choral event wherein the lyrics include religious or spiritual themes in the local language. Bhajans often describe loving devotion to a deity, legends from the Epics or the Puranas, compositions of Bhakti movement saints, or spiritual themes from Hindu scriptures. The Bhajans in many Hindu traditions are a form of congregational singing and bonding, that gives the individual an opportunity to share in the music-driven spiritual and liturgical experience as well as the community a shared sense of identity, wherein people share food, meet and reconnect. &quot;Bhajans&quot; have played a significant role in community organization in 19th and 20th century colonial era, when Indian workers were brought to distant lands such as Trinidad, Fiji and South Africa as cheap labor on plantations.

Some &quot;Bhajans&quot; are centuries old, popular on a pan-regional basis, passed down as a community tradition, while others are newly composed. Everyone in the Hindu tradition are free to compose a &quot;Bhajan&quot; with whatever ideas or in praise of any deity of their wish. But since they are sung, they typically follow meters of classical Indian music, the raga and the tala to go with the musical instruments. They are sung in open air, inside temples such as those of Swaminarayan movement, in Vaishnava monasteries, during festivals or special events, and at pilgrimage sites.

There are some terms related to bhajan. Bhajansimran and Bhajankirtan help a disciple to achieve the higher reverence towards God.

===Bhajan versus Kirtan in the Hindu traditions===
A &quot;Bhajan&quot; is closely related to &quot;Kirtan&quot;, with both sharing common aims, subjects, musical themes and being devotional performance arts. A &quot;Bhajan&quot; is more free in form, and can be singular melody that is performed by a single singer with or without one and more musical instruments. &quot;Kirtan&quot;, in contrast, differs in being a more structured team performance, typically with a call and response musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas, and it includes two or more musical instruments, with roots in the prosody principles of the Vedic era.

Many &quot;Kirtan&quot; are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn, a mantra or a theme, the audience then responds back by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs. A &quot;Bhajan&quot;, in contrast, is either experienced in silence or a &quot;sing along&quot;.

==Jainism==
&quot;Stavan&quot; is a form of popular and historically pervasive genre of devotional music in Jainism. The subject of a &quot;Stavan&quot; varies, ranging from praise of Jina, Jain religious ideas and its philosophy, in a manner similar to Bhakti Bhajans.

Jainism rejects any Creator god, but accepts protector deities and rebirth of souls as heavenly beings, and its devotional singing traditions integrate these beliefs. &quot;Stavan&quot; may include dancing and worship rituals. Known as &quot;Bhajan&quot; in north and west Indian regional languages, a &quot;Stavan&quot; is typically sung as folk melodies by groups of Jain women, and are a formal part of ceremonies and celebrations within Jainism.

== Buddhism ==
Numerous Buddhist traditions use vocal music with instrumental accompaniment as part of their rituals and devotional practices. Buddhist vocal music and chanting is often part of Buddhist rituals and festivals in which they may be seen as offerings to the Buddha. 

In South Asia, there are still several traditions of Buddhist bhajan singing. One is the Newari Buddhist Gunlā Bājan tradition, which has a long history.

Bengali Barua Buddhists also have a tradition of singing songs in the vernacular, which they call &quot;Buddha-samkirtan&quot; or &quot;Buddha kirtan.&quot;

There is also a more recent tradition of Indian Buddhist bhajans which has become popular among recent Indian converts to Buddhism.

Sri Lankan Buddhists also have their own tradition of bhajans and Buddhist songs.

==Sikhism==
The Sikh tradition places major emphasis on devotional worship to one formless God, and &quot;Bhajans&quot; are a part of this worship. A more common form of community singing is called &quot;Shabad Kirtan&quot; in Sikhism. A &quot;Shabad Kirtan&quot; is performed by professional religious musicians, wherein &quot;bani&quot; (&#x27;word&#x27;, or &#x27;hymns&#x27;) from the Sikh scripture are sung to a certain raga and tala.

==Modern composers and singers of Bhajans==

A modern Bhajan has no fixed form: it may be as simple as a mantra or kirtan or as sophisticated as the dhrupad, &quot;thumri&quot; or &quot;kriti&quot; with music based on classical ragas and talas.

V. D. Paluskar and V. N. Bhatkhande have combined Indian classical music with bhajan. Pandit Kumar Gandharva made famous the Nirguni Bhajans of Sant Kabir and Malwa Region. The dancer Mallika Sarabhai has produced performances based on bhajans. Abhinaya Chakravathi Sri JS Eswara Prasad Rao of Hyderabad, who is the disciple of AL Krishnamurthy Bhagavathar, Pudukkottai system, has produced performances based on Sampradaya bhajans under the title &quot;Nitrya Sankeerthnam&quot;.

Bhajans of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism traditions, Vedic mantras and Yoga chants have been composed, published in Western musical sheet format or recorded by western singers such as Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Miten, and by various West Indies singers influenced by East Indian heritage.

The &quot;Stavan&quot; compositions and literature of the Jainism tradition are extensive, with a historic overview provided by &quot;Sri Sudhara Stavan Sangrah&quot;, traditionally preserved in &quot;puja box&quot; by Jain families. It is vectored text with Jain lyrics and is canonically inspired.

Kripalu Maharaj is one of the modern era bhakti leaders and bhajan-kirtan composers. He has composed eleven thousand one hundred and eleven &quot;doha&quot; (couplets) on the &quot;leela&quot; of Radha and Krishna, and the devotional philosophy called &quot;Radha Govind Geet&quot;; 1008 &quot;pad&quot; (songs) called &quot;Prem Ras Madira&quot;; hundreds of &quot;kirtan&quot; in the form of &quot;Yugal Shatak&quot; and &quot;Yugal Ras&quot; and twelve &quot;pad&quot; which fully describe the beauty and the decorations of Krishna, and thirteen &quot;pad&quot; which describe the beauty and the decorations of Radha called &quot;Shree Krishn Dwadashi&quot; and &quot;Shree Radha Trayodashi&quot;. Renditions of Shree Maharaji&#x27;s &quot;bhajans&quot; and &quot;kirtans&quot; have been recorded by well-known singers in India such as Manna Dey, Ajnish, Anuradha Paudwal and Anup Jalota.

In the olden days, Sants such as Mirabai, Surdas, and Narsinh Mehta composed several bhajans that are universally sung even today.

<text>George Girard (October 7, 1930 – January 18, 1957) was a New Orleans jazz trumpeter. He was known for his great technical ability, playing in a style that combined traditional New Orleans Dixieland jazz with the big-band-style trumpet, and a member of the Basin Street Six.

Girard was born in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. In highschool he studied music under Johnny Wiggs and became a professional musician immediately after graduating in 1946. He played and toured with the bands of Johnny Archer and Phil Zito before cofounding the band The Basin Street Six, made up mostly of friends he had grown up with, including clarinetist Pete Fountain. The band got a regular gig at L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s Restaurant in New Orleans, as well as regular television broadcasts over WWL. The band started receiving favorable national attention, but Girard was dissatisfied with it and broke up the band in 1954 to found his own band, George Girard &amp; the New Orleans Five which included trombonist Bob Havens, drummer Paul Edwards, and bassist Bob Coquille. Girard landed a residency at the Famous Door in the French Quarter, recorded for several labels, and got a weekly broadcast on CBS&#x27;s affiliated local radio station WWL. The broadcasts, from O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s on Jefferson Highway, were recorded and made available through the AFRTS. Girard had ambitions to make a national name for himself (and according to many fellow musicians the musical ability to do so), but became ill and had to give up playing in 1956. Girard died from colon cancer in New Orleans on January 18, 1957.

<doc id="173943" wikidata="Q2581060" url="?curid=173943" title="William Whittingham">
<text>William Whittingham (c. 1524–1579) was an English Puritan, a Marian exile, and a translator of the Geneva Bible. He was well connected to the circles around John Knox, Heinrich Bullinger and John Calvin, and firmly resisted the continuance of the English liturgy during the Marian exile. At last, he was ordained by the Presbyterians in Geneva. Upon his return to England, he became a well-known opponent to the rites of the Church of England. Through the patronage of the Earl of Leicester, he was collated to the Deanery of Durham, but in 1579 action was started to deprive him of all holy orders on account of his Presbyterian ordination. The process of deprivation was in process, when Whittingham died in 1579. The full record of Whittingham&#x27;s appointment and trial may be found in Strype&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;, II.ii., pp. 167, 168, 620.

==Early life==
Born at Chester about 1524, he was son of William Whittingham, by his wife, a daughter of Haughton of Hoghton Tower, Lancashire. In 1540, at the age of sixteen, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating B.A. and being elected fellow of All Souls&#x27; College in 1545. In 1547 he became senior student of Christ Church, Oxford earning the M.A. on 5 Feb 1547–8. On 17 May 1550, he was granted leave to travel for three years to study languages and civil law. He went to France, where he spent his time chiefly at the University of Orleans, but he also visited Lyon and studied at Paris, where his services as interpreter were used by the English ambassador, Sir John Mason or Sir William Pickering.

Towards the end of 1552 Whittingham visited universities in Germany and Geneva. He briefly returned to England in May 1553. Whittingham had adopted radical Puritan views, but the accession of Queen Mary, the return of Anglo-Italian ecclesiastical policies of &quot;De Haeretico Comburendo&quot; in the form of Cardinal Pole&#x27;s repatriation to England, and the vulnerabilities and liabilities associated with burnings-to-come (e.g. William Tyndale, 1536), anticipated persecutions, interfered with hopes of usefulness in ministerial labours. Late in August, however, he made intercession, which was ultimately successful, for the release of Peter Martyr; but after a few weeks he himself left England with difficulty by way of Dover to France.

==At Frankfort==

In the spring of 1554 Frankfort was the ecclesiastical centre for the English Marian exiles on the continent, and Whittingham was one of the first who reached the city on 27 June 1554; he sent out invitations to exiles in other cities to join them. Difficulties soon arose, however, between the party led by Whittingham and John Knox which sought to abolish all English liturgies and adopt the Genevan and Presbyterian mode of worship; and those who sought to retain the Anglican Prayerbooks, in particular Edward VI&#x27;s second prayer-book. Whittingham was one of those appointed to draw up a service-book. He procured a letter from John Calvin, dated 18 January 1555, which prevailed; but the compromise adopted was disturbed by the arrival and public disruptions of Richard Cox, an uncompromising champion of the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. In the party with Cox was John Jewel, the famed later bishop of Salisbury, who resolutely opposed Whittingham and Knox in their program. In the ensuing struggle between the two parties, Whittingham was Knox&#x27;s chief supporter. However, he failed to prevent Knox&#x27;s expulsion from Frankfort on 26 March; he gave his support to the form of church government established at Frankfort under Cox&#x27;s influence. He was dissatisfied with the outcome, however. About 22 September 1555, he followed Knox to Geneva, a veritable beehive of growing scholarship and, in time, international influence. There, he was ordained in the Presbyterian manner.

There exists a nearly eye-witness narrative of the conflict, published in 1575, entitled &quot;&#x27;A Brieff Discours off the Troubles begonne at Franckford in Germany, anno Domini 1554. Abowte the Booke off Common Prayer and Ceremonies, and continued by the Englishe men theyre to thende off Q. Maries Raigne,&quot;&#x27; 1575. Recent scholars have argued that Whittingham is indeed the author of the narrative.

==At Geneva==

On 16 December 1555, and again in December 1556, Whittingham was elected a Presbyterian elder; on 16 December 1558, he was ordained as a deacon, and in 1559 he succeeded Knox as Presbyterian minister at Calvin&#x27;s insistence. Upon Queen Mary&#x27;s death, most of the exiles at Geneva returned to England, but Whittingham remained to complete the translation of the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;. He had laboured with other scholars in the review of earlier English editions—Tyndale&#x27;s, Coverdale&#x27;s, the Thomas Matthew&#x27;s Bible and other versions. He had already produced a version of the New Testament, which was issued at Geneva by Conrad Badius on 10 June 1557. He also took part in the minor revisions of the Old Testament. The critical and explanatory notes were largely textual and explanatory. It was printed at Geneva by Rowland Hall in 1560; after 1611, its popularity was not lost. More than 150 editions were printed up to 1644. It was an influential version for at least one hundred years. By the 17th century, as Laudian influences would gain ascendancy, all-things-Genevan grew to be condemned.

Besides the translation of the Bible, Whittingham issued metrical versions some of Psalms. Seven of these were included among the fifty-one psalms published at Geneva in 1556; others were revised versions of Thomas Sternhold&#x27;s psalms. A metrical rendering of the Ten Commandments by Whittingham was appended. Another edition of 1558, now lost, is believed to have contained nine fresh psalms of Whittingham; these were reprinted in the edition of 1561, to which Whittingham also contributed a version of the &#x27;Song of Simeon&#x27; and two of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. Besides these, Whittingham translated four psalms in the Scottish psalter. These do not appear in any English edition. Whittingham revised for press Knox&#x27;s work on predestination, published at Geneva in 1560. He contributed a dedicatory epistle to Christopher Goodman&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;How Superior Powers ought to be obeyed&#x27;&quot; (Geneva, 1558). As well, he was the Latin translator of the martyr Nicholas Ridley&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Brief Declaration of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;&#x27; (Oxford, 1555); regarding his translation, a recent editor of the &quot;Declaration&quot; said this:&quot;... the Latin Version, to a reader who has learnt to love Ridley&#x27;s noble combination of courage and decision with fairness of thought and restraint of expression, is a painful study. Its diffuseness is such as to make it much more a parahprase than a version; and this diffuseness is largely displayed in the rendering of Ridley&#x27;s quiet English into an embittered rhetoric, or in quite gratuitous and disputable additions. A few examples may suffice...&quot;

==Return to England==

Whittingham took formal leave of the council at Geneva on 30 May 1560. In January 1561, he was appointed to attend Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford during his embassy to the French court. In the following year he became a chaplain to Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, a minister at Le Havre, then occupied by the English under Warwick. He won general praise; but William Cecil complained of his neglect of conformity to the English &quot;Book of Common Prayer.&quot; Owing to the support of Warwick and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, another Puritan sympathizer, Whittingham was collated on 19 July 1563 to the deanery of Durham.

In keeping with his past, Whittingham took his duties seriously, holding two services a day, devoting time to his grammar school and song school, and church music. Before the outbreak of the Rising of the North in 1569 he unsuccessfully urged James Pilkington, the bishop of Durham, to put the city in a state of defence, but he was more successful at Newcastle, which resisted the rebels. In 1572, when Lord Burghley became lord treasurer, Whittingham was suggested, probably by Leicester, as his successor in the office of secretary. In 1577, Leicester also promised Whittingham aid in securing the see of York or Durham, both being vacant; but Whittingham did not press for preferment.

==A Dean of Durham==

In 1564, Whittingham wrote a long letter to Leicester protesting against the &#x27;old popish apparel&#x27; and the historic associations with Massing-vestments and theology. He refused to wear the surplice and cope, and proceedings by Church officials were begun against him in 1566. Whittingham eventually yielded, taking Calvin&#x27;s moderating advice not to leave the ministry for external and minor matters of order. In 1577, however, he incurred the enmity of Edwin Sandys, the new archbishop of York, by resisting his claim to visit Durham Cathedral. According to William Hutchinson a commission had been issued in 1576 or 1577 to examine complaints against him. But this proved ineffectual because the Earl of Huntingdon and Matthew Hutton sided with the dean against the third commissioner, Sandys. A fresh commission was issued on 14 May 1578. This included the three former commissioners and about a dozen others.

The articles against Whittingham are printed from the domestic state papers in the &#x27;Camden Miscellany&#x27;; the charge that &#x27;he is defamed of &#x27; is entered as &#x27;partly proved&#x27; and that of drunkenness as &#x27;proved;&#x27; but the real allegation against Whittingham was the alleged inadequacy and invalidity of his ordination in Geneva. He admitted to not having been ordained according to the rites of the church of England. Archbishop Sandys further added that Whittingham had not even been validly ordained even according to Genevan standards, but had been elected preacher without the imposition of hands. Huntingdon repudiated the Archbishop and suggested a stay of the proceedings against Whittingham, arguing that &#x27;it could not but be ill-taken of all the godly learned both at home and in all the reformed churches abroad, that we should allow of the popish massing priests in our ministry, and disallow of the ministers made in a reformed church&#x27;. However Archbishop Richard Bancroft, in &quot;&#x27;Dangerous Positions&#x27;&quot;, referred to him as &#x27;afterward &quot;unworthily&quot; Dean of Durham&#x27;, and ranks him with Goodman, Gilby, and other Puritans. So does Roger L&#x27;Estrange in his violent philippic, &quot;&#x27;The Holy Cheat&quot;&#x27;.

As the proceedings to deprive Whittingham of holy orders were proceeding, he was met with death, on 10 June 1579. He was buried in Durham Cathedral, where his tomb (ironically) was destroyed by the Presbyterian Scots in 1640. His will, dated 18 April 1579, is printed in &#x27;Durham Wills and Inventories&#x27; (Surtees Soc. ii. 14–19).

==Family==

Whittingham&#x27;s wife Catherine, daughter of Louis Jaqueman, was probably born not before 1535 and married to Whittingham on 15 November 1556. Her eldest son, Zachary, was baptised on 17 August 1557, and her eldest daughter, Susanna, on 11 December 1558; both died young. Whittingham was survived by two sons, Sir Timothy and Daniel, and four daughters.

<doc id="173948" wikidata="Q651204" url="?curid=173948" title="Metatron">
<text>Metatron (Mishnaic Hebrew: &quot;Meṭāṭrōn&quot;), or Matatron (), is an angel in Judaism, Gnosticism, and Islam. Metatron is mentioned three times in the Talmud, in a few brief passages in the Aggadah, the Targum, and in mystical Kabbalistic texts within Rabbinic literature. The figure forms one of the traces for the presence of dualist proclivities in Gnosticism and the otherwise monotheistic vision of the Tanakh. In Rabbinic literature, he is sometimes portrayed as serving as the celestial scribe. The name Metatron is not mentioned in the Torah or the Bible, and how the name originated is a matter of debate. In Islamic tradition, he is also known as Mīṭaṭrūn (), the angel of the veil. 

In Jewish apocrypha, early Kabbalah, and rabbinic literature, &quot;Metatron&quot; is the name that Enoch received after his transformation into an angel.

== Etymology ==
Numerous etymologies have been proposed to account for the name Metatron, but there is no consensus, and its precise origin is unknown. Some scholars, such as Philip Alexander, believe that if the name Metatron originated in Hekhalot literature and Merkabah texts such as 3 Enoch, then it may have been a magical word like and .

Hugo Odeberg Adolf Jellinek and Marcus Jastrow suggest the name may have originated from either (, ) or the verb (, &#x27;to guard&#x27; or &#x27;to protect&#x27;). An early derivation of this can be seen in , where Enoch is clothed in light and is the guardian of the souls ascending to heaven. Odeberg also suggested that the name Metatron might have been adopted from the Old Persian name Mithra. Citing Wiesner, he drew up several parallels that appeared to link Mithra and Metatron based on their positions in heaven and duties.

Another hypothesis would derive Metatron from a combination of two Greek words, (&quot;meta&quot;, meaning &#x27;after&#x27;) and (&quot;thronos&quot;, meaning &#x27;throne&#x27;), which, taken together, would suggest the idea of &#x27;one who serves behind the throne&#x27; or &#x27;one who occupies the throne next to the throne of glory&#x27;. The primary arguments against this etymology are that Metatron&#x27;s function as a servant of the celestial throne emerges only later in the traditions regarding him, and itself is not attested as a word in Talmudic literature.

A connection with the word () used as &#x27;co-occupant of the divine throne&#x27;, has been advanced by some scholars; This, like the above etymology, is not found in any source materials. It is supported by Saul Lieberman and Peter Schäfer, who give further reasons why this might be a viable etymology. The Latin word (&#x27;messenger, guide, leader, measurer&#x27;) had been suggested by Eleazar of Worms ( – ), Nachmanides, and brought to light again by Hugo Odeberg. When transliterated into the Hebrew language, it is given as () or (). Gershom Scholem argues that there is no data to justify the conversion of to Metatron. Philip Alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of Metatron, stating that the word also occurs in Greek as – a word for an officer in the Roman army who acted as a forerunner. Using this etymology, Alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of &#x27;the angel of the Lord who led the Israelites through the wilderness: acting like a Roman army metator guiding the Israelites on their way&#x27;.

Other ideas include (, &#x27;a measure&#x27;). Charles Mopsik believes that the name Metatron may be related to the sentence from Genesis 5:24, &quot;Enoch walked with God, then he was no more, because God took him&quot;. The LXX version of the Hebrew word לָקַ֥ח (&quot;took&quot;) is .

In the entry entitled &quot;Paradigmata&quot; in his study The Written&#x27; as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly&quot;, John W. McGinley gives an accounting of how this name functions in the Bavli&#x27;s version of &quot;four entered pardes&quot;.

== Origins ==
In the Hellenistic period, mention of a second divine figure, either beside Yahweh or beneath him, occurs in several Jewish texts, mostly apocryphal. These Jewish traditions implying a divine dualism were most frequently associated with Enoch. In the rabbinic period, they center on &#x27;Metatron&#x27;, often in the context of debates over the heretical doctrine of &#x27;two powers in heaven&#x27; (). Ultimately, these ideas appear to go back to differing interpretations of the heavenly enthronement passages at Exodus 24:10, Daniel 7:9. and perhaps even Ezekiel 1:26. These different interpretations later came to distinguish what was orthodox from what was heretical in Judaism.

Among the pseudepigrapha 1 Enoch: Book of Parables presents two figures: the son of man and Enoch. At first, these two characters seem to be separate entities. Enoch views the son of man enthroned in Heaven. Later, however, they prove to be the same. Many scholars believe that the final chapters in the Book of Parables are a later addition. Others think they are not and that the son of man is Enoch&#x27;s heavenly double, similar to the &quot;Prayer of Joseph&quot;, where Jacob is depicted as an angel. The Book of Daniel displays two similar characters: the Ancient of Days and the one like a man. Parts of the text in Daniel are Aramaic and may have been changed in translation. The Septuagint reads that the son of man came as the Ancient of Days. All other translations say the son of man gained access to the Ancient of Days and was brought before that one.

The identification of Enoch with Metatron in 3 Enoch, where the name first appears, is not explicitly made in the Talmud, although it does refer to a Prince of the World who was young but now is old. However, some of the earliest kabbalists assumed the connection. There also seem to be two Metatrons, one spelled with six letters (), and one spelled with seven (). The former may be the transformed Enoch, Prince of the Countenance within the divine palace; the latter, the Primordial Metatron, a sephira &quot;persona&quot; of the &quot;Cause of Causes&quot;, specifically the tenth and last persona, identified with the earthly Shekhina. Furthermore, the Merkabah text identifies the Ancient of Days from the Book of Daniel as Metatron.

=== Scholem&#x27;s scholastic analysis ===
Many scholars see a discontinuity between how Enoch is portrayed in the early Enoch literature and how Metatron is portrayed. Scholars commonly see the character of Metatron as being based on an amalgam of Jewish literature; in addition to Enoch, Michael, Melchizedek, and Yahoel among others are seen as influences.

Scholem argues two streams of thought influenced Metatron&#x27;s character: One linking Metatron with Enoch, and one fusing different obscure entities and mythic motifs. Scholem argues that this second tradition was originally separate but later fused with the Enoch tradition. He points to texts where this second Metatron is a primordial angel and referred to as Metatron Rabbah. Scholem theorizes that the two Hebrew spellings of Metatron&#x27;s name represent these two separate traditions. In his view, the second Metatron is linked to Yahoel. Scholem also links Yahoel with Michael. In the Apocalypse of Abraham, Yahoel is assigned duties normally reserved for Michael. Yahoel&#x27;s name is commonly seen as a substitute for the Ineffable Name.

In 2 Enoch, Enoch is assigned titles commonly used by Metatron such as &quot;the Youth, the Prince of the Presence and the Prince of the World.&quot; Enoch is not called the Lesser Yahweh. In 3 Enoch, Metatron is called the Lesser Yahweh. This raises a problem since the name Metatron does not seem to be directly related to the name of God, Yahweh. Scholem proposes that this is because the Lesser Yahweh is a reference to Yahoel. In Maaseh Merkabah, the text reasons that Metatron is called the Lesser YHWH because in Hebrew gematria, Metatron is numerically equivalent to another name of God . Scholem does not find this convincing. Scholem points to the fact that both Yahoel and Metatron were known as the Lesser YHWH. In 3 Enoch 48D1, Metatron is called both Yahoel Yah and Yahoel. In addition to being one of the seventy names of Metatron from 3 Enoch 48D, Yahoel and Metatron are also linked in Aramaic incantation bowl inscriptions.

== Talmud ==
The Babylonian Talmud mentions Metatron by name in three places: Hagigah 15a, Sanhedrin 38b, and Avodah Zarah 3b.

Hagigah 15a describes Elisha ben Abuyah in Paradise seeing Metatron sitting down (an action that is not done in the presence of God). Elishah ben Abuyah therefore looks to Metatron as a deity and says heretically: &quot;Perhaps there are, God forbid, two powers in Heaven!&quot; The rabbis explain that Metatron had permission to sit because of his function as the Heavenly Scribe, writing down the deeds of Israel. The Talmud states that it was proved to Elisha that Metatron could not be a second deity by the fact that Metatron received 60 &quot;strokes with fiery rods&quot; to demonstrate that Metatron was not a god, but an angel, and could be punished.

In Sanhedrin 38b, one of the tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped because he has a name like his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel, Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness.

In Avodah Zarah 3b, the Talmud hypothesizes as to how God spends his day. It is suggested that in the fourth quarter of the day God sits and instructs the school children, but that before the destruction of the Temple, Metatron may have taken God&#x27;s place in this activity.

Yevamot 16b records an utterance, &quot;I have been young; also I have been old&quot; found in Psalm 37:25. The Talmud here attributes this utterance to the &quot;chief angel&quot; and &quot;prince of the world&quot;, whom the rabbinic tradition identifies as Metatron.

== Kirkisani ==
The tenth century Karaite scholar Jacob Qirqisani believed that rabbinic Judaism was the heresy of Jeroboam of the Kingdom of Israel. He quoted a version of Sanhedrin 38b, which he claimed contained a reference to the &quot;lesser YHWH&quot;. Scholem suggests that the name was deliberately omitted from later copies of the Talmud. Extra-talmudic mystical texts such as Sefer Hekhalot do speak of a &quot;lesser YHWH&quot;, apparently deriving the concept from Exodus 23:21, which mentions an angel of whom God says &quot;my name [understood as YHWH, the usual divine Proper Name] is in him&quot;.

== Merkabah, Zohar and other mystical writings ==
Metatron also appears in the Pseudepigrapha including , and most prominently in the Merkabah literature of the 3 Enoch, also called the &quot;Book of Enoch&quot; or &quot;Book of [the Heavenly] Palaces.&quot; The book describes the link between Enoch, son of Jared (great-grandfather of Noah) and his transformation into the angel Metatron.

Metatron says, &quot;He [the Holy One] called me, &#x27;The lesser YHWH&#x27; in the presence of his whole household in the height, as it is written, &#x27;my name is in him (12:5, Alexander&#x27;s translation). The narrator of this book, supposedly Rabbi Ishmael, tells how Metatron guided him through Heaven and explained its wonders. 3 Enoch presents Metatron in two ways: as a primordial angel (9:2–13:2) and as the transformation of Enoch after he was assumed into Heaven.

Metatron &quot;the Youth&quot;, a title previously used in 3 Enoch, where it appears to mean &quot;servant&quot;. It identifies him as the angel that led the people of Israel through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt (again referring to Exodus 23:21), and describes him as a heavenly priest.

In the later Ecstatic Kabbalah, Metatron is a messianic figure.

The &quot;Zohar&quot; describes Metatron as the &quot;King of the angels&quot;. and associates the concept of Metatron with that of the divine name . Zohar commentaries such as the by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero explain the Zohar as meaning that Metatron as the head of Yetzira This corresponds closely with Maimonides&#x27; description of the Talmudic &quot;Prince of the World&quot;, traditionally associated with Metatron, as the core &quot;Active Intellect&quot;.

The &quot;Zohar&quot; describes several biblical figures as metaphors for Metatron. Examples are Enoch, Joseph, Eliezer, Joshua, and others. The &quot;Zohar&quot; uses &quot;youth&quot; to describe Joseph and Joshua, a hint that the figures are a metaphor to Metatron, and also the concept of &quot;servant&quot; by Eliezer as a reference to Metatron. The Staff of Moses is also described by the Zohar as a reference to Metatron. The Zohar also states that the two tets in the word &quot;totafot&quot; () are a reference to Metatron. The &quot;Zohar&quot; distinguishes Metatron and Michael. While Michael is described repeatedly in the &quot;Zohar&quot; as the figure represented by the High Priest, Metatron is represented by the structure of the tabernacle itself.

== Apocalyptic texts ==
In the &quot;Apocalypse of Zerubbabel&quot;, Metatron is not identified as Enoch. Instead, he is recognized as the archangel Michael. The text also records that Metatron in gematria is the equivalent of Shaddai. While he also appears in other apocalyptic writings, he is most prominent in the &quot;Apocalypse of Zerubbabel&quot;. In these writings, he plays the role of heavenly interlocutor delivering knowledge about the coming messianic age.

== Islam ==

The earliest account of Metatron within Islamic scriptures might derive directly from the Quran itself. Uzair, according to Surah 9:30–31 venerated as a &quot;Son of God&quot; by Jews, commonly interpreted as an Arabic transliteration of the Hebrew name of the prophet Ezra, who was also identified with Enoch and Metatron in Merkabah Mysticism. In Islamic tradition, Metatron became a symbol for the idea that Jews worship &quot;God-as-old-man&quot; or an angelic being instead of God. Muslim heresiologists repeatedly accused Jews for venerating an angel as a &quot;lesser god&quot; (or an &quot;Incarnation of God&quot;), especially for celebrating Rosh Hashanah.

The name itself is attested early in Islam by al-Kindi and al-Masudi. Al-Suyuti identifies him as the angel of the veil and only he knows about that which lies beyond. He is also frequently mentioned in the magical works by Ahmad al-Buni, who describes Metatron as wearing a crown and a lance, probably constituting the Staff of Moses. In other magical practises, he is invoked to ward off evil jinn, devils, sorcerers and other magical threats.

Ibn Hazm mentions that Jews, although regarding Metatron as an angel, would celebrate Metatron as a lesser god ten days each year, perhaps a reference to Rosh Hashanah in connection with Merkabah mysticism that Metatron took part on the creation of the world.

<text>Laurence Tomson (1539 – 29 March 1608) was an English politician, author, and translator. He acted as the personal secretary of Sir Francis Walsingham, the secretary of state to Elizabeth I of England.

Tomson revised both the text and the annotations of the New Testament of the Geneva Bible. His revised edition appeared in 1576. Tomson was a Calvinist, and his annotations reflect that system of theology.

==Life==
He was born in Northamptonshire, and was admitted a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1553. He graduated B.A. in 1559, was elected a fellow of his college, and commenced M.A. in 1564. He accompanied Sir Thomas Hoby on an embassy to France in 1566, and resigned his Magdalen fellowship in 1569.

Between 1575 and 1587 Tomson represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the House of Commons, and he was member for Downton in 1588–9. In 1582 he was in attendance at court at Windsor Castle. According to his epitaph he travelled in Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and France; was conversant with twelve languages; and at one period gave public lectures on the Hebrew language at Geneva. He was employed in political affairs by Sir Francis Walsingham, after whose death he retired into private life.

Tomson died on 29 March 1608, and was buried in the chancel of the church at Chertsey, Surrey, where a black marble was erected to his memory with a curious Latin inscription.

<doc id="173954" wikidata="Q1783179" url="?curid=173954" title="Orthogonal group">
<text>In mathematics, the orthogonal group in dimension , denoted , is the group of distance-preserving transformations of a Euclidean space of dimension that preserve a fixed point, where the group operation is given by composing transformations. The orthogonal group is sometimes called the general orthogonal group, by analogy with the general linear group. Equivalently, it is the group of orthogonal matrices, where the group operation is given by matrix multiplication (an orthogonal matrix is a real matrix whose inverse equals its transpose). The orthogonal group is an algebraic group and a Lie group. It is compact.

The orthogonal group in dimension has two connected components. The one that contains the identity element is a normal subgroup, called the special orthogonal group, and denoted . It consists of all orthogonal matrices of determinant 1. This group is also called the rotation group, generalizing the fact that in dimensions 2 and 3, its elements are the usual rotations around a point (in dimension 2) or a line (in dimension 3). In low dimension, these groups have been widely studied, see , and . The other component consists of all orthogonal matrices of determinant . This component does not form a group, as the product of any two of its elements is of determinant 1, and therefore not an element of the component.

By extension, for any field , an matrix with entries in such that its inverse equals its transpose is called an &quot;orthogonal matrix over&quot; . The orthogonal
matrices form a subgroup, denoted , of the general linear group ; that is 
formula_1

More generally, given a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form or quadratic form on a vector space over a field, the &quot;orthogonal group of the form&quot; is the group of invertible linear maps that preserve the form. The preceding orthogonal groups are the special case where, on some basis, the bilinear form is the dot product, or, equivalently, the quadratic form is the sum of the square of the coordinates.

All orthogonal groups are algebraic groups, since the condition of preserving a form can be expressed as an equality of matrices.

== Name ==

The name of &quot;orthogonal group&quot; originates from the following characterization of its elements. Given a Euclidean vector space of dimension , the elements of the orthogonal group are, up to a uniform scaling (homothecy), the linear maps from to that map orthogonal vectors to orthogonal vectors.

== In Euclidean geometry ==

The orthogonal is the subgroup of the general linear group , consisting of all endomorphisms that preserve the Euclidean norm; that is, endomorphisms such that formula_2

Let be the group of the Euclidean isometries of a Euclidean space of dimension . This group does not depend on the choice of a particular space, since all Euclidean spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic. The stabilizer subgroup of a point is the subgroup of the elements such that . This stabilizer is (or, more exactly, is isomorphic to) , since the choice of a point as an origin induces an isomorphism between the Euclidean space and its associated Euclidean vector space.

There is a natural group homomorphism from to , which is defined by
: formula_3
where, as usual, the subtraction of two points denotes the translation vector that maps the second point to the first one. This is a well defined homomorphism, since a straightforward verification shows that, if two pairs of points have the same difference, the same is true for their images by (for details, see &quot;&quot;).

The kernel of is the vector space of the translations. So, the translations form a normal subgroup of , the stabilizers of two points are conjugate under the action of the translations, and all stabilizers are isomorphic to .

Moreover, the Euclidean group is a semidirect product of and the group of translations. It follows that the study of the Euclidean group is essentially reduced to the study of .

=== Special orthogonal group ===
By choosing an orthonormal basis of a Euclidean vector space, the orthogonal group can be identified with the group (under matrix multiplication) of orthogonal matrices, which are the matrices such that 
: formula_4

It follows from this equation that the square of the determinant of equals , and thus the determinant of is either or . The orthogonal matrices with determinant form a subgroup called the &quot;special orthogonal group&quot;, denoted , consisting of all direct isometries of , which are those that preserve the orientation of the space.

 is a normal subgroup of , as being the kernel of the determinant, which is a group homomorphism whose image is the multiplicative group . This implies that the orthogonal group is an internal semidirect product of and any subgroup formed with the identity and a reflection.

The group with two elements (where is the identity matrix) is a normal subgroup and even a characteristic subgroup of , and, if is even, also of . If is odd, is the internal direct product of and .

The group is abelian (whereas is not abelian when ). Its finite subgroups are the cyclic group of -fold rotations, for every positive integer . All these groups are normal subgroups of and .

=== Canonical form ===
For any element of there is an orthogonal basis, where its matrix has the form
: formula_5
where there may be any number, including zero, of ±1&#x27;s; and where the matrices are 2-by-2 rotation matrices, that is matrices of the form 
: formula_6
with .

This results from the spectral theorem by regrouping eigenvalues that are complex conjugate, and taking into account that the absolute values of the eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix are all equal to .

The element belongs to if and only if there are an even number of on the diagonal. A pair of eigenvalues can be identified with a rotation by and a pair of eigenvalues can be identified with a rotation by .

The special case of is known as Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem, which asserts that every (non-identity) element of is a rotation about a unique axis–angle pair.

=== Reflections ===
Reflections are the elements of whose canonical form is 
: formula_7
where is the identity matrix, and the zeros denote row or column zero matrices. In other words, a reflection is a transformation that transforms the space in its mirror image with respect to a hyperplane.

In dimension two, every rotation can be decomposed into a product of two reflections. More precisely, a rotation of angle is the product of two reflections whose axes form an angle of .

A product of up to elementary reflections always suffices to generate any element of . This results immediately from the above canonical form and the case of dimension two.

The Cartan–Dieudonné theorem is the generalization of this result to the orthogonal group of a nondegenerate quadratic form over a field of characteristic different from two.

The reflection through the origin (the map ) is an example of an element of that is not a product of fewer than reflections.

=== Symmetry group of spheres ===
The orthogonal group is the symmetry group of the -sphere (for , this is just the sphere) and all objects with spherical symmetry, if the origin is chosen at the center.

The symmetry group of a circle is . The orientation-preserving subgroup is isomorphic (as a &quot;real&quot; Lie group) to the circle group, also known as , the multiplicative group of the complex numbers of absolute value equal to one. This isomorphism sends the complex number of absolute value  to the special orthogonal matrix
: formula_8

In higher dimension, has a more complicated structure (in particular, it is no longer commutative). The topological structures of the -sphere and are strongly correlated, and this correlation is widely used for studying both topological spaces.

== Group structure ==
The groups and are real compact Lie groups of dimension . The group has two connected components, with being the identity component, that is, the connected component containing the identity matrix.

=== As algebraic groups ===
The orthogonal group can be identified with the group of the matrices such that . 
Since both members of this equation are symmetric matrices, this provides equations that the entries of an orthogonal matrix must satisfy, and which are not all satisfied by the entries of any non-orthogonal matrix.

This proves that is an algebraic set. Moreover, it can be proved that its dimension is
: formula_9 
which implies that is a complete intersection. This implies that all its irreducible components have the same dimension, and that it has no embedded component.
In fact, has two irreducible components, that are distinguished by the sign of the determinant (that is or ). Both are nonsingular algebraic varieties of the same dimension . The component with is .

=== Maximal tori and Weyl groups===
A maximal torus in a compact Lie group &quot;G&quot; is a maximal subgroup among those that are isomorphic to for some , where is the standard one-dimensional torus.

In and , for every maximal torus, there is a basis on which the torus consists of the block-diagonal matrices of the form 
: formula_10
where each belongs to . 
In and , the maximal tori have the same form, bordered by a row and a column of zeros, and on the diagonal.

The Weyl group of is the semidirect product formula_11 of a normal elementary abelian 2-subgroup and a symmetric group, where the nontrivial element of each factor of acts on the corresponding circle factor of } by inversion, and the symmetric group acts on both and } by permuting factors. The elements of the Weyl group are represented by matrices in .
The factor is represented by block permutation matrices with 2-by-2 blocks, and a final on the diagonal. The component is represented by block-diagonal matrices with 2-by-2 blocks either
: formula_12
with the last component chosen to make the determinant .

The Weyl group of is the subgroup formula_13 of that of , where is the kernel of the product homomorphism given by formula_14; that is, is the subgroup with an even number of minus signs. The Weyl group of is represented in by the preimages under the standard injection of the representatives for the Weyl group of . Those matrices with an odd number of formula_15 blocks have no remaining final coordinate to make their determinants positive, and hence cannot be represented in .

== Topology ==

=== Low-dimensional topology ===

The low-dimensional (real) orthogonal groups are familiar spaces:
* , a two-point discrete space
* is 
* is 
* is doubly covered by .

=== Fundamental group ===
In terms of algebraic topology, for the fundamental group of is cyclic of order 2, and the spin group is its universal cover. For the fundamental group is infinite cyclic and the universal cover corresponds to the real line (the group is the unique connected 2-fold cover).

=== Homotopy groups ===
Generally, the homotopy groups of the real orthogonal group are related to homotopy groups of spheres, and thus are in general hard to compute. However, one can compute the homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group (aka the infinite orthogonal group), defined as the direct limit of the sequence of inclusions:
: formula_16

Since the inclusions are all closed, hence cofibrations, this can also be interpreted as a union. On the other hand, is a homogeneous space for , and one has the following fiber bundle:
: formula_17
which can be understood as &quot;The orthogonal group acts transitively on the unit sphere , and the stabilizer of a point (thought of as a unit vector) is the orthogonal group of the perpendicular complement, which is an orthogonal group one dimension lower.&quot; Thus the natural inclusion is -connected, so the homotopy groups stabilize, and for : thus the homotopy groups of the stable space equal the lower homotopy groups of the unstable spaces.

From Bott periodicity we obtain , therefore the homotopy groups of are 8-fold periodic, meaning , and so one need list only the first 8 homotopy groups:
: formula_18

==== Relation to KO-theory ====
Via the clutching construction, homotopy groups of the stable space are identified with stable vector bundles on spheres (up to isomorphism), with a dimension shift of 1: . Setting (to make fit into the periodicity), one obtains:
: formula_19

==== Computation and interpretation of homotopy groups ====

===== Low-dimensional groups =====
The first few homotopy groups can be calculated by using the concrete descriptions of low-dimensional groups.
* , from orientation-preserving/reversing (this class survives to and hence stably)
* , which is spin comes from .
* , which surjects onto ; this latter thus vanishes.

===== Lie groups =====
From general facts about Lie groups, always vanishes, and is free (free abelian).

===== Vector bundles =====

 is a vector bundle over , which consists of two points. Thus over each point, the bundle is trivial, and the non-triviality of the bundle is the difference between the dimensions of the vector spaces over the two points, so is the dimension.

===== Loop spaces =====
Using concrete descriptions of the loop spaces in Bott periodicity, one can interpret the higher homotopies of in terms of simpler-to-analyze homotopies of lower order. Using π0, and have two components, and have countably many components, and the rest are connected.

==== Interpretation of homotopy groups ====
In a nutshell:
* is about dimension
* is about orientation
* is about spin
* is about topological quantum field theory.

Let be any of the four division algebras , , , , and let be the tautological line bundle over the projective line , and its class in K-theory. Noting that , , , , these yield vector bundles over the corresponding spheres, and
* is generated by 
* is generated by 
* is generated by 
* is generated by 

From the point of view of symplectic geometry, can be interpreted as the Maslov index, thinking of it as the fundamental group of the stable Lagrangian Grassmannian as , so .

==== Whitehead tower ====
The orthogonal group anchors a Whitehead tower:
: formula_20
which is obtained by successively removing (killing) homotopy groups of increasing order. This is done by constructing short exact sequences starting with an Eilenberg–MacLane space for the homotopy group to be removed. The first few entries in the tower are the spin group and the string group, and are preceded by the fivebrane group. The homotopy groups that are killed are in turn 0(&quot;O&quot;) to obtain &quot;SO&quot; from &quot;O&quot;, 1(&quot;O&quot;) to obtain &quot;Spin&quot; from &quot;SO&quot;, 3(&quot;O&quot;) to obtain &quot;String&quot; from &quot;Spin&quot;, and then 7(&quot;O&quot;) and so on to obtain the higher order branes.

== Of indefinite quadratic form over the reals==
Over the real numbers, nondegenerate quadratic forms are classified by Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, which asserts that, on a vector space of dimension , such a form can be written as the difference of a sum of squares and a sum of squares, with . In other words, there is a basis on which the matrix of the quadratic form is a diagonal matrix, with entries equal to , and entries equal to . The pair called the &quot;inertia&quot;, is an invariant of the quadratic form, in the sense that it does not depend on the way of computing the diagonal matrix.

The orthogonal group of a quadratic form depends only on the inertia, and is thus generally denoted . Moreover, as a quadratic form and its opposite have the same orthogonal group, one has .

The standard orthogonal group is . So, in the remainder of this section, it is supposed that neither nor is zero.

The subgroup of the matrices of determinant 1 in is denoted . The group has four connected components, depending on whether an element preserves orientation on either of the two maximal subspaces where the quadratic form is positive definite or negative definite. The component of the identity, whose elements preserve orientation on both subspaces, is denoted .

The group is the Lorentz group that is fundamental in relativity theory. Here the corresponds to space coordinates, and corresponds to the time coordinate.

== Of complex quadratic forms ==
Over the field of complex numbers, every non-degenerate quadratic form in variables is equivalent to . Thus, up to isomorphism, there is only one non-degenerate complex quadratic space of dimension , and one associated orthogonal group, usually denoted . It is the group of &quot;complex orthogonal matrices&quot;, complex matrices whose product with their transpose is the identity matrix.

As in the real case, has two connected components. The component of the identity consists of all matrices of determinant in ; it is denoted .

The groups and are complex Lie groups of dimension over (the dimension over is twice that). For , these groups are noncompact.
As in the real case, is not simply connected: For , the fundamental group of is cyclic of order 2, whereas the fundamental group of is .

== Over finite fields ==
=== Characteristic different from two ===
Over a field of characteristic different from two, two quadratic forms are &quot;equivalent&quot; if their matrices are congruent, that is if a change of basis transforms the matrix of the first form into the matrix of the second form. Two equivalent quadratic forms have clearly the same orthogonal group.

The non-degenerate quadratic forms over a finite field of characteristic different from two are completely classified into congruence classes, and it results from this classification that there is only one orthogonal group in odd dimension and two in even dimension.

More precisely, Witt&#x27;s decomposition theorem asserts that (in characteristic different from two) every vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form can be decomposed as a direct sum of pairwise orthogonal subspaces
: formula_21
where each is a hyperbolic plane (that is there is a basis such that the matrix of the restriction of to has the form formula_22), and the restriction of to is anisotropic (that is, for every nonzero in ).

The Chevalley–Warning theorem asserts that, over a finite field, the dimension of is at most two.

If the dimension of is odd, the dimension of is thus equal to one, and its matrix is congruent either to formula_23 or to formula_24 where is a non-square scalar. It results that there is only one orthogonal group that is denoted , where is the number of elements of the finite field (a power of an odd prime).

If the dimension of is two and is not a square in the ground field (that is, if its number of elements is congruent to 3 modulo 4), the matrix of the restriction of to is congruent to either or , where is the 2×2 identity matrix. If the dimension of is two and is a square in the ground field (that is, if is congruent to 1, modulo 4) the matrix of the restriction of to is congruent to formula_25 is any non-square scalar.

This implies that if the dimension of is even, there are only two orthogonal groups, depending whether the dimension of zero or two. They are denoted respectively and .

The orthogonal group is a dihedral group of order , where .
2&lt;/math&gt; and formula_26

In the real case, the corresponding isomorphisms are:
: formula_27
where is the circle of the complex numbers of norm one;
: formula_28
with formula_29 and formula_30

When the characteristic is not two, the order of the orthogonal groups are
: formula_31
: formula_32
: formula_33
In characteristic two, the formulas are the same, except that the factor of must be removed.

=== Dickson invariant ===
For orthogonal groups, the Dickson invariant is a homomorphism from the orthogonal group to the quotient group (integers modulo 2), taking the value in case the element is the product of an even number of reflections, and the value of 1 otherwise.

Algebraically, the Dickson invariant can be defined as , where is the identity . Over fields that are not of characteristic 2 it is equivalent to the determinant: the determinant is to the power of the Dickson invariant.
Over fields of characteristic 2, the determinant is always 1, so the Dickson invariant gives more information than the determinant.

The special orthogonal group is the kernel of the Dickson invariant and usually has index 2 in . When the characteristic of is not 2, the Dickson Invariant is whenever the determinant is . Thus when the characteristic is not 2, is commonly defined to be the elements of with determinant . Each element in has determinant . Thus in characteristic 2, the determinant is always .

The Dickson invariant can also be defined for Clifford groups and pin groups in a similar way (in all dimensions).

=== Orthogonal groups of characteristic 2 ===
Over fields of characteristic 2 orthogonal groups often exhibit special behaviors, some of which are listed in this section. (Formerly these groups were known as the hypoabelian groups, but this term is no longer used.)
* Any orthogonal group over any field is generated by reflections, except for a unique example where the vector space is 4-dimensional over the field with 2 elements and the Witt index is 2. A reflection in characteristic two has a slightly different definition. In characteristic two, the reflection orthogonal to a vector takes a vector to where is the bilinear form and is the quadratic form associated to the orthogonal geometry. Compare this to the Householder reflection of odd characteristic or characteristic zero, which takes to .
* The center of the orthogonal group usually has order 1 in characteristic 2, rather than 2, since .
* In odd dimensions in characteristic 2, orthogonal groups over perfect fields are the same as symplectic groups in dimension . In fact the symmetric form is alternating in characteristic 2, and as the dimension is odd it must have a kernel of dimension 1, and the quotient by this kernel is a symplectic space of dimension , acted upon by the orthogonal group.
* In even dimensions in characteristic 2 the orthogonal group is a subgroup of the symplectic group, because the symmetric bilinear form of the quadratic form is also an alternating form.

== The spinor norm ==
The spinor norm is a homomorphism from an orthogonal group over a field to the quotient group (the multiplicative group of the field up to multiplication by square elements), that takes reflection in a vector of norm to the image of in .

For the usual orthogonal group over the reals, it is trivial, but it is often non-trivial over other fields, or for the orthogonal group of a quadratic form over the reals that is not positive definite.

== Galois cohomology and orthogonal groups ==
In the theory of Galois cohomology of algebraic groups, some further points of view are introduced. They have explanatory value, in particular in relation with the theory of quadratic forms; but were for the most part &quot;post hoc&quot;, as far as the discovery of the phenomenon is concerned. The first point is that quadratic forms over a field can be identified as a Galois , or twisted forms (torsors) of an orthogonal group. As an algebraic group, an orthogonal group is in general neither connected nor simply-connected; the latter point brings in the spin phenomena, while the former is related to the determinant.

The &#x27;spin&#x27; name of the spinor norm can be explained by a connection to the spin group (more accurately a pin group). This may now be explained quickly by Galois cohomology (which however postdates the introduction of the term by more direct use of Clifford algebras). The spin covering of the orthogonal group provides a short exact sequence of algebraic groups.
: formula_34

Here is the algebraic group of square roots of 1; over a field of characteristic not 2 it is roughly the same as a two-element group with trivial Galois action. The connecting homomorphism from , which is simply the group of -valued points, to is essentially the spinor norm, because is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the field modulo squares.

There is also the connecting homomorphism from of the orthogonal group, to the of the kernel of the spin covering. The cohomology is non-abelian so that this is as far as we can go, at least with the conventional definitions.

== Lie algebra ==

The Lie algebra corresponding to Lie groups and consists of the skew-symmetric matrices, with the Lie bracket given by the commutator. One Lie algebra corresponds to both groups. It is often denoted by formula_35 or formula_36, and called the orthogonal Lie algebra or special orthogonal Lie algebra. Over real numbers, these Lie algebras for different are the compact real forms of two of the four families of semisimple Lie algebras: in odd dimension , where , while in even dimension , where .

Since the group is not simply connected, the representation theory of the orthogonal Lie algebras includes both representations corresponding to &quot;ordinary&quot; representations of the orthogonal groups, and representations corresponding to &quot;projective&quot; representations of the orthogonal groups. (The projective representations of are just linear representations of the universal cover, the spin group Spin(&quot;n&quot;).) The latter are the so-called spin representation, which are important in physics.

More generally, given a vector space (over a field with characteristic not equal to 2) with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form , the special orthogonal Lie algebra consists of tracefree endomorphisms formula_37 which are skew-symmetric for this form (formula_38). Over a field of characteristic 2 we consider instead the alternating endomorphisms. Concretely we can equate these with the alternating tensors . The correspondence is given by:
: formula_39

This description applies equally for the indefinite special orthogonal Lie algebras formula_40 for symmetric bilinear forms with signature .

Over real numbers, this characterization is used in interpreting the curl of a vector field (naturally a 2-vector) as an infinitesimal rotation or &quot;curl&quot;, hence the name.

== Related groups ==
The orthogonal groups and special orthogonal groups have a number of important subgroups, supergroups, quotient groups, and covering groups. These are listed below.

The inclusions and are part of a sequence of 8 inclusions used in a geometric proof of the Bott periodicity theorem, and the corresponding quotient spaces are symmetric spaces of independent interest – for example, is the Lagrangian Grassmannian.

=== Lie subgroups ===
In physics, particularly in the areas of Kaluza–Klein compactification, it is important to find out the subgroups of the orthogonal group. The main ones are:
: formula_41 – preserve an axis
: formula_42 – are those that preserve a compatible complex structure &quot;or&quot; a compatible symplectic structure – see 2-out-of-3 property; also preserves a complex orientation.
: formula_43
: formula_44

=== Lie supergroups ===
The orthogonal group is also an important subgroup of various Lie groups:
: formula_45

==== Conformal group ====
Being isometries, real orthogonal transforms preserve angles, and are thus conformal maps, though not all conformal linear transforms are orthogonal. In classical terms this is the difference between congruence and similarity, as exemplified by SSS (side-side-side) congruence of triangles and AAA (angle-angle-angle) similarity of triangles. The group of conformal linear maps of is denoted for the conformal orthogonal group, and consists of the product of the orthogonal group with the group of dilations. If is odd, these two subgroups do not intersect, and they are a direct product: , where } is the real multiplicative group, while if is even, these subgroups intersect in , so this is not a direct product, but it is a direct product with the subgroup of dilation by a positive scalar: .

Similarly one can define ; this is always: .

=== Discrete subgroups ===
As the orthogonal group is compact, discrete subgroups are equivalent to finite subgroups. These subgroups are known as point groups and can be realized as the symmetry groups of polytopes. A very important class of examples are the finite Coxeter groups, which include the symmetry groups of regular polytopes.

Dimension 3 is particularly studied – see point groups in three dimensions, polyhedral groups, and list of spherical symmetry groups. In 2 dimensions, the finite groups are either cyclic or dihedral – see point groups in two dimensions.

Other finite subgroups include:
* Permutation matrices (the Coxeter group )
* Signed permutation matrices (the Coxeter group ); also equals the intersection of the orthogonal group with the integer matrices.

=== Covering and quotient groups ===
The orthogonal group is neither simply connected nor centerless, and thus has both a covering group and a quotient group, respectively:
* Two covering Pin groups, and ,
* The quotient projective orthogonal group, .
These are all 2-to-1 covers.

For the special orthogonal group, the corresponding groups are:
* Spin group, ,
* Projective special orthogonal group, .
Spin is a 2-to-1 cover, while in even dimension, is a 2-to-1 cover, and in odd dimension is a 1-to-1 cover; i.e., isomorphic to . These groups, , , and are Lie group forms of the compact special orthogonal Lie algebra, formula_46 – is the simply connected form, while is the centerless form, and is in general neither.

In dimension 3 and above these are the covers and quotients, while dimension 2 and below are somewhat degenerate; see specific articles for details.

== Principal homogeneous space: Stiefel manifold ==

The principal homogeneous space for the orthogonal group is the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal bases (orthonormal -frames).

In other words, the space of orthonormal bases is like the orthogonal group, but without a choice of base point: given an orthogonal space, there is no natural choice of orthonormal basis, but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the orthogonal group. Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an orthogonal map can take any &quot;orthogonal&quot; basis to any other &quot;orthogonal&quot; basis.

The other Stiefel manifolds for of &quot;incomplete&quot; orthonormal bases (orthonormal -frames) are still homogeneous spaces for the orthogonal group, but not &quot;principal&quot; homogeneous spaces: any -frame can be taken to any other -frame by an orthogonal map, but this map is not uniquely determined.

<doc id="173957" wikidata="Q741759" url="?curid=173957" title="Pete Fountain">
<text>Pierre Dewey LaFontaine Jr. (July 3, 1930 – August 6, 2016), known professionally as Pete Fountain, was an American jazz clarinetist.

==Early life and education==
LaFontaine was born to Pierre, Sr. and Madeline, in a small Creole cottage-style frame house on White Street (between Dumaine Street and St. Ann Street) in New Orleans. Pete was the great-grandson of a French immigrant, François Fontaine, who was born in Toulon, circa 1796, and came to the U.S. in the early 19th century, and died on the Mississippi Gulf Coast circa 1885. Pete&#x27;s father, a truck driver and part-time musician, changed the family name to Fountain.

He started playing clarinet as a child at the McDonogh 28 school located on Esplanade Avenue. As a child, young Pete was very sickly, frequently battling respiratory infections due to weakened lungs. He was given expensive medication but it proved ineffective. During a pharmacy visit, Pete&#x27;s father began a discussion with a neighborhood doctor who was also there shopping and talked with him about his son&#x27;s condition. The doctor agreed to see the boy the following day. After a short exam, the doctor confirmed the weak lung condition and advised the father to try an unorthodox treatment: purchase the child a musical instrument, anything he has to blow into. The same day, they went to a local music store and, given his choice of instruments, Pete chose the clarinet (after first wanting the drums, which his father declined per the doctor&#x27;s orders). At first, Pete was unable to produce a sound from the instrument, but he continued to practice and eventually not only made sounds and eventually music, but greatly improved the health of his lungs.

He took private lessons but also learned to play jazz by playing along with phonograph records of first Benny Goodman and then Irving Fazola. By the time he reached his teens, he was playing regular gigs in the nightclubs on Bourbon Street. According to Fountain:
:When I was a high school senior, my history teacher asked me why I didn’t study more... I answered that I was too busy playing clarinet every night, and when I told him I was making scale — about $125 a week — he said that was more than he made and I should play full time. I guess I was a professional from that point on.

One of Fountain&#x27;s early engagements were with the bands of Monk Hazel. Fountain founded the Basin Street Six in 1950 with his longtime friend, trumpeter George Girard. In 1954, after the Basin Street Six folded, Fountain briefly went to Chicago to play with the Dukes of Dixieland, then returned to New Orleans and teamed up with Al Hirt to lead a band, playing an extended residence at Dan Levy’s Pier 600.

==Lawrence Welk orchestra==

A talent scout for Lawrence Welk, who saw Fountain performing at the Pier 600, brought him to the attention of Larry Welk, son of television bandleader Lawrence Welk. Persistent persuasion from the son led the senior Welk to invite Fountain to join the Lawrence Welk orchestra in Los Angeles, where he relocated and lived for two years. Fountain became well known for his many solos on Welk&#x27;s ABC television show, &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. He was rumored to have quit when Welk refused to let him &quot;jazz up&quot; a Christmas carol on the 1958 Christmas show. Other accounts, including one in Fountain&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Closer Walk With Pete Fountain,&quot; indicate he in fact played a jazzy rendition of &quot;Silver Bells&quot; on the show which upset Welk, leading to Fountain&#x27;s departure in early 1959. In an interview, Fountain said he left &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; because &quot;champagne and bourbon don&#x27;t mix.&quot; Fountain was hired by Decca Records A&amp;R head Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Dant and went on to produce 42 hit albums with Dant. After Welk&#x27;s death, Fountain occasionally joined with the Welk musical family for reunion shows.

==Return to New Orleans==

Fountain returned to New Orleans, played with the Dukes of Dixieland, then began leading bands under his own name. He owned his own club in the French Quarter in the 1960s and 1970s. He later acquired &quot;Pete Fountain&#x27;s Jazz Club&quot; at the Riverside Hilton in downtown New Orleans.

The New Orleans Jazz Club presented &quot;Pete Fountain Day&quot; on October 19, 1959, with celebrations honoring the pride of their city, concluding with a packed concert that evening. His Quintett was made up of his studio recording musicians, Stan Kenton&#x27;s bassist Don Bagley, vibeist Godfrey Hirsch, pianist Merle Koch, and the double bass drummer Jack Sperling. Fountain brought these same players together in 1963 when they played the Hollywood Bowl. Pete would make the trek to Hollywood many times, appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; 56 times.

Fountain opened his club, the French Quarter Inn, located in the heart of the famed French Quarter district, at 800 Bourbon Street, in the spring of 1960. His group members were Oliver &quot;Stick&quot; Felix on bass, John Probst on piano, Paul Guma on guitar, Godfrey Hirsch on vibes, and Jack Sperling on drums. In no time at all, major entertainers found their way there. Cliff Arquette, popularly known as Charley Weaver, and Jonathan Winters were there on opening night and performed their comedy routines. Over the next few years Frank Sinatra, Phil Harris, Carol Lawrence and Robert Goulet, Keely Smith, Robert Mitchum, and Brenda Lee, among many others, came to the club. Many would perform with the band, and Brenda Lee&#x27;s sit-in resulted in a duet record album recorded by her and Pete. Benny Goodman came to the club twice, but without bringing his clarinet.

His greatest friendly rivalry was with trumpeter Al Hirt, whose club was down the street from Fountain&#x27;s. They stole musicians from each other, and sometimes came into each other&#x27;s clubs and played together. They were good friends who came up together and later recorded several albums together.

In 2003, Fountain closed his club at the Hilton with a performance before a packed house filled with musical friends and fans. He began performing two nights a week at Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where he also had a home (later destroyed by Hurricane Katrina).

After heart surgery in 2006, he performed at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and helped reopen the Bay St. Louis casino. It has since been renamed the Hollywood Casino. He performed his last show at Hollywood Casino on December 8, 2010, before returning to help reopen the resort in 2014, by which point he was mostly retired.

==Half-Fast Walking Club==
Fountain was a founder and the most prominent member of the Half-Fast Walking Club, one of the best known freelance marching units that parade in New Orleans on Mardi Gras Day. The original name was &quot;The Half-Assed Walking Club,&quot; and it was an excuse to take a &quot;lubricated&quot; musical stroll down the parade route. Pete changed the name under pressure exerted by the parade organizers. On Mardi Gras Day 2007, Pete again joined his Half-Fast Walking Club, having missed the event in 2006 due to illness.

==Musical style==
Fountain&#x27;s clarinet work was noted for his sweet fluid tone. He recorded over 100 LPs and CDs under his own name, some in the Dixieland style, many others essentially instrumental pop records with only peripheral relevance to any type of jazz. Nonetheless, in 1997 critic Doug Ramsey of &quot;Jazz Times&quot; magazine included Fountain on a list of underrated musicians, writing: &quot;His ear for harmony and mastery of time are among the best-kept secrets in jazz because all these years he has chosen to stick with the repertoire and sidemen that make him comfortable.&quot; 

The distinctive Fountain sound — more woody than most — came from the crystal mouthpieces he played with since 1949 rather than the more common rubber mouthpieces. His first crystal mouthpiece was actually Irving Fazola&#x27;s, given to Pete by Fazola&#x27;s mother after Faz&#x27;s death, because she had heard him play and noted how he played like her son. That mouthpiece was shattered on the bandstand one night when Pete had played his solo and was standing by as trumpeter George Girard played his [own solo], and Girard brought his trumpet down suddenly on top of the mouthpiece. Pete kept the shattered mouthpiece, and played other crystal mouthpieces from then on.

Fountain led the &quot;Pete Fountain Quintett&quot;, a New Orleans French Quarter jazz band of Fountain and his Creole-style music. The &quot;Quintett&quot; had many musicians over the years, but primarily recorded with Jack Sperling on drums, bassists Don Bagley or Morty Corb, vibraphonist Godfrey Hirch, and pianists Merle Koch or Stan Wrightsman.

==Personal life==
Fountain married Beverly Lang on October 27, 1951; they remained married for sixty-five years until his death. They have two sons and a daughter: Kevin, Jeffrey, and Dahra. Dahra&#x27;s husband, Benny Harrell, was Fountain&#x27;s manager in his later years.

Fountain died of heart failure in his home town on August 6, 2016, at the age of eighty-six. He had suffered from heart problems and was in hospice care when he died.

==Awards and honors==
*2006, Loyola University New Orleans awarded Fountain an honorary degree.
*On March 18, 2007, Pete Fountain was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.
*On April 5, 2008, Fountain was inducted into the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame in Ferriday, Louisiana.

<text>In physics, the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space (sometimes referred to as the barycenter or balance point) is the unique point at any given time where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero. For a rigid body containing its center of mass, this is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a linear acceleration without an angular acceleration. Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where the entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.l

In the case of a single rigid body, the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the centroid. The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for or open-shaped objects, such as a horseshoe. In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the planets of the Solar System, the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.

The center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in mechanics that involve masses distributed in space, such as the linear and angular momentum of planetary bodies and rigid body dynamics. In orbital mechanics, the equations of motion of planets are formulated as point masses located at the centers of mass (see Barycenter (astronomy) for details). The center of mass frame is an inertial frame in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.

==History==
The concept of center of gravity or weight was studied extensively by the ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point—their center of mass. In his work &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;, Archimedes demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.

Other ancient mathematicians who contributed to the theory of the center of mass include Hero of Alexandria and Pappus of Alexandria. In the Renaissance and Early Modern periods, work by Guido Ubaldi, Francesco Maurolico, Federico Commandino, Evangelista Torricelli, Simon Stevin, Luca Valerio, Jean-Charles de la Faille, Paul Guldin, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, Louis Carré, Pierre Varignon, and Alexis Clairaut expanded the concept further.

Newton&#x27;s second law is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in Euler&#x27;s first law.

==Definition==

The center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space.

===A system of particles===
In the case of a system of particles , each with mass that are located in space with coordinates , the coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy 
formula_1

Solving this equation for R yields the formula
formula_2

===A continuous volume===
If the mass distribution is continuous with the density ρ(r) within a solid &quot;Q&quot;, then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass R over the volume V is zero, that is
formula_3

Solve this equation for the coordinates R to obtain
formula_4
where M is the total mass in the volume.

If a continuous mass distribution has uniform density, which means that &quot;ρ&quot; is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the centroid of the volume.

===Barycentric coordinates===

The coordinates R of the center of mass of a two-particle system, &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2, with masses &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 is given by
formula_5

The process can be repeated for all dimensions of the system to determine the complete center of mass. The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the &quot;best&quot; center of mass is, instead of guessing or using cluster analysis to &quot;unfold&quot; a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. If both average values are zero, formula_6, then formula_7 is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their &quot;x&quot; coordinates are mathematically identical in a periodic system.

==Center of gravity==


A body&#x27;s center of gravity is the point around which the resultant torque due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same. However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to and further-from the planet (stronger and weaker gravity respectively) can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical. In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center. Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque.

The mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field. In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.

In the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration. Referring to the mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.

In physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the resultant of the gravity forces on a continuous body. Consider a body &quot;Q&quot; of volume &quot;V&quot; with density &quot;ρ&quot;(r) at each point r in the volume. In a parallel gravity field the force f at each point r is given by,
formula_8
where &quot;dm&quot; is the mass at the point r, &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration of gravity, and formula_9 is a unit vector defining the vertical direction.

Choose a reference point R in the volume and compute the resultant force and torque at this point,
formula_10
and
formula_11

If the reference point R is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then
formula_12
which means the resultant torque . Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass.

By selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.

==Linear and angular momentum==
The linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass. Let the system of particles &quot;Pi&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; of masses &quot;mi&quot; be located at the coordinates r&quot;i&quot; with velocities v&quot;i&quot;. Select a reference point R and compute the relative position and velocity vectors,
formula_13

The total linear momentum and angular momentum of the system are
formula_14
and
formula_15

If R is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to
formula_16
where &quot;m&quot; is the total mass of all the particles, p is the linear momentum, and L is the angular momentum.

The law of conservation of momentum predicts that for any system not subjected to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means the center of mass will move with constant velocity. This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on. More formally, this is true for any internal forces that cancel in accordance with Newton&#x27;s Third Law.

==Determination==
The experimental determination of a body&#x27;s center of mass makes use of gravity forces on the body and is based on the fact that the center of mass is the same as the center of gravity in the parallel gravity field near the earth&#x27;s surface.

The center of mass of a body with an axis of symmetry and constant density must lie on this axis. Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder. In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere. In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry.

===In two dimensions===
An experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop plumb lines from the suspension points. The intersection of the two lines is the center of mass.

The shape of an object might already be mathematically determined, but it may be too complex to use a known formula. In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers. This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.

A direct development of the planimeter known as an integraph, or integerometer, can be used to establish the position of the centroid or center of mass of an irregular two-dimensional shape. This method can be applied to a shape with an irregular, smooth or complex boundary where other methods are too difficult. It was regularly used by ship builders to compare with the required displacement and center of buoyancy of a ship, and ensure it would not capsize.

===In three dimensions===
An experimental method to locate the three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass begins by supporting the object at three points and measuring the forces, F1, F2, and F3 that resist the weight of the object, formula_17 (formula_18 is the unit vector in the vertical direction). Let r1, r2, and r3 be the position coordinates of the support points, then the coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy the condition that the resultant torque is zero,
formula_19
or
formula_20

This equation yields the coordinates of the center of mass R* in the horizontal plane as,
formula_21

The center of mass lies on the vertical line L, given by
formula_22

The three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass are determined by performing this experiment twice with the object positioned so that these forces are measured for two different horizontal planes through the object. The center of mass will be the intersection of the two lines L1 and L2 obtained from the two experiments.

== Applications ==

=== Engineering designs ===

==== Automotive applications ====

Engineers try to design a sports car so that its center of mass is lowered to make the car handle better, which is to say, maintain traction while executing relatively sharp turns.

The characteristic low profile of the U.S. military Humvee was designed in part to allow it to tilt farther than taller vehicles without rolling over, by ensuring its low center of mass stays over the space bounded by the four wheels even at angles far from the horizontal.

==== Aeronautics ====
The center of mass is an important point on an aircraft, which significantly affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the center of mass must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly to the point of being unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly unstable enough so as to be impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition.

For helicopters in hover, the center of mass is always directly below the rotorhead. In forward flight, the center of mass will move forward to balance the negative pitch torque produced by applying cyclic control to propel the helicopter forward; consequently a cruising helicopter flies &quot;nose-down&quot; in level flight.

=== Astronomy ===
The center of mass plays an important role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the &quot;barycenter&quot;. The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body. For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710 km (1,062 miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto and Charon, the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.

=== Rigging and safety ===
Knowing the location of the center of gravity when rigging is crucial, possibly resulting in severe injury or death if assumed incorrectly. A center of gravity that is at or above the lift point will most likely result in a tip-over incident. In general, the further the center of gravity below the pick point, the safer the lift. There are other things to consider, such as shifting loads, strength of the load and mass, distance between pick points, and number of pick points. Specifically, when selecting lift points, it is very important to place the center of gravity at the center and well below the lift points.

=== Body motion ===
The center of mass of the adult human body vertically is 10 cm above the trochanter (the femur joins the hip), with it in horizontally being located 1.4 cm forward of the knee, and 1.0 behind the trochanter. In kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter that assists people in understanding their human locomotion. Typically, a human&#x27;s center of mass is detected with one of two methods: the reaction board method is a static analysis that involves the person lying down on that instrument, and use of their static equilibrium equation to find their center of mass; the segmentation method relies on a mathematical solution based on the physical principle that the summation of the torques of individual body sections, relative to a specified axis, must equal the torque of the whole system that constitutes the body, measured relative to the same axis.

=== Optimization ===
The Center-of-gravity method is a method for convex optimization, which uses the center-of-gravity of the feasible region.
