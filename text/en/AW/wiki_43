<text>Vermicompost (vermi-compost) is the product of the decomposition process using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. This process is called vermicomposting, with the rearing of worms for this purpose is called vermiculture.

Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm [[humus]], worm poop, worm [[manure]], or worm faeces) is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by earthworms. These excreta have been shown to contain reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials before vermicomposting.

Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients which may be extracted as vermiwash and is an excellent, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner. It is used in gardening and sustainable, organic farming.

Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage. A variation of the process is vermifiltration (or vermidigestion) which is used to remove organic matter, pathogens, and oxygen demand from wastewater or directly from blackwater of flush toilets.

==Overview==
Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. In manure composing, the use of vermicomposting generates products that have lower salinity levels, as well as a more neutral pH.

The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (&quot;Eisenia fetida&quot; or &quot;Eisenia andrei&quot;), though European nightcrawlers (&quot;Eisenia hortensis&quot;, synonym &quot;Dendrobaena veneta&quot;) and red earthworm (&quot;Lumbricus rubellus&quot;) could also be used. Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including &quot;dendrobaenas&quot;, &quot;dendras&quot;, Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.

Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb. Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms&#x27; digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a &quot;living&quot; soil environment for plants. The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the drilosphere.

Vermicomposting is a common practice in permaculture.

Vermiwash can also be obtained from the liquid potion of vermicompost. Vermiwash is found to contain enzyme cocktail of proteases, amylases, urease and phosphatase. Microbiological study of vermiwash reveals that it contains nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Azotobactrer sp., Agrobacterium sp. and Rhizobium sp. and some phosphate solublizing bacteria. Laboratory scale trial shows effectiveness of vermiwash on plant growth.

==Design considerations==
===Suitable worm species===
All worms make compost but some species are not suitable for this purpose. Vermicompost worms are generally epigean. Species most often used for composting include:

* &quot;Eisenia fetida&quot; (Europe), the red wiggler or tiger worm. Closely related to &quot;Eisenia andrei&quot;, which is also usable.
* &quot;Eisenia hortensis&quot; (Europe), European nightcrawlers, prefers high C:N material.
* &quot;Eudrilus eugeniae&quot; (West Africa), African Nightcrawlers. Useful in the tropics.
* &quot;Perionyx excavatus&quot; (South and East Asia), blueworms. May be used in the tropics and subtropics.
* &quot;Lampito mauritii&quot; (Southern Asia), used locally.

These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure piles. As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to live on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin. Some species are considered invasive in some areas, so they should be avoided (see earthworms as invasive species for a list).

Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or angling shops where they are sold as bait. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.

The following species are &quot;not&quot; recommended:
* &quot;Lumbricus rubellus&quot; and &quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; (Europe). The two closely related species are anecic: they like to burrow underground and come up for food. As a result, they adapt poorly to shallow compost bins and should be avoided. They are also invasive in North America.

===Large scale===
Large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create compost tea, or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.

There are two main methods of large-scale vermicomposting, windrow and raised bed. Some systems use a windrow, which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not, due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.

The windrow method and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.
The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of &quot;worm chow&quot; across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.

Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.

===Small scale===
For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, Styrofoam, or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.

Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release heavy metals into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material. Some cedars, yellow cedar, and redwood contain resinous oils that may harm worms, although western red cedar has excellent longevity in composting conditions. Hemlock is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins.

Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection. The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood. Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.

Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil amendments, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that bin composting requires.

Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler &quot;Eisenia fetida&quot;, are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as &quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system. Other soil species that contribute include insects, other worms and molds.

===Climate and temperature===
There may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate. It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high heat-retentive properties), as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost, heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.

The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (&quot;Eisenia fetida,&quot; &quot;Eisenia andrei,&quot; and &quot;Lumbricus rubellus&quot;) feed most rapidly at temperatures of . They can survive at . Temperatures above may harm them. This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like &quot;Perionyx excavatus&quot; are suitable for warmer climates. If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter.

==Feedstock==
There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract vermin. Green waste should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.

===Small-scale or home systems===
Such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste, using &quot;earthworms and other microorganisms to digest organic wastes, such as kitchen scraps&quot;.
This includes:
* All fruits and vegetables (including citrus, in limited quantities)
* Vegetable and fruit peels and ends
* Coffee grounds and filters
* Tea bags (even those with high tannin levels)
* Grains such as bread, cracker and cereal (including moldy and stale)
* Eggshells (rinsed off)
* Leaves and grass clippings (not sprayed with pesticides)
* Newspapers (most inks used in newspapers are not toxic)
* Paper toweling (which has not been used with cleaners or chemicals)

===Large-scale or commercial===
Such vermicomposting systems need reliable sources of large quantities of food.
Systems presently operating use:
* Dairy cow or pig manure 
*Sewage sludge
* Brewery waste
* Cotton mill waste
* Agricultural waste
* Food processing and grocery waste
* Cafeteria waste
* Grass clippings and wood chips

==Harvesting==
Factors affecting the speed of composting include the climate and the method of composting. There are signs to look for to determine whether compost is finished. The finished compost would have an ambient temperature, dark color, and be as moist as a damp sponge. Towards the end of the process, bacteria slow down the rate of metabolizing food or stop completely. There is the possibility of some solid organic matter still being present in the compost at this point, but it could stay in and continue decomposing for the next couple of years unless removed. The compost should be allowed to cure after finished to allow acids to be removed over time so it becomes more neutral, which could take up to three months and results in the compost being more consistent in size. Elevating the maturing compost off the ground can prevent unwanted plant growth. It compost should consistently be slightly damp and should be aerated but does not need to be turned. The curing process can be done in a storage bin or on a tarp.

=== Methods ===
Vermicompost is ready for harvest when it contains few-to-no scraps of uneaten food or bedding. There are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems: &quot;dump and hand sort&quot;, &quot;let the worms do the sorting&quot;, &quot;alternate containers&quot; and &quot;divide and dump.&quot; These differ on the amount of time and labor involved and whether the vermicomposter wants to save as many worms as possible from being trapped in the harvested compost.

The pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermicomposting, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which the rest of the process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.

When harvesting the compost, it is possible to separate eggs and cocoons and return them to the bin, thereby ensuring new worms are hatched. Cocoons are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen with the naked eye. The cocoons can hold up to 20 worms (though 2–3 is most common). Cocoons can lay dormant for as long as two years if conditions are not conducive for hatching.

==Properties==
Vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many nutrients than compost produced by other composting methods. It has also outperformed a commercial plant medium with nutrients added, but levels of magnesium required adjustment, as did pH.

However, in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass, soil microbial activity, and yield of a species of ryegrass than municipal compost.

It is rich in microbial life which converts nutrients already present in the soil into plant-available forms.

Unlike other compost, worm castings also contain worm mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil.

Increases in the total nitrogen content in vermicompost, an increase in available nitrogen and phosphorus, a decrease in potassium, as well as the increased removal of heavy metals from sludge and soil have been reported. The reduction in the bioavailability of heavy metals has been observed in a number of studies.

==Benefits of vermicomposting==
Soil
* Improves soil aeration
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding enzymes such as phosphatase and cellulase)
* Microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests
* Attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil
* Improves water holding capacity

Plant growth
* Enhances germination, plant growth and crop yield
* It helps in root and plant growth
* Enriches soil organisms (adding plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellic acid)

Economic
* Biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to landfills
* Elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin (a common problem in communities practicing single-stream recycling)
* Creates low-skill jobs at local level
* Low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions

Environmental
* Helps to close the &quot;metabolic gap&quot; through recycling waste on-site
* Large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting, however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly
* Production reduces greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitric oxide (produced in landfills or incinerators when not composted).

==Uses==
=== Soil conditioner ===
Vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil, or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea.

The light brown waste liquid, or leachate, that drains into the bottom of some vermicomposting systems is not to be confused with worm tea. It is an uncomposted byproduct from when water-rich foods break down and may contain pathogens and toxins. It is best discarded or applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed for further processing.

The pH, nutrient, and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms. Pulverized limestone, or calcium carbonate can be added to the system to raise the pH.

==Operation and maintenance==
===Smells===
When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, it should have little smell—if any smell is present, it is earthy. The smell may also depend on the type of composted material added to the bin. An unhealthy worm bin may smell, potentially due to low oxygen conditions. Worms require gaseous oxygen. Oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of ammonia.

===Moisture===
Moisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70 and 90%, with a suggested content of 70–80% for vermicomposting operations. If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, mixing it in well.

===Pest species===
Pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors, usually from large amounts of kitchen waste, particularly meat. Eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests.

Predatory ants can be a problem in African countries.

In warm weather, fruit and vinegar flies breed in the bins if fruit and vegetable waste is not thoroughly covered with bedding. This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least of bedding. Maintaining the correct pH (close to neutral) and water content of the bin (just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops) can help avoid these pests as well.

===Worms escaping===
Worms generally stay in the bin, but may try to leave the bin when first introduced, or often after a rainstorm when the humidity outside is high. Maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem.

===Nutrient levels===
Commercial vermicomposters test and may amend their products to produce consistent quality and results. Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden.

In order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as nitrogen burn, vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with potting soil.

Additionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a &quot;time release&quot; effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once. This also reduces the risk of burning the plants, as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers.

==Application examples==

Vermicomposting is widely used in North America for on-site institutional processing of food scraps, such as in hospitals, universities, shopping malls, and correctional facilities. Vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling, such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls. It is selected either as a more environmentally friendly choice than conventional disposal, or to reduce the cost of commercial waste removal.

From 20 July 2020, the State Government of Chhattisgarh India started buying cow dung under the &quot;Godhan Nyay Yojana&quot; Scheme. Cow dung procured under this scheme will be utilised for the production of vermicompost fertilizer.

<text>The &quot;Gato&quot; class of submarines were built for the United States Navy and launched in 1941–1943. Named after the lead ship of the class, , they were the first mass-production U.S. submarine class of World War II.

The &quot;Gatos&quot;, along with the closely related and es that followed, accounted for most of the Navy&#x27;s World War II submarines; they destroyed much of the Japanese merchant marine and a large portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy. In some references, the &quot;Gato&quot;s are combined with their successors, especially the &quot;Balao&quot; class.

&quot;Gato&quot;″s name comes from a species of small catshark. Like most other U.S. Navy submarines of the period, ships of the &quot;Gato&quot; class were given the names of aquatic creatures.

==Design==

===&quot;AA-1&quot; class and V-boats===
The &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships were considered to be fleet submarines, designed to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet, based on standard-type battleships since World War I. They were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet&#x27;s composition, speed, and course, then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action, a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers. This was an operational concept born from experience in World War I. To operate effectively in this role, a submarine had to have high surface speed, long range and endurance, and heavy armament. Limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve. The U.S. Navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-World War I years, producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability, the (also known as the T class) and the V-boats, of which &quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-3&quot; were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine.

===&quot;Tambor&quot; and &quot;Gar&quot; class===
By 1931, the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the Navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the &quot;Gato&quot; class. By 1940, a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the &quot;Porpoise&quot;-, -, and ships resulted in the &quot;Tambor&quot; and &quot;Gar&quot; classes. Finally, the U.S. Navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine.

Timing, however, conspired against the actual use of these ships in their assigned role. The attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 destroyed the Pacific Fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle, as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development. It left the fleet submarine without a mission. Fortunately, the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the Japanese Empire.

Timing, however, also conspired to make the &quot;Gato&quot;s a mass-produced class of submarines. Six units were planned in FY41. In the immediate aftermath of the Two-Ocean Navy Act 48 additional units were ordered. By the end of 1941, 33 &quot;Gato&quot; keels had been laid.

===&quot;Gato&quot; class===
The &quot;Gato&quot;-class design, with a top range of 11,000 nautical miles (20,000 km), was a near-duplicate of the preceding &quot;Tambor&quot;- and &quot;Gar&quot;-class ships. The only significant differences were an increase in diving depth from to , and an extra five feet in length to allow the addition of a watertight bulkhead dividing the one large engine room in two, with two diesel generators in each room. The &quot;Gato&quot;s, along with nearly all of the U.S. Navy fleet-type submarines of World War II, were of partial double-hulled construction. The inner pressure-resisting hull was wrapped by an outer, hydrodynamic hull. The voids between the two hulls provided space for fuel and ballast tanks. The outer hull merged with the pressure hull at both ends in the area of the torpedo room bulkheads, hence the &quot;partial&quot; double hull. Operational experience with earlier ships led the naval architects and engineers at the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength. Without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel, they decided that the &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet, a increase in test depth over the preceding classes.

The &quot;Gato&quot;s were slow divers when compared to some German and British designs, but that was mostly because the &quot;Gato&quot;s were significantly larger ships. Sufficient fuel bunkerage to provide the range necessary for 75-day patrols from Hawaii to Japan and back could be obtained only with a larger ship, which would take longer to submerge than a smaller one. Acknowledging this limitation, the bureau designers incorporated a negative (sometimes called a &quot;down express&quot;) tank into the design, which was flooded to provide a large amount of negative buoyancy at the start of the dive. Based on later wartime experience, the tank was normally kept full or nearly full at the surface, then emptied to a certain mark after the ship was submerged to restore neutral buoyancy. At the start of the war, these ships could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45–50 seconds. The superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the ship was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the ship was submerged. When the dive began, the ship would &quot;hang&quot; for a few extra seconds while this superstructure filled with water. In an attempt to speed this process, additional limber, or free-flooding, holes were drilled and cut into the superstructure to allow it to flood faster. By midwar, these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30–35 seconds, very fast for such a large ship and acceptable to the ship&#x27;s crew.

The large size of these ships did negatively affect both surfaced and underwater maneuverability when compared to smaller submarines. No practical fix for this was available due to the limitations of the installed hydraulic systems used to move the rudder. Although a point of concern, the turning radius was still acceptable. After the war, a few fleet ships were fitted with an additional rudder topside at the very stern.

The class of ships had numerous crew comforts including showers, air conditioning, refrigerated storage for food, generous freshwater distilling units, clothes washers, and bunks for nearly every crew member; these were luxuries virtually unheard of in other navies. The bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60–80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the Pacific, these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew. They could be added without impact to the ship&#x27;s war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet ship. The air conditioning in particular had a very practical application, too, besides comfort. Should a submarine submerge for any length of time, the heat generated by the recently shut-down engines, electronic gear, and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above . High humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment, eventually causing electrical shorts and fires. Air conditioning, acting mostly as a dehumidifier, virtually eliminates this problem and greatly increases mechanical and electrical reliability. It proved to be a key factor in the success of these ships during World War II.

====Mine armament====
Like the previous Tambor/Gar classes, the Gato class could substitute mines in place of torpedoes. For the Mk 10 and Mk 12 type mines used in World War II, each torpedo could be replaced by as many as two mines, giving the submarine a true maximum capacity of 48 mines. However, doctrine was to retain at least four torpedoes on mine laying missions, which further limits the capacity to 40 mines, and this is often stated as the maximum in various publications. In practice during the war, submarines went out with at least 8 torpedoes, and the largest minefields laid were 32 mines. Post-war, the Mk 49 mine replaced the Mk 12, while the larger Mk 27 mine (in actuality an acoustic-homing torpedo) was also carried which only allowed one mine replacing one torpedo.

====Engine changes====

Twelve submarines of this class built by Electric Boat (SS-253 to SS-264) received what would be the final installations of the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) double-acting diesel engine. The Navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types. Unfortunately, the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler company ran into severe design and manufacturing problems, and these engines proved to be operational and maintenance nightmares. Frequent breakdowns and utter unreliability had destroyed these engines&#x27; reputation with the Navy and they were all removed at the first opportunity and replaced by General Motors Cleveland Model
16-278A V-type diesels. The other &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships received either the Fairbanks-Morse 38D 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the 
General Motors Cleveland Model 16-248 V-type as original installations. These engines were hardy, rugged, and well liked by the crews and served the ships quite well. Both the Fairbanks-Morse and General Motors engines were two-stroke cycle types.

Two manufacturers supplied electric motors for the &quot;Gato&quot; class. Elliott Company motors were fitted primarily to boats with Fairbanks-Morse engines. General Electric motors were fitted primarily to boats with General Motors engines, but some Fairbanks-Morse boats received General Electric motors.

====Fairwater changes====
At the beginning of the war, &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships, as well as the &quot;Gar&quot; and &quot;Tambor&quot; classes, had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines. Experience during the war led to the progressive reduction of this structure to reduce visibility and radar profile at the expense of underwater performance and foul-weather operating comfort. Most of the subs in postwar movies show the final result of these modifications. A side benefit of these modifications was the creation of convenient locations for antiaircraft guns.

==Boats in class==
Seventy-seven of these ships were commissioned from November 1941 () through April 1944 (). Twenty of the 52 U.S. submarines lost in World War II were of this class, plus , a damaged ship that returned to the U.S., but was considered a constructive total loss and not repaired.

Occasionally, some confusion arises as to the number of &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines built, with some sources listing the total as 73, due to the transitional nature of the first four ships (SS-361 through SS-364) constructed under the second contract by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. These were originally intended to be &quot;Balao&quot;-class subs and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the &quot;Balao&quot; class (SS-285 to SS-416, SS-425, and SS-426). Manitowoc was a designated follow-on yard to Electric Boat; they used construction blueprints and plans supplied by Electric Boat and used many of the same suppliers. The government-owned shipyards (Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Mare Island Naval Shipyard) began to make the transition to the new &quot;Balao&quot; design in the summer of 1942. Electric Boat, due to the huge backlog of &quot;Gato&quot;-class construction, was not ready to make the transition to the new design until January 1943. Manitowoc had already completed their allotted production run of &quot;Gato&quot;s and could not switch over to the &quot;Balao&quot; design until Electric Boat supplied them with the plans. Faced with a work stoppage while they waited for Electric Boat to catch up, managers at Manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats (SS-361 through SS-364) to Electric Boat&#x27;s &quot;Gato&quot;-class plans. Manitowoc&#x27;s first &quot;Balao&quot;-class ship was .

== History ==
=== World War II ===

The &quot;Gato&quot; boats were authorized in appropriations for Fiscal Year 1941, as part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s proclamation of &quot;limited emergency&quot; in September 1939. The first boat laid down was actually at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 11 September 1940. She was commissioned on 1 November 1941, and was the only &quot;Gato&quot;-class ship in commission when the war started. &quot;Gato&quot; herself was laid down on 5 October 1940 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, and commissioned 31 December 1941. Due to their large construction capacity, more than half (41) of the class was built at Electric Boat facilities; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production. In addition, the government purchased an old foundry downstream from the main yard, constructed 10 slipways, and turned the yard over to Electric Boat. Called the Victory Yard, it became an integral part of Electric Boat operations. A total of 77 &quot;Gato&quot;s were built at four different locations (Electric Boat, Manitowoc, Portsmouth, and Mare Island).

All of the &quot;Gato&quot;s (with one exception, ) would eventually fight in the Pacific Theater of Operations. However, in the summer of 1942, six new &quot;Gato&quot;s were assigned to Submarine Squadron 50 and sent to Rosneath, Scotland, to patrol the Bay of Biscay and to assist in the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. All in all, they conducted 27 war patrols, but could not claim any verified sinkings. Considered a waste of valuable resources, in mid-1943, all six ships were recalled and transferred to the Pacific.

Once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942, the &quot;Gato&quot;s were in the thick of the fight against the Japanese. Many of these ships racked up impressive war records: , , and were second, third, and fourth based on tonnage sunk by U.S. submarines. , &quot;Flasher&quot;, and were third, fourth, and seventh place on the list for the number of ships sunk. &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships sank four Japanese submarines: , , , and ; while only losing one in exchange, to .

Their principal weapon was the steam-powered Mark 14 torpedo in the early war years, with the electric Mark 18 torpedo supplementing the Mark 14 in late 1943. Due to a stunted research-and-development phase in the Depression-era 1930s, and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer, the Naval Torpedo Station Newport under the Bureau of Ordnance, the &quot;wonder weapon&quot; Mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable. They tended to run too deep, explode prematurely, run erratically, or fail to detonate. Bowing to pressure from the submariners in the Pacific, the bureau eventually acknowledged the problems in the Mark 14 and largely corrected them by late 1943. The Mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured German G7e torpedoes and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943. Unfortunately, it also was full of faults, the most dangerous being a tendency to run in a circular pattern and come back at the sub that fired it. Once perfected, both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons, allowing the &quot;Gato&quot;s and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of Japanese shipping by the end of the war.

The &quot;Gato&quot;s were subjected to numerous exterior configuration changes during their careers, with most of these changes centered on the conning tower fairwater. The large, bulky original configuration proved to be too easy to spot when the boat was surfaced; it needed to be smaller. Secondly, the desire to incorporate new masts for surface- and air-search radars drove changes to the fairwater and periscope shears. Third, additional gun armament was needed, and cutting down the fairwater provided excellent mounting locations for machine guns and antiaircraft cannon. The modifications (or mods) to the &quot;Gato&quot;-class conning tower fairwaters were fairly uniform in nature and they can be grouped together based on what was done when:
* Mod 1 – This is the original configuration with the covered navigation bridge, the high bulwark around the aft &quot;cigarette&quot; deck, and with the periscope shears plated over. All the early boats were built with this mod and it lasted until about mid-1942.
* Mod 2 – Same as mod 1, but with the bulwark around the cigarette deck cut down to reduce the silhouette. This also gave the .50 caliber machine gun mounted there a greatly improved arc of fire. Began to appear in about April 1942.
* Mod 3 – Same as mod 2, but with the covered navigation bridge on the forward part of the fairwater cut away and the plating around the periscope shears removed. In this configuration, the &quot;Gato&quot;s now had two excellent positions for the mounting of single 40 mm Bofors or twin 20 mm Oerlikon antiaircraft cannon, an improvement over the .50 caliber machine gun. This mod started to appear in late 1942 and early 1943.
* Mod 4 – Same as the mod 3, but with the height of the bridge itself lowered in a last attempt to lessen the silhouette. The lowering of the bridge exposed three I-beams on either side of the periscope shears. These exposed beams gave rise to the nickname &quot;covered wagon boats&quot;. Began to appear in early 1944.
Variations on the above mods included the 1A (shortened navigation bridge), 2A (plating removed from periscope shears), and the 3A and 4A (which moved the SJ radar mast aft of the periscopes). The conning tower fairwater of &quot;Flasher&quot; is preserved in Groton, Connecticut, in the mod 4A configuration, with two single 40 mm Bofors mounts.

Deck guns varied during the war. Many targets in the Pacific War were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo, so the deck gun was an important weapon. Most ships began the war with a /50 caliber Mk. 17 gun (although some ships received older Mk. 6 mounts due to shortages). The gun was the model originally specified for the &quot;Gato&quot; class, but war experience led to the removal of /50 caliber Mk. 9 guns from old S-class submarines to equip front-line ships. Beginning in late 1943, almost all were refitted with a /25 caliber Mk. 17 gun, and some ships had two of these weapons. Additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm Bofors and twin 20 mm Oerlikon mounts, usually one of each.

== Notable examples ==

* sank the . &quot;Taihō&quot; was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and at the time Japan&#x27;s newest carrier.
* , on her 12th patrol in July 1945, landed a small team from her crew on the shore of Patience Bay on Karafuto. They placed charges under a railroad track and blew up a passing train. &quot;Barb&quot; also conducted several rocket attacks against shore targets on this same patrol, the first ever by an American submarine. They used unguided rockets fired from a special launching rack on the main deck.
* sank the . &quot;Shōkaku&quot; was one of six Japanese carriers that had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* sank a ship carrying Japanese tank reinforcements that were en route to Iwo Jima.
* went to the rescue of a grounded Dutch submarine , taking its crew on board and destroying the submarine when it could not be removed from the reef, the only international submarine-to-submarine rescue in history.
* was the only U.S. submarine sunk by a Japanese submarine () during the Second World War.
* along with conducted an aggressive and successful attack against Japanese fleet units during the lead up to the U.S. invasion of Leyte Island in the Philippines in October 1944. The two boats sank the heavy cruisers and and severely damaged the heavy cruiser . A few hours later, while maneuvering back to the scene to finish off the crippled &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Darter&quot; ran hard aground on Bombay Shoal off Palawan. Her entire crew was rescued and subsequent attempts to destroy the wreck were only partially successful. As late as 1998, portions of &quot;Darter&quot;″s hulk were still visible on the reef.
* recovered downed pilot LTJG George H. W. Bush, future President of the United States, after his Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bomber was damaged and eventually ditched during a bombing mission at Chichi-jima in the Pacific.
* was the second-highest scoring U.S. ship of the war, with 100,231 tons officially credited to her by the Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC).
* &#x27;s skipper, Howard W. Gilmore, earned the submarine force&#x27;s first combat Medal of Honor for sacrificing his life to save his boat and his crew. Alone on the bridge after being wounded by enemy gunfire, and unable to reach the hatch after he had ordered the others below, he pressed his face to the phone and uttered the order that saved his ship and sealed his doom: &quot;Take &#x27;er down!&quot;
* In , Mannert L. Abele earned the submarine force&#x27;s first Navy Cross, when his boat engaged in a running battle with Japanese ships off Kiska in July 1942. &quot;Grunion&quot; was subsequently lost in this action. In 2006 and 2007, expeditions organized and led by Abele&#x27;s sons, Bruce, Brad, and John, located and photographed the wreck of the &quot;Grunion&quot; using side-scan sonar and a remotely operated vehicle.
* was essentially the 53rd U.S. submarine loss of the war. Terribly damaged in an aircraft-borne depth charge attack on 14 November 1944, she barely limped back to port in Saipan. Temporarily patched up, she was sent back to the United States. Examined by engineers, she was found to be beyond economical repair and was decommissioned on 18 July 1945, never having made another war patrol. Her entire crew survived.
* was commanded by Samuel D. Dealey, the only submarine commander of the war (perhaps the only one ever) to sink five enemy destroyers, four in a single patrol.
* , which sank two Japanese ships during her patrols, was lent to the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force after the war, serving under the name &quot;Kuroshio&quot;.
* &#x27;s notable record during World War II included eight patrols in the Pacific. She sank the third- or second-most tonnage during the war. She served the U.S. Navy until 1967.
* is officially credited with sinking 23 ships, the third-most of any allied World War II submarine, behind only and , according to JANAC figures. 
* became famous in Edward L. &quot;Ned&quot; Beach&#x27;s book &quot;Submarine!&quot; (which was a kind of eulogy to her).
* sank the Japanese submarine &quot;I-42&quot; on the night of 23 March 1944, after the two subs dueled for position for over an hour. A week later, &quot;Tunny&quot; engaged the and inflicted enough damage for &quot;Musashi&quot; to return to dry dock for repairs.
* , commanded by one of the submarine force&#x27;s most famous skippers, Dudley W. &quot;Mush&quot; Morton, engaged in a running gun and torpedo battle with a convoy of four ships off the coast of New Guinea and destroyed the entire convoy. She was also one of the first U.S. subs into the Sea of Japan. She was sunk while exiting the Sea of Japan through the La Perouse Strait in October 1943 while on her seventh patrol.

==Postwar service==
At the end of World War II, the U.S. Navy found itself in an awkward position. The 56 remaining &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines, designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed, were largely obsolete, despite the fact they were only two to four years old. Such was the pace of technological development during the war that a submarine with only a 300-foot test depth was going to be of little use, despite being modern in most other aspects. Enough of the &quot;Balao&quot; and &quot;Tench&quot; ships, with their greater diving depth, remained that the &quot;Gato&quot;s were superfluous for front-line missions. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) modernization program of the late 1940s largely passed these ships by. Only and received GUPPY conversions; these were austere GUPPY IB modernizations under project SCB 47A prior to their transfer to the Italian Navy. However, the U.S. Navy found itself new missions to perform, and for some of these the &quot;Gato&quot;s were well suited. The last two &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships active in the U.S. Navy were and , which were both decommissioned on 13 September 1969 and sold for scrap.

===Radar picket===

The advent of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; demonstrated the need for a long-range radar umbrella around the fleet. Surface ships refitted with powerful radar suites were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role, as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. Two &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships ( and ) received rudimentary conversions to radar pickets before the end of World War II, but were not used in this role. After further experimenting with the concept on four &quot;Balao&quot; and &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats under Projects Migraine I and II, and realizing that a deep diving depth was not overly important in this role, six &quot;Gato&quot;s were taken in hand (, , , , , and ) for conversion under Project Migraine III (aka SCB 12A). They were lengthened by to provide additional space for an air control center and had powerful air-search and height-finding radars installed, with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed. They also received a streamlined &quot;sail&quot; in place of the traditional conning tower fairwater. Redesignated as SSRs, these ships were only moderately successful in this role, as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable. The radars were removed and the ships temporarily reverted to general-purpose submarines after 1959.

===Hunter-killer===

The threat of the Soviet Navy building hundreds of Type XXI-derived submarines (eventually the 215-strong and dozens of others) in the Atlantic led the U.S. Navy to adapt submarines to specifically hunt other submarines, a radically new role for the 1950s. Concluding that this role did not require a fast or deep-diving submarine (this line of thought would quickly change with the advent of nuclear power), seven &quot;Gato&quot;s were converted to SSKs (hunter-killer submarines) between 1951 and 1953, joining three purpose-built &quot;K-1&quot;-class SSKs entering service at that time. The &quot;Gato&quot; class was chosen because large numbers were available in the reserve fleet should rapid mobilization become necessary, and the deeper-diving classes were more suitable for GUPPY rather than SSK conversions. A streamlined GUPPY-style sail was installed, a large sonar array was wrapped around the bow (losing two torpedo tubes in the process), the ships were extensively silenced including the removal of the two forward diesel engines, and they received a snorkel. was converted under project SCB 58 as the test ship for the concept, having her sonar array at the forward end of the sail instead of the better position at the bow. The other ships in the program included , , , , , and .

Eventually more advanced sonars were installed on the new nuclear subs: , commissioned in 1960, introduced the bow-mounted sonar sphere. &quot;Tullibee&quot; was an attempt to develop a slow but ultra-quiet nuclear-powered SSK equivalent; no others were built due to her unexpectedly high cost relative to the more capable , and the SSK mission was folded into the regular attack submarine role. The slow and less capable diesel SSKs were decommissioned or reassigned to other roles in 1959, and all except &quot;Croaker&quot; and &quot;Cavalla&quot; (eventually preserved as memorials) were scrapped in 1968 and 1969.

===Guided-missile submarine===

The Regulus nuclear cruise missile program of the 1950s provided the U.S. Navy with its first strategic missile capability. was converted under SCB 28 in 1953 to house and fire this large surface-launched missile and was designated SSG (guided-missile submarine). She could carry two of the missiles in a cylindrical hangar on the aft deck. She made strategic deterrent patrols with Regulus until 1964, when the program was discontinued in favor of Polaris.

===Transport submarine===
With the retirement of the Regulus missile system in 1965, was converted into a troop transport in 1966. She was redesignated as an APSS (transport submarine), replacing in this role. Her Regulus hangar became a lockout chamber for UDT, SEAL, and Marine Force Recon teams in the Vietnam War. On 1 January 1969, &quot;Tunny&quot;″s designation was changed to LPSS (amphibious transport submarine); however, she was replaced by and decommissioned in June of that year.

===Submarine oiler===

 was converted under SCB 39 to a SSO in 1950 to carry fuel oil, gasoline, and cargo to amphibious beachheads. She received additional &quot;saddle&quot; tanks wrapped around her outer hull to carry these fuels and a streamlined sail. After a few tests, the concept was dropped in 1951 as impractical, and &quot;Guavina&quot; served in the test role for a few years under the designation AGSS. In 1957, she converted back to the oiler/tanker role and carried the designation AOSS. This time, she experimented with refueling seaplanes at sea, which was potentially important, as refueling the nuclear-capable Martin P6M Seamaster at sea could improve the Navy&#x27;s strategic strike capabilities. However, this mission, too, was dropped and &quot;Guavina&quot; was decommissioned.

===Sonar test submarine===

The development of advanced sonar systems took on a great deal of importance in the 1950s, and several fleet ships were outfitted with various strange-looking sonar transducer arrays and performed extensive tests. Two &quot;Gato&quot;s, and (previously the prototype hunter-killer ship) were assigned to these duties and proved to be key players in the development of new sonar capabilities. &quot;Grouper&quot; had all her forward torpedo tubes removed and the space was used as berthing for technicians and as a sonar lab. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was decommissioned in 1954, but &quot;Grouper&quot; continued in the test role until 1968.

===Naval Reserve trainer===
Interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists, the Navy assigned numerous fleet ships to various coastal and inland ports (even in Great Lakes ports such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit) where they served as a training platform during the reservists&#x27; weekend drills. Twenty-eight &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships served in this capacity, some as late as 1971. In this role, the ships were rendered incapable of diving and had their propellers removed. They were used strictly as pierside trainers. These were in commission, but classed as &quot;in commission in reserve&quot;, thus some were decommissioned and recommissioned on the same day to reflect the change in status.

===Foreign service===
The large numbers of relatively modern, but surplus U.S. fleet submarines proved to be popular in sales, loans, or leases to allied foreign navies. While most of these ships were of the more capable &quot;Balao&quot; and &quot;Tench&quot; classes, some &quot;Gato&quot;s went overseas, as well. Italy received two ( and ), which received the only GUPPY conversions given to &quot;Gato&quot;-class ships (Guppy IB). Japan received one (), Brazil two ( and ), Greece two ( and ), and Turkey two ( and ). The ships transferred to Japan and Brazil did not receive any modernizations (streamlining and snorkels) prior to transfer, but the four ships sent to Greece and Turkey did receive snorkels and partial streamlining to the fairwater.

== Museums ==
Six &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines are open to public viewing. They primarily depend on revenue generated by visitors to keep them operational and up to U.S. Navy standards; each ship gets a yearly inspection and a &quot;report card&quot;. Some ships, such as &quot;Cod&quot; and &quot;Silversides&quot;, have been used in film production.

<text>A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games which generally includes relevant libraries and support programs such as a level editor. The &quot;engine&quot; terminology is akin to the term &quot;software engine&quot; used more widely in the software industry.

&quot;Game engine&quot; can also refer to the development software supporting this framework, typically a suite of tools and features for developing games.

Developers can use game engines to construct games for video game consoles and other types of computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine (&quot;renderer&quot;) for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics. Game engine implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.

==Purpose==
In many cases, game engines provide a suite of visual development tools in addition to reusable software components. These tools are generally provided in an integrated development environment to enable simplified, rapid development of games in a data-driven manner. Game-engine developers often attempt to preempt implementer needs by developing robust software suites which include many elements a game developer may need to build a game. Most game-engine suites provide facilities that ease development, such as graphics, sound, physics and artificial intelligence (AI) functions. These game engines are sometimes called &quot;middleware&quot; because, as with the business sense of the term, they provide a flexible and reusable software platform which provides all the core functionality needed, right out of the box, to develop a game application while reducing costs, complexities, and time-to-market—all critical factors in the highly competitive video game industry.

Like other types of middleware, game engines usually provide platform abstraction, allowing the same game to run on various platforms (including game consoles and personal computers) with few, if any, changes made to the game source code. Often, programmers design game engines with a component-based architecture that allows specific systems in the engine to be replaced or extended with more specialized (and often more expensive) game-middleware components. Some game engines comprise a series of loosely connected game middleware components that can be selectively combined to create a custom engine, instead of the more common approach of extending or customizing a flexible integrated product. However achieved, extensibility remains a high priority for game engines due to the wide variety of uses for which they are applied. Despite the specificity of the name &quot;game engine&quot;, end-users often re-purpose game engines for other kinds of interactive applications with real-time graphical requirements—such as marketing demos, architectural visualizations, training simulations, and modeling environments.

Some game engines only provide real-time 3D rendering capabilities instead of the wide range of functionality needed by games. These engines rely upon the game developer to implement the rest of this functionality or to assemble it from other game-middleware components. These types of engines are generally referred to as a &quot;graphics engine&quot;, &quot;rendering engine&quot;, or &quot;3D engine&quot; instead of the more encompassing term &quot;game engine&quot;. This terminology is inconsistently used, as many full-featured 3D game engines are referred to simply as &quot;3D engines&quot;. Examples of graphics engines include: Crystal Space, Genesis3D, Irrlicht, OGRE, RealmForge, Truevision3D, and Vision Engine. Modern game- or graphics-engines generally provide a scene graph—an object-oriented representation of the 3D game-world which often simplifies game design and can be used for more efficient rendering of vast virtual worlds. Most game engines or graphics engines use a Graphics API, which eases communication with the GPU. But older games did not have hardware acceleration or GPUs and had to build their own software renderer.

As technology ages, the components of an engine may become outdated or insufficient for the requirements of a given project. Since the complexity of programming an entirely new engine may result in unwanted delays (or necessitate that a project restart from the beginning), an engine-development team may elect to update their existing engine with newer functionality or components.

==History==

Before game engines, games were typically written as singular entities: a game for the Atari 2600, for example, had to be designed from the bottom up to make optimal use of the display hardware—this core display routine is today called the kernel by developers of games for older systems. Other platforms had more leeway, but even when the display was not a concern, memory constraints usually sabotaged attempts to create the data-heavy design that an engine needs. Even on more accommodating platforms, very little could be reused between games. The rapid advance of arcade hardware—which was the leading edge of the market at the time—meant that most of the code would have to be thrown out afterwards anyway, as later generations of games would use completely different game designs that took advantage of extra resources. Thus most game designs through the 1980s were designed through a hard-coded rule set with a small number of levels and graphics data. Since the golden age of arcade video games, it became common for video game companies to develop in-house game engines for use with first-party software.

A notable example of an in-house game engine on home consoles in the mid-1980s was the smooth side-scrolling engine developed by Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s team at Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The engine they had developed for the side-scrolling racing game &quot;Excitebike&quot; (1984) was later employed for the scrolling platformer &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985). This had the effect of allowing Mario to smoothly accelerate from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed like in earlier platformers.

While third-party game engines were not common up until the rise of 3D computer graphics in the 1990s, there were several 2D game creation systems produced in the 1980s for independent video game development. These include &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; (1983), ASCII&#x27;s &quot;War Game Construction Kit&quot; (1983), &quot;Thunder Force Construction&quot; (1984), &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot; (1984), Garry Kitchen&#x27;s GameMaker (1985), &quot;Wargame Construction Set&quot; (1986), &quot;Shoot-&#x27;Em-Up Construction Kit&quot; (1987), &quot;Arcade Game Construction Kit&quot; (1988), and most popularly ASCII&#x27;s &quot;RPG Maker&quot; engines from 1998 onward. Klik &amp; Play (1994) is another legacy offering that is still available.

The term &quot;game engine&quot; arose in the mid-1990s, especially in connection with 3D games such as first-person shooters with a first-person shooter engine. Epic games, founded by developer Tim Sweeney, debuted Unreal Engine in the year 1998.

Such was the popularity of Id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; games that, rather than work from scratch, other developers licensed the core portions of the software and designed their own graphics, characters, weapons and levels—the &quot;game content&quot; or &quot;game assets&quot;. Separation of game-specific rules and data from basic concepts like collision detection and game entity meant that teams could grow and specialize.

Later games, such as id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and Epic Games&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Unreal&quot; were designed with this approach in mind, with the engine and content developed separately. The practice of licensing such technology has proved to be a useful auxiliary revenue stream for some game developers, as one license for a high-end commercial game engine can range from $10,000 to millions of dollars, and the number of licensees can reach several dozen companies, as seen with the Unreal Engine. At the very least, reusable engines make developing game sequels faster and easier, which is a valuable advantage in the competitive video game industry. While there was a strong rivalry between Epic and id around the year 2000, since then Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine has been far more popular than id Tech 4 and its successor id Tech 5.

Modern game engines are some of the most complex applications written, often featuring dozens of finely tuned systems interacting to ensure a precisely controlled user experience. The continued evolution of game engines has created a strong separation between rendering, scripting, artwork, and level design. It is now common, for example, for a typical game development team to have several times as many artists as actual programmers.

First-person shooter games remain the predominant users of third-party game engines, but they are now also being used in other genres. For example, the role-playing video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot; and the MMORPG &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; are based on the Gamebryo engine, and the MMORPG &quot;Lineage II&quot; is based on the Unreal Engine. Game engines are used for games originally developed for home consoles as well; for example, the RenderWare engine is used in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Burnout&quot; franchises.

Threading is taking on more importance due to modern multi-core systems (e.g. Cell) and increased demands in realism. Typical threads involve rendering, streaming, audio, and physics. Racing games have typically been at the forefront of threading with the physics engine running in a separate thread long before other core subsystems were moved, partly because rendering and related tasks need updating at only 30–60 Hz. For example, on PlayStation 3, physics ran in &quot;Need For Speed&quot; at 100 Hz versus &quot;Forza Motorsport 2&quot; at 360 Hz.

Although the term was first used in the 1990s, there are a few earlier systems in the 1980s that are also considered to be game engines, such as Sierra&#x27;s Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and SCI systems, LucasArts&#x27; SCUMM system and Incentive Software&#x27;s Freescape engine (in 1986). Unlike most modern game engines, these game engines were never used in any third-party products (except for the SCUMM system which was licensed to and used by Humongous Entertainment).

As game engine technology matures and becomes more user-friendly, the application of game engines has broadened in scope. They are now being used for serious games: visualization, training, medical, and military simulation applications, with the CryEngine being one example. To facilitate this accessibility, new hardware platforms are now being targeted by game engines, including mobile phones (e.g. Android phones, iPhone) and web browsers (e.g. WebGL, Shockwave, Flash, Trinigy&#x27;s WebVision, Silverlight, Unity Web Player, O3D and pure DHTML).

Additionally, more game engines are being built upon higher level languages such as Java and C#/.NET (e.g. TorqueX, and Visual3D.NET), Python (Panda3D), or Lua Script (Leadwerks). As most 3D rich games are now mostly GPU-limited (i.e. limited by the power of the graphics card), the potential slowdown due to translation overheads of higher level languages becomes negligible, while the productivity gains offered by these languages work to the game engine developers&#x27; benefit. These recent trends are being propelled by companies such as Microsoft to support indie game development. Microsoft developed XNA as the SDK of choice for all video games released on Xbox and related products. This includes the Xbox Live Indie Games channel designed specifically for smaller developers who do not have the extensive resources necessary to box games for sale on retail shelves. It is becoming easier and cheaper than ever to develop game engines for platforms that support managed frameworks.

==Game engines as an industry==
Producers of game engines decide how they allow users to utilize their products. Just as gaming is an industry, so are the engines they are built off. The major game engines come at varying prices, whether it be in the form of subscription fees or license payments. Unity and the Unreal Engine are currently the two most popular choices for game developers. Although the differences among the different game engines blur as they build their own tools on top of them, different game developers may be too used to a system to change, or attracted by the huge benefits of such engines regardless of pay-walls.

==Game middleware==
In the broader sense of the term, game engines themselves can be described as middleware. In the context of video games, however, the term &quot;middleware&quot; is often used to refer to subsystems of functionality within a game engine. Some game middleware does only one thing but does it more convincingly or more efficiently than general purpose middleware.

The four most widely used middleware packages that provide subsystems of functionality include RAD Game Tools&#x27; Bink, Firelight FMOD, Havok, and Scaleform GFx. RAD Game Tools develops Bink for basic video rendering, along with Miles audio, and Granny 3D rendering. Firelight FMOD is a low cost robust audio library and toolset. Havok provides a robust physics simulation system, along with a suite of animation and behavior applications. Scaleform provides GFx for high performance Flash UI and high-quality video playback, and an Input Method Editor (IME) add-on for in-game Asian chat support.

Other middleware is used for performance optimisation—for example &#x27;Simplygon&#x27; helps to optimise and generate level of detail meshes, and &#x27;Umbra&#x27; adds occlusion culling optimisations to 3d graphics.

Some middleware contains full source code, others just provide an API reference for a compiled binary library. Some middleware programs can be licensed either way, usually for a higher fee for full source code.

<doc id="170584" wikidata="Q205660" url="?curid=170584" title="Poverty threshold">
<text>The poverty threshold, poverty limit, poverty line, or breadline is the minimum level of income deemed adequate in a particular country. The poverty line is usually calculated by estimating the total cost of one year&#x27;s worth of necessities for the average adult. The cost of housing, such as the rent for an apartment, usually makes up the largest proportion of this estimate, so economists track the real estate market and other housing cost indicators as a major influence on the poverty line. Individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances, such as whether one is a parent, elderly, a child, married, etc. The poverty threshold may be adjusted annually. In practice, like the definition of poverty, the official or common understanding of the poverty line is significantly higher in developed countries than in developing countries.

In September 2022, the World Bank updated the International Poverty Line (IPL), a global absolute minimum, to $2.15 per day (in PPP). In addition, as of 2022, $3.65 per day in PPP for lower-middle income countries, and $6.85 per day in PPP for upper-middle income countries. Per the $1.90/day standard, the percentage of the global population living in absolute poverty fell from over 80% in 1800 to 10% by 2015, according to United Nations estimates, which found roughly 734 million people remained in absolute poverty.

==History==
Charles Booth, a pioneering investigator of poverty in London at the turn of the 20th century, popularised the idea of a &quot;poverty line&quot;, a concept originally conceived by the London School Board. Booth set the line at 10 (50p) to 20 shillings (£1) per week, which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of four or five people to subsist on. Seebohm Rowntree (1871–1954), a British sociological researcher, social reformer and industrialist, surveyed rich families in York, and drew a poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money &quot;necessary to enable families … to secure the necessaries of a healthy life&quot;, which included fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. Based on data from leading nutritionists of the period, he calculated the cheapest price for the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary, before people get ill or lose weight. He considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84% of the total population of York lived below this poverty line. This result corresponded with that from Booth&#x27;s study of poverty in London and so challenged the view, commonly held at the time, that abject poverty was a problem particular to London and was not widespread in the rest of Britain. Rowntree distinguished between primary poverty, those lacking in income and secondary poverty, those who had enough income, but spent it elsewhere (1901:295–96).

The poverty threshold was first developed by Mollie Orshansky between 1963 and 1964. She attributed the poverty threshold as a measure of income inadequacy by taking the cost of food plan per family of three or four and multiplying it by a factor of three. In 1969 the inter agency poverty level review committee adjusted the threshold for only price changes.

==Absolute poverty and the International Poverty Line ==

The term &quot;absolute poverty&quot; is also sometimes used as a synonym for extreme poverty. Absolute poverty is the absence of enough resources to secure basic life necessities.

To assist in measuring this, the World Bank has a daily per capita international poverty line (IPL), a global absolute minimum, of $2.15 a day as of September 2022.

The new IPL replaces the $1.25 per day figure, which used 2005 data. In 2008, the World Bank came out with a figure (revised largely due to inflation) of $1.25 a day at 2005 purchasing power parity (PPP). The new figure of $1.90 is based on ICP PPP calculations and represents the international equivalent of what $1.90 could buy in the US in 2011. Most scholars agree that it better reflects today&#x27;s reality, particularly new price levels in developing countries. The common IPL has in the past been roughly $1 a day.

These figures are artificially low according to Peter Edward of Newcastle University. He believes the real number as of 2015 was $7.40 per day.

Using a single monetary poverty threshold is problematic when applied worldwide, due to the difficulty of comparing prices between countries. Prices of the same goods vary dramatically from country to country; while this is typically corrected for by using PPP exchange rates, the basket of goods used to determine such rates is usually unrepresentative of the poor, most of whose expenditure is on basic foodstuffs rather than the relatively luxurious items (washing machines, air travel, healthcare) often included in PPP baskets. The economist Robert C. Allen has attempted to solve this by using standardized baskets of goods typical of those bought by the poor across countries and historical time, for example including a fixed calorific quantity of the cheapest local grain (such as corn, rice, or oats).

===Basic needs===
The basic needs approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of absolute poverty in developing countries. It attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term physical well-being, usually in terms of consumption goods. The poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs. The &#x27;basic needs&#x27; approach was introduced by the International Labour Organization&#x27;s World Employment Conference in 1976. &quot;Perhaps the high point of the WEP was the World Employment Conference of 1976, which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy. The basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers&#x27; and employers&#x27; organizations from all over the world. It influenced the programs and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and was the precursor to the human development approach.&quot;

A traditional list of immediate &quot;basic needs&quot; is food (including water), shelter, and clothing. Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of &#x27;basic needs&#x27; of not just food, water, and shelter, but also sanitation, education, and health care. Different agencies use different lists.
According to a UN declaration that resulted from the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995, absolute poverty is &quot;a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education, and information. It depends not only on income, but also on access to services.&quot;

David Gordon&#x27;s paper, &quot;Indicators of Poverty and Hunger&quot;, for the United Nations, further defines absolute poverty as the absence of any two of the following eight basic needs:

* Food: Body mass index must be above 16.
* Safe drinking water: Water must not come solely from rivers and ponds, and must be available nearby (fewer than 15 minutes&#x27; walk each way).
* Sanitation facilities: Toilets or latrines must be accessible in or near the home.
* Health: Treatment must be received for serious illnesses and pregnancy.
* Shelter: Homes must have fewer than four people living in each room. Floors must not be made of soil, mud, or clay.
* Education: Everyone must attend school or otherwise learn to read.
* Information: Everyone must have access to newspapers, radios, televisions, computers, or telephones at home.
* Access to services: This item is undefined by Gordon, but normally is used to indicate the complete panoply of education, health, legal, social, and financial (credit) services.

In 1978, Ghai investigated the literature that criticized the basic needs approach. Critics argued that the basic needs approach lacked scientific rigour; it was consumption-oriented and antigrowth. Some considered it to be &quot;a recipe for perpetuating economic backwardness&quot; and for giving the impression &quot;that poverty elimination is all too easy&quot;. Amartya Sen focused on &#x27;capabilities&#x27; rather than consumption.

In the development discourse, the basic needs model focuses on the measurement of what is believed to be an eradicable level of poverty.

==Relative poverty==

Relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country: for example, below 60% of the median income of people in that country.

Relative poverty measurements, unlike absolute poverty measurements, take the social economic environment of the people observed into consideration. It is based on the assumption that whether a person is considered poor depends on her/his income share relative to the income shares of other people who are living in the same economy. The threshold for relative poverty is considered to be at 50% of a country&#x27;s median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. Thus, it can vary greatly from country to country even after adjusting for purchasing power standards (PPS).

A person can be poor in relative terms but not in absolute terms as the person might be able to meet her/his basic needs, but not be able to enjoy the same standards of living that other people in the same economy are enjoying. Relative poverty is thus a form of social exclusion that can for example affect peoples access to decent housing, education or job opportunities.

The relative poverty measure is used by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers. In the European Union, the &quot;relative poverty measure is the most prominent and most–quoted of the EU social inclusion indicators.&quot;

&quot;Relative poverty reflects better the cost of social inclusion and equality of opportunity in a specific time and space.&quot;

&quot;Once economic development has progressed beyond a certain minimum level, the rub of the poverty problem – from the point of view of both the poor individual and of the societies in which they live – is not so much the effects of poverty in any absolute form but the effects of the contrast, daily perceived, between the lives of the poor and the lives of those around them. For practical purposes, the problem of poverty in the industrialized nations today is a problem of relative poverty (page 9).&quot;

However, some have argued that as relative poverty is merely a measure of inequality, using the term &#x27;poverty&#x27; for it is misleading. For example, if everyone in a country&#x27;s income doubled, it would not reduce the amount of &#x27;relative poverty&#x27; at all.

===History of the concept of relative poverty===
In 1776, Adam Smith argued that poverty is the inability to afford &quot;not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without.&quot;

In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith argued, &quot;People are poverty stricken when their income, even if adequate for survival, falls markedly behind that of their community.&quot;

In 1964, in a joint committee economic President&#x27;s report in the United States, Republicans endorsed the concept of relative poverty: &quot;No objective definition of poverty exists. ... The definition varies from place to place and time to time. In America as our standard of living rises, so does our idea of what is substandard.&quot;

In 1965, Rose Friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards. Those labelled as poor in 1995, would have had &quot;a higher standard of living than many labelled not poor&quot; in 1965.

In 1967, American economist Victor Fuchs proposed that &quot;we define as poor any family whose income is less than one-half the median family income.&quot; This was the first introduction of the relative poverty rate as typically computed today

In 1979, British sociologist, Peter Townsend published his famous definition: &quot;individuals... can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary, or are at least widely encouraged or approved, in the societies to which they belong (page 31).&quot;

Brian Nolan and Christopher T. Whelan of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Ireland explained that &quot;poverty has to be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question.&quot;

Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the European Union, UNICEF and the OECD. The main poverty line used in the OECD and the European Union is based on &quot;economic distance&quot;, a level of income set at 60% of the median household income.

===Relative poverty compared with other standards===
A measure of &quot;relative poverty&quot; defines &quot;poverty&quot; as being below some relative poverty threshold. For example, the statement that &quot;those individuals who are employed and whose household equivalised disposable income is below 60% of national median equivalised income are poor&quot; uses a relative measure to define poverty.

The term &quot;relative poverty&quot; can also be used in a different sense to mean &quot;moderate poverty&quot; – for example, a standard of living or level of income that is high enough to satisfy basic needs (like water, food, clothing, housing, and basic health care), but still significantly lower than that of the majority of the population under consideration.
An example of this could be a person living in poor conditions or squalid housing in a high crime area of a developed country and struggling to pay their bills every month due to low wages, debt or unemployment. While this person still benefits from the infrastructure of the developed country, they still endure a less than ideal lifestyle compared to their more affluent countrymen or even the more affluent individuals in less developed countries who have lower living costs.

=== Living Income Concept ===
Living Income refers to the income needed to afford a decent standard of living in the place one lives. The distinguishing feature between a living income and the poverty line is the concept of decency, wherein people thrive, not only survive. Based on years of stakeholder dialogue and expert consultations, the Living Income Community of Practice, an open learning community, established the formal definition of living income drawing on the work of Richard and Martha Anker, who co-authored &quot;Living Wages Around the World: Manual for Measurement&quot;. They define a living income as:The net annual income required for a household in a particular place to afford a decent standard of living for all members of that household. Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transport, clothing, and other essential needs including provision for unexpected events.Like the poverty line calculation, using a single global monetary calculation for Living Income is problematic when applied worldwide. Additionally, the Living Income should be adjusted quarterly due to inflation and other significant changes such as currency adjustments. The actual income or proxy income can be used when measuring the gap between initial income and the living income benchmarks. The World Bank notes that poverty and standard of living can be measured by social perception as well, and found that in 2015, roughly one-third of the world&#x27;s population was considered poor in relation to their particular society.

The Living Income Community of Practice (LICOP) was founded by The Sustainable Food Lab, GIZ and ISEAL Alliance to measure the gap between what people around the world earn versus what they need to have a decent standard of living, and find ways to bridge this gap.

A variation on the LICOP&#x27;s Living Income is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Living Wage Calculator, which compares the local minimum wage to the amount of money needed to cover expenses beyond what is needed to merely survive across the United States. The cost of living varies greatly if there are children or other dependents in the household.

== Relevance ==
An outdated or flawed poverty measure is an obstacle for policymakers, researchers and academics trying to find solutions to the problem of poverty. This has implications for people. The federal poverty line is used by dozens of federal, state, and local agencies, as well as several private organizations and charities, to decide who needs assistance. The assistance can take many forms, but it is often difficult to put in place any type of aid without measurements which provide data. In a rapidly evolving economic climate, poverty assessment often aids developed countries in determining the efficacy of their programs and guiding their development strategy. In addition, by measuring poverty one receives knowledge of which poverty reduction strategies work and which do not, helping to evaluate different projects, policies and institutions. To a large extent, measuring the poor and having strategies to do so keep the poor on the agenda, making the problem of political and moral concern.

== Threshold limitations ==
It is hard to have exact number for poverty, as much data is collected through interviews, meaning income that is reported to the interviewer must be taken at face value. As a result, data could not rightly represent the situations true nature, nor fully represent the income earned illegally. In addition, if the data were correct and accurate, it would still not mean serving as an adequate measure of the living standards, the well-being or economic position of a given family or household. Research done by Haughton and Khandker finds that there is no ideal measure of well-being, arguing that all measures of poverty are imperfect. That is not to say that measuring poverty should be avoided; rather, all indicators of poverty should be approached with caution, and questions about how they are formulated should be raised.

As a result, depending on the indicator of economic status used, an estimate of who is disadvantaged, which groups have the highest poverty rates, and the nation&#x27;s progress against poverty varies significantly. Hence, this can mean that defining poverty is not just a matter of measuring things accurately, but it also necessitates fundamental social judgments, many of which have moral implications.

==National poverty lines==

National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys. Definitions of the poverty line do vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations. Even among rich nations, the standards differ greatly. Thus, the numbers are not comparable among countries. Even when nations do use the same method, some issues may remain.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK in 2006, &quot;more than five million people – over a fifth (23 percent) of all employees – were paid less than £6.67 an hour&quot;. This value is based on a low pay rate of 60 percent of full-time median earnings, equivalent to a little over £12,000 a year for a 35-hour working week. In April 2006, a 35-hour week would have earned someone £9,191 a year – before tax or National Insurance&quot;.

In 2019, the Low Pay Commission estimated that about 7% of people employed in the UK were earning at or below the National Minimum Wage. In 2021, the Office for National Statistics found that 3.8% of jobs were paid below the National Minimum Wage, a decrease from 7.4% in 2020 but an increase from 1.4% in 2019. They note that this increase from 2019 to 2021 is connected to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The Guardian reported in 2021 that &quot;almost 5m jobs, or one in six nationally, pay below the real living wage&quot;.

===India===
India&#x27;s official poverty level is split according to rural versus urban thresholds. For urban dwellers, the poverty line is defined as living on less than 538.60 rupees (approximately US$12) per month, whereas for rural dwellers, it is defined as living on less than 356.35 rupees per month (approximately US$7.50) In 2019, the Indian government stated that 6.7% of its population is below its official poverty limit. As India is one of the fastest-growing economies in 2018, poverty is on the decline in the country, with close to 44 Indians escaping extreme poverty every minute, as per the World Poverty Clock. India lifted 271 million people out of poverty in a 10-year time period from 2005/06 to 2015/16.

===Iran===
In 2008 Iran government report by central statistics had recommended 9.5 around million people living below poverty line.
As of August 2022 the Iranian economy suffered the highest inflation in 75 years; official statistics put the poverty line at 10 million tomans ($500), while the 
minimum wage given in the same year has been 5 million toman.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore has experienced strong economic growth over the last ten years and has consistently ranked among the world&#x27;s top countries in terms of GDP per capita.

Inequality has however increased dramatically over the same time span, yet there is no official poverty line in the country. Given Singapore&#x27;s high level of growth and prosperity, many believe that poverty does not exist in the country, or that domestic poverty is not comparable to global absolute poverty. Such a view persists for a selection of reasons, and since there is no official poverty line, there is no strong acknowledgement that it exists.

Yet, Singapore is not considering establishing an official poverty line, with Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing claiming it would fail to represent the magnitude and scope of problems faced by the poor. As a result, social benefits and aids aimed at the poor would be a missed opportunity for those living right above such a line.

===United States===

In the United States, the poverty thresholds are updated every year by Census Bureau. The threshold in the United States is updated and used for statistical purposes. The poverty guidelines are also used as an
eligibility criterion by Medicaid and a
number of other Federal programs.

In 2020, in the United States, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of $12,760, or about $35 per day. The threshold for a family group of four, including two children, was $26,200, about $72 per day. According to the US Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey 2018 One-year Estimates, 13.1% of Americans lived below the poverty line.
Other estimates place the percentage of people living in poverty as low as only 1.1% in 2017.

====Women and children====
Women and children find themselves impacted by poverty more often when a part of single mother families. The poverty rate of women has increasingly exceeded that of men&#x27;s. While the overall poverty rate is 12.3%, women poverty rate is 13.8% which is above the average and men are below the overall rate at 11.1%. Women and children (as single mother families) find themselves as a part of low class communities because they are 21.6% more likely to fall into poverty. However, extreme poverty, such as homelessness, disproportionately affects males to a high degree.

====Racial minorities====
A minority group is defined as &quot;a category of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.&quot; Minorities are traditionally separated into the following groups: African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. According to US Poverty statistics, Black Americans – 21%, Foreign born non-citizens – 19%, Hispanic Americans – 18%, and adults with a disability – 25%. This does not include all minority groups, but these groups alone account for 85% of people under the poverty line in the United States. Whites have a poverty rate of 8.7%; the poverty rate is more than double for Black and Hispanic Americans.

====Impacts on education====
Living below the poverty threshold can have a major impact on a child&#x27;s education. The psychological stresses induced by poverty may affect a student&#x27;s ability to perform well academically. In addition, the risk of poor health is more prevalent for those living in poverty. Health issues commonly affect the extent to which one can continue and fully take advantage of his or her education. Poor students in the United States are more likely to dropout of school at some point in their education. Research has also found that children living in poverty perform poorly academically and have lower graduation rates. Impoverished children also experience more disciplinary issues in school than others.

Schools in impoverished communities usually do not receive much funding, which can also set their students apart from those living in more affluent neighborhoods. There is much dispute over whether upward mobility that brings a child out of poverty may or may not have a significant positive impact on his or her education; inadequate academic habits that form as early as preschool typically are unknown to improve despite changes in socioeconomic status.

====Impacts on healthcare====
The nation&#x27;s poverty threshold is issued by the Census Bureau. According to the Office of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation the threshold is statistically relevant and can be a solid predictor of people in poverty. The reasoning for using Federal Poverty Level (FPL) is due to its action for distributive purposes under the direction of Health and Human Services. So FPL is a tool derived from the threshold but can be used to show eligibility for certain federal programs. Federal poverty levels have direct effects on individuals&#x27; healthcare. In the past years and into the present government, the use of the poverty threshold has consequences for such programs like Medicaid and the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program.  The benefits which different families are eligible for are contingent on FPL. The FPL, in turn, is calculated based on federal numbers from the previous year.

The benefits and qualifications for federal programs are dependent on number of people on a plan and the income of the total group. For 2019, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services enumerate what the line is for different families. For a single person, the line is $12,490 and up to $43,430 for a family of 8, in the lower 48 states. Another issue is reduced-cost coverage. These reductions are based on income relative to FPL, and work in connection with public health services such as Medicaid. The divisions of FPL percentages are nominally, above 400%, below 138% and below 100% of the FPL. After the advent of the American Care Act, Medicaid was expanded on states bases. For example, enrolling in the ACA kept the benefits of Medicaid when the income was up to 138% of the FPL.

====Poverty mobility and healthcare====
Health Affairs along with analysis by Georgetown found that public assistance does counteract poverty threats between 2010 and 2015. In regards to Medicaid, child poverty is decreased by 5.3%, and Hispanic and Black poverty by 6.1% and 4.9% respectively. The reduction of family poverty also has the highest decrease with Medicaid over other public assistance programs. Expanding state Medicaid decreased the amount individuals paid by an average of $42, while it increased the costs to $326 for people not in expanded states. The same study analyzed showed 2.6 million people were kept out of poverty by the effects of Medicaid. From a 2013–2015 study, expansion states showed a smaller gap in health insurance between households making below $25,000 and above $75,000. Expansion also significantly reduced the gap of having a primary care physician between impoverished and higher income individuals. In terms of education level and employment, health insurance differences were also reduced. Non-expansion also showed poor residents went from a 22% chance of being uninsured to 66% from 2013 to 2015.

====Poverty dynamics====
Living above or below the poverty threshold is not necessarily a position in which an individual remains static. As many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth; rather, they descended into poverty over the course of their life. Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant.

====Cutoff issues====
Most experts and the public agree that the official poverty line in the United States is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs. In particular, a 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults earning between 100 and 200% of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship, not significantly different from those below the poverty line. The cause of the discrepancy is believed to be an outdated model of spending patterns based on actual spending in the year 1955; the number and proportion of material needs has risen substantially since then.

=====Variability=====
The US Census Bureau calculates the poverty line the same throughout the US regardless of the cost-of-living in a state or urban area. For instance, the cost-of-living in California, the most populous state, was 42% greater than the US average in 2010, while the cost-of-living in Texas, the second-most populous state, was 10% less than the US average. In 2017, California had the highest poverty rate in the country when housing costs are factored in, a measure calculated by the Census Bureau known as &quot;the supplemental poverty measure&quot;.

====Government transfers to alleviate poverty====
In addition to wage and salary income, investment income and government transfers such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps) and housing subsidies are included in a household&#x27;s income. Studies measuring the differences between income before and after taxes and government transfers, have found that without social support programs, poverty would be roughly 30% to 40% higher than the official poverty line indicates.

<doc id="170586" wikidata="Q6545811" url="?curid=170586" title="Jealousy">
<text>Jealousy generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, and concern over a relative lack of possessions or safety.

Jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust. In its original meaning, &quot;jealousy&quot; is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with &quot;jealousy&quot; now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone. These two emotions are often confused with each other, since they tend to appear in the same situation.
Jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships, and it has been observed in infants as young as five months. Some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all cultures and is a universal trait. However, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific emotion.

Jealousy can either be suspicious or reactive, and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. Psychologists have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. Sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy.

Throughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.

== Etymology ==

The word stems from the French &quot;jalousie&quot;, formed from &quot;jaloux&quot; (jealous), and further from Low Latin &quot;zelosus&quot; (full of zeal), in turn from the Greek word (&quot;zēlos&quot;), sometimes &quot;jealousy&quot;, but more often in a positive sense &quot;emulation, ardour, zeal&quot; (with a root connoting &quot;to boil, ferment&quot;; or &quot;yeast&quot;). The &quot;biblical language&quot; would be known as &quot;tolerating no unfaithfulness&quot; while in middle English zealous is good. One origin word &quot;gelus&quot; meant &quot;Possessive and suspicious&quot; the word then turned into &quot;jelus.&quot;

Since William Shakespeare&#x27;s use of terms like &quot;green-eyed monster&quot;, the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expression &quot;green with envy&quot;, is derived.

== Theories ==

=== Scientific examples ===

People do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.
They instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define it in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:
* &quot;Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions which follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the perception of potential attraction between one&#x27;s partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.&quot;


* &quot;Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a partner&#x27;s extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to occur.&quot;


* &quot;Jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral response to a relationship threat. In the case of sexual jealousy, this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one&#x27;s partner has had (or desires to have) sexual activity with a third party. In the case of emotional jealousy, an individual feels threatened by her or his partner&#x27;s emotional involvement with and/or love for a third party.&quot;


* &quot;Jealousy is defined as a defensive reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship, arising from a situation in which the partner&#x27;s involvement with an activity and/or another person is contrary to the jealous person&#x27;s definition of their relationship.&quot;


* &quot;Jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from, or loss of, a romantic partner, when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner&#x27;s romantic interest in another person.&quot;
These definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.

==== Comparison with envy ====

Popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for envy. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.

The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular &#x27;feel-good&#x27; books as Nancy Friday&#x27;s &quot;Jealousy&quot;, where the expression &#x27;jealousy&#x27; applies to a broad range of passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz&#x27;s fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and Germanic languages asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term. Classical Latin used &quot;invidia&quot;, without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word &quot;zelotypia&quot; and the associated adjective &quot;zelosus&quot;. It is from this adjective that are derived French &quot;jaloux&quot;, Provençal &quot;gelos&quot;, Italian &quot;geloso&quot;, Spanish &quot;celoso&quot;, and Portuguese &quot;cioso&quot;.

Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival. In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy. A jealous person may envy the affection that their partner gives to a rival – affection the jealous person feels entitled to themselves. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.

Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher John Rawls distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents&#x27; attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend&#x27;s new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction. They claim the jealous person &quot;perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner,&quot; whereas the envious person &quot;does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it.&quot; Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.

The common experience of jealousy for many people may involve:

:* Fear of loss
:* Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal
:* Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss
:* Uncertainty and loneliness
:* Fear of losing an important person to another
:* Distrust

The experience of envy involves:

:* Feelings of inferiority
:* Longing
:* Resentment of circumstances
:* Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings
:* Motivation to improve
:* Desire to possess the attractive rival&#x27;s qualities
:* Disapproval of feelings
:* Sadness towards other&#x27;s accomplishments

Parrott acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy. Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science.

=== In psychology ===

Jealousy involves an entire &quot;emotional episode&quot; including a complex narrative. This includes the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at self regulation, subsequent actions and events, and ultimately the resolution of the episode.  The narrative can originate from experienced facts, thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guesses and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, jealousy can be a &quot;cognitively impenetrable state&quot;, where education and rational belief matter very little.

One possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in evolutionary psychology is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one&#x27;s own offspring. A jealous behavior, in women, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else&#x27;s offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person&#x27;s cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one&#x27;s needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship.

While mainstream psychology considers sexual arousal through jealousy a paraphilia, some authors on sexuality have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on sexual function and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.

Jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem. Research by Sybil Hart, PhD, at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months. Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry.

In addition to traditional jealousy comes Obsessive Jealousy, which can be a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This jealousy is characterized by obsessional jealousy and thoughts of the partner.

=== In sociology ===
Anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. Cultural learning can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy.

== Romantic jealousy ==

Romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest.

It is defined as “&quot;a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one&#x27;s partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.&quot;” Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively correlated to relationship jealousy in both genders.

=== Communicative responses ===
As romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem. If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy.

There are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively. Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness:

* Avoidance/Denial (low threat and low directness). &quot;Example: becoming silent; pretending nothing is wrong.&quot;
* Integrative Communication (low threat and high directness). &quot;Example: explaining feelings; calmly questioning partner.&quot;
* Active Distancing (medium threat and medium directness). &quot;Example: decreasing affection.&quot;
* Negative Affect Expression (medium threat and medium directness). &quot;Example: venting frustration; crying or sulking.&quot;
* Distributive Communication (high threat and high directness). &quot;Example: acting rude; making hurtful or abrasive comments.&quot;
* Violent Communication/Threats (high threat and high directness). &quot;Example: using physical force.&quot;

Guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced:

* Surveillance/ Restriction (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). &quot;Example: observing rival; trying to restrict contact with partner.&quot;
* Rival Contacts (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented/repair-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). &quot;Example: confronting rival.&quot;
* Manipulation Attempts (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, negatively valenced). &quot;Example: tricking partner to test loyalty; trying to make partner feel guilty.&quot;
* Compensatory Restoration (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, commonly positively valenced). &quot;Example: sending flowers to partner.&quot;
* Violent Behavior (-, -, negatively valenced). &quot;Example: slamming doors.&quot;

While some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way. Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes. One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors.

Researchers also believe that when jealousy is experienced it can be caused by differences in understanding the commitment level of the couple, rather than directly being caused by biology alone. The research identified that if a person valued long-term relationships more than being sexually exclusive, those individuals were more likely to demonstrate jealousy over emotional rather than physical infidelity.

Through a study conducted in three Spanish-Speaking countries, it was determined that Facebook jealousy also exists. This Facebook jealousy ultimately leads to increased relationship jealousy and study participants also displayed decreased self esteem as a result of the Facebook jealousy.

== Sexual jealousy ==
Sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person&#x27;s partner displays sexual interest in another person. The feeling of jealousy may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of infidelity. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners.

It seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner&#x27;s phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy. Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.

== Contemporary views on gender-based differences ==
According to Rebecca L. Ammon in &quot;The Osprey Journal of Ideas and Inquiry at UNF Digital Commons&quot; (2004), the Parental Investment Model based on parental investment theory posits that more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity. According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one&#x27;s level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected. The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants&#x27; attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships. As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that audit attachment styles strongly conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.
In 1906, &quot;The American Journal of Psychology&quot; had reported that &quot;the weight of quotable (male) authority is to the effect that women are more susceptible to jealousy&quot;. This claim was accompanied in the journal by a quote from Confucius: &quot;The five worst maladies that afflict the female mind are indocility, discontent, slander, jealousy and silliness.&quot;

Emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy.

There are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships. For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity. A large amount of data supports this notion. However, one must consider for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve the reproductive role. However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces when both parties involved are responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages. For example, it was predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases.

A second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is cultural. Differences have been highlighted in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional infidelity. Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals&#x27; life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as we age). Research on self-esteem and attachment theory suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship.

== In animals ==

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines. They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to non-social objects.

In addition, Jealousy has been speculated to be a potential factor in incidences of aggression or emotional tension in dogs. Mellissa Starling, an animal behavior consultant of the University of Sydney, noted that &quot;dogs are social animals and they obey a group hierarchy. Changes in the home, like the arrival of a baby, can prompt a family pet to behave differently to what one might expect.&quot;

== Applications ==

=== In fiction, film, and art ===

Artistic depictions of jealousy occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession.

A study done by Ferris, Smith, Greenberg, and Smith looked into the way people saw dating and romantic relationships based on how many reality dating shows they watched. People who spent a large amount of time watching these reality dating shows &quot;endorsed&quot; or supported the &quot;dating attitudes&quot; that would be shown on the show. While the other people who do not spend time watching reality dating shows did not mirror the same ideas. This means if someone watches a reality dating show that displays men and women reacting violently or aggressively towards their partner due to jealousy they can mirror that. This is reflected in romantic movies as well. Jessica R. Frampton conducted a study looking into romantic jealousy in movies. The study found that there were &quot;230 instances of romantic jealousy were identified in the 51 top-grossing romantic comedies from 2002–2014&quot; Some of the films did not display romantic jealousy however, some featured many examples of romantic jealousy. This was due to the fact that some of the top-grossing movies did not contain a rival or romantic competition. While others such as &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot; was said to contain &quot;19 instances of romantic jealousy.&quot; Out of the 230 instances 58% were reactive jealousy while 31% showed possessive jealousy. The last 11% displayed anxious jealousy it was seen the least in all 230 cases. Out of the 361 reactions to the jealousy found 53% were found to be &quot;Destructive responses.&quot; Only 19% of responses were constructive while 10% showed avoidant responses. The last 18% were considered &quot;rival focused responses&quot; which lead to the finding that &quot;there was a higher than expected number of rival-focused responses to possessive jealousy.&quot;

=== In religion ===
Jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy.

=== Cross culture ===
A study was done in order to cross examine jealousy among four different cultures, Ireland, Thailand, India and the United States. These cultures were chosen to demonstrate differences in expression across cultures. The study posits that male-dominant cultures are more likely to express and reveal jealousy. The survey found that Thais are less likely to express jealousy than the other three cultures. This is because the men in these cultures are rewarded in a way for showing jealousy due to the fact that some women interpret it as love. This can also be seen when watching romantic comedies when males show they are jealous of a rival or emotionally jealous women perceive it as men caring more.

Proteus ( ), also known as Neptune VIII, is the second-largest Neptunian moon, and Neptune&#x27;s largest inner satellite. Discovered by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus orbits Neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at a distance of about 4.75 times the radius of Neptune&#x27;s equator.

Despite being a predominantly icy body more than in diameter, Proteus&#x27;s shape deviates significantly from an ellipsoid. It is shaped more like an irregular polyhedron with several slightly concave facets and relief as high as . Its surface is dark, neutral in color, and heavily cratered. Proteus&#x27;s largest crater is Pharos, which is more than in diameter. There are also a number of scarps, grooves, and valleys related to large craters.

Proteus is probably not an original body that formed with Neptune. It could have accreted later from the debris formed when the largest Neptunian satellite, Triton, was captured.

== Discovery and naming ==

Proteus was discovered from the images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe two months before its Neptune flyby in August 1989. Proteus was discovered 40 years after the discovery of Neptune&#x27;s moon Nereid in 1949.

Upon discovery, Proteus received the temporary provisional designation S/1989 N 1. Stephen P. Synnott and Bradford A. Smith announced its discovery on July 7, 1989, speaking only of &quot;17 frames taken over 21 days&quot;, which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16.

On 16 September 1991, S/1989 N 1 was named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology following the convention that moons of Neptune should be named after deities and creatures related to the sea.

== Orbit ==

Proteus orbits Neptune at a distance of approximately , nearly equal to 4.75 times the equatorial radius of the planet. The orbit of Proteus is nearly circular, having a small orbital eccentricity, and is inclined by about 0.5 degrees to Neptune&#x27;s equator. Proteus is tidally locked to Neptune, and rotates synchronously with its orbital motion, which means that Proteus always presents the same face to Neptune.

Proteus may have once been in a 1:2 orbital resonance with Larissa, where Proteus made one orbit for every two orbits made by Larissa. Due to the outward tidal migration of Proteus over time, this is no longer the case. Proteus may have ceased its integral orbital resonance with Larissa several hundred million years ago.

== Physical characteristics ==

Proteus is the second-largest moon of Neptune and is the largest of its regular prograde moons. It is about in diameter, larger than Nereid, Neptune&#x27;s third-largest moon. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes because Proteus orbits so close to Neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight.

=== Composition ===

The surface of Proteus is dark as it has a geometrical albedo of about 10 percent–meaning that its surface reflects 10 percent of the light it receives from the Sun. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared range of around the wavelength of 2 μm, Proteus&#x27;s surface becomes less reflective, suggesting the presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. While Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, there is no definite spectroscopic confirmation of its presence on the surface. However, James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam spectrophotometry of the moon has revealed a 3 μm absorption feature, indicating possible water ice or hydrated minerals on the surface of Proteus. Proteus&#x27;s infrared albedo measured at 1.4, 2.1, 3.0, and 4.6 microns appears to match other dark Solar System small bodies, such as 2004 EW95.

=== Shape ===

The shape of Proteus is close to a sphere with a radius of about , although deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to ; scientists believe it is about as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200 km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.
=== Surface features ===

Proteus is heavily cratered, showing no sign of any geological modification. The largest crater, Pharos, has a diameter from . Its depth is about 10–15 km. The crater has a central dome on its floor a few kilometres high. Pharos is the only named surface feature on this moon. In Greek mythology, it refers to the island where Proteus reigned. In addition to Pharos, there are several craters 50–100 km in diameter and many more with diameters less than 50 km.

Other landforms on Proteus include linear features such as scarps, valleys, and grooves. The most prominent one runs parallel to the equator to the west of Pharos. These features likely formed as a result of the giant impacts, which formed Pharos and other large craters or as a result of tidal stresses from Neptune.

=== Named features ===
Protean craters are named after water-related spirits, gods, goddesses (excluding Greek and Roman names). As of May 2024, there is only one named crater on this body.

== Origin ==

Proteus, like the other inner moons of Neptune, is unlikely to be an original body that formed with it, and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after Triton&#x27;s capture. Triton&#x27;s orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian moons, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. Only after Triton&#x27;s orbit became circularised did some of the rubble disc re-accrete into the present-day moons of Neptune.

Proteus initially had a smaller orbit around Neptune, and may have formed closer to the planet. At the time of the formation of Proteus, its orbit was estimated to be less than its current distance from Neptune. Over time, Proteus migrated outward from Neptune through tidal interactions. During the outward migration of Proteus, collisions and impact events may have formed large craters and had ejected fragments of Proteus into orbit around Neptune. A collision of Proteus and another object could possibly explain the origin of Neptune&#x27;s smaller moon Hippocamp, which orbits close to Proteus.

<text>Forgotten Silver is a 1995 New Zealand mockumentary film that purports to tell the story of a pioneering New Zealand filmmaker. It was written and directed by Peter Jackson and Costa Botes, both of whom appear in the film in their roles as makers of the documentary.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Forgotten Silver&quot; purports to tell the story of &quot;forgotten&quot; New Zealand filmmaker Colin McKenzie, and the rediscovery of his lost films, which presenter Peter Jackson claims to have found in an old shed. McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and colour film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film, &quot;Salome&quot;, supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a &quot;computer enhancement&quot; of a McKenzie film proving that New Zealander Richard Pearse was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months before the Wright Brothers.

The film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton. It features deadpan commentary from actor/director Sam Neill and director and film archivist John O&#x27;Shea, as well as critical praise from international industry notables including film historian Leonard Maltin, and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films.

In reality, McKenzie is a fictional character, and the films featured in &quot;Forgotten Silver&quot; were all created by Peter Jackson, carefully mimicking the style of early cinema. The interviewees are all acting. Thomas Robins, the actor who portrays Colin McKenzie, is today more easily recognized by audiences as Sméagol&#x27;s ill-fated cousin Déagol in Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

==Cast==
As themselves:
* Jeffrey Thomas (narrator)
* Peter Jackson
* Johnny Morris
* Costa Botes
* Harvey Weinstein
* Leonard Maltin
* Sam Neill
* John O&#x27;Shea
* Marguerite Hurst
* Lindsay Shelton

Actors:
* Beatrice Ashton - Hannah McKenzie
* Thomas Robins - Colin McKenzie
* Richard Shirtcliffe - Brooke McKenzie
* Peter Corrigan - Stan &quot;the Man&quot; Wilson

== Production ==
Costa Botes directed the &quot;documentary&quot; portions while Peter Jackson created the &quot;archive footage&quot; supposedly filmed by McKenzie. Jackson also shot fake interviews in Los Angeles, including the one with Weinstein.

== Reception ==
The film was first aired on Television New Zealand&#x27;s channel TV ONE at a time usually dedicated to plays and mini-series, but was billed and introduced as a serious documentary. Many viewers were fooled until the directors shortly afterwards revealed that it was a hoax. This created controversy. The film was later screened at film festivals.

<doc id="170592" wikidata="Q1268397" url="?curid=170592" title="Chuck Barris">
<text>Charles Hirsch Barris (June 3, 1929 – March 21, 2017) was an American game show creator, producer, and host, author, and songwriter. A key crew member of several hugely successful game shows, he was the creator of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (1965-2021), the original producer of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; (1966-2013), and the host and producer of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; from 1977 to 1980, all for the network ABC.

His songwriting credits include &quot;Palisades Park&quot;, first recorded by Freddy Cannon in 1962 and also recorded by the Ramones in 1989, and he has authored three novels and four memoirs. Barris has made unsubstantiated claims that in parallel to his career on television, he was an active international assassin for the CIA in the 1960s and the 1970s, including in his 1984 memoir &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;, which was adapted into a 2002 film of the same name by director George Clooney and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, starring Sam Rockwell as Barris, and in which his alleged CIA career is mostly portrayed in an absurdist manner.

==Early life==
Barris was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 3, 1929, the son of Edith (née Cohen) and Nathaniel Barris, a dentist. He was raised in Lower Merion Township and attended Lower Merion High School. His uncle was singer, songwriter and actor Harry Barris. He graduated in 1953 from Drexel University where he was a columnist for the student newspaper, &quot;The Triangle&quot;.

==Career==
Barris got his start in television as a page and later was part of the staff at NBC in New York City. Following his stint at NBC, Barris worked as a standards-and-practices person at the television music show &quot;American Bandstand&quot; for ABC. Barris produced pop music for records and television, and wrote &quot;Palisades Park,&quot; which was recorded by Freddy Cannon and peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks (June 23–30, 1962) to become the biggest hit of Cannon&#x27;s career. Barris also wrote or co-wrote some of the music that appeared on his game shows.

Barris was promoted to the daytime programming division at ABC in Los Angeles and was responsible for determining which game shows the network would air. When Barris told his bosses at ABC that he felt the game show concepts being pitched were worse than his own ideas, they suggested that Barris quit his programming job and become a producer.

Barris formed his own production company, Chuck Barris Productions, on June 14, 1965. His first success came with &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, which aired in 1965 on ABC. The show was hosted by Jim Lange and featured three contestants who competed for a date with a person hidden from their view. The contestants&#x27; suggestive banter and its &quot;flower power&quot;-motif studio set were a revolution for the game show genre at the time. The show ran until 1980 and was twice revived, later in the 1980s and 1990s. A Celebrity version of the show began in June 2021.

In 1966, Barris launched &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, originally created by Nick Nicholson and E. Roger Muir, also for ABC. The combination of the newlywed couples&#x27; humorous candor and host Bob Eubanks&#x27;s sly questioning made the show another hit for Barris. The show is the longest lasting of any developed by his company, broadcast until 1985, for a total of 19 full years on both &quot;first run&quot; network TV and syndication. Interviewed on the NPR program &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on August 1, 2009, Barris said that &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; was the easiest program he had developed: &quot;All I needed was four couples, eight questions, and a washer-dryer.&quot;

Barris created several other short-lived game shows for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, all of which revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and often, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, or anger of the contestants or participants in the game. Barris also made several attempts through the years at non-game formats, such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a variety show staged at military bases akin to USO shows; a CBS revival of &quot;Your Hit Parade;&quot; and &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show,&quot; a Canada-based syndicated variety show for singer Bobby Vinton (produced in conjunction with Chris Bearde and Allan Blye). The last was his most successful program other than a game show.

===&quot;The Gong Show&quot;===

Somewhat shy, Barris disliked appearing on camera, though he once dashed onto the set of &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot; to throw a pie at emcee Geoff Edwards. However, Barris became a public figure in 1976 when he produced and served as the host of the talent show spoof &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, which he packaged in partnership with television producer Chris Bearde. The show&#x27;s cult following has endured, though it ran only two seasons on NBC (1976–78) and four in syndication (1976–80). As with some of Barris&#x27; other projects (including &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;), it was at one point possible to see &quot;The Gong Show&quot; twice daily, a relatively uncommon feat in the years prior to cable TV&#x27;s expansion into the commercial market.

The original host of the NBC show was John Barbour, who initially misunderstood the show&#x27;s concept and considered it to be a straight talent show, as opposed to Barris&#x27; parody concept. At the last minute, Barbour was dropped as host; to save the show, Barris followed the advice of an NBC executive who suggested that he should host his own show.

Though initially uneasy before the cameras, Barris soon settled in comfortably as the show&#x27;s host. His jokey, bumbling personality, his accentuated hand-clapping between sentences (which eventually had the studio audience joining in with him), and his catchphrases (he would usually go into commercial break with, &quot;We&#x27;ll be right back with more er ... STUFF ...&quot;, occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the later ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply &quot;STUFF&quot;, and &quot;This is me saying &#x27;bye&#x27;&quot; was one of his favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who emceed the syndicated version of the show in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing and wearing strange hats, pulled down and nearly covering his eyes. He became yet another performer of the show, and for many viewers, a cult hero. Dubbed &quot;Chuckie Baby&quot; by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show&#x27;s goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing &quot;cast of characters&quot;, including an NBC stage carpenter who played &quot;Father Ed,&quot; a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; stand-up comedian Murray Langston, who as &quot;The Unknown Comic&quot; wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex) and &quot;Gene Gene the Dancing Machine&quot;, who was arguably the most popular member of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; &quot;cast&quot;. Gene Gene was actually Gene Patton, the show&#x27;s stagehand, who would dance onto the stage whenever the band played the tune &quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Woodside&quot;. In the 1980s, long after &quot;The Gong Show&quot; had been cancelled, Patton was still being pointed out by NBC tour guides to crowds as his onscreen character, while working at his typical duties as an NBC stagehand.

One &quot;Gong Show&quot; episode consisted of every act appearing singing the song &quot;Feelings&quot;, which was popular at the time. One of its most infamous incidents came on the NBC version in 1978, when Barris presented an onstage act consisting of two teenage girls, slowly and suggestively sucking popsicles. Another incident was when during a &quot;Gene Gene, The Dancing Machine&quot; segment, Jaye P. Morgan opened her blouse to reveal her bare breasts.

In 1980, Barris directed and starred in &quot;The Gong Show Movie&quot;, which performed so poorly both critically and financially, it was pulled from theaters shortly after release. The film later achieved cult status and was released on Blu-ray in 2016.

&quot;The Gong Show&quot; has had four subsequent revivals, one under Barris&#x27; title (with Don Bleu) in 1988–1989, one on The Game Show Network in 2000 called &quot;Extreme Gong&quot; and another with current format owner Sony Pictures Television in 2008, hosted by stand-up comedian Dave Attell. A fourth version, produced by Will Arnett and hosted by fictional British celebrity &quot;Tommy Maitland&quot; (Mike Myers), aired on ABC beginning in 2017.

===Comebacks and setbacks===
Barris continued strongly until the mid-1970s, when ABC canceled the &quot;Dating&quot; and &quot;Newlywed&quot; games. This left Barris with only one show, his weekly syndicated effort &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot;, but the success of &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in 1976 encouraged him to revive the &quot;Dating&quot; and &quot;Newlywed&quot; games, as well as adding the &quot;$1.98 Beauty Show&quot; to his syndication empire. He also hosted a short lived prime time variety hour for NBC from February to April 1978, called &quot;The Chuck Barris Rah-Rah Show,&quot; essentially a non-competitive knock-off of &quot;Gong&quot;.

The empire crumbled again amid the burnout of another of his creations, the 1979–1980 &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (in which three sets of wives and secretaries competed to see who knew more about their husbands/bosses). This show provoked protests from both feminist and socially conservative groups, who charged that the show deliberately exploited adultery, to advocate it as a social norm. Most stations dropped this show months before the season was over as a response to those criticisms. At the same time, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; lost the sponsorships of Ford and Procter &amp; Gamble and earned the resentment of Jackie Autry, whose husband and business partner Gene Autry owned the show&#x27;s Los Angeles outlet and production base, KTLA, because of its supposedly highly prurient content. So strong were the feelings of the Autrys that &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; came close to being expelled from the KTLA facilities, but the show was discontinued by the syndicator before any action occurred. &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and &quot;The Dating Game&quot; also ended otherwise successful syndicated runs in 1980.

During the winter of 1980, Barris attempted to rebuild by bringing back another game show that was not an original of his, &quot;Camouflage&quot;, in which contestants answered questions for the chance to locate a &quot;hidden object&quot; (such as a toaster) concealed within a cartoon-type drawing. Although a noncontroversial format, it lasted only a short time in syndication. By September 1980, for the first time in his company&#x27;s history, Barris had no shows in production.

After a year&#x27;s inactivity, Barris revived &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; again in 1981 in partnership with the original 1950s version&#x27;s producer, Budd Granoff, who had become his business partner (the show itself was created by its original host, Jan Murray). Unlike with the 1970s version of &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, Barris did not have direct involvement with the production of the show itself. This revival, a five-day-a-week strip, lasted only one year.

After briefly living in France, Barris returned in 1984 and formed Barris Industries and a distribution unit called Bel-Air Program Sales (later Barris Program Sales) and an ad-sales barter called Clarion Communications (later Barris Advertising Sales). After a week-long trial of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; on ABC in 1984 (with &quot;Dating Game&quot; emcee Jim Lange), Barris produced the daily &quot;Newlywed Game&quot; (titled &quot;The New Newlywed Game&quot;) in syndication from 1985 to 1989, with original host Eubanks (and in 1988, comedian Paul Rodriguez). &quot;The Dating Game&quot; returned to syndication the next year for a three-year run (the first year hosted by Elaine Joyce, and the next two hosted by Jeff MacGregor). &quot;The Gong Show&quot; would also return for one season in 1988, now hosted by &quot;True&quot; Don Bleu. All of those shows (except for the one-week trial run of &quot;Newlywed&quot; on ABC) aired in syndication, not on the networks.

In 1987, Chuck Barris sold his shares of Barris Industriesto Burt Sugarman and returned to France, no longer directly involved in his media company. In 1988, Barris Industries acquired the Guber-Peters Company. On September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed as the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company. After the shows&#x27; runs ended, Sony Corporation acquired Guber-Peters Entertainment (formerly Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989, a day after Sony Corporation of Japan acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. The sale was completed on November 9, 1989. Sony revived &quot;Dating&quot; and &quot;Newlywed&quot; from 1996 to 1999. Sony also revived &quot;The Gong Show&quot; in 1998, this time as &quot;Extreme Gong&quot;, a Game Show Network (GSN) original production. &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; would be revived as &quot;All New Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, which, like &quot;Extreme Gong&quot;, was a GSN original. A few years after &quot;Extreme Gong&quot; ended, Sony planned to revive the show again under its classic name and format for The WB Television Network, but this version was never realized. Sony and MTV Networks&#x27; Comedy Central collaborated on a fourth &quot;Gong Show&quot; revival as &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot; in 2008; this did sell and aired on Comedy Central from July to September 2008.

One more attempt at reviving an old game show that was not his own originally resulted in an unsold pilot of the 1950s-era game &quot;Dollar a Second&quot;, hosted by Bob Eubanks. It had at least one showing on GSN, and has since become part of the collector/trader&#x27;s circuit. Two more unsold pilots were called &quot;Bamboozle&quot; and &quot;Comedy Courtroom&quot;.

In 2010, Barris published &quot;Della: A Memoir of My Daughter&quot; about the death of his only child, who died in 1998 after her long struggle with drug addiction.

==CIA career claims==
In 1984, Barris wrote an autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. In the book he states that he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an assassin in the 1960s and the 1970s in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. A 2002 feature film version, directed by George Clooney and starring Sam Rockwell, depicts Barris killing 33 people. Barris wrote a sequel to &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; in 2004 called &quot;Bad Grass Never Dies&quot;.

The CIA denied Barris ever worked for them in any capacity. After the release of the movie, CIA spokesman Paul Nowack said Barris&#x27; assertions that he worked for the spy agency &quot;[are] ridiculous. It&#x27;s absolutely not true&quot;.

In an interview on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; in 1984, Barris admitted to having made the story up. &quot;No, I was never a CIA hit man. I never did those things. I once applied for the CIA, and while I was going through the process I got a job and went on television. But I had always wondered what would have happened if I had done both.&quot; In an interview in 2010 with the Television Academy Foundation, he was asked if he had ever disclosed the truth to anyone, including his wife. &quot;No, never,&quot; Barris said. &quot;I&#x27;ll never say, one way or the other&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Barris&#x27; first wife was Lyn Levy, the niece of one of the founders of CBS. Their marriage lasted from 1957 to 1976, ending in divorce. Together they had a daughter, Della, who frequently appeared on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, usually introducing her father. Della died of an alcohol and cocaine overdose in 1998 at the age of 36. At the time of her death, she was HIV positive. In 1980, Barris married Robin Altman. They divorced in 1999. The following year, he married Mary Clagett.

Barris was diagnosed with lung cancer in the 1990s. After undergoing surgery to remove part of his lung, he contracted an infection and spent a month in intensive care.

Barris died on March 21, 2017, of natural causes at the age of 87 at his home in Palisades, New York, where he lived with Clagett.

<text>Stage management is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including overseeing of the rehearsal process and coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and provides complete organization to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

A stage manager is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or production stage manager, and one or more assistant stage managers.

==History==

The title of stage manager was not used until the 18th century, though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.

In the Middle Ages, there is evidence of a &quot;conducteur de secrets&quot;, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines; this was a common practice of the time.

Between the Renaissance and 17th century, the actors and playwrights handled stage management aspects and stage crew. In the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre there were two roles that covered stage management: stage keeper and bookkeeper. The stage keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The bookkeeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects.

Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management. Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare&#x27;s and Molière&#x27;s time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.

It was not until the 18th century in England that the term &quot;stage manager&quot; was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager&#x27;s job was split into two positions—&quot; director&quot; and &quot;stage manager&quot;.

Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as assistant stage managers. Writer and director Preston Sturges, for example, was employed as an ASM on Isadora Duncan&#x27;s production of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; at the age of 16 and a half:

When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nerve-wracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...

Sturges didn&#x27;t last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later Brock Pemberton hired him as an ASM on Antoinette Perry&#x27;s production of &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges&#x27; plays on Broadway, &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;, in 1929.

== Regional differences ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, &quot;stage manager&quot; is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as &quot;the stage manager&quot;. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled &quot;production stage manager&quot; (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more &quot;assistant stage managers&quot; (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as &quot;production stage manager&quot; (first or head stage manager), &quot;stage manager&quot; (second stage manager), and &quot;assistant stage manager&quot; (third stage manager).

Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union&#x27;s rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals. The American Guild of Variety Artists also represents variety performers, dancers and stage managers. Any show that is employing members of these unions must hire at least one stage manager that is also a member of that union.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A fringe theatre show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a West End theatre show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association, which also represents performers.
====Deputy stage manager====
The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes. The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.

====Assistant stage manager====
The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in. The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.

Due to the recent global rise in popularity of K-POP and mainstream cultural arts, Korean stage planners are playing a significant role worldwide. Typically, stage planners determine the timing and venue of performances and take responsibility for the entire process leading up to the completion of the event, acting as overall directors. They conduct thorough analyses on what performances people desire, whether similar events have already taken place, and if the emotional expression aligns with the intended message. Successful performances are scrutinized for the strategies used to captivate the audience. Those responsible for bringing the performances planned by stage planners to life on stage are the staff. Consequently, stage planners organize various staff members responsible for directing, choreography, music, stage design, lighting, costumes, makeup, etc. They also oversee the preparation process, secure the necessary funds, check preparations, and guide the director in staging scenes.
One of the most notable Korean stage planners is Kim Sang-wook, the CEO of PLAN A, who has orchestrated numerous performances, including the &#x27;Love Yourself&#x27; tour by BTS.

==Show control based venues==

Many live shows around the world are produced with the foreknowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. They may be on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, show control systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.

== Different areas of stage management ==

The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are opera, music and dance concerts, film and television.

For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.

== Stage managers and unions ==

Stage managers often ensure safe working conditions in the theatrical space by working closely with theatrical unions to keep rehearsals and performances on time, safe, and efficient.

=== Actors&#x27; Equity Association ===
Commonly referred to as Equity, AEA is the American union for stage managers and actors. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living conditions, livable wages, and benefits. 

=== Related Unions ===
American stage managers work closely with the following unions. Stage managers often have an in depth knowledge of their sister unions:

* IATSE: The union representing theatrical stage hands. IATSE also represents other crafts including makeup and hair designers, costume designers, child-actor guardians, and the film industry crafts. 
* USA: American entertainment industry union. In theatre they represents the scenic crafts. 
* AFM: Union representing American musicians and laborers
* Teamsters: Labor union representing transportation professionals
* DGA: Union representing film and television directors and stage managers
* SAG-AFTRA: Labor union representing media professionals including film and television actors

<text>Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in American English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;dialogue&quot; stems from the Greek (, ); its roots are (, ) and (, ). The first extant author who uses the term is Plato, in whose works it is closely associated with the art of dialectic. Latin took over the word as .

==As genre==
===Antiquity===
Dialogue as a genre in the Middle East and Asia dates back to ancient works, such as Sumerian disputations preserved in copies from the late third millennium BC, Rigvedic dialogue hymns, and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

In the West, Plato ( BC – BC) has commonly been credited with the systematic use of dialogue as an independent literary form. Ancient sources indicate, however, that the Platonic dialogue had its foundations in the &quot;mime&quot;, which the Sicilian poets Sophron and Epicharmus had cultivated half a century earlier. These works, admired and imitated by Plato, have not survived and we have only the vaguest idea of how they may have been performed. The &quot;Mimes&quot; of Herodas, which were found in a papyrus in 1891, give some idea of their character.

Plato further simplified the form and reduced it to pure argumentative conversation, while leaving intact the amusing element of character-drawing. By about 400 BC he had perfected the Socratic dialogue. All his extant writings, except the &quot;Apology&quot; and Epistles, use this form.

Following Plato, the dialogue became a major literary genre in antiquity, and several important works both in Latin and in Greek were written. Soon after Plato, Xenophon wrote his own &quot;Symposium&quot;; also, Aristotle is said to have written several philosophical dialogues in Plato&#x27;s style (of which only fragments survive). In the 2nd century CE, Christian apologist Justin Martyr wrote the &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, which was a discourse between Justin representing Christianity and Trypho representing Judaism. Another Christian apologetic dialogue from the time was the &quot;Octavius&quot;, between the Christian Octavius and pagan Caecilius.

===Japan===
In the East, in 13th century Japan, dialogue was used in important philosophical works. In the 1200s, Nichiren Daishonin wrote some of his important writings in dialogue form, describing a meeting between two characters in order to present his argument and theory, such as in &quot;Conversation between a Sage and an Unenlightened Man&quot; (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin 1: pp. 99–140, dated around 1256), and &quot;On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land&quot; (Ibid., pp. 6–30; dated 1260), while in other writings he used a question and answer format, without the narrative scenario, such as in &quot;Questions and Answers about Embracing the Lotus Sutra&quot; (Ibid., pp. 55–67, possibly from 1263). The sage or person answering the questions was understood as the author.

===Modern period===
Two French writers of eminence borrowed the title of Lucian&#x27;s most famous collection; both Fontenelle (1683) and Fénelon (1712) prepared &quot;Dialogues des morts&quot; (&quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;). Contemporaneously, in 1688, the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche published his &quot;Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion&quot;, thus contributing to the genre&#x27;s revival in philosophic circles. In English non-dramatic literature the dialogue did not see extensive use until Berkeley employed it, in 1713, for his treatise, &quot;Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous&quot;. His contemporary, the Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.&quot; A prominent 19th-century example of literary dialogue was Landor&#x27;s &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot; (1821–1828).

In Germany, Wieland adopted this form for several important satirical works published between 1780 and 1799. In Spanish literature, the &quot;Dialogues&quot; of Valdés (1528) and those on &quot;Painting&quot; (1633) by Vincenzo Carducci are celebrated. Italian writers of collections of dialogues, following Plato&#x27;s example, include Torquato Tasso (1586), Galileo (1632), Galiani (1770), Leopardi (1825), and a host of others.

In the 19th century, the French returned to the original application of dialogue. The inventions of &quot;Gyp&quot;, of Henri Lavedan, and of others, which tell a mundane anecdote wittily and maliciously in conversation, would probably present a close analogy to the lost mimes of the early Sicilian poets. English writers including Anstey Guthrie also adopted the form, but these dialogues seem to have found less of a popular following among the English than their counterparts written by French authors.

The Platonic dialogue, as a distinct genre which features Socrates as a speaker and one or more interlocutors discussing some philosophical question, experienced something of a rebirth in the 20th century. Authors who have recently employed it include George Santayana, in his eminent &quot;Dialogues in Limbo&quot; (1926, 2nd ed. 1948; this work also includes such historical figures as Alcibiades, Aristippus, Avicenna, Democritus, and Dionysius the Younger as speakers). Also Edith Stein and Iris Murdoch used the dialogue form. Stein imagined a dialogue between Edmund Husserl (phenomenologist) and Thomas Aquinas (metaphysical realist). Murdoch included not only Socrates and Alcibiades as interlocutors in her work &quot;Acastos: Two Platonic Dialogues&quot; (1986), but featured a young Plato himself as well. More recently Timothy Williamson wrote &quot;Tetralogue&quot;, a philosophical exchange on a train between four people with radically different epistemological views.

In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have proposed a holistic concept of dialogue. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and techniques for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.

==As topic==
Martin Buber assigns dialogue a pivotal position in his theology. His most influential work is titled &quot;I and Thou&quot;. Buber cherishes and promotes dialogue not as some purposive attempt to reach conclusions or express mere points of view, but as the very prerequisite of authentic relationship between man and man, and between man and God. Buber&#x27;s thought centres on &quot;true dialogue&quot;, which is characterised by openness, honesty, and mutual commitment.

The Second Vatican Council placed a major emphasis on dialogue within the church and with the world. Most of the council&#x27;s documents refer to some kind of dialogue: dialogue &quot;between the laity and their spiritual leaders&quot; (&quot;Lumen gentium&quot;), dialogue with other religions (&quot;Nostra aetate&quot;: &quot;dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other religions&quot;), dialogue with other Christians (&quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot;: &quot;fraternal dialogue on points of doctrine and the more pressing pastoral problems of our time&quot;), dialogue with modern society (: &quot;the rightful betterment of this world ... cannot be realized, ... apart from sincere and prudent dialogue&quot;), and dialogue with political authorities (Dignitatis humanae: &quot;[in] dialogue ... men explain to one another the truth they have discovered, or think they have discovered, in order thus to assist one another in the quest for truth&quot;). However, in the English translations of these texts, &quot;dialogue&quot; was used to translate two Latin words with distinct meanings, &quot;colloquium&quot; (&quot;discussion&quot;) and (&quot;dialogue&quot;). The choice of terminology appears to have been strongly influenced by Buber&#x27;s thought.

The physicist David Bohm originated a related form of dialogue where a group of people talk together in order to explore their assumptions of thinking, meaning, communication, and social effects. This group consists of ten to thirty people who meet for a few hours regularly or a few continuous days. In a Bohm dialogue, dialoguers agree to leave behind debate tactics that attempt to convince and, instead, talk from their own experience on subjects that are improvised on the spot.

In his influential works, Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin provided an extralinguistic methodology for analysing the nature and meaning of dialogue:
&quot;Dialogic relations&quot; have a specific nature: they can be reduced neither to the purely logical (even if dialectical) nor to the purely linguistic (compositional-syntactic) They are possible only between complete utterances of various speaking subjects... Where there is no word and no language, there can be no dialogic relations; they cannot exist among objects or logical quantities (concepts, judgments, and so forth). Dialogic relations presuppose a language, but they do not reside within the system of language. They are impossible among elements of a language.

The Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire, known for developing popular education, advanced dialogue as a type of pedagogy. Freire held that dialogued communication allowed students and teachers to learn from one another in an environment characterised by respect and equality. A great advocate for oppressed peoples, Freire was concerned with praxis—action that is informed and linked to people&#x27;s values. Dialogued pedagogy was not only about deepening understanding; it was also about making positive changes in the world: to make it better.

==As practice==

Dialogue is used as a practice in a variety of settings, from education to business. Influential theorists of dialogal education include Paulo Freire and Ramon Flecha.

In the United States, an early form of dialogic learning emerged in the Great Books movement of the early to mid-20th century, which emphasised egalitarian dialogues in small classes as a way of understanding the foundational texts of the Western canon. Institutions that continue to follow a version of this model include the Great Books Foundation, Shimer College in Chicago, and St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis and Santa Fe.

===Egalitarian dialogue===

Egalitarian dialogue is a concept in dialogic learning. It may be defined as a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.

===Structured dialogue===
Structured dialogue represents a class of dialogue practices developed as a means of orienting the dialogic discourse toward problem understanding and consensual action. Whereas most traditional dialogue practices are unstructured or semi-structured, such conversational modes have been observed as insufficient for the coordination of multiple perspectives in a problem area. A disciplined form of dialogue, where participants agree to follow a dialogue framework or a facilitator, enables groups to address complex shared problems.

Aleco Christakis (who created &quot;structured dialogue design&quot;) and John N. Warfield (who created &quot;science of generic design&quot;) were two of the leading developers of this school of dialogue. The rationale for engaging structured dialogue follows the observation that a rigorous bottom-up democratic form of dialogue must be structured to ensure that a sufficient variety of stakeholders represents the problem system of concern, and that their voices and contributions are equally balanced in the dialogic process.

Structured dialogue is employed for complex problems including peacemaking (e.g., Civil Society Dialogue project in Cyprus) and indigenous community development., as well as government and social policy formulation.

In one deployment, structured dialogue is (according to a European Union definition) &quot;a means of mutual communication between governments and administrations including EU institutions and young people. The aim is to get young people&#x27;s contribution towards the formulation of policies relevant to young peoples lives.&quot; The application of structured dialogue requires one to differentiate the meanings of discussion and deliberation.

Groups such as Worldwide Marriage Encounter and Retrouvaille use dialogue as a communication tool for married couples. Both groups teach a dialogue method that helps couples learn more about each other in non-threatening postures, which helps to foster growth in the married relationship.

===Dialogical leadership===
The German philosopher and classicist Karl-Martin Dietz emphasises the original meaning of dialogue (from Greek &quot;dia-logos&quot;, i.e. &#x27;two words&#x27;), which goes back to Heraclitus: &quot;The logos [...] answers to the question of the world as a whole and how everything in it is connected. Logos is the one principle at work, that gives order to the manifold in the world.&quot; For Dietz, dialogue means &quot;a kind of thinking, acting and speaking, which the logos &quot;passes through&quot;&quot; Therefore, talking to each other is merely one part of &quot;dialogue&quot;. Acting dialogically means directing someone&#x27;s attention to another one and to reality at the same time.

Against this background and together with Thomas Kracht, Karl-Martin Dietz developed what he termed &quot;dialogical leadership&quot; as a form of organisational management. In several German enterprises and organisations it replaced the traditional human resource management, e.g. in the German drugstore chain dm-drogerie markt.

Separately, and earlier to Thomas Kracht and Karl-Martin Dietz, Rens van Loon published multiple works on the concept of dialogical leadership, starting with a chapter in the 2003 book &quot;The Organization as Story&quot;.

===Moral dialogues===
Moral dialogues are social processes which allow societies or communities to form new shared moral understandings. Moral dialogues have the capacity to modify the moral positions of a sufficient number of people to generate widespread approval for actions and policies that previously had little support or were considered morally inappropriate by many. Communitarian philosopher Amitai Etzioni has developed an analytical framework which—modelling historical examples—outlines the reoccurring components of moral dialogues. Elements of moral dialogues include: establishing a moral baseline; sociological dialogue starters which initiate the process of developing new shared moral understandings; the linking of multiple groups&#x27; discussions in the form of &quot;megalogues&quot;; distinguishing the distinct attributes of the moral dialogue (apart from rational deliberations or culture wars); dramatisation to call widespread attention to the issue at hand; and, closure through the establishment of a new shared moral understanding. Moral dialogues allow people of a given community to determine what is morally acceptable to a majority of people within the community.

<doc id="170595" wikidata="Q39579" url="?curid=170595" title="Pomeranian dog">
<text>The Pomeranian (also known as a Pom, Pommy or Pome) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz.

The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian, and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria&#x27;s lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. As of 2017, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.

== Appearance ==
Pomeranians are small dogs weighing and standing high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.

The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, parti, and blue Merle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black, and cream/white.

== Behaviour==
Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises.

== Health ==
A UK study found a life expectancy of 12.2 years for the Pomeranian. A Japanese study of pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 14 years, below the average of 15.3 years for cross-breed dogs below 10kgs.

Pomeranians are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.

===Dermatological conditions===
The Pomeranian is significantly predisposed to alopecia X with Pomeranians comprising 79.3% of the case load of a referral clinic in Japan and 26.5% of an endocrine alopecia case load in the US.

===Skeletal conditions===
A study in England found the prevalence patellar luxation to be 6.5% in the Pomeranian, the highest prevalence out of all breeds in the study. A USA study found an odds ratio of 18.6 compared to crossbreeds. Another study in the US found the Pomeranian to make up 9.3% of the caseload. In Thailand prevalence was found as high as 75% in one study and a 28.9% caseload in another.

===Gastrointestinal conditions===
A study in the US found a prevalence of 0.29% for congenital portosystemic shunt, an odds ratio of 5.6 compared to mixed-breed dogs.

A Japanese study found the Pomeranian to be significantly predisposed to gallbladder mucocoele with an odds ratio of 7.74 compared to the overall referral population.

===Neurological conditions===
In case studies of atlantoaxial subluxation the Pomeranian was found to comprise 10.6% of cases in Japan, 46.7% in the UK, and 10.5% and 6.5% in the US.

===Other conditions ===
Merle-colored dogs may have mild to severe deafness, blindness, increased intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles may additionally have abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.
In case studies of referral clinics for tracheal collapse the Pomeranian made up 6%, 13.5%, and 16.7% of three referral caseloads in the US and 11.9% of a referral caseload in South Korea. In an Australian study on a referral population the Pomeranian had a 9.3% prevalence.

Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either one or both of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle.

In China, 54.6% of Pomeranians attending veterinary clinics were obese.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz. The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding that led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed&#x27;s introduction into the United Kingdom.

An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland&quot;. &quot;The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of.&quot; The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant&#x27;s &quot;A Tour in Scotland&quot; from 1769.

Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of Great Britain, brought two Pomeranians to England.

Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as , but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back.

Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named &quot;Windsor&#x27;s Marco&quot; and was reported to weigh only . When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately popular, and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colours from various European countries to add to her breeding program. Royal owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of France, and King George IV of the United Kingdom.

The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in the United States to the American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.

In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. A Pomeranian called &quot;Lady&quot;, owned by Margaret Bechstein Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat number seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number six.

Glen Rose Flashaway won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926, the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian, &quot;Great Elms Prince Charming II&quot;, to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel Club.

In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard, along with the Keeshond, by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

=== Popularity ===
The Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States, featuring consistently in the top 20 of registered American Kennel Club dog breeds since at least 1998, when it was ranked #10; the breed was #17 in the 2011 rankings, dropping two spots from the previous year. In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at #19. In 2015, the breed fell to #21, falling further to #22 in both 2016 and 2017.

It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008. In Australia their popularity has declined since 1986, with a peak of 1,128 Pomeranians registered with the Australian National Kennel Council in 1987; only 285 were registered in 2023.

<text>Sunnydale is the fictional setting for the American television drama &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). The series creator Joss Whedon conceived the town as a representation of a generic Californian city, as well as a narrative parody of the all-too-serene towns typical in traditional horror films.

Sunnydale is located on a &quot;Hellmouth&quot;; a portal &quot;between this reality and the next&quot;, and convergence point of mystical energies.

==Environment ==

===Sunnydale itself===
Sunnydale&#x27;s size and surroundings are implausible but justified given its origins — to sustain a human population for supernatural evils to prey upon. The town&#x27;s founder spared no expense to attract a populace, and Sunnydale thus contains many elements of a large city — which the show&#x27;s writers utilized fully for comic effect and narrative convenience. During the first three seasons, Sunnydale is shown to have 38,500 inhabitants, very few high schools, forty-three churches, a small private college, a zoo, a museum, and one modest main street. Even so, it has twelve gothic cemeteries. These cemeteries are so heavily used that services are sometimes held at night. Sunnydale is divided into five neighborhoods. The first is the entertainment district which contains the Bronze, Sunnydale&#x27;s nightclub, which attracts some well-known artists despite a clientele consisting mainly of high-school kids. The second consists of the alleys directly behind Bronze, housing the town&#x27;s surplus supply of pallets and cardboard. The high school makes up the third neighborhood. The fourth neighborhood is entirely occupied by a large graveyard, and finally, the suburban residential sprawl forms the last neighborhood. The prevalence of very nice homes is made possible by low property values resulting from frequent murders.

In later seasons it is revealed that Sunnydale contains a campus of the University of California system, as well as a profitable magic supply shop. The town is also seen to include a large park containing a creek and a lake, and one of its cemeteries is shown to be adjacent to a lake. Sunnydale has a number of parks: Weatherly Park, Glebe Park, Radcliff Park and Nelson Park are just some of the examples.

Sunnydale has a train station, a bus station, a small airport, and a small military base. There is also a seaport with a harbor deep enough to allow the docking of coastal freighters.

Directly beneath Sunnydale High School is a Hellmouth, a subterranean, mystical portal that attracts evil forces. This functions as a major plot device in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, as it explains why vampires and other demons are so prevalent in Sunnydale. Also beneath the school is a small pool of sea water with an outlet to the Pacific Ocean.

Sunnydale exhibits many common horror-movie characteristics, including an abundance of dark alleyways, abandoned mansions, and factories. The adult population is either clueless or perpetually in denial, in stark contrast to the demon-fighting, supernaturally aware teens.

By the show&#x27;s seventh season, set in 2002–03, the city&#x27;s population had fallen to 32,900. In the spring, the town was almost completely evacuated.

===Sunnydale&#x27;s surroundings===
Sunnydale is somewhat isolated.

The town is situated near several acres of woods and forest, including Miller&#x27;s Woods. Breaker&#x27;s Woods is a 45-minute drive from town.

Sunnydale is located on or near the Pacific Ocean. An ocean port with several docked ships is nearby. Kingman&#x27;s Bluff stands on a tall cliff overlooking the sea. There is a beach not too far away.

Close to or in Sunnydale is an old quarry house built beside a deep lake, located a few feet from a cliff edge. In addition, there is a hydroelectric dam in the vicinity of Sunnydale.

Within a day&#x27;s drive of Sunnydale is a desert. It is stated several times that Sunnydale is approximately two hours&#x27; drive north of Los Angeles.

In the final episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (&quot;Chosen&quot;), and also in the first issue of the &quot;Buffy: Season Eight&quot; comic book, Sunnydale is depicted being surrounded by desert terrain.

The episode &quot;Pangs&quot; reveals that Sunnydale is in the former homeland of the Chumash people, which is the area northwest of Los Angeles, centered on Santa Barbara County. The episode references a lost Spanish mission, which might be a reference to a historical mission originally located near Point Conception which was destroyed by an earthquake and relocated inland.

The episode &quot;Shadow&quot; (5.08) contains a telephone directory ad for the Magic Box, which uses an 805 area code. This would indicate that Sunnydale is located in Santa Barbara County, or possibly Ventura County or San Luis Obispo County (all are along the coast north of Los Angeles but south of Monterey).

===Maps of Sunnydale===
Maps of Sunnydale have appeared at various times during the show:

* A large map of &quot;Sunnydale County&quot; hangs on the wall of Principal Snyder&#x27;s office and also on the wall of Mayor Wilkins&#x27; office. This is actually a map of Santa Barbara County, California with the words &quot;Sunnydale County&quot; superimposed on it. According to this map, Sunnydale is located at a bend on the California coast. To the south and west of Sunnydale is the Pacific Ocean. Joss Whedon stated in November 1998 that &quot;Sunnydale is in fact near Santa Barbara.&quot;
* Giles uses a street map of Santa Barbara as a map of Sunnydale when he is plotting sightings of the Initiative commandos in the series&#x27; fourth season.
* A street map of central Sunnydale is used by the Scooby Gang twice in the seventh season.
* In the seventh season, Andrew draws a map of Sunnydale to track the First&#x27;s activities. The general shape of the coastline matches the map used in season three. According to Andrew&#x27;s map, there are woods between Sunnydale and the ocean to the west and to the south, and directly southeast of the town, at the location where the coast bends, there is a dark forest. There are also woods to the east of Sunnydale, as well as railroad tracks.

===Filming locations===
Various southern California locations are used as stand-ins for Sunnydale:

* The exterior shots, as well as some interior shots, of Buffy&#x27;s home are of an actual residence located in Torrance.
* The exterior shots of Sunnydale High School (seasons 1–3) are of Torrance High School in Torrance, California.
* The exterior shots of The Crawford Street Mansion (seasons 2–3) are of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Ennis House in Los Feliz near Griffith Park.
* Most of the University of California, Sunnydale scenes (season 4) were filmed at the University of California, Los Angeles, and in a closed sound stage designed to match the UCLA architecture. Some of the later scenes were filmed at a private business park.
* The exterior shots of Sunnydale City Hall is the Iowa Courthouse Building, an office building in Torrance.
* The exterior shots of New Sunnydale High School (season 7) were filmed at California State University, Northridge in Northridge, California.

==History==
===Prior to Buffy&#x27;s arrival===
Long before humans settled the area, a Hellmouth existed at the site of the future town of Sunnydale.

In ancient times, a magic scythe was used at the site of the Hellmouth &quot;to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the Earth.&quot; After this, the scythe was hidden, and its last guardian remained, waiting in a pagan temple that would somehow remain unnoticed for centuries.

Centuries later, the Navajo and Chumash peoples lived in this area along with one or more groups of monks and friars who also settled there. As in general Californian history, these friars are assumed to have been Spanish Franciscans, who arrived in California in the late 18th century. In 1812, there was an earthquake in the Sunnydale region that caused a cave-in during which an entire mission was lost; the very existence of the mission was soon forgotten. (The Mission La Purísima Concepción, originally sited near Point Conception and relocated to Lompoc would fit this description.)

Richard Wilkins arrived in California in the late 19th century, looking for gold. He founded Sunnydale (after considering the alternate names &quot;Happydale&quot; and &quot;Sunny Acres&quot;) in a demon infested valley after a Navajo Slayer died there in 1899. He made a pact with the demons to found a town atop the Hellmouth for them &quot;to feed on&quot;, in return for the promise of immortality by becoming a pure demon himself. Wilkins became Mayor of Sunnydale.

In the 1930s, there was at least one more major earthquake in Sunnydale. This caused a cave-in that swallowed up the Master and his lair, as well as the Satanist temple on Kingman&#x27;s Bluff. (The date of this earthquake is given as either 1932 or 1937, although it is possible these were two distinct quakes.)

Sometime in the 1980s or 1990s, Richard Wilkins was again elected mayor, now under the name of &quot;Richard Wilkins III&quot;, and served more than one term.

By the 1990s, Sunnydale appeared to have become a typical town on the California coast, with a popular mayor, a police force that Principal Snyder describes as &quot;deeply stupid,&quot; and a local newspaper (the &quot;Sunnydale Press&quot;). However, Mayor Wilkins had instructed the police to cover up any supernatural or mysterious violence occurring in the city and had directed Principal Snyder to conceal supernatural violence occurring at Sunnydale High.

==== Mystic artifacts ====
At some point in Sunnydale&#x27;s history, the following mystic artifacts were hidden throughout the town&#x27;s cemeteries and perhaps elsewhere:
* the du Lac Cross (found in &quot;What&#x27;s My Line, Part One&quot;)
* some, but not all, of the scattered remnants of the Judge (found and reassembled in &quot;Surprise&quot;); other pieces were found elsewhere and shipped to Sunnydale
* the Glove of Myhnegon (found in &quot;Revelations&quot;)
* the Amulet of Balthazar (found in &quot;Bad Girls&quot;)
* the Gem of Amara (found in &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot;)

===During the series===
The series begins when Buffy Summers, the current vampire slayer, moves to 1630 Revello Drive, and begins attending Sunnydale High School. There she meets new friends, including Willow Rosenberg, Xander Harris, and her new watcher, Rupert Giles. This &quot;Scooby Gang&quot;, eventually including popular cheerleader Cordelia Chase and Willow&#x27;s boyfriend Oz, often hangs out at the Bronze, the Espresso Pump (a local coffee house with a retro gas station motif) and the Sun Cinema. Buffy&#x27;s mother, Joyce, works in an art gallery in Sunnydale. (It is not clear whether or not she owns the gallery.)

During their time in high school, Buffy and her friends fight a number of vampires, most notably the Master, Angel, a vampire with a soul, who fell in love with Buffy; Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus (when Angel had lost his soul). Another slayer, Faith, arrives in their senior year of high school (season 3) and lives at the Downtowner Motel until she joins forces with Mayor Wilkins.

In the third season episode &quot;The Wish&quot;, Cordelia angrily wishes that Buffy Summers had never arrived in Sunnydale, and her wish is granted by vengeance demon Anyanka. Cordelia finds herself in an alternate universe where The Master has risen to the surface and completely taken over the town, with the surviving human population living in terror of the vampires. The school is sparsely populated; curfews are strict; humans wear crosses and drab colors to avoid attracting vampires; and almost all of the people she knew are either dead or have been turned into vampires.

At the end of the third season (June 1999), Sunnydale High School is destroyed in a great conflict that kills Mayor Wilkins and Principal Snyder. After this point, there is no mention in the television show of the political leaders of the city. The police occasionally appear, but the police chief does not. There is no further discussion of the police covering up supernatural evidence, although one newspaper headline suggests this may have continued.

As the fourth season begins (fall 1999), Buffy and Willow begin attending the University of California, Sunnydale. There they discover that the United States government was operating a &quot;black&quot; (secret) military unit, The Initiative, and has a laboratory and demon confinement complex in a cavern beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. The Initiative is closed down at the end of the season (spring 2000) after a climactic battle with the cyborg Adam. By this time, Tara Maclay and Anya have been added to the Scooby Gang. Later this same year, Giles purchases a magic shop named The Magic Box.

Sometime between the fourth and fifth seasons (during the summer of 2000), the mysterious &quot;Key&quot; is transformed into Buffy&#x27;s younger &quot;sister&quot;, Dawn Summers and the evil goddess Glory arrives in the town, leading to an increase in the number of mentally ill patients due to her ability to suck the sanity from their brains to maintain her own. The next year brings the deaths of Joyce Summers and Buffy herself (although Buffy is returned from the grave by a magic spell cast by Willow). After this point, Buffy and Dawn become co-owners of the family house.

Before Season 5&#x27;s end, a scene in the city would be shown at least once in the second season of &quot;Buffy&quot;″s spinoff, &quot;Angel&quot;. In the episode &quot;Disharmony&quot;, Cordelia Chase calls Willow from Los Angeles when her high school friend Harmony Kendall turns up. We see Willow&#x27;s side of this call in a rare Sunnydale scene for this series. Angel himself returns to Sunnydale at least four times in &quot;Buffy&quot; seasons 4, 5 and 7.

At the end of the sixth season (spring 2002), the Magic Box is demolished in a battle between Willow and Buffy. At the beginning of the seventh season (fall 2002), Sunnydale High School was rebuilt on the same location as before — directly over the Hellmouth.

By this time, knowledge of supernatural phenomena seems to be slowly growing in the town. Sunnydale&#x27;s population is also revealed to have dropped to 32,900.

In the second half of the seventh season (early 2003), supernatural manifestations at Sunnydale High reach unprecedented levels. Within less than a month, virtually the entire population of the town flees in a mass evacuation. Soon thereafter, the cataclysmic showdown between the Scooby Gang, the Potential Slayers Buffy has gathered together, and the First Evil results in the complete obliteration of the town. Sunnydale collapses into a giant pit, closing the entrance to the Hellmouth.

During the weeks between the series finale of &quot;Buffy&quot; and the Season 5 premiere of &quot;Angel&quot;, Lindsey McDonald makes an off-screen trip to the crater and digs up the amulet worn by Spike in the final battle. He sends it to Angel at Wolfram &amp; Hart where it releases an incorporeal Spike. The destruction of the city is mentioned several times during Angel&#x27;s final season, mainly tying into Spike&#x27;s brief ghostly status. It is seen one more time when a military general oversees the crater in Season 8. The destruction of the town has also led the U.S. government to brand the Scooby Gang and their Slayers an international terrorist group.

In the final arc of Season 8, the Scooby Gang return to the ruins of Sunnydale to secure the Seed of Wonder, an artifact that is the source of all magic on Earth, and serves as a battleground between themselves and a massive legion of extra-dimensional demons.

<doc id="170609" wikidata="Q1430745" url="?curid=170609" title="Albany International Airport">
<text>Albany International Airport is northwest of Albany, in Albany County, New York, United States. It is owned by the Albany County Airport Authority. ALB covers of land.

It is an airport of entry in the town of Colonie. It was built on the site of the Shaker settlement about north of Albany and stretching north to the hamlet of Verdoy. It is also located in close proximity to Interstate 87 and State Route 7. The airport is considered Class Charlie Airspace.

Albany International Airport serves as the major air center for the Capital Region, Northeastern New York, and Western New England. In 2019, the airport handled a total of 1,518,969 passengers, which was a 3.6% increase from 2018. Many airlines serve the airport, with Southwest Airlines having the most presence. They hold 34% of the total airline share at Albany. Along with Southwest Airlines, Albany sees service with many other low-cost carriers, including JetBlue Airways, Allegiant Airlines, and Avelo Airlines. The airport is the fourth largest in New York State.

== History ==
Albany International was the first and remains the oldest, municipal airport in the United States. In 1908 the airstrip was on a former polo field on Loudonville Road, north of the city in the town of Colonie. In 1909 the airport moved to Westerlo Island, in the city of Albany, but at that time was in the town of Bethlehem; the airport was named at this time. The airport was named after Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s son, Quentin, a fighter pilot during World War I who perished while in air combat. A $10,000 prize was established for sustained flight between Albany and New York City; Glenn Curtiss achieved this on May 29, 1910. Other early pioneers of aviation that stopped at this early field were Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, and James Doolittle.

Mayor John Boyd Thacher II once said &quot;a city without the foresight to build an airport for the new traffic may soon be left behind in the race for competition&quot;. He, therefore, decided to build in 1928 a new modern airport on the Shaker site near Albany-Shaker Road in Colonie, not far from the original polo fields used as the first site of the municipal airport. The Shakers not only sold the land used but also loaned the use of tractors and tools.

The early Albany Airport was often closed and threatened with a closure that prompted repeated improvements in the late 1930s and 1940s. The airport was closed from January 1939 until December 1940, when it reopened to traffic during daylight hours only, and then with no restrictions since January 1942. The airport has not been closed (other than for weather and emergency landings) since.

The February 1947 C&amp;GS chart shows three runways aimed at 12, 98, and 133 degrees magnetic. By 1950, the primary runway was up to in length and was hard-surfaced. In 1966 and 1967, the north–south runway was extended to . In the 1980s, the main runway was extended again to the north to . The east/west crosswind runway was also extended eastward to from in the early 2000s, but the landing threshold was maintained, thus the available landing distance was unchanged because of obstructions to the east, but the full length was available for takeoffs to the west. A few years later, another of the runway was added to the north end of the main runway to bring it to its length. The north–south runway gained runway centerline lighting and the north-facing runway added touchdown zone lighting to lower landing minimums - including a category two instrument landing system approach.

ALB was jointly owned and managed by the city and county of Albany until 1960 when Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd ended the city&#x27;s stake.

In 1962 a new terminal building opened. A landside building had ticket counters, a coffee shop, and baggage claim on the first floor and a restaurant, offices and viewing area on the second floor. A single-story boarding concourse extended outwards from this building. In 1968 this concourse was widened to allow more concessions and boarding space. The terminal was expanded again in 1979, with the addition of a new two-story building attached diagonally to the northwest. It had boarding gates for Allegheny Airlines on the second floor and baggage carousels on the first floor.

The Albany County Airport Authority was created by the county in 1993 with a 40-year lease to operate the airport in 1996. Construction of a new terminal began on May 16, 1996; it opened in June 1998. It was designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills and Stracher-Roth-Gilmore, and it was built around the existing terminal, most of which was demolished upon its completion. Only the 1979 extension remains from the old terminal building.

In 1999 the Airport Authority began building a addition to the new terminal for Southwest Airlines&#x27; use. The project was completed in 2000 and included the addition of two new dual jet bridges allowing passengers to board and deplane from front and rear doors of the aircraft.

Construction started in 2019 for various airport improvements. This includes a new 1,000 car parking garage, which will open in March 2020; new solar panels, escalators, energy efficient taxiway lighting, concessions are also being installed. In addition, some passenger jet bridges are being replaced.

Frontier Airlines &quot;temporarily&quot; left ALB in late 2022, leaving gate C1 without a use. It is unknown if Frontier intends to return to service in Albany in the future.

== Future ==
In September 2022, the upgrades were finished and the airport secured a large amount of funding to begin a new project. This project would extend the bridge that goes from the north garage to the main terminal, adding a new feel to walking through or driving under it. It will make space for concessions and retail to appear in those spaces. The project will also improve passenger flow for the airport, and will improve the inside of the airport overall. The project broke ground in December of 2023, and is expected to be completed in mid-2025.

== Service history ==
Between 1946 and 1961, American Airlines, TWA and Colonial/Eastern flew to Albany, but nonstop flights did not travel farther than New York City and Buffalo until 1967. Eastern left in 1961 and TWA left in 1965, leaving Mohawk and a few American flights. The first jets were American and Mohawk British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Elevens in late 1966; concurrently, runway 1/19 was extended south sometime in 1966–67, from .

Before airline deregulation in 1978, most flights at Albany were on &quot;trunk carriers&quot; (American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines) and &quot;local service carrier&quot; (Allegheny Airlines, which renamed itself USAir in 1979). After deregulation, many new airlines expanded to Albany. Most did not survive the 1980s.

Airlines at Albany after deregulation include:
* Braniff International Airways, which added Albany as part of an unsuccessful expansion in 1979. Albany was the only Upstate New York city served by the colorful Dallas-based airline that shut down in 1982.
* Empire Airlines, a regional carrier based in Utica, opened a hub at Syracuse Hancock International Airport after deregulation and operated flights from Albany and other Northeast cities with a fleet of regional jets and turboprops.
* Mall Airways, a commuter carrier, ran a hub at Albany in the 1980s; its small turboprops flew around the Northeast and into Canada.
* People Express Airlines, a low-cost carrier founded in 1981 with a hub at Newark International Airport. People grew quickly into a major carrier, but couldn&#x27;t maintain it and was purchased by Continental Airlines in 1986. Continental&#x27;s Continental Express and Continental Connection affiliates served Albany until the merger with United in 2010.
* Piedmont Airlines, a pre-deregulation local service carrier based in North Carolina, expanded to the Northeast with a hub at Baltimore–Washington International Airport; they flew to Albany from there. They bought Empire in 1985 and merged them into itself. In 1989 Piedmont was bought by USAir.
* Republic Airlines, an airline formed from the merger of three pre-deregulation local service carriers, began flying from Albany to their Detroit hub in 1984. They were bought by Northwest Airlines in 1987; Delta Air Lines bought Northwest in 2008 and took over their operations in 2009.
* TWA (Trans World Airlines) served Albany briefly around 1979–1981 during a short-lived experiment running a hub in Pittsburgh.
* United Airlines had long served Rochester and Buffalo, and added Albany and Syracuse in 1982. United and its affiliates serve Albany today.

During 1986–1987, the airline industry saw a series of mergers; after 1989, the US airline industry was dominated by six &quot;legacy carriers&quot;: American, United, Delta, Northwest, USAir, and Continental. All six served Albany themselves or by their regional affiliates. During the 1990s, Albany and other Upstate markets enjoyed little low-fare service, and the legacy carriers mostly kept fares high. Southwest Airlines&#x27; entry into Albany in 2000 brought a new era of low fare service.

== CommutAir hub ==

In early 2001, CommutAir (now CommuteAir) started to invest in an Albany hub. The hub was to connect a number of smaller cities in the Northeastern United States via the Albany hub. This allowed passengers to travel between cities that lack the demand for a direct flight between them while still bypassing busy, delay-prone hubs in major cities. These flights were operated under the Continental Connection brand using Beechcraft 1900Ds. The flights were scheduled in banks so that passengers would only have a 20-minute layover in Albany between flights, thereby minimizing travel times.

At its peak, CommutAir served Allentown, Bangor, Binghamton, Boston, Buffalo, Burlington, Elmira, Portland, Harrisburg, Nantucket, Wilkes-Barre, LaGuardia, Islip, Hartford, White Plains, Manchester, Providence, Syracuse, Rochester, Saranac Lake, Plattsburgh, Montréal, Ottawa. The hub was closed down in late 2005 to shift operations to Cleveland. A few of the markets did do well.

As of December 2023, CommuteAir operates several daily flights from Albany to its hub at Washington Dulles International Airport for United Express. CommuteAir also has one of its key maintenance bases at Albany, serving its ERJ-145 fleet. Previously CommuteAir&#x27;s main maintenance base was located at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, but CommuteAir moved the maintenance base to Albany in 2014.

== Main terminal and concourses ==
=== Main terminal ===
The main terminal is divided into two levels. Level 1 includes the main check-in area, baggage claim, car rental, and taxi services. Level 2 includes a public waiting area. The security checkpoint leads passengers to a central atrium and all three concourses.

=== Concourses ===
Concourse A was opened in 1998. The concourse currently hosts Allegiant Air and United. Concourse B hosts American, Delta, and JetBlue. Concourse C was opened in June 1998 as part of the airport&#x27;s $184 million renovation project. Concourse C has three gates, with two currently being used by Southwest, while the other is currently unassigned after being vacated by Frontier.

== Incidents and accidents ==

On September 16, 1953, American Airlines Flight 723, a Convair 240, was flying Boston-Springfield-Albany-Syracuse-Rochester-Buffalo-Detroit-Chicago when it crashed and caught fire after flying into a series of radio towers in a fog while descending for landing. All 28 occupants on board (25 passengers and three crew) were killed.

On March 3, 1972, Mohawk Airlines Flight 405, a Fairchild Hiller FH-227, crashed into a house in Albany, on approach to Albany County Airport. The crew had difficulty getting the cruise lock to disengage in one of the engines. While the crew attempted to deal with the problem, the aircraft crashed short of the airfield, killing 16 of the 48 people in the aircraft and one person on the ground.

On June 17, 2024, at approximately 8:15 A.M., a Piper PA-31 Navajo carrying one pilot took off from Runway 19 at the Albany International Airport only to crash minutes later next to neighborhood and library property in Colonie, killing the pilot. The plane was headed to Montreal, where the pilot had been returning after a previous landing in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Two members from the Federal Aviation Administration arrived to the scene of the crash along with several police vehicles and EMTs, with members from The National Transportation Safety Board travelling to Albany from Washington, D.C. to investigate.

<text>El Nuevo Día (English: &quot;The New Day&quot;) is the newspaper with the largest circulation in Puerto Rico. It is considered mainstream and the territory&#x27;s newspaper of record. It was founded in 1909 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and today it is a subsidiary of GFR Media. Its headquarters are in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

==History==
===El Dia===

El Nuevo Día was founded in 1909 in the city of Ponce as &quot;El Diario de Puerto Rico,&quot; later changing its name to &quot;El Día&quot; in 1911, a name it kept for nearly seven decades. Its founder was Guillermo V. Cintrón, with assistance from Eugenio Astol and Nemesio Canales. Its editorial staff consisted of Felix Matos Bernier, Juan Braschi, Nemesio R. Canales, Felix Astol, and Eugenio Deschamps.

In 1928 Guillermo V. Cintron sold the paper to Guillermo Vivas Valdivieso who formed an editorial team consisting of the three Gil De Lamadrid brothers (Jesus, Joaquin and Alfredo), Enrique Colon Barega, and Julio Enrique Monagas, and published the paper until 1945. Under his directorship the paper also started distribution in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 8 November 1945, the newspaper was acquired by Ponce native and future governor Luis A. Ferré. Its board of directors consisted of Raul Matos Balaguer, Arturo Gallardo Guerrero, Miguel Sotero Palermo, Juan A. Wirshing, and Luis A. Ferre. After Ferré was elected governor of Puerto Rico in 1968, his eldest son, Antonio Luis Ferré, purchased the paper from his father. The paper&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Y vivamos la moral, que es lo que nos hace falta&quot; (roughly, &quot;And let us live by the moral yardstick, which is what we lack).

===El Nuevo Día===
Two years after this, in 1970, Antonio Luis moved the newspaper to San Juan and renamed it &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;. The paper&#x27;s first director under Antonio Luis Ferre was Carlos Castañeda. During its first years in San Juan, El Nuevo Día&#x27;s newsroom was located in the &quot;Torre de la Reina&quot; building, near the Luis Muñoz Rivera Park in Puerta de Tierra. It subsequently moved, in 1986, to its current location municipality of Guaynabo.

&quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; continues to be owned and published by the Ferré family. The newspaper&#x27;s current president is María Eugenia Ferré Rangel and the current editor is Luis Alberto Ferré Rangel. As of 2006, El Nuevo Día is the most widely read newspaper in Puerto Rico, with a daily circulation of 155,000.

Its main competitor in terms of sales is &quot;El Vocero&quot;. Content-wise, both papers have somewhat different news formats and audiences. While &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; has been known largely for its political reporting, &quot;El Vocero&quot; has traditionally taken a more tabloid-oriented approach, giving greater prominence to news stories on daily street crime. More recently, however, &quot;El Vocero&quot; has begun to put greater emphasis to political and business news, making it a more direct competitor to &quot;El Nuevo Día.&quot;

In addition to its political and community sections, &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; also has sports, entertainment and business sections. Its previous television commercial campaign slogan read: &quot;El Nuevo Día: Un Gran Periodico&quot; (&quot;El Nuevo Día: A Great Newspaper&quot;). The campaign slogan recently changed to &quot;El Nuevo Día: Conocer es Crecer&quot; (&quot;El Nuevo Día: To Know is to Grow&quot;).

From 2003 to 2008, El Nuevo Día had an Orlando edition called &quot;El Nuevo Día Orlando&quot;. It started publication on 2 September 2003 and was published on weekdays. On 13 November 2009, the newspaper began to circulate free of charge. The paper printed 25,000 copies daily. A study showed that 96% percent of people who read the Orlando edition read it at home. The Orlando edition ceased publication on 29 August 2008.

<text>Aceh ( , ; , Jawi: ), officially the Province of Aceh (, , Jawi: ), is the westernmost province of Indonesia. It is located on the northern end of Sumatra island, with Banda Aceh being its capital and largest city. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the west, Strait of Malacca to the northeast, as well bordering the province of North Sumatra to the east, its sole land border, and shares maritime borders with Malaysia and Thailand to the east, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India to the north. Granted a special autonomous status, Aceh is a religiously conservative territory and the only Indonesian province practicing Sharia law officially. There are ten indigenous ethnic groups in this region, the largest being the Acehnese people, accounting for approximately 70% of the region&#x27;s population of about 5.5 million people in mid-2023. Its area is comparable to Croatia or Togo.

Aceh is where the spread of Islam in Indonesia began, and was a key factor of the spread of Islam in Southeast Asia. Islam reached Aceh (Kingdoms of Fansur and Lamuri) around 1250 AD. In the early 17th century the Sultanate of Aceh was the most wealthy, powerful and cultivated state in the Malacca Straits region. Aceh has a history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders, including the former Dutch colonists and later the Indonesian government.

Aceh has substantial natural resources of oil and natural gas. Aceh was the closest point of land to the epicenter of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which devastated much of the western coast of the province. Approximately 170,000 Indonesians were killed or went missing in the disaster. The disaster helped precipitate the peace agreement between the government of Indonesia and the separatist group of Free Aceh Movement.

== Name ==
Aceh was first known as Aceh Darussalam (1511–1945). Upon its formation in 1956 it bore the name Aceh before being renamed to the Daerah Istimewa Aceh (Aceh Special Region; 1959–2001), Nanggroë Aceh Darussalam (2001–2009), and back to Aceh (2009–present). In the past it was also spelled as &quot;Acheh&quot;, &quot;Atjeh&quot;, and &quot;Achin&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
According to several archaeological findings, the first evidence of human habitation in Aceh is from a site near the Tamiang River where shell middens are present. Stone tools and faunal remains were also found on the site. Archeologists believe the site was first occupied around 10,000 BCE.

=== Pre-Islamic Aceh ===

The history of Aceh stretches back to the Lambri Kingdom. Several documented references indicate that Hindu-Buddhist culture existed in the area before its Islamization.

The people of Lambri were described by Marco Polo as &quot;idolaters&quot;, who had a Maharaja as their ruler, a king in the Hindu political structure, likely meaning they were Hindus, Buddhists, or a combination thereof.

The inscription at Tanjore of Rajendra I documents the conquest of a land called &quot;llämuridesam&quot;, located at the northern tip of Sumatra. The Nagarakritagama documents the possessions of the Imperial Majapahit, and states that they control Barat, identified as the western coast of Aceh. Chinese records indicate that Aceh was under the control of the Sriwijaya.

Though many temples were left abandoned or converted into mosques, such as the Indrapuri Old Mosque, some evidence remains, such as the head of a stone sculpture of Avalokiteshvara Boddhisattva was discovered in Aceh. Images of Amitabha Buddhas adorn his crown in front and on each side. Srivijayan art estimated 9th-century CE collection of National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta. One of the few structural remains is the Indra Patra fort, which has several Hindu shrines. Historic names such as Indrapurba, Indrapurwa, Indrapatra, and Indrapuri, which refer to the God Indra, also indicate that Hinduism had a lasting and significant presence in this land.

=== Beginnings of Islam in Southeast Asia ===

Evidence concerning the initial coming and subsequent establishment of Islam in Southeast Asia is thin and inconclusive. The historian Anthony Reid has argued that the region of the Cham people on the south-central coast of Vietnam was one of the earliest Islamic centers in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, as the Cham people fled the Vietnamese, one of the earliest locations that they established a relationship was with Aceh. Furthermore, it is thought that one of the earliest centers of Islam was in the Aceh region. When Venetian traveller Marco Polo passed by Sumatra on his way home from China in 1292 he found that Peureulak was a Muslim town while nearby &#x27;Basma(n)&#x27; and &#x27;Samara&#x27; were not. &#x27;Basma(n)&#x27; and &#x27;Samara&#x27; are often said to be Pasai and Samudra but evidence is inconclusive. The gravestone of Sultan Malik as-Salih, the first Muslim ruler of Samudra, has been found and is dated AH 696 (AD 1297). This is the earliest clear evidence of a Muslim dynasty in the Indonesia-Malay area and more gravestones from the 13th century show that this region continued under Muslim rule. Ibn Batutah, a Moroccan traveller, passing through on his way to China in 1345 and 1346, found that the ruler of Samudra was a follower of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islam.

After the initial appearance of Islam in Aceh, it further spread into the coastal regions by the 15th century. Aceh soon became a cultural and scholastic Islamic center throughout Southeast Asia. It also became wealthy because it was a center of extensive trade.

The Portuguese apothecary Tome Pires reported in his early 16th-century book &quot;Suma Oriental&quot; that most of the kings of Sumatra from Aceh through Palembang were Muslim. At Pasai, in what is now the North Aceh Regency, there was a thriving international port. Pires attributed the establishment of Islam in Pasai to the &#x27;cunning&#x27; of the Muslim merchants. The ruler of Pasai, however, had not been able to convert the people of the interior.

=== Sultanate of Aceh ===
The Sultanate of Aceh was established by Sultan Ali Mughayat Syah in 1511.

In 1584–88 the Bishop of Malacca, D. João Ribeiro Gaio, based on information provided by a former captive called Diogo Gil, wrote the &quot;Roteiro das Cousas do Achem&quot; (Lisboa 1997) – a description of the sultanate.

Later, during its golden era, in the 17th century, its and political influence expanded as far as Satun in southern Thailand, Johor in Malay Peninsula, and Siak in what is today the province of Riau. As was the case with most non-Javan pre-colonial states, Acehnese power expanded outward by sea rather than inland. As it expanded down the Sumatran coast, its main competitors were Johor and Portuguese Malacca on the other side of the Straits of Malacca. It was this seaborne trade focus that saw Aceh rely on rice imports from north Java rather than develop self sufficiency in rice production.

After the Portuguese occupation of Malacca in 1511, many Islamic traders passing the Malacca Straits shifted their trade to Banda Aceh and increased the Acehnese rulers&#x27; wealth. During the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda in the 17th century, Aceh&#x27;s influence extended to most of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Aceh allied itself with the Ottoman Empire and the Dutch East India Company in their struggle against the Portuguese and the Johor Sultanate. Acehnese military power waned gradually thereafter, and Aceh ceded its territory of Pariaman in Sumatra to the Dutch in the 18th century.

By the early 19th century, however, Aceh had become an increasingly influential power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world&#x27;s supply of black pepper. The pepper trade produced new wealth for the sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh&#x27;s control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh&#x27;s integrity, but a new Sultan Tuanku Ibrahim, who controlled the kingdom from 1838 to 1870, reasserted power over nearby ports.

Under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 the British ceded their colonial possessions on Sumatra to the Dutch. In the treaty, the British described Aceh as one of their possessions, although they had no actual control over the sultanate. Initially, under the agreement the Dutch agreed to respect Aceh&#x27;s independence. In 1871, however, the British dropped previous opposition to a Dutch invasion of Aceh, possibly to prevent France or the United States from gaining a foothold in the region. Although neither the Dutch nor the British knew the specifics, there had been rumors since the 1850s that Aceh had been in communication with the rulers of France and of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Aceh War ===

Pirates operating from Aceh threatened commerce in the Strait of Malacca; the sultan was unable to control them. Britain was a protector of Aceh and gave the Netherlands permission to eradicate the pirates. The campaign quickly drove out the sultan but the local leaders mobilized and fought the Dutch in four decades of guerrilla war, with high levels of atrocities. The Dutch colonial government declared war on Aceh on 26 March 1873. Aceh sought American help but Washington rejected the request.

The Dutch tried one strategy after another over the course of four decades. An expedition under Major General Johan Harmen Rudolf Köhler in 1873 occupied most of the coastal areas. Köhler&#x27;s strategy was to attack and take the sultan&#x27;s palace. It failed. The Dutch then tried a naval blockade, reconciliation, concentration within a line of forts, and lastly passive containment. They had scant success. Reaching 15 to 20 million guilders a year, the heavy spending for failed strategies nearly bankrupted the colonial government. During the course of the war, the Dutch set up the Gouvernment of Atjeh and Dependencies under a governor, although it did not establish wider control of its territory until after 1908.

The Aceh army was rapidly modernized, and Aceh soldiers killed Köhler. Köhler made some grave tactical errors and the reputation of the Dutch was severely harmed. In recent years, in line with expanding international attention to human rights issues and atrocities in war zones, there has been increasing discussion about some of the recorded acts of cruelty and slaughter committed by Dutch troops during the period of warfare in Aceh.

Hasan Mustafa (1852–1930) was a chief &quot;penghulu&quot;, or judge, for the colonial government and was stationed in Aceh. He had to balance traditional Muslim justice with Dutch law. To stop the Aceh rebellion, Hasan Mustafa issued a fatwa, telling the Muslim population there in 1894, &quot;It is Incumbent upon the Indonesian Muslim to be loyal to the Dutch East Indies Government&quot;.

=== Japanese occupation ===
During World War II, Japanese troops occupied Aceh. The Acehnese &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars&#x27; Association (PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centered around Tjot Plieng village&#x27;s religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again. The religious ulama party gained ascendancy to replace district warlords (Ulèëbalang) party that formerly collaborated with the Dutch. Concrete bunkers still line the northernmost beaches.

=== Indonesian independence ===

After World War II, civil war erupted in 1945 between the district warlords party, that supported the return of a Dutch government, and the Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (PUSA) party that supported the newly proclaimed state of Indonesia. The ulama won, and the area remained free during the Indonesian War of Independence. The Dutch military itself never attempted to invade Aceh. The civil war raised the religious &quot;ulama&quot; party leader, Daud Bereueh, to the position of military governor of Aceh.

=== Acehnese rebellion ===
The Acehnese revolted soon after its inclusion into an independent Indonesia, a situation created by a complex mix of what the Acehnese regarded as transgressions against and betrayals of their rights.

Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, had reneged on his promise made on 16 June 1948 that Aceh would be allowed to rule itself in accordance with Islamic Law. Aceh was politically dismantled and incorporated into the province of North Sumatra in 1950. This resulted in the Acehnese Rebellion of 1953–59 which was led by Daud Beureu&#x27;eh who on 20 September 1953 declared a free independent Aceh under the leadership of Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosoewirjo. In 1959, the Indonesian government attempted to placate the Acehnese by offering wide-ranging freedom in matters relating to religion, education and culture.

=== Free Aceh Movement ===

During the 1970s, under an agreement with the Indonesian central government, American oil and gas companies began exploitation of Aceh natural resources. Alleged unequal distribution of profits between central government and the native people of Aceh induced Dr. Hasan Muhammad di Tiro, former ambassador of Darul Islam, to call for an independent Aceh. He proclaimed independence in 1976.

The movement had a small number of followers initially, and di Tiro himself had to live in exile in Sweden. Meanwhile, the province followed Suharto&#x27;s policy of economic development and industrialization. During the late 1980s several security incidents prompted the Indonesian central government to take repressive measures and to send troops to Aceh. Human rights abuse was rampant for the next decade, resulting in many grievances on the part of the Acehnese toward the Indonesian central government. In 1990, the Indonesian government initiated military operations against GAM by deploying more than 12,000 Indonesian troops in the region.

During the late 1990s, chaos in Java and an ineffective central government gave an advantage to the Free Aceh Movement and resulted in the second phase of the rebellion, this time with large support from the Acehnese people. This support was demonstrated during the 1999 plebiscite in Banda Aceh which was attended by nearly half a million people (of four million population of the province). The Indonesian central government responded in 2001 by broadening Aceh&#x27;s autonomy, giving its government the right to apply Sharia law more broadly and the right to receive direct foreign investment. This was again accompanied by repressive measures, however, and in 2003 an offensive began and a state of emergency was proclaimed in the province. The war was still ongoing when the tsunami disaster of 2004 struck the province.

In 2001, villagers from the North Aceh Regency sued ExxonMobil for human rights abuses at the hands of Indonesian military units hired by the company for security for its natural gas operations. ExxonMobil denied fault for the allegations. After a series of attacks against its operations, the company shut down its Arun natural gas operations in the province.

=== Tsunami disaster ===

The western coastal areas of Aceh, including the cities of Banda Aceh, Calang, and Meulaboh, were among the areas hardest-hit by the tsunami resulting from the magnitude 9.2 Indian Ocean earthquake on 26 December 2004. While estimates vary, over 170,000 people were killed by tsunami in Aceh and about 500,000 were left homeless. The tragedy of the tsunami was further compounded several months later, when the 2005 M8.6 Nias–Simeulue earthquake struck the sea bed between the islands of Simeulue Island in Aceh and Nias in North Sumatra. This second quake killed a further 1346 people on Nias and Simeulue, displaced tens of thousands more, and caused the tsunami response to be expanded to include Nias. The World Health Organisation estimates a 100% increase in prevalence of mild and moderate mental disorders in Aceh&#x27;s general population after the tsunami.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, misjudging the intensity of the Sumatra earthquake, sent out a bulletin that no tsunami was expected following a magnitude 8.0 quake based on historical data. Only when more accurate measurements of the quakes &gt;9.0 magnitude became available did scientists at the warning center realize they were dealing with a basin-wide tsunami across the Indian Ocean. When the tsunami hit, it was enormous, and the death toll in Aceh exceeded 100,000. There was no tsunami warning system in 2004. Tsunami warning systems have improved since the immense death toll drew international notice but in rural areas where many don&#x27;t have internet access or cell phones it remains a challenge to communicate warnings in a timely manner. A warning system was put in place at the request of Aceh residents but it was disabled in 2007 after technical issues and a false alarm that caused a panic.

The population of Aceh before the December 2004 tsunami was 4,271,000 (2004). The population as of 15 September 2005 was 4,031,589, and in January 2014 was 4,731,705. The 2020 census produced a total population of 5,274,871, comprising 2,647,563 males and 2,627,308 females.

As of February 2006, more than a year after the tsunami, a large number of people were still living in barrack-style temporary living centers (TLC) or tents. Reconstruction was visible everywhere, but due to the sheer scale of the disaster, and logistic difficulties, progress was slow. A study in 2007 estimated that 83.6% of the population had a psychiatric illness, while 69.8% suffers from severe emotional distress.

The ramifications of the tsunami went beyond the immediate impact to the lives and infrastructure of the Acehnese living on the coast. Since the disaster, the Acehnese rebel movement GAM, which had been fighting for independence against the Indonesian authorities for 29 years, has signed a peace deal (15 August 2005). The perception that the tsunami was punishment for insufficient piety in this proudly Muslim province is partly behind the increased emphasis on the importance of religion post-tsunami. This has been most obvious in the increased implementation of Sharia law, including the introduction of the controversial Wilayatul Hisbah or Syariah police. As homes are being built and people&#x27;s basic needs are met, the people are also looking to improve the quality of education, increase tourism, and develop responsible, sustainable industry. Well-qualified educators are in high demand in Aceh.
While parts of the capital Banda Aceh were unscathed, the areas closest to the water, especially the areas of Kampung Jawa and Meuraxa, were completely destroyed. Most of the rest of the western coast of Aceh was severely damaged. Many towns completely disappeared. Other towns on Aceh&#x27;s west coast hit by the disaster included Lhoknga, Leupung, Lamno, Patek, Calang, Teunom, and the island of Simeulue. Affected or destroyed towns on the region&#x27;s north and east coasts were Pidie Regency, Samalanga, and Lhokseumawe.

The area was slowly rebuilt after the disaster. The government initially proposed the creation of a two-kilometer buffer zone along low-lying coastal areas within which permanent construction was not permitted. This proposal was unpopular among some local inhabitants and proved impractical in most situations, especially fishing families that are dependent on living near to the sea.

The Indonesian government set up a special agency for Aceh reconstruction, the Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR) headed by Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, a former Indonesian government minister. This agency had ministry level of authority and incorporated officials, professionals and community leaders from all backgrounds. Most of the reconstruction work was performed by local people using a mix of traditional methods and partial prefabricated structures, with funding coming from many international organizations and individuals, governments, and the people themselves.

The Government of Indonesia estimated in their Preliminary Damage and Losses Assessment that damages amounted to US$4.5 billion (before inflation, and US$6.2 billion including inflation). Three years after the tsunami, reconstruction was still ongoing. The World Bank monitored funding for reconstruction in Aceh and reported that US$7.7 billion had been earmarked for the reconstruction whilst at June 2007 US$5.8 billion had been allocated to specific reconstruction projects, of which US$3.4 billion had actually been spent (58%).

In 2009, the government opened a US$5.6 million museum to commemorate the tsunami with photographs, stories, and a simulation of the earthquake that triggered the tsunami.

=== Peace agreement and contemporary history ===

The 2004 tsunami helped trigger a peace agreement between the GAM and the Indonesian government. The mood in post-Suharto Indonesia in the liberal-democratic reform period, as well as changes in the Indonesian military, helped create an environment more favorable to peace talks. The roles of newly elected president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and vice president Jusuf Kalla were highly significant. At the same time, the GAM leadership was undergoing changes, and the Indonesian military had inflicted so much damage on the rebel movement that it had little choice but to negotiate with the central government. The peace talks were first initiated by Juha Christensen, a Finnish peace activist, and then formally facilitated by a Finland-based NGO, the Crisis Management Initiative led by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari. The resulting peace agreement, generally known as the Helsinki MOU, was signed on 15 August 2005. Under the agreement Aceh would receive special autonomy and government troops would be withdrawn from the province in exchange for GAM&#x27;s disarmament. As part of the agreement, the European Union dispatched 300 monitors. Their mission expired on 15 December 2006, following local elections.

Aceh has been granted broader autonomy through Aceh government legislation covering special rights agreed upon in 2002 as well as the right of the Acehnese to establish local political parties to represent their interests. Human rights advocates protested that previous human rights violations in the province needed to be addressed, however.

== Biodiversity ==

Aceh has the largest range of biodiversity in the Asian Pacific region. including the Gunung Leuser National Park, 7,927 km2 national park that stretches across the border between Aceh and North Sumatra provinces The national park, located in the Barisan mountains, is close to Mount Leuser (3,119 m) and protects a variety of ecosystems, among the rarer large mammals are the Sumatran rhinoceros, Sumatran tiger, Orangutan and Sumatran elephant. In 2014, there were 460 Sumatran elephants in Aceh including at least eight baby elephants. The area has been suffering from deforestation since the 1970s. The first wood pulp mill in Aceh was built in 1982. The government of Aceh intends a law by which 1.2 million hectares would be opened for commercial use. This proposal has caused many protests.

== Government ==
Within the country, Aceh is governed not as a regular province but as a special autonomous province (&quot;daerah istimewa&quot;), an administrative designation intended to give the area increased from the central government in Jakarta. This has resulted in canings for crimes deemed to have violated sharia law such as gambling, drinking, skipping Friday prayers, and most notably homosexuality.

Regional elections have been held in Aceh in recent years for senior positions at the provincial, regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and district (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) levels. In the 2006 elections, Irwandi Yusuf was elected as the provincial governor for 2007–2012 and in elections in April 2012, Zaini Abdullah was elected as governor for 2012–2017.
=== Law ===
Beginning with the promulgation of Law 44/1999, Aceh&#x27;s governor began to issue limited Sharia-based regulations, for example requiring female government employees to wear Islamic dress. These regulations were not enforced by the provincial government, but as early as April 1999, reports emerged that groups of men in Aceh were engaging in vigilante violence in an effort to impose Sharia, for example, by conducting &quot;jilbab raids,&quot; subjecting women who were not wearing Islamic headscarves to verbal abuse, cutting their hair or clothes, and committing other acts of violence against them. The frequency of these and other attacks on individuals considered to be violating Sharia principles appeared to increase following the enactment of Law 44/1999 and the governor&#x27;s Sharia regulations. In 2014, a group of scholars who call themselves Tadzkiiratul Ummah, started to paint the pants of men and women as a call for heavier Islamic law enforcement in the area.

Upon the enactment of the Special Autonomy Law in 2001, Aceh&#x27;s provincial legislature enacted a series of &quot;qanuns&quot; (local laws) governing the implementation of Sharia. Five qanuns enacted between 2002 and 2004 contained criminal penalties for violations of Sharia: Qanun 11/2002 on &quot;belief, ritual, and promoting Islam,&quot; which contains the Islamic attire requirement; Qanun 12/2003 prohibiting the consumption and sale of alcohol; Qanun 13/2003 prohibiting gambling; Qanun 14/2003 prohibiting &quot;seclusion&quot;; and Qanun 7/2004 on the payment of Islamic alms. With the exception of gambling, none of the offenses are prohibited outside of Aceh.

Responsibility for enforcement of the qanuns rests both with the National Police and with a special Sharia police force unique to Aceh, known as the Wilayatul Hisbah (Sharia Authority). All of the qanuns provide for penalties including fines, imprisonment, and caning, the latter a punishment unknown in most parts of Indonesia. Between mid-2005 and early 2007, at least 135 people were caned in Aceh for transgressing the qanuns. In April 2016, a 60-year-old non-Muslim woman was sentenced to 30 lashes for selling alcohol drinks. The controversy is that qanun is not allowed for non-Muslim person, and national law should be used instead as in other parts of Indonesia.

In April 2009, Partai Aceh won control of the local parliament in Aceh&#x27;s first post-war legislative elections. In September 2009, one month before the new legislators were to take office, the outgoing parliament unanimously endorsed two new qanuns to expand the existing criminal Sharia framework in Aceh.

*One bill, the &quot;Qanun on Criminal Procedure&quot; (Qanun Hukum Jinayat), to create an entirely new procedural code for the enforcement of Sharia by police, prosecutors, and courts in Aceh.
*The other bill, the &quot;Qanun on Criminal Law&quot; (Qanun Jinayat), reiterated the existing criminal Sharia prohibitions, at times enhancing their penalties, and a host of new criminal offenses, including ikhtilat (intimacy or mixing), zina (adultery, defined as willing intercourse by unmarried people), sexual harassment, rape, and homosexual conduct. The law authorized punishments including up to 60 lashes for &quot;intimacy,&quot; up to 100 lashes for engaging in homosexual conduct, up to 100 lashes for adultery by unmarried persons, and death by stoning for adultery by a married person.

However, the then proposed bylaws was met with widespread condemnations from all of Indonesia and then governor Irwandi Yusuf refused to sign the bylaw, thereby keeping it a law without legal force and, in some views, therefore still a law &quot;draft&quot;, rather than actual law. In March 2013, the Aceh government removed the stoning provision from its own draft of a new criminal code.

Caning

In practice since the introduction of the new laws, there has been a considerable increase in the use of the penalties provided set out in the laws. As an example, in August 2015 six men in Bireuën Regency were arrested and caned for betting on the names of passing buses. And it was reported that on just one day, 18 September 2015, a total of 34 people were caned in Banda Aceh and in the nearby regency of Aceh Besar.

Two gay men are to be publicly lashed 85 times each under sharia law after being filmed by vigilantes in Indonesia. An Islamic court in the province of Aceh passed down its first sentence for homosexuality on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, 17 May 2017 in spite of international appeals to spare the couple.

Whipping is the common hudud punishment for gambling, adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex. Typically the whipping has been done by men. In 2020, with increased enforcement and more crimes being conducted by women, Aceh authorities say they are trying to follow Islamic law, which calls for women to whip female perpetrators.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Administratively, the province now is subdivided into eighteen regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and five autonomous cities (&quot;kota&quot;). The capital and the largest city is Banda Aceh, located on the coast near the northern tip of Sumatra. When originally devised in 1956, the province comprised the city of Banda Aceh and six regencies – Aceh Besar, Pidie, North Aceh, East Aceh, Central Aceh, and West Aceh; however on 14 November 1956 a seventh regency (South Aceh) was created from the southeastern districts of West Aceh Regency. A second city (Sabang City) was separated from Aceh Besar on 10 June 1965 and Southeast Aceh Regency from part of Central Aceh on 4 June 1974; three additional regencies were formed in 1999 – Aceh Singkil from part of South Aceh Regency on 20 April, and Bireuen (from part of North Aceh Regency) and Simeulue (from part of West Aceh Regency) on 4 October.

The towns of Lhokseumawe and Langsa were given separate city status (from parts of North Aceh Regency and of East Aceh Regency respectively) on 21 June 2001, and five additional regencies were created on 10 April 2002 – Aceh Jaya and Nagan Raya (both from parts of West Aceh Regency), Aceh Tamiang (from part of East Aceh Regency), Gayo Lues (from part of Southeast Aceh Regency) and Southwest Aceh (from part of South Aceh Regency). Bener Meriah Regency was created on 19 December 2003 (from part of Central Aceh Regency), and Pidie Jaya Regency (from part of Pidie Regency) and Subulussalam City (from part of Aceh Singkil Regency) on 2 January 2007. Some other local areas are pushing to create new autonomous areas, usually with the stated goal of enhancing local control over politics and development.

The cities and regencies (subdivided into the 289 districts or &quot;kecamatan&quot; of Aceh), are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the officially estimated population as at mid 2024.

Note: UU is an abbreviation from Undang-Undang (the Indonesia statute of law).

Aceh is unique in Indonesia in grouping its villages into mukims. These are sometimes related to traditional indigenous communities. Beginning in September 2023, the Indonesian government provided legal recognition to the claims of some mukims over customary forests.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The Aceh I Electoral District consists of 12 of the regencies in the province (Simeulue, Aceh Singkil, South Aceh, Southeast Aceh, West Aceh, Aceh Besar, Pidie, Southwest Aceh, Aceh Jaya, Gayo Lues, Nagan Raya and Pidie Jaya), together with the cities of Bandar Aceh, Sabang and Subulussalam, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The Aceh II Electoral District consists of the remaining 6 regencies (East Aceh, Central Aceh, Bireuen, North Aceh, Aceh Tamiang and Bener Meriah), together with the cities of Langsa and Lhokseumawe, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Economy ==
In 2006, the economy of Aceh grew by 7.7% after having minimal growth since the devastating tsunami. This growth was primarily driven by the reconstruction effort with massive growth in the building/construction sector.

The ending of the conflict, and the reconstruction program resulted in the structure of the economy changing significantly since 2003. Service sectors played a more dominant role whilst the share of the oil and gas sectors continued to decline.

Note: ... = less than 0.5%

After peaking at around 40% in December 2005, largely as a result of the Dutch disease impact of sudden aid flows into the province, inflation declined steadily and was 8.5% in June 2007, close to the national level in Indonesia of 5.7%. Persistent inflation means that Aceh&#x27;s consumer price index (CPI) remains the highest in Indonesia. As a result, Aceh&#x27;s cost competitiveness has declined as reflected in both inflation and wage data. Although inflation has slowed down, CPI has registered steady increases since the tsunami. Using 2002 as a base, Aceh&#x27;s CPI increased to 185.6 (June 2007) while the national
CPI increased to 148.2. There have been relatively large nominal wage increases in particular sectors, such as construction where, on average, workers&#x27; nominal wages have risen to almost Rp.60,000 per day, from Rp.29,000 pre-tsunami. This is also reflected in Aceh&#x27;s minimum regional wage (UMR, or Upah Minimum Regional), which increased by 55% from Rp.550,000 pre-tsunami to Rp.850,000 in 2007, compared with an increase of 42% in neighboring North Sumatra, from Rp.537,000 to Rp.761,000.

Poverty levels increased slightly in Aceh in 2005 after the tsunami, but by less than expected. The poverty level then fell in 2006 to below the pre-tsunami level, suggesting that the rise in tsunami-related poverty was short lived and reconstruction activities and the end of the conflict most probably facilitated this decline. However, poverty in Aceh remains significantly higher than in the rest of Indonesia. A large number of the Acehnese remain vulnerable to poverty, reinforcing the need for further sustained efforts at development in the post-tsunami construction period.

== Demographics ==
The population of Aceh was not adequately documented during the Indonesia 2000 census because the insurgency complicated the process of collecting accurate information. An estimated 170,000 people died in Aceh in the 2004 tsunami which further complicates the task of careful demographic analysis. According to the most recent censuses, the total population of Aceh in 2010 was 4,486,570, in 2015 was 4,993,385, and in 2020 was 5,274,871. The official estimate for mid 2023 was 5,482,527 (comprising 2,753,176 males and 2,729,351 females); however, the sum of the official population estimates for the individual regencies and cities totalled 5,512,219 people.

=== Ethnic and cultural groups ===
Aceh is a diverse region occupied by several ethnic and language groups. The major ethnic groups are the Acehnese (who are distributed throughout Aceh), Gayo (in central and eastern part), Alas (in Southeast Aceh Regency), Tamiang-Malays (in Aceh Tamiang Regency), Aneuk Jamee (descendant from Minangkabau, concentrated in southern and southwestern), Kluet (in South Aceh Regency), Singkil (in Singkil and Subulussalam), Simeulue and Sigulai (on Simeulue Island). There is also a significant population of Chinese, among the present day Acehnese can be found some individuals of Arab, Turkish, and Indian descent.

=== Languages ===

The Acehnese language is widely spoken within the Acehnese population. This is a member of the Aceh-Chamic group of languages, whose other representatives are mostly found in Vietnam and Cambodia, and is also closely related to the Malay group of languages. Acehnese also has many words borrowed from Malay and Arabic and traditionally was written using Arabic script. Acehnese is also used as local language in Langkat and Asahan (North Sumatra), and Kedah (Malaysia), and once dominated Penang. Aside from the Indonesian language, Acehnese is also designated as the co-official regional language of Aceh under Qanun Number 10 of 2022.

Alas and Kluet are closely related languages within the Batak group. The Jamee language originated from Minangkabau language in West Sumatra, with just a few variations and differences.

=== Religion ===

According to 2022 data of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Aceh is overwhelmingly Muslim-majority where they dominate Aceh with more than 98%. Only 1.15% of population are Protestants, 0.13% Buddhism and 0.1% Catholics.
Religious issues are often sensitive in Aceh. There is very strong support for Islam across the province, and sometimes other religious groups – such as Christians or Buddhists – feel that they are subject to social or community pressure to limit their activities. The official explanation for this action, supported by both the governor of Aceh Zaini Abdullah and the Indonesian home affairs minister Gamawan Fauzi from Jakarta, was that the churches did not have the appropriate permits. Earlier in April 2012, a number of churches in the Singkil regency in southern Aceh had also been ordered to close. In response, some Christians voiced concern about these actions. In 2015 a church was burned down and another attacked in which a Muslim rioter was shot, causing President Joko Widodo to call for calm.

=== Human rights ===
Caning has increasingly been used as a form of judicial punishment in Aceh. This is backed by the governor of Aceh. At least 72 people were caned for various offences, including drinking alcohol, being alone with someone of the opposite sex who was not a marriage partner or relative (khalwat), gambling and for being caught having gay sex. The Acehnese authorities passed a series of by-laws governing the implementation of Sharia after the enactment of the province&#x27;s Special Autonomy Law in 2001. In 2016 alone, 100 public caning cases were documented by human rights organizations.

In January 2018, the Aceh police, with support from the Aceh autonomous government, raided hair salons known to have LGBT clients and staff as part of an &quot;operasi penyakit masyarakat&quot; (&quot;community sickness operation&quot;). The police abused all LGBT citizens within the premises of the parlors and arrested twelve transgender women. The arrested trans women were stripped topless, had their heads shaved, and were forced to chant insults at themselves as part of a process &quot;until they really become men&quot;. The intent of the incident was to reverse what officials deemed a &quot;social disease&quot; and that parents were coming to them upset at the increasing number of LGBT individuals in Aceh. The event was decried by human rights organizations local and worldwide, such as Amnesty International. Usman Hamid stated for the Indonesia branch of the organization that &quot;cutting the hair of those arrested to &#x27;make them masculine&#x27; and forcing them to dress like men are forms of public shaming and amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, in contravention of Indonesia&#x27;s international obligations&quot;.

==Tourism==

Aceh has many tourist destinations, especially natural, historical and cultural tourism. With a fairly long coastline, several archipelagos, and a large forest area, Aceh offers many tourism options, one of the famous natural attractions in Aceh is other famous natural attractions are mountainous areas such as in Tangse and the Gayo Highlands, Ulu Masen Nature Reserve, Gunung Leuser National Park and Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve, Lake Laut Tawar, Sabang and Rondo Island. while for historical and cultural tourism, Aceh also has several favorite destinations for tourists, including the Aceh Tsunami Museum, Aceh Museum, Museum Samudra Pasai, Gunongan Historical Park and Baiturahman Mosque.

==Culture ==

Aceh has a variety of distinctive arts and culture.
=== Traditional weapon ===
*Rencong is a type of dagger, a traditional weapon of the Acehnese people. The shape resembles the letter L, and when viewed more closely the form is bismillah calligraphy.

In addition to rencong, the Acehnese people also possessed several other special weapons, such as sikin panyang, peurise awe, peurise teumaga, siwah, geuliwang and peudeueng.

=== Traditional house ===

Aceh&#x27;s traditional house is called &quot;Rumoh Aceh&quot;. This house is a type of house on stilts with three main parts and one additional section. The three main parts of the Aceh house are the &quot;seuramoë keuë&quot; (front porch), &quot;seuramoë teungoh&quot; (middle porch) and &quot;seuramoë likôt&quot; (back porch). Another additional part is the &quot;rumoh dapu&quot; (kitchen house).

=== Dance ===

Traditional Acehnese dances illustrate traditional heritage, religion, and local folklore. Acehnese dances are generally performed in groups, in which a group of dancers are of the same sex, and there are standing or sitting positions. When viewed from the accompanying music, the dances can be grouped into two types; namely accompanied by the vocal and percussion of the dancer&#x27;s own body, and accompanied by an ensemble of musical instruments. Some dances that are famous at the national and even world level are dances originating from Aceh, such as the Rateb Meuseukat Dance and the Saman dance.

=== Cuisine ===

Acehnese cuisine uses combinations of spices found in Indian and Arabic cuisine, include ginger, pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and fennel. A variety of Acehnese foods are cooked with curry or curry spices and coconut milk, which are generally combined with meat, such as buffalo meat, beef, lamb, fish and chicken. Certain recipes have traditionally used cannabis as a seasoning; which is also found in some other Southeast Asian dishes such as in Laos, but now the material is no longer used. Dishes native to Aceh include nasi gurih, mie aceh, mi caluk and timphan.

=== Literature ===
Aceh has a tradition of oral literature, such as the folktale &quot;The king of the parakeets&quot;.

The oldest Acehnese manuscripts that can be found are from 1069 H (1658/1659 AD), namely Hikayat Seuma&#x27;un.

Before Dutch colonialism (1873–1942), almost all Acehnese literature was in the form of poetry known as Hikayat. Very little is in the form of prose and one of them is the Book of Bakeu Meunan which is a translation of the book Qawaa&#x27;id al-Islaam.

It was only after the arrival of the Dutch that Acehnese writings appeared in the form of prose, in the 1930s, such as Lhee Saboh Nang written by Aboe Bakar and De Vries. It was only afterward that various forms of prose appeared, but still remained dominated by the form of Hikayat.

== Transportation ==

<doc id="170626" wikidata="Q535356" url="?curid=170626" title="Stephen Walt">
<text>Stephen Martin Walt (born July 2, 1955) is an American political scientist serving as the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of international relations at the Harvard Kennedy School. A member of the realist school of international relations, Walt has made important contributions to the theory of neorealism and has authored the balance of threat theory. Books that he has authored or coauthored include &quot;Origins of Alliances&quot;, &quot;Revolution and War&quot;, and &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Walt was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where his father, a physicist, worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His mother was a teacher. The family moved to the Bay Area when Walt was about eight months old. Walt grew up in Los Altos Hills. He pursued his undergraduate studies at Stanford University. He first majored in chemistry with an eye to becoming a biochemist but then shifted to history and finally to international relations. After attaining his BA, Walt began graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley and graduated with a MA in political science in 1978 and a PhD in political science in 1983.

==Career==
Walt taught at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, where he served as master of the Social Science Collegiate Division and deputy dean of social sciences. As of 2015, he holds the Robert and Renee Belfer Professorship in International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School.

===Other professional activities===
Walt was elected a fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in May 2005. He spoke at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University in 2010. In 2012, Walt took part in a panel at the one-state solution conference at the Kennedy School, along with Ali Abunimah and Eve Spangler. Walt spoke at Clark University in April 2013. He gave a talk at the College of William &amp; Mary in October 2013: &quot;Why US Foreign Policy Keeps Failing.&quot; He delivered the 2013 F. H. Hinsley Lecture at Cambridge University.

==Opinions==
===American power and culture===
On the twentieth anniversary of the war against Iraq, Walt characterized the rules-based world order as &quot;a set of rules that we [the US] had an enormous role in writing, and of course which we feel free to violate whenever it&#x27;s inconvenient for us to follow them.&quot; In the comprehensive 2005 article &quot;Taming American Power&quot;, Walt argued that the US should &quot;make its dominant position acceptable to others—by using military force sparingly, by fostering greater cooperation with key allies, and, most important of all, by rebuilding its crumbling international image.&quot; He proposed for the US to &quot;resume its traditional role as an &#x27;offshore balancer, to intervene &quot;only when absolutely necessary&quot;, and to keep &quot;its military presence as small as possible.&quot; In a late 2011 article for &quot;The National Interest&quot;, &quot;The End of the American Era&quot;, Walt wrote that the US was losing its position of world dominance.

Walt gave a speech in 2013 to the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, &quot;Why does US foreign policy keep failing?&quot; The institute later described him as seeing &quot;an overwhelming bias among US foreign policy institutions toward an activist foreign policy&quot; and &quot;a propensity to exaggerate threats, noting the chances of being struck by lightning have been far greater since 2001 than death by terrorist attack.&quot; He also characterized the US as lacking &quot;diplomatic skill and finesse&quot; and advised Europeans &quot;to think of themselves and not rely on the US for guidance or advice on solving their security issues.&quot; Ultimately, he argued that &quot;the United States is simply not skilled enough to run the world.&quot;

In 2013, Walt asked &quot;Why are Americans so willing to pay taxes in order to support a world-girdling national security establishment, yet so reluctant to pay taxes to have better schools, health care, roads, bridges, subways, parks, museums, libraries, and all the other trappings of a wealthy and successful society?&quot; He said that the question was especially puzzling given that &quot;the United States is the most secure power in history and will remain remarkably secure unless it keeps repeating the errors of the past decade or so.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
A critic of military interventionism, Walt stated:

===Europe===
In 1998, Walt wrote that &quot;deep structural forces&quot; were &quot;beginning to pull Europe and America apart&quot;. Walt argued that NATO must be sustained because of four major areas in which close co-operation is beneficial to European and American interest.
# Defeating international terrorism; Walt saw a need for cooperation between Europe and the United States in managing terrorist networks and stopping the flow of money to terror cells.
# Limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction; Walt argued that anti-proliferation efforts are most successful when Europe and the US work in concert to bring loose nuclear material into responsible custody. He cited the case of Libya&#x27;s willingness to abandon its nascent fission program after being pressured multilaterally as evidence of this.
# Managing the world economy; lowering barriers to trade and investment particularly between the US and the EU would accelerate economic growth. Notable differences in trade policy stem mainly in areas of agricultural policy.
# Dealing with failed states; failed states are breeding grounds for anti-Western movements. Managing failed states such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Somalia require a multinational response since the US has insufficient wealth to modernise and rebuild these alone. In this area, European allies are especially desirable because they have more experience with peacekeeping and &quot;nation-building&quot;.

===Eastern Europe and Russia===
In 2015, a year after Russia invaded Crimea, Walt wrote that extending invitations for NATO membership to countries in the former Soviet bloc is a &quot;dangerous and unnecessary goal&quot; and that Ukraine ought to be a &quot;neutral buffer state in perpetuity.&quot; He further argued that, although Obama had refrained from arming Ukraine, doing so would be &quot;a recipe for a longer and more destructive conflict&quot;. The Obama administration avoided arming Ukraine for the duration of its term, in keeping with Walt&#x27;s strategy, but the Trump administration angered Russia by approving a plan to provide anti-tank missiles in 2017.

===Middle East===
Walt said in December 2012 that America&#x27;s &quot;best course in the Middle East would be to act as an &#x27;offshore balancer&#x27;: ready to intervene if the balance of power is upset, but otherwise keeping our military footprint small. We should also have normal relationship with states like Israel and Saudi Arabia, instead of the counterproductive &#x27;special relationships&#x27; we have today.&quot; An article by Walt entitled &quot;What Should We Do if the Islamic State Wins? Live with it.&quot; appeared on June 10, 2015, in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine. He explained his view that the Islamic State was unlikely to grow into a longlasting world power on &quot;Point of Inquiry&quot;, the podcast of the Center for Inquiry in July 2015.

===Israel===
Walt has been a critic, along with his co-author John Mearsheimer of the offensive neorealism school of international relations, of the Israel lobby in the United States and the influence he says that it has on its foreign policy. He wrote that Barack Obama erred by breaking with the principles in his Cairo speech by allowing continued Israeli settlement and by participating in a &quot;well-coordinated assault&quot; against the Goldstone Report.

Walt suggested in 2010 that State Department diplomat Dennis Ross&#x27;s alleged partiality toward Israel might make him give Obama advice that was against US interests. Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), defended Ross and criticized Walt in a piece published by &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, which had published Walt&#x27;s piece a few days earlier. Satloff wrote that Ross&#x27;s connection to WINEP is innocuous (Ross was a distinguished fellow at WINEP throughout George W. Bush&#x27;s administration, and Mearsheimer and Walt&#x27;s book described WINEP as &quot;part of the core&quot; of the Israel lobby in the United States) and that Walt mistakenly believes that the US cannot simultaneously &quot;advance strategic partnership both with Israel and with friendly Arab and Muslim states.&quot;

After the Itamar attack, in which a Jewish family was killed on the West Bank in March 2011, Walt condemned the murderers but added that &quot;while we are at it, we should not spare the other parties who have helped create and perpetuate the circumstances.&quot; He listed &quot;every Israeli government since 1967, for actively promoting the illegal effort to colonize these lands,&quot; &quot;Palestinian leaders who have glorified violence,&quot; and &quot;the settlers themselves, some of whom routinely use violence to intimidate the Palestinians who live in the lands they covet.&quot;

Walt criticized the US for voting against a Security Council resolution condemning Israel&#x27;s West Bank settlements and called the vote a &quot;foolish step&quot; because &quot;the resolution was in fact consistent with the official policy of every president since Lyndon Johnson.&quot;

===Iran===
Walt has frequently criticized America&#x27;s policy with respect to Iran. In 2011, Walt told an interviewer that the American reaction to an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in the United States &quot;might be part of a larger American diplomatic effort to put Iran on the hot seat.&quot; In December 2012, Walt wrote, &quot;Washington continues to insist on a near-total Iranian capitulation. And because Iran has been effectively demonized here in America, it would be very hard for President Obama to reach a compromise and then sell it back home.&quot;

Walt said in November 2013, &quot;Americans often forget just how secure the United States is, especially compared with other states,&quot; thanks to its power, resources, and geography, and thus &quot;routinely blows minor threats out of all proportion. I mean: Iran has a defense budget of about $10 billion... yet we manage to convince ourselves that Iran is a Very Serious Threat to US vital interests. Ditto the constant fretting about minor-league powers like Syria, North Korea, Muammar al-Qaddafi&#x27;s Libya, and other so-called &#x27;rogue states.&#x27;&quot; Therefore, whatever happens in the Middle East, &quot;the United States can almost certainly adjust and adapt and be just fine.&quot;

===Libya===
After visiting Libya, Walt wrote in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; in January 2010 that while &quot;Libya is far from a democracy, it also doesn&#x27;t feel like other police states that I have visited. I caught no whiff of an omnipresent security service—which is not to say that they aren&#x27;t there. … The Libyans with whom I spoke were open and candid and gave no sign of being worried about being overheard or reported or anything like that. … I tried visiting various political websites from my hotel room and had no problems, although other human rights groups report that Libya does engage in selective filtering of some political websites critical of the regime. It is also a crime to criticize Qaddafi himself, the government&#x27;s past human rights record is disturbing at best, and the press in Libya is almost entirely government-controlled. Nonetheless, Libya appears to be more open than contemporary Iran or China and the overall atmosphere seemed far less oppressive than most places I visited in the old Warsaw Pact.&quot;

David E. Bernstein, Foundation Professor at the George Mason University School of Law, criticized Walt in 2011 for accepting funding from the Libyan government for a trip to Libya in which he addressed that country&#x27;s Economic Development Board and then wrote what Bernstein called &quot;a puff piece&quot; about his visit. Bernstein said it was ironic that &quot;Walt, after fulminating about the American domestic &#x27;Israel Lobby&#x27; &quot; had thus become &quot;a part of the &#x27;Libya lobby.&#x27; &quot; Bernstein also found it ironic that &quot;Walt, a leading critic of the friendship the US and Israel, concludes his piece with the hope &#x27;that the United States and Libya continue to nurture and build a constructive relationship.&#x27; Because, you know, Israel is so much nastier than Qaddafi&#x27;s Libya.&quot;

Under the headline &quot;Is Stephen Walt Blind, a Complete Fool, or a Big Liar?&quot;, Martin Peretz of the &quot;New Republic&quot; mocked Walt for praising Libya, which Peretz called a &quot;murderous place&quot; and for viewing its dictator as &quot;civilized.&quot; Peretz contrasted Walt&#x27;s view of Libya, which, Peretz noted, he had visited for less than a day.

===Syria===
In August 2013, Walt argued that even if it turned out that Bashar al-Assad of Syria had used chemical weapons, the US should not intervene. &quot;Dead is dead, no matter how it is done,&quot; wrote Walt. &quot;Obama may be tempted to strike because he foolishly drew a &#x27;red line&#x27; over this issue and feels his credibility is now at stake. But following one foolish step with another will not restore that lost standing.&quot;

===China===
Walt posits that offshore balancing is the most desirable strategy to deal with China. In 2011, Walt argued that China will seek to gain regional hegemony and a broad sphere of influence in Asia, which was comparable in size to the US position in the Western Hemisphere. If that happens, he predicts that China would be secure enough on the mainland to give added attention to shaping events to its favour in far flung areas. Since China is resource-poor, it will likely aim to safeguard vital sea lanes in areas such as the Persian Gulf. In a December 2012 interview, Walt said that &quot;the United States does not help its own cause by exaggerating Chinese power. We should not base our policy today on what China might become twenty or thirty years down the road.&quot;

===Balance of threat theory===
Walt developed the balance of threat theory, which defined threats in terms of aggregate power, geographic proximity, offensive power, and aggressive intentions. It is a modification of the &quot;balance of power&quot; theory, whose framework was refined by neorealist Kenneth Waltz.

===Snowden case===
In July 2013, Walt argued that Obama should give Edward Snowden an immediate pardon. &quot;Mr. Snowden&#x27;s motives,&quot; wrote Walt, &quot;were laudable: he believed fellow citizens should know their government was conducting a secret surveillance programme enormous in scope, poorly supervised and possibly unconstitutional. He was right.&quot; History, Walt suggested, &quot;will probably be kinder to Mr Snowden than to his pursuers, and his name may one day be linked to the other brave men and women—Daniel Ellsberg, Martin Luther King Jr., Mark Felt, Karen Silkwood and so on—whose acts of principled defiance are now widely admired.&quot;

==Books==
In his 1987 book &quot;The Origins of Alliances&quot;, Walt examines the ways in which alliances are made and &quot;proposes a fundamental change in the present conceptions of alliance systems.&quot; &quot;Revolution and War&quot; (1996) exposes &quot;the flaws in existing theories about the relationship between revolution and war&quot; by studying in detail the French, Russian, and Iranian Revolutions and providing briefer views of the American, Mexican, Turkish, and Chinese Revolutions. &quot;Taming American Power&quot; (2005) provides a thorough critique of US strategy from the perspective of its adversaries. Anatol Lieven called it &quot;a brilliant contribution to the American foreign policy debate.&quot; &quot;The Hell of Good Intentions: America&#x27;s Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of U.S. Primacy&quot; was published on 16 October 2018.

===&quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;===
In March 2006, John Mearsheimer and Walt, then academic dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, published a working paper, &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;, as well as an article entitled &quot;The Israel Lobby&quot; in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, on the negative effects of &quot;the unmatched power of the Israel Lobby&quot;. They defined the Israel lobby as &quot;the loose coalition of individuals and organizations who actively work to steer US foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction&quot;. Mearsheimer and Walt took this position, &quot;What the Israel lobby wants, it too often gets.&quot;

The articles, as well as the bestselling book that Walt and Mearsheimer later developed, generated considerable media coverage throughout the world. Contending that Walt and Mearsheimer are members of a &quot;school that essentially wishes that the war with jihadism had never started&quot;, Christopher Hitchens concluded that &quot;wishfulness has led them to seriously mischaracterize the origins of the problem.&quot; Former US ambassador Edward Peck wrote that the &quot;tsunami&quot; of responses condemning the report proved the existence of the lobby and &quot;Opinions differ on the long-term costs and benefits for both nations, but the lobby&#x27;s views of Israel&#x27;s interests have become the basis of US Middle East policies.&quot;

==Personal life==
Walt is married to Rebecca E. Stone, who ran for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the 2018 election. They have two children.

<text>In traditional Japanese aesthetics, is centered on the acceptance of and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of appreciating beauty that is &quot;imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete&quot; in nature. It is prevalent in many forms of Japanese art.

 is a composite of two interrelated aesthetic concepts, and . According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, may be translated as &quot;subdued, austere beauty,&quot; while means &quot;rustic patina.&quot; is derived from the Buddhist teaching of the , specifically , and .

Characteristics of aesthetics and principles include asymmetry, roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and the appreciation of both natural objects and the forces of nature.

==Description==
 can be described as &quot;the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of what we think of as traditional Japanese beauty. It occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese of aesthetic values as do the Greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the West.&quot; Another description of by Andrew Juniper notes that, &quot;If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be .&quot; For Richard Powell, &quot; nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.&quot;

When it comes to thinking about an English definition or translation of the words &quot;wabi&quot; and &quot;sabi&quot; Andrew Juniper explains that, &quot;They have been used to express a vast range of ideas and emotions, and so their meanings are more open to personal interpretation than almost any other word in the Japanese vocabulary.&quot; Therefore, an attempt to directly translate &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; may take away from the ambiguity that is so important to understanding how the Japanese view it.

After centuries of incorporating artistic and Buddhist influences from China, eventually evolved into a distinctly Japanese ideal. Over time, the meanings of and changed to be more lighthearted and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honored as tantamount to the first step to or enlightenment. In today&#x27;s Japan, the meaning of is often condensed to &quot;wisdom in natural simplicity&quot;. In art books, it is typically defined as &quot;flawed beauty&quot;. artworks often emphasize the process of making the piece and that it is ultimately incomplete.

From an engineering or design point of view, may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; in this instance, could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or the limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word . Although the kanji characters for &quot;rust&quot; are not the same as in , the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ) are believed to be one and the same.

 and both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the Mahayana Buddhist view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and transcendence to a simpler life. Since Mahayana philosophy predicates that genuine understanding is reached through experience rather than words, may best be appreciated non-verbally.

Although the and concepts are religious in origin, actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual, in keeping with the syncretic nature of Japanese belief.

==Education==

In one sense is a training whereby the student of learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. can change the student&#x27;s perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time.

== History ==
Wabi-sabi has roots in ancient Chinese Taoism and Zen Buddhism. It started to shape Japanese culture when the Zen priest Murata Jukō (村田珠光, 1423–1502) modified the tea ceremony. He introduced simple, rough, wooden and clay instruments to replace the gold, jade, and porcelain of the Chinese style tea service that was popular at the time. About one hundred years later, the tea master Sen no Rikyū (千利休, 1522 – April 21, 1591) introduced wabi-sabi to the royalty with his design of the teahouse. &quot;He constructed a teahouse with a door so low that even the emperor would have to bow in order to enter, reminding everyone of the importance of humility before tradition, mystery, and spirit.&quot;

== In Japanese arts ==
At first, something that exhibited wabi-sabi qualities could only be discovered; it could be &quot;found in the simple dwellings of the farmers that dotted the landscape, epitomized in neglected stone lanterns overgrown with moss or in simple bowls and other household utensils used by the common folk.&quot; However, towards the end of the late medieval period, the ruling class began using these aesthetic values to intentionally create &quot;tea ceremony utensils, handicrafts, tea ceremony rooms and cottages, homes, gardens, even food and sweets, and above all manners and etiquette.&quot;

Many forms of Japanese art have been influenced by Zen and Mahayana philosophy over the past thousand years, with the concepts of the acceptance and contemplation of imperfection, and constant flux and impermanence of all things being particularly important to Japanese arts and culture. Accordingly, many Japanese art forms can be seen to encapsulate and exemplify the ideals of &quot;wabi-sabi&quot;.

=== Garden design ===

Japanese gardens started out as very simple open spaces that were meant to encourage kami, or spirits, to visit. During the Kamakura period Zen ideals began to influence the art of garden design in Japan. Temple gardens were decorated with large rocks and other raw materials to build Karesansui or Zen rock gardens. &quot;Their designs imbued the gardens with a sense of the surreal and beckoned viewers to forget themselves and become immersed in the seas of gravel and the forests of moss. By loosening the rigid sense of perception, the actual scales of the garden became irrelevant and the viewers were able to then perceive the huge landscapes deep within themselves.&quot;

==== Tea gardens ====
Due to the tea garden’s close relationship with the tea ceremony, &quot;the tea garden became one of the richest expressions of wabi sabi.&quot; These small gardens would usually include many elements of wabi-sabi style design. They were designed in a way that set the scene for the visitor to make their own interpretations and put them in the state of mind in order to participate in the tea ceremony.

=== Poetry ===
Japanese poetry such as tanka and haiku are very short and focus on the defining attributes of a scene. &quot;By withholding verbose descriptions the poem entices the reader to actively participate in the fulfillment of its meaning and, as with the Zen gardens, to become an active participant in the creative process.&quot; One of the most famous Japanese poets, Basho, was credited with establishing sabi as definitive emotive force in haiku. Many of his works, as with other wabi-sabi expressions, make no use of sentimentality or superfluous adjectives, only the &quot;devastating imagery of solitude.&quot;

=== Ceramics ===

As the preference for the more simplistic and modest was on the rise, Zen masters found the ornate ceramics from China less and less attractive and too ostentatious. Potters began to experiment with a more free expression of beauty and strayed away from uniformity and symmetry. New kilns gave potters new colors, forms, and textures, allowing them to create pieces that were unique and nonuniform. These potters used a specific kind of firing which was thought to produce the best ceramics due to the part played by nature and the organic ash glazes, a clear embodiment of wabi-sabi.

For example: Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu&#x27;s (本阿弥 光悦; 1558 – 27 February 1637) white raku bowl called &quot;Mount Fuji&quot; (Shiroraku-Chawan, Fujisan) listed as a national treasure by the Japanese government.

Kintsugi, a specific technique that uses gold lacquer to repair broken pottery, is considered a wabi-sabi expression.

=== Flower arrangement ===
Sen no Rikyu saw the rikka style that was popular at the time and disliked its adherence to formal rules. He did away with the formalism and the opulent vases from China, using only the simplest vases for the flower displays (chabana) in his tea ceremonies. Instead of using more impressive flowers, he insisted on the use of wildflowers. &quot;Ikebana, like the gardens, uses a living medium in the creative process, and it is this ingredient of life that brings a unique feel to flower arrangements.&quot;

Ikebana then became a very important part of the tea ceremony, and the flowers were treated with the utmost respect. &quot;When a tea-master has arranged a flower to his satisfaction he will place it on the tokonoma, the place of honour in a Japanese room. It rests there like an enthroned prince, and the guests or disciples on entering the room will salute it with a profound bow before making their addresses to the host.&quot;

=== Other examples ===
 (the traditional (bamboo flute) music of wandering Zen monks)

A contemporary Japanese exploration of the concept of can be found in the influential essay &quot;In Praise of Shadows&quot; by Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki.

Other examples include:
* The cultivation of bonsai (miniature trees) – a typical bonsai design features wood with a rough texture, pieces of deadwood, and trees with hollow trunks, all intended to highlight the passage of time and nature. Bonsai are often displayed in the autumn or after they have shed leaves for the winter, in order to admire their bare branches.
* Tea ceremony.

==Influence upon the West==

 has been employed in the Western world in a variety of contexts, including in the arts, technology, media, and mental health, among others.

===The arts===
Many Western designers, writers, poets and artists have utilised ideals within their work to varying degrees, with some considering the concept a key component of their art, and others using it only minimally.

* Designer Leonard Koren (born 1948) published &quot;for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers&quot; (1994) as an examination of , contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren&#x27;s book subsequently &quot;became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes.&quot; This is the book that first introduced the term &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; into Western aesthetic discourse.
* concepts historically had extreme importance in the development of Western studio pottery; Bernard Leach (1887–1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics and techniques, which is evident in his foundational book &quot;A Potter&#x27;s Book&quot;.
* The work of American artist John Connell (1940–2009) is also considered to be centered on the idea of ; other artists who have employed the idea include former Stuckist artist and remodernist filmmaker Jesse Richards (born 1975), who employs it in nearly all of his work, along with the concept of .
* Some haiku in English also adopt the aesthetic in written style, creating spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience, such as Nick Virgilio&#x27;s &quot;autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind&quot;.

===Technology===
During the 1990s, the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in agile programming and wiki, used to describe acceptance of the ongoing imperfection of computer programming produced through these methods.

===Mental health===
Wabi-sabi has been evoked in a mental health context as a helpful concept for reducing perfectionist thinking.

===In media===
In 2009, Marcel Theroux presented &quot;In Search of Wabi Sabi&quot; on BBC Four, as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Japan&quot; season of programming, travelling throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people. Theroux began by comically enacting a challenge from the book &quot;Living&quot; by Taro Gold, asking members of the public on a street in Tokyo to describe – the results of which showed that, just as Gold predicted, &quot;they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that Wabi Sabi is simply unexplainable.&quot;

<doc id="170635" wikidata="Q25392" url="?curid=170635" title="Northern lapwing">
<text>The northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), also known as the peewit or pewit, tuit or tewit, green plover, or (in Ireland and Great Britain) pyewipe or just lapwing, is a bird in the lapwing subfamily. It is common through temperate Eurosiberia.

==Taxonomy==
The northern lapwing was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa vanellus&quot;. The species is now placed with the other lapwings in the genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The scientific name &quot;Vanellus&quot; is Medieval Latin for the northern lapwing and derives from &quot;vannus&quot;, a winnowing fan. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The name &quot;lapwing&quot; has been variously attributed to the &quot;lapping&quot; sound its wings make in flight, from the irregular progress in flight due to its large wings (the Oxford English Dictionary derives this from an Old English word meaning &quot;to totter&quot;), or from its habit of drawing potential predators away from its nest by trailing a wing as if broken. The names &quot;peewit&quot;, &quot;pewit&quot;, &quot;tuit&quot; or &quot;tew-it&quot; are onomatopoeic and refer to the bird&#x27;s characteristic call.

==Description==

The northern lapwing is a long bird with a wingspan and a body mass of . It has rounded wings and a crest. It is also the shortest-legged of the lapwings. It is mainly black and white, but the back is tinted green. The male has a long crest and a black crown, throat and breast contrasting with an otherwise white face. Females and young birds have shorter crests, and have less strongly marked heads, but plumages are otherwise quite similar.

This is a vocal bird in the breeding season, with constant calling as the crazed tumbling display flight is performed by the male. The typical contact call is a loud, shrill &quot;pee-wit&quot; from which they get their other name of peewit. Displaying males usually make a wheezy &quot;pee-wit, wit wit, eeze wit&quot; during their display flight; these birds also make squeaking or mewing sounds.

==Behaviour==
It is highly migratory over most of its extensive range, wintering further south as far as North Africa, northern India, Nepal, Bhutan and parts of China. It migrates mainly by day, often in large flocks. Lowland breeders in westernmost areas of Europe are resident. It occasionally is a vagrant to North America, especially after storms, as in the Canadian sightings after storms in December 1927 and in January 1966.

It is a wader that breeds on cultivated land and other short vegetation habitats. 3–4 eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders, up to and including horses and cattle.

In winter, it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly arable land and mud-flats.

It feeds primarily on insects and other small invertebrates. This species often feeds in mixed flocks with golden plovers and black-headed gulls, the latter often robbing the two plovers, but providing a degree of protection against predators.

Like the golden plovers, this species prefers to feed at night when there is moonlight.

The northern lapwing is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Population decline==
National surveys of England and Wales have shown a population decline between 1987 and 1998, and since 2009 the northern lapwing has had red list conservation status in the United Kingdom. The numbers of this species have been adversely affected by intensive agricultural techniques. In the lowlands this includes the loss of rough grassland, conversion to arable or improved grassland, loss of mixed farms, and switch from spring- to autumn-sown crops. In the uplands, the losses may have been due to increases in grazing density. Natural England gives grant aid to help restore lapwing habitat within its Environmental Stewardship Scheme. The organisation suggests an option within this scheme called &#x27;Fallow plots for ground-nesting birds&#x27;. Uncropped plots at least in size provide nesting habitat and are located in suitable arable fields, which provide additional foraging habitat. Locating the plots within of extensively grazed grassland will provide additional foraging habitat. The plots are cultivated in the spring to produce a rough fallow, which is retained without the input of fertiliser or pesticides. In addition to agricultural intensification and land-use change, predation of nests and chicks contributes to wader declines, including of lapwing. By radio-tagging lapwing chicks, and using automatic radio tracking systems, the timing of chick predation can be revealed, which provides additional insights into the importance of different predators. Lapwing chicks are predated both in the day and at night, with mammalian predators having the greatest impact.

In Armenia, the population decline and loss of breeding habitats was also documented; the threats are thought to be intensification of land use and hunting, but further investigations for threat clarification are required. In the Middle East, the northern lapwing is threatened by overhunting as it is shot in large quantities along its winter migration routes. Several photos surfacing from the region show many Northern lapwings, alongside other migratory birds including the threatened European turtle dove and European golden-plover, killed for sport in unsustainable and unnecessary numbers.

==Cultural significance==

===Harvesting eggs===
&quot;Plover&#x27;s eggs&quot; were an expensive delicacy in Victorian Europe, mentioned in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, about aristocratic British society in 1920–40. In the Netherlands, there is a cultural-historical competition to find the first peewit egg of the year (&quot;het eerste kievietsei&quot;). It is especially popular in the province Friesland, but there are also regional competitions. Gathering peewit eggs is prohibited by the European Union, but Friesland was granted an exception for cultural-historical reasons. The Frisian exception was removed in 2005 by a court, which determined that the Frisian executive councillors had not properly followed procedure. As of 2006 looking for peewit eggs is permitted between 1 March and 9 April, though harvesting the eggs is now forbidden. In 2008 the first egg was found on 3 March, in Eemnes, Utrecht, and the first egg of 2009 was found on 8 March in Krabbendijke. Over the last century, the first peewit egg has been found earlier and earlier in the year. This is ascribed to both increased use of fertiliser and climate change, causing the growth of grass needed for egg laying to occur earlier.

===In Ireland===
The northern lapwing was declared the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national bird by a committee of the Irish Wildlife Conservancy in 1990. In the Irish language it is called &quot;pilibín&quot;, &quot;little Philip&quot;, supposedly a reference to Philip II of Spain (King of Ireland 1554–58), who often wore a feather in his cap.

===Mythology===
The bird referred to in English translations of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, book 6, as &quot;lapwing&quot; is probably the northern lapwing. Tereus is turned into an &quot;epops&quot; (6.674); Ovid presumably had the hoopoe in mind, whose crest indicates his royal status and whose long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature.

<text>An arrest is the act of apprehending and taking a person into custody (legal protection or control), usually because the person has been suspected of or observed committing a crime. After being taken into custody, the person can be questioned further or charged. An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system, sometimes it is also done after a court warrant for the arrest.

Police and various other officers have powers of arrest. In some places, a citizen&#x27;s arrest is permitted; for example in England and Wales, any person can arrest &quot;anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence&quot;, although certain conditions must be met before taking such action. Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID.

As a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of probable cause in the United States. Furthermore, in most democracies, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and 24 or 48 hours in the United States and France) before the detained person must be either charged or released.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;arrest&quot; is Anglo-Norman in origin, derived from the French word &quot;arrêt&quot; meaning &#x27;to stop or stay&#x27; and signifies a restraint of a person. Lexicologically, the meaning of the word arrest is given in various dictionaries depending upon the circumstances in which the word is used. There are numerous slang terms for being arrested throughout the world. In British slang terminology, the term &quot;nicked&quot; is often synonymous with being arrested, and &quot;nick&quot; can also refer to a police station, and the term &quot;pinched&quot; is also common. In the United States and France the term &quot;collared&quot; is sometimes used. The terms &quot;lifted&quot; or &quot;picked up&quot; are also heard on occasion.

==Procedure==
===India===

According to Indian law, no formality is needed during the procedure of arrest. The arrest can be made by a citizen, a police officer or a Magistrate. The police officer needs to inform the person being arrested the full particulars of the person&#x27;s offence and that they are entitled to be released on bail if the offence fits the criteria for being bailable. There is no general rule of eligibility or requirement that a police officer must handcuff a person who is being arrested. When there is a question regarding handcuffing a person, case law has stated that the choice to handcuff a person is dependent on the surrounding circumstances, and that officers should always take the proper precautions to ensure the safety of themselves, and the public.

===United States===

==== Distinction between arrest and detention ====
In the United States, there exists a distinction between an investigatory stop or detention, and an arrest. The distinction tends to be whether or not the stop is &quot;brief and cursory&quot; in nature, and whether or not a reasonable individual would feel free to leave.

====Minor crimes and infractions====
When there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a minor crime, such as petty theft, driving on a suspended license, or disturbing the peace, law enforcement agents typically issue the individual a citation but do not otherwise detain them. The person must then appear in court on the date provided on the citation. Prior to the court date, the prosecution will decide whether to file formal criminal charges against the individual. When the accused appears in court, they will be advised if formal criminal charges have been filed. If charges are filed, they will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty at the initial court hearing, which is referred to as the arraignment.

====Arrests for serious crimes====
When a person is arrested for a serious crime, the defendant will have their picture taken and be held in pre-trial detention. Under certain circumstances (that is where the public won&#x27;t be endangered by one&#x27;s release from custody), the defendant may be entitled to release on bail. If the accused cannot post a monetary bail, they will appear at their arraignment where the judge will determine if the bail set by the schedule should be lowered.

Also, in certain states, the prosecution has 48 hours to decide whether or not to file formal charges against the accused. For example, in California, if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period, the accused must be released from the arresting host&#x27;s custody. If formal charges are filed, the accused will be asked to appear at their arraignment. At the arraignment, the accused will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty, and the judge will set a bail amount (or refuse to set bail) for the accused.

==Powers of arrest==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

Arrests under English law fall into two general categories—with and without a warrant—and then into more specific subcategories. Regardless of what power a person is arrested under, they must be informed that they are under arrest and of the grounds for their arrest at the time or as soon after the arrest as is practicable, otherwise the arrest is unlawful. 

====Northern Ireland====
Arrest powers in Northern Ireland are informed by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. This order legislates operational standards during arrest, questioning and charging a person suspected of committing a crime. Breach of this order may affect the investigation. Arrestees in Northern Ireland have the right to contact a person to inform them of an arrest, and legal representation.

====Scotland====

====Arrest with a warrant====
A justice of the peace can issue warrants to arrest suspects and witnesses.

====Arrest without a warrant====

There are four subcategories of arrest without warrant:
*under the provisions of section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), which only applies to constables,
*under the provisions of section 24A of PACE, applies to those who are not constables,
*the power to arrest for a breach of the peace at common law, which applies to everyone (constable or not and includes a power of entry), and
*the powers to arrest otherwise than for an offence, which apply to constables only.

===United States===
United States law recognizes the common law arrest under various jurisdictions.

===Hong Kong===
The police may arrest a person according to a warrant issued by a Magistrate under sections 31, 72, 73 or 74 of the Magistrates Ordinance. For example, an arrest warrant may be issued if an accused person does not appear in Court when he is due to answer a charge.

However, an arrest warrant is not always necessary. Under section 50(1) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer can &quot;apprehend&quot; (i.e. arrest) a person if he reasonably suspects the person being arrested is guilty of an offence. Whether there is such a reasonable suspicion in a particular case is to be determined objectively by reference to facts and information which the arresting officer has at the time of the arrest. It is not necessary that the officer knows the exact statutory provision that the suspect has violated, so long as the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect has done something amounting to an offence.

==Warnings on arrest==

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a person must be told that they are under arrest in simple, non-technical language, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest. A person must be &#x27;cautioned&#x27; when being arrested or subject to a criminal prosecution procedure, unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrested person.

The caution required in England and Wales states,
Minor deviations from the words of any caution given do not constitute a breach of the Code of Practise, provided the sense of the caution is preserved.

The caution required in Scotland states:

===United States===

Based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, after making an arrest, the police must inform the detainee of the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights for statements made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court. A Miranda warning is required only when a person is in custody (i.e., is not free to leave) and is being interrogated, and the results of this interrogation are to be used in court. An officer is not required to inform a person of the Miranda rights if the officer will not be questioning the detainee any further after the arrest. An officer is also not necessarily required to provide a Miranda warning if the person being questioned has not been arrested or if an arrested person speaks spontaneously without being questioned. There is also an exception that permits questioning without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety. 

One common formulation of the warning is

The warning must inform the detainee that they have the right to be silent, the right to legal counsel (and the availability of pro bono legal assistance), and that what the detainee says can be used against them. The failure to provide a detainee with an adequate warning could make information obtained from an interrogation inadmissible in court, but does not prevent other evidence from being used to obtain a conviction. As in the British system, the exact phrasing of the warning is not explicitly mandated under federal law. There are also additional requirements about the warning that vary from state to state and may depend on the circumstances (such as when the arrestee is a non-citizen or juvenile). Since the exact wording used in an arrest is legally important, police officers often carry a printed copy of the rights, and read from it when providing the warning to ensure accuracy. 

===Hong Kong===
Immediately after the arrest, the police must inform the arrested of their right to remain silent. They may choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police (except that they may need to provide their name and address to the police). The police officer will caution them by saying,

==Search and seizure==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
==Non-criminal arrests==

===United States===
Breach of a court order can be considered civil contempt of court, and a warrant for the person&#x27;s arrest may be issued. Some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order.

If a legislature lacks a quorum, many jurisdictions allow the members present the power to order a call of the house, which orders the arrest of the members who are not present. A member arrested is brought to the body&#x27;s chamber to achieve a quorum. The member arrested does not face prosecution, but may be required to pay a fine to the legislative body. 

==Following arrest==
While an arrest will not necessarily lead to a criminal conviction, it may nonetheless in some jurisdictions have serious ramifications such as absence from work, social stigma, and in some cases, the legal obligation to disclose a conviction when a person applies for a job, a loan or a professional license. In the United States a person who was not found guilty after an arrest can remove their arrest record through an expungement or (in California) a finding of factual innocence. A cleared person has the choice to file a complaint or a lawsuit if they choose to. Legal action is sometimes filed against the government after a wrongful arrest.

For convictions, the collateral consequences are more severe in the United States than in the UK, where arrests without conviction do not appear in standard criminal record checks and need not be disclosed, whereas in the United States, people have to expunge or (if the case goes to court) seal arrest without convictions, or if the charges are dropped. However, in the UK, Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) disclosures permit a Chief Constable to disclose this data if they believe it relevant to the post for which the DBS disclosure was applied.

<text>Provinces are the first-level administrative divisions of Indonesia. They were formerly called first-level provincial regions (), before the Reform era. Provinces have a local government, consisting of a 
governor () and a regional legislative body (). The governor and members of local representative bodies are elected by popular vote for five-year terms, but governors can only serve for two terms. Provincial governments have the authority to regulate and manage their own government affairs, subject to the limits of the central government. The average land area of all 38 provinces in Indonesia is about , and they had an average population of 7,410,626 people in mid-2024.

Indonesia is divided into 38 provinces, nine of which have special autonomous status. The terms for special status are &quot; and &quot;, which translate to &quot;special&quot;, or &quot;designated&quot;. Provinces are further divided into regencies and cities (formerly called second-level region regencies/cities, or ), which are in turn subdivided into districts (). Proposals for the creation of additional provinces (by the splitting of existing ones) have been considered by the Indonesian government, but further action has been suspended since 2013 under a moratorium. However, in 2022, nine years later, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, and Southwest Papua were created and became the youngest provinces in the country. The enactment of the Law on State Capital in 2022 established a future provincial-level city, Nusantara, which would officially become the 39th province after a presidential decree on relocating the state capital is issued, and it would replace Jakarta as the nation&#x27;s capital city.

==Background==
Article 18 paragraph 1 of the 1945 Constitution states that &quot;the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia is divided into provincial regions and those provincial regions are divided into regencies and city, whereby every one of those provinces, regencies, and municipalities has its regional government, which shall be regulated by laws.&quot; 

According to the Law on Regional Government (UU 23/2014) the authority of the Provincial Government includes:

# Development planning and control;
# Planning, utilization, and community peace;
# Implementation of public order and public peace;
# Provision of public facilities and infrastructure;
# Handling the health sector;
# Education and allocation of potential human resources;
# Handling social problems across regencies/cities;
# Services in the field of manpower across regencies/cities;
# Facilitating the development of cooperatives, small and medium enterprises, including across districts/cities;
# Environmental control;
# Defense services, including across regencies/cities;
# Population and civil registration services;
# Government general administration services;
# Investment administration services, including across regencies/cities;
# The implementation of other basic services that cannot be carried out by regencies/cities; and
# Other mandatory affairs mandated by laws and regulations.

The authority of the provincial government are government affairs which are located across regencies/municipalities, government affairs whose users are across regencies/municipalities, government affairs whose benefits or negative impacts lie across regencies/municipalities, government affairs which use more resources. efficient if carried out by the province.

Each province has a local government, headed by a governor and a legislative body (DPRD). The governor and members of local representative bodies are elected by popular vote for five-year terms, but governors can only serve for two terms. The general election to elect members of the DPRDs is conducted simultaneously with the national general election. Previously, the general elections for Governor and Vice Governor were not held simultaneously. However, since 2015 regional head elections have been held simultaneously. Under the plan, simultaneous partial local elections were held in February 2017, June 2018 and December 2020, culminating in simultaneous elections for all local executive posts in November 2024 and then every five years.

== Current provinces ==

==Special autonomy==
The decentralization of some power and autonomy to provinces is called for by Article 18 of the Constitution of Indonesia, and this article was expanded through amendments in October 1999 in the period following the fall of Suharto. Some provinces have been granted additional autonomy beyond this, although Indonesia is not a federated state. The form this special autonomy takes is not standardized, with provinces gaining different formulations of specific autonomy based on particular political imperatives.
* The Special Region of Yogyakarta, which was autonomous under Dutch rule, was (along with Surakarta) given consideration for autonomy as part of Law no. 1 of 1945. Autonomy for Yogyakarta was confirmed directly through Law no. 3 of 1950, the first granting of special autonomy to a province. This status has been maintained until the present, with some tweaks from additional laws. Sultan Hamengkubuwono serves as a hereditary governor and Adipati Paku Alam as a hereditary vice-governor.
* Rebellion in Aceh due to demands for a stricter implementation of Islamic law has led to several shifts in political status. Specific autonomy was initially granted to the province through Law no. 24 of 1956. Further autonomy was given through the declaration that Aceh was a &quot;special region&quot; on 23 May 1959, later formalized through Law no. 18 of 1965. Following the fall of Suharto, Law no. 44 of 1999 and Law no. 18 of 2001 created a new framework that was adopted by both parties through Law no. 11 of 2006. This law provides privileged status regarding implementation of Islamic law in religious life, customary life, and education. Aceh also received its own development fund for a period of 20 years.
* The province of Papua was granted special autonomy through Law no. 21 of 2001. This was a response to independence movements that had been present in the province since it became part of Indonesia, and occurred alongside the renaming of the province from Irian Jaya to Papua. This gave Papua a greater portion of revenue, autonomy outside reserved areas maintained by the central government, and 20 years of a special development fund. Before special autonomy was implemented, West Papua was split from Papua in 2003, although both kept special autonomy. The special autonomy for both provinces was renewed in 2021, including a renewal and increase of the special autonomy fund. Included in this new legislation was the provision to create new provinces, and in July 2022 new national legislation split South Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua from Papua through Law Number 14 of 2022, Law Number 15 of 2022, and Law Number 16 of 2022 respectively. Law No. 29 of 2022 was enacted in December 2022 splitting Southwest Papua from West Papua. All the split provinces retained their autonomous status.
* The Special Capital Region of Jakarta has its own status, due to it being the country&#x27;s capital and largest city.

== Geographical units ==
The provinces are officially grouped into seven geographical units for statistical and national planning purposes, but without administrative function.

==Former provinces==
Upon the independence of Indonesia, eight provinces were established. West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Maluku still exist as of today despite later divisions, while Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara, formerly Lesser Sunda (&quot;Sunda Kecil&quot;) were fully liquidated by dividing them into new provinces. The province of Central Sumatra existed from 1948 to 1957, while East Timor was annexed as a province from 1976 until its power transfer to UNTAET in 1999 prior to its independence as a country in 2002.

==New provinces made from currently-existing provinces==

==Renamed provinces==

==Former provincial capitals==
*Tanjungpinang to Pekanbaru, Riau (until 1959)
*Jakarta to Bandung, West Java (until 1960)
*Singaraja to Denpasar, Bali (until 1960)
*Soasio to Sukarnapura, West Irian (1956–1963)
*Dili, East Timor (1975–1999), later became the capital of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
*Ternate to Sofifi, North Maluku (until 2010)
*Banjarmasin to Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan (until 2022)

<text>A newsreel is a form of short documentary film, containing news stories and items of topical interest, that was prevalent between the 1910s and the mid 1970s. Typically presented in a cinema, newsreels were a source of current affairs, information, and entertainment for millions of moviegoers. Newsreels were typically exhibited preceding a feature film, but there were also dedicated newsreel theaters in many major cities in the 1930s and ’40s, and some large city cinemas also included a smaller theaterette where newsreels were screened continuously throughout the day.

By the end of the 1960s television news broadcasts had supplanted the format. Newsreels are considered significant historical documents, since they are often the only audiovisual record of certain cultural events.

==History==
 
Silent news films were shown in cinemas from the late 19th century. In 1909 Pathé started producing weekly newsreels in Europe. Pathé began producing newsreels for the UK in 1910 and the US in 1911.

Newsreels were a staple of the typical North American, British, and Commonwealth countries (especially Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and throughout European cinema programming schedule from the silent era until the 1960s when television news broadcasting completely supplanted its role. The National Film and Sound Archive in Australia holds the Cinesound Movietone Australian Newsreel Collection, a comprehensive collection of 4,000 newsreel films and documentaries representing news stories covering all major events.

The first official British news cinema that only showed newsreels was the &quot;Daily Bioscope&quot; that opened in London on May 23, 1909. In 1929, William Fox purchased a former cinema called the Embassy. He changed the format from a $2 show twice a day to a continuous 25-cent programme, establishing the first newsreel theater in the United States; the idea was such a success that Fox and his backers announced they would start a chain of newsreel theaters across the country. The newsreels were often accompanied by cartoons or short subjects.

The First World War saw the major countries using the newest technologies to develop propaganda for home audiences. Each used carefully edited newsreels to combine straight news reports and propaganda. During the Second World War, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, a state organization in Nazi Germany for disseminating stories favorable to the administration&#x27;s goals, created &quot;Die Deutsche Wochenschau&quot; (1940–1945). There were no other newsreels disseminated within the country during the war.

In some countries, newsreels generally used music as a background for usually silent on-site film footage. In some countries, the narrator used humorous remarks for light-hearted or non-tragic stories. In the U.S., newsreel series included &quot;The March of Time&quot; (1935–1951), &quot;Pathé News&quot; (1910–1956), &quot;Paramount News&quot; (1927–1957), &quot;Fox Movietone News&quot; (1928–1963), &quot;Hearst Metrotone News&quot; (1914–1967), and &quot;Universal Newsreel&quot; (1929–1967). Pathé News was distributed by RKO Radio Pictures from 1931 to 1947, and then by Warner Brothers from 1947 to 1956.

An example of a newsreel story can be found in the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), which was prepared by RKO&#x27;s actual newsreel staff. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; includes a fictional newsreel called &quot;News on the March&quot; that summarizes the life of title character Charles Foster Kane while parodying &quot;The March of Time&quot;.

On August 12, 1949, one hundred twenty cinema technicians employed by Associated British Pathé in London went on strike to protest the dismissal of fifteen men on the grounds of redundancy while conciliation under trade union agreements was pending. Their strike lasted through to at least Tuesday August 16, the Tuesday being the last day for production on new newsreels shown on the Thursday. Events of the strike resulted in over three hundred cinemas across Britain having to go without newsreels that week.

==Television news==
In 1936, when the BBC Television Service was launched in the United Kingdom, it was airing the British Movietone and Gaumont British newsreels for several years (except for a hiatus during World War II), until 1948, when the service launched their own newsreel programme, titled &quot;Television Newsreel&quot;, that would last until July 1954, when it was replaced by &quot;News and Newsreel&quot;.
On February 16, 1948, NBC launched a ten-minute television program called &quot;Camel Newsreel Theatre&quot; with John Cameron Swayze that featured newsreels with Swayze doing voiceovers. Also in 1948, the DuMont Television Network launched two short-lived newsreel series, &quot;Camera Headlines&quot; and &quot;I.N.S. Telenews&quot;, the latter in cooperation with Hearst&#x27;s International News Service.

On August 15, 1948, CBS started their evening television news program &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News&quot;. Later the NBC, CBS, and ABC(USA) news shows all produced their own news film.

In New Zealand, the &quot;Weekly Review&quot; was &quot;the principal film series produced in the 1940s&quot;. The first television news broadcasts in the country, incorporating newsreel footage, began in 1960.

== Demise == 
Newsreel-producing companies excluded television companies from their distribution, but the television companies countered by sending their own camera crews to film news events.

Newsreels died out because of the nightly television news broadcast,&lt;ref name=&quot;muse/66391&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/newsreel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and technological advances such as electronic news-gathering for television news, introduced in the 1970s, rendered them obsolete.

Newsreel cinemas either closed or went to showing continuous programmes of cartoons and short subjects, such as the London Victoria Station News Cinema, later Cartoon Cinema&lt;ref name=&quot;cinematreasures/1248&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that opened in 1933 and closed in 1981.

The last American newsreel was released on December 26, 1967, the day after Christmas. Nonetheless, some countries such as Cuba, Japan, Spain, and Italy continued producing newsreels into the 1980s and 1990s.

==UK newsreels ==
The first British newsreel was Pathé Animated Gazette (June 1910–1970). Other British newsreels include:
* Gaumont Graphic (1910–1932)
* Warwick Bioscope Chronicle
* Topical Budget
* Empire News Bulletin (1926–1930)
* British Movietone News ( -May 1979)
* British Paramount (1931–1957)
* Gaumont British (1934–1959)
* Visnews (1957–1984)

==Retrospectives==
An Australian movie production dramatizing the cameramen and producers of newsreels was released in 1978. The title was &quot;Newsfront&quot;. Some events featured during the presentation were regarding the 1949 election of the Australian Prime Minister, the rabbit plague, and the introduction of television (1956).

A 2016 Irish documentary, &quot;Éire na Nuachtscannán&quot; (&quot;Ireland in the Newsreels&quot;) looked at the newsreel age in Ireland, mostly focusing on Pathé News and how the (British) company altered its newsreels for an Irish audience.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to criminal justice:

[[Criminal justice]] – system of practices and institutions of governments directed at upholding social control, deterring and mitigating crime, or sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts.

==Parts of the criminal justice system==

# Legislative system – network of legislatures that create laws.
# Judiciary system – network of courts that interpret the law in the name of the state, and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law.
# Corrections system – network of governmental agencies that administer a jurisdiction&#x27;s prisons, probation, and parole systems.
In the 17th century, William Penn began to promote reform in the criminal justice system and helped to see these changes implemented. After the American Revolution, the U.S. Constitution was created which guaranteed freedoms and rights that were never in place in colonial days. This was the starting point to setting guidelines for crimes, punishment and procedures that need to be followed to protect the rights of the innocent. Our modern system of criminal justice is the result of several evolutionary changes that society has undergone since the inception of the United States. Over the years, Americans have developed mechanisms that institute and enforce the rules of society as well as assign responsibility and punish offenders. Today, those functions are carried out by the police, the courts, and corrections. The early beginnings of the criminal justice system in the United States lacked this structure.

In fact, before formal rules, laws, and institutions were established in the United States, Americans relied on religion and sin as a means of shaping society and its behaviors. Many colonial crime codes were defined in biblical terms, making offenses such as profanity, blasphemy, and sacrileges of the Sabbath highly punishable. Punishments such as dunking, stoning, and whipping were designed to humiliate the offender and ultimately lead towards their repentance. Ironically, we still see this desire to make offenders remorseful for their criminal acts but more so for the victims of crime than to a higher power.

<doc id="170652" wikidata="Q162351" url="?curid=170652" title="Bail">
<text>Bail is a set of pre-trial restrictions that are imposed on a suspect to ensure that they will not hamper the judicial process. Court bail may be offered to secure the conditional release of a defendant with the promise to appear in court when required. In some countries, especially the United States, bail usually implies a bail bond, a deposit of money or some form of property to the court by the suspect in return for the release from pre-trial detention. If the suspect does not return to court, the bail is forfeited and the suspect may be charged with the crime of failure to appear. If the suspect returns to make all their required appearances, bail is returned after the trial is concluded.

In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, bail is more likely to consist of a set of restrictions that the suspect will have to abide by for a set period of time. Under this usage, bail can be given both before and after charge. Bail offered before charge is known as pre-charge or police bail, to secure the suspect&#x27;s release under investigation.

For minor crimes, a defendant may be summoned to court without the need for bail, or may be released on recognizance (promising to appear in court, with no bail required) following arraignment. For serious crimes, or for suspects who are deemed likely to fail to turn up in court, they may be remanded (detained) while awaiting trial. A suspect is given bail in cases where remand is not justified but there is a need to provide an incentive for the suspect to appear in court. Bail amounts may vary depending on the type and severity of crime the suspect is accused of; practices for determining bail amounts vary.

== Bail bond ==
In the United States, it is common for bail to be a cash (or other property) deposit. Cash bail in other countries is more limited. Known as a bail bond or cash bail, an amount of money is posted so that the suspect can be released from pre-trial detention. Unless posted by a bail bondsman, this deposit is refunded if the suspect makes all of their required court appearances.

In 46 US states, a commercial bail bondsman can be paid to deposit bail money on behalf of a detained individual. This practice is mostly illegal in the rest of the world. In Germany, the use of bail bondsmen is legal if the court allows it in its decision to grant cash bail. Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon, and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds, while New Jersey and Alaska rarely permit money bail.

== Worldwide ==
=== Australia ===
Bail laws in Australia are similar to the laws of New Zealand and Canada, but are different in each state. Each state holds that there is a &quot;prima facie&quot; entitlement to bail for most charges upon application by a defendant. However, there is an exception when the charges are especially serious, such as drug trafficking, family violence or murder. In such cases, there is no entitlement to bail, and it must be argued as to what circumstances exist that justify a grant of bail.

In Victoria, bail may be refused to a defendant who faces a more serious charge unless the defendant demonstrates compelling reasons why bail should be granted. Compelling reasons may generally be established by demonstrating that jail is an unlikely outcome for the charge, or that bail conditions can be imposed that make re-offending unlikely. In cases where a defendant is charged with murder, terrorism or offending with a moderately serious charge while on bail, to become eligible for bail the defendant must prove exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are difficult to demonstrate, but may arise as a consequence of significant delay in a criminal prosecution.

=== Canada ===

As in other Commonwealth nations, people charged with a criminal offence in Canada have a &quot;prima facie&quot; right to reasonable bail (known in Canada as &#x27;judicial interim release&#x27;) unless there is some compelling reason to deny it. These reasons can be related to the accused&#x27;s likelihood to skip bail, or to public danger resulting from the accused being at large. Unlike many other jurisdictions granting a constitutional right to bail, in Canada the accused may be denied bail because the public confidence in the administration of justice may be disturbed by letting the individual go free pending the completion of the trial or passing of sentence (Criminal Code, s. 515 (10)(c)). Sureties and deposits can be imposed, but are optional.

=== Czech Republic ===

Notable Czech bail cases
* &quot;Radovan Krejčíř&quot;
** charged with fraud (2004)
** bail denied, following Krejčíř&#x27;s complaint bail set at CZK 40 million (~€1.6 million), then denied by appellate court following state prosecutor&#x27;s complaint
* &quot;David Rath&quot;
** charged with accepting bribe (2012)
** bail set at CZK 14 million (~€560,000)

* &quot;Michal Hala&quot;
** charged with accepting bribe (2012)
** bail set at CZK 4 million (~€160,000), but denied and returned by appellate court following prosecutor&#x27;s complaint
* &quot;Randy Blythe&quot;
** charged with intentionally inflicting bodily harm which resulted in death (i.e. manslaughter) (2012)
** bail set at CZK 4 million, then doubled by appellate court following prosecutor&#x27;s complaint
* &quot;Robert Rosenberg&quot;
** charged with procuring prostitution, trafficking (2008)
** bail set at CZK 600,000 (~€24,000)
Instead of remand, a court in the Czech Republic may decide to accept:

* a guaranty from a trustworthy person or association
* a written word of honor from the person charged
* surveillance by a probation officer
* bail

Bail can be considered when a charged person is held because of concern of possible escape or of a continuation of criminal activity. Bail cannot be considered where there is a concern of influencing witnesses or otherwise frustrating the proceedings. Bail is also excluded in case of 31 specified serious crimes (e.g. murder, grievous bodily harm, rape, robbery, public endangerment, etc.) when the person is held due to concern of continuation of criminal activity. Bail may be posted either by the charged person, or with his or her consent, by a third party, but this only after this third party has received a thorough briefing regarding the charges and reasons for custody and possible grounds for the forfeiture of the bail.

After the bail has been posted, the court must again review the grounds for bail, and must decide either to accept or refuse the bail. When accepting the bail, the court may also require the charged person to stay in the country.

The court may decide to rescind the bail if the charged person
* escapes, is in hiding or fails to report a change of address and thus frustrates the possibility of delivery of summons or other documents from the court, the prosecution or the police, or
* is at fault for failing to appear for a proceeding, which may not take part without him or her, or
* continues criminal activity, or attempts to finish the crime which they had attempted or threatened previously, or
* is evading execution of imprisonment sentence, court-ordered fine or other court-ordered punishment.

The court holds out on bail as long as the reasons for custody remain (which includes pending of the charges), and in case of conviction until the convict starts serving prison sentence, reimburses the criminal proceedings and/or pays court-ordered fine. In case that the court decided also on damages and the aggrieved party asks for it within three months, the bail or its part may be used also to reimburse the damages. Otherwise, the court returns the bail.

Both the prosecutor and the person in custody may challenge any decision on custody (including bail) by filing a complaint which leads to review by an appellate court.

===Denmark===
The possibility of posting bail is mentioned in passing in § 71, part 3, of the constitution of Denmark.

The possibility is further established in Retsplejeloven (the law relating to the administration of justice) § 765:

However, the practise is rarely used. For example, there were seven instances during the period 1973–1987.

===France===

In France, bail may be ordered by the examining magistrate or the judge of freedoms and detention within the framework of judicial control in French law (before the trial). It guarantees:
* The representation of the indicted person, the accuser or the accused in all the acts of the procedure and for the execution of the judgment, as well as, if necessary, the execution of the other obligations which were imposed on them. This part is restored if the person under examination has presented themselves to all the acts of the procedure, satisfied the obligations of the judicial control and submitted to the execution of the judgment;
* A payment in the order defined below. This part is returned in the event of dismissal in French criminal proceedings.

=== India ===
Indian law stresses the principles of presumption of innocence. The principle embodies freedom from arbitrary detention and serves as a bulwark against punishment before conviction. More importantly, it prevents the State from successfully employing its vast resources to cause greater damage to an un-convicted accused than he/she can inflict on society. While considering bail applications of the accused, courts are required to balance considerations of personal liberty with public interest. Accordingly, the granting of bail should be the rule rather than the exception. The Supreme Court has laid down in its judgements,

The courts have also held that foreign nationals cannot be deprived of the right to seek bail. The Delhi High Court observed,

The &quot;Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973&quot; does not define bail, although the terms bailable offence and non-bailable offence have been defined in section 2(a) of the Code. A Bailable offence is defined as an offence which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule of the Code or which is made bailable by any other law, and non-bailable offence means any other offence. A person who is arrested for a &#x27;bailable&#x27; offence may secure bail at the police station, while those who fail to secure police bail and those arrested for non-bailable offences have to secure bail in court.

Sections 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. The amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the code. Thus, it is left to the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond. The Supreme Court of India has delivered several cases wherein it has reiterated that the basic rule is – bail and not jail. One such instance came in &quot;State of Rajasthan, Jaipur v. Balchand alias Baliay&quot; which the Supreme Court decided on 20 September 1977, and held that the basic rule is bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like by the petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court. The bench of Krishnaiyer, V.R. had observed that when considering the question of bail, the gravity of the offence involved and the heinousness of the crime which are likely to induce the petitioner to avoid the course of justice must weigh with the court. Taking into consideration the facts of the case the apex court held that the circumstances and the social milieu do not militate against the petitioner being granted bail.

When a person accused of a crime is arrested, his statement is recorded and information such as the name, residence address, birthplace, charges filed are noted. The police officer may also check back the criminal record if any in the police station and ask for fingerprints to file a case against the accused. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (First Schedule), offences have been classified as &quot;bailable&quot; and &quot;non-bailable&quot; offences. In the case of bailable offences, if the accused produces proper surety, and fulfils other conditions, it is binding upon the Investigating officer to grant bail. However, in case of a non-bailable offence, the police cannot grant bail; it can only be granted by a judicial magistrate/judge. The Investigating Officer must produce the accused before the judicial magistrate/judge concerned within 24 hours of his arrest. At that time, the accused has a right to apply for bail. Depending upon the facts of the case, the judge decides whether bail should be granted. If bail is granted the accused must deposit money with the court. Generally, for lesser crimes, a standard amount is asked to be deposited for awarding the bail.

There are some conditions put under section 437 of the Cr.P.C. wherein bail can be requested even for a non-bailable offence. In non-bailable cases, bail is not the right of the accused, but the discretion of the judge if regards the case as fit for the grant of bail, it regards imposition of certain conditions as necessary in the circumstances. Section 437(3) elaborates the conditions set by the law to get bail in non-bailable offences. The sub-section says that when a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offense punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offense under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offense, is released on bail under sub-section (1). However, for that, the Court has the power to impose any condition which it considers necessary. Some conditions that the court may place while granting bail are to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, or to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which they are accused or of the commission of which they are suspected, or otherwise in the interests of justice.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, bail (, from Old Norse &quot;band&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;) is when a person enters a written bond (recognisance), committing to appear before the court to answer the charges made against them. A person may be required to lodge money as part of their bail. A surety is a person who makes themselves responsible for a prisoner coming to court. They promise to pay a sum of money to the court if the prisoner does not appear as agreed; however, commercial bail bonding as in the U.S. is illegal.

There are three kinds of bail:
*Station bail: set by a Garda Síochána. A common condition is that the prisoner must report to his/her local Garda station once or several times a day.
*Court bail: set by the judge in the District Court. The prisoner (or his/her surety) must pay the court at least one-third of the amount of money promised in the bail bond.
*High Court bail: if the prisoner is charged with a very serious crime, only the High Court can grant bail.

In &quot;People (AG) v O&#x27;Callaghan&quot; (1966), the Irish Supreme Court had ruled that the provisions of Article 40.4 of the Irish Constitution, which guarantees personal liberty and the principle of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, meant that an individual charged with a crime could only be refused bail if they were likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, approved by referendum in 1996, provided that a court could refuse bail to a suspect where it feared that while at liberty they would commit a serious criminal offence. The Bail Act 1997 was passed by the Oireachtas the following year, and it governs bail in the Republic.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, those charged with a criminal offence have a right to be released on bail with reasonable terms and conditions, unless there is a good reason for continuing to be held in custody.

When one is arrested the police decide whether to grant the person bail until their court date. After that the courts will have discretion whether to grant bail again, if the case is not resolved at the first court appearance.

When considering granting bail, the police and courts take into consideration factors such as: the persons likelihood of showing up to court, the nature of the offence, the persons past conduct, whether the person will offend again while out on bail, and the risk of evidence/witnesses being tampered with. Certain offences (such as violence, drug-dealing, or repeat offenders) automatically disqualify persons from being granted bail. People who have previously breached their bail or the conditions associated with it are less likely to be granted bail again.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====
In the modern English bail system, monetary payments play a very small role. Securities and sureties can be taken as conditions for being granted bail, but these amounts are not excessive. Wider restrictions such as curfews, electronic monitoring, presenting at a police station, and limits on meeting specific people or going to specific places are more common conditions.

Bail is regulated primarily by the Bail Act 1976 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, both of which have been heavily amended by later legislation such as the Policing and Crime Act 2017.

The Bail Act 1976 was enacted with the aims of creating more conditions by which defendants could be denied bail and also redefining the parameters of fulfilling bail. The Bail Act also nullified the recognizance system, removing the requirement of paying a specific amount of money and instead arresting defendants for failing to surrender. The Bail Act created a qualified right to be granted bail before conviction, except for when certain factors applied. This does not guarantee a person will get bail, but it places the onus on the prosecution to demonstrate why bail should be refused in preference to custody.

In England and Wales there are three types of bail that can be given:
* Police bail. A suspect is released without being charged but must return to the police station at a stated time.
* Police to court. After being charged, a suspect is given bail but must attend their first court hearing at the date and Court stated.
* Court bail. After a court hearing, a suspect is granted bail pending further investigation or while the case continues.

==== Scotland ====
Bail can be granted by any of the courts of Scotland, with the final decision in solemn proceedings being with the High Court of Justiciary. All crimes are bailable, and bail should be granted to any accused person &quot;except where there is good reason for refusing bail&quot;. The Bail, Judicial Appointments etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, had removed the previous restrictions on bail that meant that murder and treason were not ordinarily bailable. However, a person could be bailed when accused of these crimes on application of the Lord Advocate or by a decision of the High Court itself. The Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 reintroduced restrictions on the granting of bail by requiring exceptional circumstances to be shown when a person is accused of a violent, sexual or drugs offence, and they have a prior conviction for a similar offence.

In Scotland, the focus is normally for those who are opposed to bail to convince the courts that bail should not be granted, with the procurator fiscal given guidance to use the nature and gravity of an offence as grounds to oppose bail.

A person who is refused bail can appeal against the refusal to either the Sheriff Appeal Court for summary proceedings in the Sheriff Courts and Justice of the Peace Courts and solemn proceedings in the Sheriff Courts, or to the High Court of Justiciary when a case is on trial there. The High Court of Justiciary has final authority to decide all bail decisions, and will decide on bail appeals for cases before the High Court on first instance. A Procurator Fiscal or Advocate Depute can request the High Court to review any bail decision where they believe that bail should not have been granted.

=== United States ===
The 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution states, &quot;Excessive bail shall not be required&quot;, thus establishing bail as a constitutionally-protected right. What constitutes &quot;excessive&quot; is a matter of judicial discretion, and bail &quot;can&quot; be denied if the judge feels that it will not aid in forcing the accused back to trial. Money bail is the most common form of bail in the United States and the term &quot;bail&quot; often specifically refers to such a deposit, but other forms of pre-trial release are permitted; this varies by state.

Many states have a &quot;bail schedule&quot; that lists the recommended bail amount for a given criminal charge. At the first court appearance (the arraignment), the judge can set the bail at the amount listed on the schedule or at a different amount based on the specific facts of the crime and the person accused.

A common criticism of bail in the United States is that a suspect&#x27;s likelihood of being released is significantly affected by their economic status and systemic racial bias. Once detained pretrial, these economically disadvantaged people have been shown to experience conditions in jails that improperly induce guilty pleas (whether or not they are factually or legally guilty). In response, in 2014 New Jersey and Alaska have abolished cash bail for all but a limited number of court cases. Though the California legislature attempted to eliminate cash bail in 2018, this change was vetoed by California Proposition 25 in November 2020. In 2019, New York passed bail reform legislation that took effect on January 1, 2020, eliminating cash bail for many misdemeanor and non-violent felony charges. However, this law was later narrowed by the governor due to public pushback led by prosecutors and law enforcement officials.

<text>Authority is commonly understood as the legitimate power of a person or group of other people.
In a civil state, &quot;authority&quot; may be practiced by legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, each of which has authority and is an authority.
The term &quot;authority&quot; has many nuances and distinctions within various academic fields ranging from sociology to political science.

In the exercise of governance, the terms &quot;authority&quot; and &quot;power&quot; are inaccurate synonyms. The term &quot;authority&quot; identifies the political legitimacy, which grants and justifies rulers&#x27; right to exercise the power of government; and the term &quot;power&quot; identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal, either by compliance or by obedience; hence, &quot;authority&quot; is the &quot;power&quot; to make decisions and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution.

== History ==
Ancient understandings of authority trace back to Rome and draw later from Catholic (Thomistic) thought and other traditional understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority (exhibited in, for example, Cambodia), public authority in the form of popular power, and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are. The claims of authority can extend to national or individual sovereignty, which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is legitimated.

Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of Geneva, and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot; by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry. The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.

== Political philosophy ==
There have been several contributions to the debate of political authority. Among others, Hannah Arendt, Carl Joachim Friedrich, Thomas Hobbes, Alexandre Kojève and Carl Schmitt have provided some of the most influential texts.

In European political philosophy, the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of sovereignty, the balancing of notions of freedom and authority, and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of Plato and Aristotle to the present. Most democratic societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of governmental authority. In the United States, for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the Founding Fathers should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable; that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as limited government.

Political anarchism is a philosophy which rejects the legitimacy of political authority and adherence to any form of sovereign rule or autonomy of a nation-state. An argument for political anarchy is made by Michael Huemer in his book &quot;The Problem of Political Authority&quot;. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the social contract theory developed by Thomas Hobbes in his 1668 book, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, or by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his political writings on the social contract.

== Sociology ==
In sociology, authority is the legitimate or socially approved power which one person or a group possesses and practices over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power.

Power can be exerted by the use of force or violence. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by subordinates of the right of those above them to give them orders or s.

The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. Max Weber in his essay &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; (1919) divided legitimate authority into three types. Others, like Howard Bloom, suggest a parallel between authority and respect/reverence for ancestors.

===Max Weber on authority===

Max Weber, in his sociological and philosophical work, identified and distinguished three types of legitimate domination (&quot;Herrschaft&quot; in German, which generally means &#x27;domination&#x27; or &#x27;rule&#x27;), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as types of authority, because English-speakers do not see domination as a political concept. Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group of people. Legitimate authority is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled. Legitimated rule results in what Weber called the monopoly over the use of coercive violence in a given territory. In the modern world, such authority is typically delegated to the police and the court system.
Weber divided legitimate authority into three types:

*The first type discussed by Weber is &quot;legal-rational authority&quot;. It is that form of authority which depends for its legitimacy on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex.
A constitution may define the extent of the power of rational-legal authority. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials are the best example of this form of authority, which is prevalent all over the world.

*The second type of authority, &quot;traditional authority&quot;, derives from long-established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, it is known as traditional authority. The rule of hereditary monarchs furnishes an obvious example. The Tudor dynasty in England and the ruling families of Mewar in Rajasthan (India) are examples of traditional authority. In &quot;Economy and Society&quot; (1921) Weber clarifies a distinction among three terms (as he defined them): Patriarchy, Patrimonialism depending on the sole authority of an Absolute Monarch (Emperor, Empress, King, Queen) and Patrimonialism where the divine right of the sole ruler is somewhat modified by feudal aristocratic legitimate authority (e.g. feudal barons in England). The feudal variant of Patrimonial legitimate authority is characteristic of Tudor England. But the earlier variant of Patrimonial legitimate authority is the most widespread form of traditional authority structures (&quot;systems&quot;) in world history. Reinhard Bendix discusses these distinctions. [citation below].
* The third form of authority is &quot;charismatic authority&quot;. Here, the charisma of an individual or of a leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is authority which is derived from the leader&#x27;s claims to a higher power or inspiration that is supported by his or her followers. An example in this regard can be NT Rama Rao, a matinée idol who became one of the most powerful Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh. Charismatic authority is also attributed to religious innovators like Siddharta Gautama (as the &quot;Buddha&quot;) and Yeshua of Nazareth (as a or the Masiach-Messiah.)

History has witnessed several social movements or revolutions against a system of traditional or legal-rational authority started by charismatic authorities. According to Weber, what distinguishes authority from coercion, force and power on the one hand, and leadership, persuasion and influence on the other hand, is legitimacy. Superiors, he states, feel that they have a right to issue commands; subordinates perceive an obligation to obey (see also Milgram experiment). Social scientists agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions. For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society.

Authority can be created expressly when public entities act publicly, using the same means to communicate the grant of authority to their agents that they use to communicate this to third parties, apparent authority describes the situation when a principal has placed restrictions on an agent that are not known to a third party, and restrictions on government agents are accomplished in the open, through laws and regulations. In this setting, all parties concerned are assumed or supposed to know the laws and regulations of the government.

Recently the concept of authority has also been discussed as a guiding principle in human-machine interaction design.

Genetic research indicates that obedience to authority may be a heritable factor.

=== Children and authority attributes ===
Authority and its attributes have been identified as of particular relevance to children as they regard their parents and teachers. The three attributes of authority have been described as &quot;status&quot;, &quot;specialist skills&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot;, and &quot;social position&quot;. Children consider the type of command, the characteristics of the authority figure, and the social context when making authority conclusions.

Although children regard these three types of authority attributes, they first assess the legitimacy of the authority figure in question using the nature of the commands they give. For example, a teacher who does not appear to have legitimate power from the child&#x27;s perspective (perhaps because she or he cannot control the class well) will not be obeyed. Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioral control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority over the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalize their values. While the study of children in modern capitalist societies does look at the psychological aspects of children&#x27;s understanding of legitimate authority at the level of symbolic interaction it is also true that is an extrapolated assumption based on one interpretation of a broad Comparative Historical Sociological (CHS) analysis of legitimate authority in many societies over a long duration, not the micro-social psychological study of children per se. There is nothing in Weber&#x27;s published work in the Max Weber Gesamtausgabe that directly deals with children&#x27;s perceptions in &quot;formations&quot; with traditional legitimate authority, prior to the emergence of modern capitalism .

=== In social science ===
&quot;Hofstede Insights&quot; details &quot;Power Distance&quot; as: &quot;Power distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally&quot;, which can be interpreted as respect for authority. Generally, ex-communist countries, poor countries, and non-Protestant countries have the highest power distance (respect for inequality in the distribution of power). According to &quot;Hofstede Insights&quot; 2021 country comparison, all countries with power distance below 50 are Western Protestant democracies, except for Austria. Such studies are attempts to apply ideas found in Weber that he himself did not postulate directly and they assume the nation-state as a basic unit of &quot;countries&quot; rather than look at all of the various political-economic &quot;formations&quot; in which Weber himself was most directly interested.

== United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms ==
The political authority in the British context can be traced to James VI and I of Scotland who wrote two political treatises called &quot;Basilikon Doron&quot; and &quot;The True Law of Free Monarchies: Or, The Reciprocal and Mutual Duty Between a Free King and His Natural Subjects&quot; which advocated his right to rule on the basis of the concept of the divine right of kings, a theological concept that has a basis in multiple religions, but in this case, Christianity, tracing this right to the apostolic succession.

Sovereign kings and queens in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms are considered the foundations of judicial, legislative and executive authority.

== United States ==
The foundation of American legitimate authority rests on the consent of the governed. This understanding of political authority and the exercise of political powers in the American context traces back to the writings of the Founding Fathers, including the arguments put forward in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and the first chief justice of the United States John Jay, and was referenced in the unanimous United States Declaration of Independence:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the , --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Later, speeches by the 16th president of the United States Abraham Lincoln would reiterate this fundamental source of legitimacy. &quot;Our government rests in public opinion,&quot; Lincoln said in 1856. In his 1854 speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused the proposition “that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own,&quot; a principle existing &quot;at the foundation of the sense of justice.&quot; This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of self-government as Lincoln saw it by a Republican nation and its people. This was because, as Lincoln also declared, &quot;No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other&#x27;s consent.&quot;

The U.S. president is called to give account to the legislature for the conduct of the whole government, including that of regulatory agencies. The president influences the appointments, and the budgeting process and has the right and capacity to review regulatory rules on a case-by-case basis. Since the time of the Reagan administration the president was informed with a cost–benefit analysis of the regulation. The creation of a regulatory agency requires an Act of Congress which specifies its jurisdiction, the related authority and delegated powers. Regulatory authorities can be qualified as independent agencies or executive branch agencies, a choice which is the reason of struggle between congress and the president as well as with the American courts. The latter&#x27;s role is limited by the authorities&#x27; power to regulate property rights without the due process rights mandatorily applied by the courts.

<text>A royalist supports a particular monarch as head of state for a particular kingdom, or of a particular dynastic claim. In the abstract, this position is royalism. It is distinct from monarchism, which advocates a monarchical system of government, but not necessarily a particular monarch. Most often, the term royalist is applied to a supporter of a current regime or one that has been recently overthrown to form a republic.

In the United Kingdom, the term is currently almost indistinguishable from &quot;monarchist&quot;, as there are no significant rival claimants to the throne. Conversely, in 19th-century France, a royalist might be either a Legitimist, Bonapartist, or an Orléanist, all being monarchists.

==United Kingdom==
* The Wars of the Roses were fought between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians
* During the English Civil War the Royalists or Cavaliers supported King Charles I and, in the aftermath, his son King Charles II
* Following the Glorious Revolution, the Jacobites supported the deposed James II and his Stuart successors to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland
* Following the Glorious Revolution, the Loyalists supported the Williamite dynasty, and after the ascension of George I to the British throne in 1714, the Hanoverian dynasty to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland

==Russia==

* During the Russian Civil War, the Royalists constituted a part of the White Army.

==Yugoslavia==
* During, and especially towards the end of, World War II in Yugoslavia, the royalist Chetniks supported the exiled king of Yugoslavia.

==France==
* Legitimists, French royalists upholding Salic Law
**Chouannerie, a royalist group during the French Revolution
**Ultra-royalists, a 19th-century reactionary faction of the French parliament
* Orléanists, who, in late 18th and 19th century France, supported the Orléans branch of the House of Orléans, which came to power in the French monarch July Revolution
*Bonapartists, supporters of the Bonaparte imperial line.

== Japan ==

*Nanboku-cho Seijunron (南北朝正閏論) – The debate on legitimacy in the Nanboku-cho period. The Southern and Northern dynasties are in conflict; the present emperor is part of the Northern dynasty.
*Tenno Kikan Setsu (天皇機関説, Emperor Organ Theory) – Based on the theory of state juridical person represented by the German public law scholar Georg Jelinek, the constitutional scholar Minobe Tatsukichi and others advocated this theory.
* Tenno Shuken Setsu (天皇主権説, Imperial Sovereignty Theory) – Hozumi Yatsuka, Uesugi Shinkichi and others opposed the Tenno Kikan Setsu and argued that the sovereignty was with the emperor.
*Tennosei (天皇制) or kokutai (国体) – In modern Japan, all political parties, with the exception of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), recognise the Emperor System. In recent years, even the JCP has weakened its opposition to the emperor system to accommodate the majority of the population who recognise him.
* Anti-monarchism () – Some far-left extremists call for the abolition of the emperor system, but most of the Japanese people recognise the emperor and support for this is infinitesimal.

==Low Countries==
* Union of Arras, states of the Netherlands loyal to Philip II
* Orangism in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg
* Supporters of the return of Leopold III as King of the Belgians after the Second World War, also called Leopoldists

==Portugal==
* Miguelist, a supporter of King Miguel

==Spain==
* Alfonsism
* Carlist, a Spanish legitimist
* Royalist (Spanish American Revolution), a supporter of continued Spanish rule during the Latin American wars of independence

==Italy==
* During World War II the royalists were Italians who supported Victor Emmanuel III and the government of Pietro Badoglio after the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was overthrown.

==China==
* Chinese Empire Reform Association (Royalist Society) in the late Qing dynasty, an organisation that supported the pro-reform Guangxu Emperor and advocated constitutional monarchy as a peaceful political reform, against both the conservative rulers (such as the Empress Dowager Cixi) who opposed any reform and the Tongmenghui which sought to overthrow the Chinese monarchy and establish the Republic of China)
* Royalist Party: This militant party was established during the Xinhai Revolution, and was vehemently opposed to the new Republic of China. It tried to use politics and later violence in order to restore the Qing dynasty or at least some form of monarchy, but failed.

==Cambodia==

The FUNCINPEC Party (; ), National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia is a royalist political party in Cambodia founded in 1981. The party draws its inspiration from the political legacy of the former King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk.

==Iran==

The Constitutionalist Party of Iran (CPI) () is a liberal democratic party founded in 1994 (originally as the &quot;Constitutional Movement of Iran&quot;) and is based in exile. The party favors a constitutional monarchy in Iran but isn&#x27;t opposed to a republic based on referendum. It also supports returning of &quot;Crown Prince&quot; Reza Pahlavi as the next shah of Iran.

==United States==
* Loyalists during the American Revolution (and the ensuing American Revolutionary War) were American colonists opposed to seceding from the Kingdom of Great Britain and instead remained loyal to the British Crown. After the war ended in independence for the Thirteen Colonies, many loyalists emigrated north to British North America (Present-day Canada), referring to themselves as the United Empire Loyalists.

==Malaysia==
* Johor Royalists Club is a non-governmental organization which was founded in the State of Johor, within the Federation of Malaysia, on 23 March 2015. Its mission is to restore the &quot;Order&quot;, and its objectives are to support the monarchy of Johor; to create awareness of the heritage of the monarchy of Johor; and to close up racial relations through the monarchy of Johor. Its membership is open to pure Johoreans (Anak Jati Johor) who, and both of whose parents, were born in Johor, and are loyal (and only loyal) to the Sultan of Johor. It operates in the form of a people&#x27;s congress, and has a standing committee to manage the day-to-day affairs.

==Nepal==
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party was founded on the principles of democracy, constitutional monarchy, nationalism and economic liberalization. When the monarchy was abolished in 2008 and Nepal was declared a secular state, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal changed its constitution to support monarchy and the re-establishment of the Hindu state.

<text>The Angora or Ankara is a Turkish breed of domesticated goat. It produces the lustrous fibre known as mohair. It is widespread in many countries of the world. Many breeds derive from it, among them the Indian Mohair, the Soviet Mohair, the Angora-Don of the Russian Federation and the Pygora in the United States.

== History ==

The origin of the Angora is not known. The earliest Western description may be that published in 1555 by Pierre Belon, who while travelling from Heraclea to Konya in southern Turkey had seen goats with snow-white &quot;... wool so delicate that one would judge it finer than silk ...&quot;. 

Angora goats were depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 lira banknote from 1938 to 1952.

In 1960 there were over 6 million Angora goats in Turkey; the population subsequently dropped sharply. In 2004 the total goat population of the country was approximately 7.2 million; of these, just over 5% were of Angora stock, while the remainder were hair goats. A conservation programme for the Angora was established in 2003.

== Characteristics ==

The Angora is a moderately small goat, standing about at the withers. It is slender, elegant and light-framed; the head is small, with semi-lop ears. It is usually horned; in billies the horns are commonly long, twisted and strong. With the exception of the face and legs, the animal is entirely covered in a coat of long ringlets of fine and lustrous mohair. This is not goat hair as seen on other breeds, but the down or undercoat which, in this breed only, grows much longer than the outer hair coat. The face and coat are normally white, but – particularly in southern Turkey – black, brown and grey animals also occur.

== Use ==

The goats are reared either for mohair or for their goat&#x27;s meat. Mohair is not as fine as cashmere, but yields are much higher. Unlike cashmere, which is obtained by combing the coat of the goat, mohair is obtained by shearing; this is commonly done twice per year. In 2010 approximately half of all mohair production was in South Africa; Argentina and Lesotho were also major producers, followed by the United States, Turkey, Australia and New Zealand.

In some other countries the Angora is reared for its meat, which is succulent and tender, and which in the early twentieth century was described as the best of its kind in the world.

<doc id="170661" wikidata="Q391101" url="?curid=170661" title="Agatha Christie's Poirot">
<text>Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot, or simply Poirot (), is a British mystery drama television programme that aired on ITV from 8 January 1989 to 13 November 2013. The ITV show is based on many of Agatha Christie&#x27;s famous crime fiction series, which revolves around the fictional private investigator Hercule Poirot. David Suchet stars as the title character. Initially produced by LWT, the series was later produced by ITV Studios. The series also aired on VisionTV in Canada, and on PBS and A&amp;E in the US.

The programme ran for 13 series and 70 episodes in total. Each episode was adapted from a novel or short story by Christie that featured Poirot. In each episode Poirot is both the main detective in charge of the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and the protagonist at the centre of most of the episode&#x27;s action. At the programme&#x27;s conclusion, which finished with &quot;&quot;, based on the 1975 novel of the same name, every major literary work by Christie that featured the title character had been adapted.

== Cast ==

David Suchet was cast as the eponymous Hercule Poirot. He was portrayed, especially in the earlier series, alongside Hugh Fraser as the closest friend of Poirot, Captain Arthur Hastings, as well as Pauline Moran playing Poirot&#x27;s clever secretary Felicity Lemon and Philip Jackson depicting Poirot’s long-standing associate Inspector James Japp.

Towards the later series, other characters such as Poirot&#x27;s English butler, George, played by David Yelland, and crime novelist Ariadne Oliver, played by Zoë Wanamaker, feature and become prominent. Several actors played multiple parts specific to certain episodes, including Nicholas Farrell and Beatie Edney.

== Episodes ==
== Production ==

Clive Exton in partnership with producer Brian Eastman adapted the pilot. Together, they wrote and produced the first eight series. Exton and Eastman left &quot;Poirot&quot; after 2001, when they began work on &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot;. Michele Buck and Damien Timmer, who both went on to form Mammoth Screen, were behind the revamping of the series.

While Christie&#x27;s novels are set contemporaneously with the time of writing (between the 1920s and 1970s), 1936 was chosen as the year in which to place the majority of &quot;Poirot&quot; episodes; references to events such as the Jarrow March were included to strengthen this chronology. With some exceptions, the series as a whole is set in roughly chronological order between 1935 and 1939, just prior to the Second World War. Numerous references in early episodes place the series primarily in 1935, progressing to 1936 by series four. Most references remain to 1936, moving slowly forward to 1937 by series eleven and 1938 by &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. &quot;The Big Four&quot; is set explicitly in early 1939. The most notable exceptions to this chronology are &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, which narrates Poirot&#x27;s first case in 1917, and &quot;Curtain: Poirot&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, which is set primarily in 1949. &quot;The Chocolate Box&quot; shows Poirot in the early 1900s, though the framing narrative remains consistent with the series&#x27; usual timeframe.

The episodes aired from series 9 in 2003 featured a radical shift in tone from the previous series. The humour of the earlier series was downplayed with each episode being presented as serious drama and saw the introduction of gritty elements not present in the Christie stories being adapted. Recurrent motifs in the additions included drug use, sex, abortion, homosexuality, and a tendency toward more visceral imagery. The visual style of later episodes was correspondingly different: particularly, an overall darker tone; and austere modernist or Art Deco locations and decor, widely used earlier in the series, being largely dropped in favour of more lavish settings (epitomised by the re-imagining of Poirot&#x27;s home as a larger, more lavish apartment).

The series logo was redesigned (the full opening title sequence had not been used since series 6 in 1996), and the main theme motif, though used often, was usually featured subtly and in sombre arrangements; this has been described as a consequence of the novels adapted being darker and more psychologically driven. However, a more upbeat string arrangement of the theme music is used for the end credits of &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;, &quot;The Clocks&quot; and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;. In flashback scenes, later episodes also made extensive use of fisheye lens, distorted colours, and other visual effects.
Series 9–12 lack Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran, who had appeared in the previous series (excepting series 4, where Moran is absent). Series 10 (2006) introduced Zoë Wanamaker as the eccentric crime novelist Ariadne Oliver and David Yelland as Poirot&#x27;s dependable valet, George — a character that had been introduced in the early &quot;Poirot&quot; novels but was left out of the early adaptations to develop the character of Miss Lemon. The introduction of Wanamaker and Yelland&#x27;s characters and the absence of the other characters is generally consistent with the stories on which the scripts were based. Hugh Fraser and David Yelland returned for two episodes of the final series (&quot;The Big Four&quot; and &quot;Curtain&quot;), with Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran returning for the adaptation of &quot;The Big Four&quot;. Zoë Wanamaker also returned for the adaptations of &quot;Elephants Can Remember&quot; and &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

Clive Exton adapted seven novels and fourteen short stories for the series, including &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; and &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, which received mixed reviews from critics. Anthony Horowitz was another prolific writer for the series, adapting three novels and nine short stories, while Nick Dear adapted six novels. Comedian and novelist Mark Gatiss wrote three episodes and also guest-starred in the series, as have Peter Flannery and Kevin Elyot. Ian Hallard, who co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Big Four&quot; with Mark Gatiss, appears in the episode and also &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;, which was scripted by Gatiss alone.

Florin Court in Charterhouse Square, London, was used as Poirot&#x27;s London residence, Whitehaven Mansions. The final episode to be filmed was &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; in June 2013 on the Greenway Estate (which was Agatha Christie&#x27;s home) broadcast on 30 October 2013. Most of the locations and buildings where the episodes were shot were given fictional names.

=== Casting ===
Suchet was recommended for the part by Christie&#x27;s family, who had seen him appear as Blott in the TV adaptation of Tom Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot;. Suchet, a method actor, said that he prepared for the part by reading all the &quot;Poirot&quot; novels and every short story, and copying out every piece of description about the character. Suchet told &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;: &quot;What I did was, I had my file on one side of me and a pile of stories on the other side and day after day, week after week, I ploughed through most of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels about Hercule Poirot and wrote down characteristics until I had a file full of documentation of the character. And then it was my business not only to know what he was like, but to gradually become him. I had to become him before we started shooting&quot;.

During the filming of the first series, Suchet almost left the production during an argument with a director, insisting that Poirot&#x27;s odd mannerisms (in this case, putting a handkerchief down before sitting on a park bench) be featured; he later said &quot;there&#x27;s no question [Poirot&#x27;s] obsessive-compulsive&quot;. According to many critics and enthusiasts, Suchet&#x27;s characterisation is considered to be the most accurate interpretation of all the actors who have played Poirot, and the closest to the character in the books. In 2013, Suchet revealed that Christie&#x27;s daughter Rosalind Hicks had told him she was sure Christie would have approved of his performance.

In 2007, Suchet spoke of his desire to film the remaining stories in the canon and hoped to achieve this before his 65th birthday in May 2011. Despite speculation of cancellation early in 2011, the remaining books were ultimately adapted into a thirteenth series, adapted in 2013 into 5 episodes, from which &quot;Curtain&quot; aired last on 13 November. A 2013 television special, &quot;Being Poirot&quot;, centred on Suchet&#x27;s characterisation and his emotional final episode.

=== Development ===
=== Actors ===
Alongside recurring characters, the early series featured actors who later achieved greater fame, including Sean Pertwee (&quot;The King of Clubs&quot;, 1989; &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;, 2013), Joely Richardson (&quot;The Dream&quot;, 1989), Polly Walker (&quot;Peril at End House&quot;, 1990), Samantha Bond (&quot;The Adventure of the Cheap Flat&quot;, 1990), Christopher Eccleston (&quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;, 1992), Hermione Norris (&quot;Jewel Robbery at The Grand Metropolitan&quot;, 1993), Damian Lewis (&quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;, 1995), Jamie Bamber (&quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, 2000), Russell Tovey (&quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;, 2001), Kelly Reilly (&quot;Sad Cypress&quot;, 2003), Emily Blunt (&quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, 2004), Alice Eve (&quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;, 2005), Michael Fassbender (&quot;After the Funeral&quot;, 2006), Aidan Gillen (&quot;Five Little Pigs&quot;, 2003), Toby Jones and Jessica Chastain (&quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, 2010), and Tom Ellis (&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;, 2013).

Four Academy Award nominees have appeared in the series: Sarah Miles, Barbara Hershey, Elizabeth McGovern and Elliott Gould. Peter Capaldi, Jessica Chastain, Michael Fassbender, Lesley Manville, Vanessa Kirby and Emily Blunt went on to receive Academy Award nominations after appearing on the show (with Chastain winning the Best Actress award in 2022 for &quot;The Eyes of Tammy Faye&quot;). Several members of British thespian families appeared in episodes throughout the course of the series. James Fox appeared as Colonel Race in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, and his older brother Edward Fox appeared as Gudgeon in &quot;The Hollow&quot;.

Three of the Cusack sisters each appeared in an episode: Niamh Cusack in &quot;The King of Clubs&quot;, Sorcha Cusack in &quot;Jewel Robbery at The Grand Metropolitan&quot;, and Sinéad Cusack in &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;. Phyllida Law and her daughter Sophie Thompson appeared in &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;. David Yelland appeared as Charles Laverton West in &quot;Murder in the Mews&quot; and as George for the remainder of the series from Series 10 onward, and his daughter Hannah Yelland appeared as Geraldine Marsh in &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
Agatha Christie&#x27;s grandson Mathew Prichard commented: &quot;Personally, I regret very much that she [Agatha Christie] never saw David Suchet. I think that visually he is much the most convincing and perhaps he manages to convey to the viewer just enough of the irritation that we always associate with the perfectionist, to be convincing!&quot;

In 2008, the series was described by some critics as going &quot;off piste&quot;, though not negatively, from its old format. It was praised for its new writers, more lavish productions, and a greater emphasis on the darker psychology of the novels. Significantly, it was noted for &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; (adapted by Kevin Elyot) bringing out a homosexual subtext of the novel. Nominations for twenty BAFTAs were received between 1989 and 1991 for series 1–3.

=== Accolades ===

== Home media ==
In the UK, ITV Studios Home Entertainment owns the home media rights.

In Region 1, Acorn Media has the rights to series 1–6 and 11–12. Series 7–10 are distributed by A&amp;E, a co-producer on several of them. In North America, series 1–11 are available on Netflix and Amazon Prime instant streaming service. In Region 4, Acorn Media, distributed by &quot;Reel DVD&quot;, has begun releasing the series on DVD in Australia in complete season sets. To date, they have released the first 8 series of the show. Series 1–9 and 12 are available in Spain (Region 2) on Blu-ray with Spanish and English audio tracks. Dutch FilmWorks were reported to be the first company to release series 12, in 2010.

Beginning in 2011, Acorn began issuing the series on Blu-ray discs. As of November 2014, series 1 through 13 have all been issued on DVD and Blu-ray by Acorn. The A&amp;E DVD releases of series 7 through 10 correspond to the A&amp;E versions broadcast in America which were missing sections of the original video as originally broadcast in the United Kingdom. The Acorn releases of series 7 through 10 restore the missing video.

== &quot;Being Poirot&quot; ==

Being Poirot is a 50-minute 2013 ITV television documentary in which David Suchet attempts to unravel the mysterious appeal of Hercule Poirot and how he portrayed him. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the same evening as the final episode, &quot;Curtain&quot;.

Suchet visits the Greenway Estate, Agatha Christie&#x27;s summer home, recollecting how he met her daughter Rosalind Hicks and her husband Anthony Hicks for their approval before he began filming. He meets Christie&#x27;s grandson Mathew Prichard who recounts how his grandmother found the character amongst Belgian refugees in Torquay. There&#x27;s a visit to the permanent Poirot exhibition at Torquay Museum, to which he presented the cane he used in the television series.

Suchet acknowledges the first stage and film adaptations of the books with actors such as Charles Laughton on the London stage in &quot;Alibi&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, in 1928. &quot;Alibi&quot; was filmed in 1931 with Austin Trevor but is now lost. The oldest surviving film portrayal from 1934 was &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; again with Austin Trevor portraying Poirot. Suchet notes a conscious decision was made by the film company to portray Poirot without a moustache.

Films featuring Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov are also featured. Suchet reveals that he read the books and wrote down 93 notes about the character that he went on to use in his portrayal. The descriptions in the books helped him discover the voice he would use, and the rapid mincing gait.

Suchet also goes to Florin Court, a place that the production company chose to represent his home Whitehaven Mansions. There he meets first producer Brian Eastman, with whom he discusses the set that was built based on the flats, and Eastman&#x27;s decision to fix the stories in 1936. Suchet also visits composer Christopher Gunning who had composed four themes for Eastman, the first being Gunning&#x27;s favourite. Eastman chose the fourth after having Gunning darken the tone.

Suchet travels to Brussels, where he is feted by the police chief and mayor. He then goes to Ellezelles, which claims to be the birthplace of Poirot, and he is shown a birth certificate as proof. It says the date was 1 April, &quot;April Fools&#x27; Day&quot;, with no year mentioned. Finally, Suchet travels on the Orient Express and recounts filming the episode &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; last at Greenway to finish on a high note.

==Novels or stories not included in the series==
Suchet was proud to have completed the entire Poirot canon by the time of the broadcast of the final episode, only slightly short of the target he had set for himself in a 2007 interview of completing the entire canon before his 65th birthday.

A number of Poirot short stories were not directly adapted for the series. In most cases, these stories were subsequently reworked by Christie, and adapted for the television series in their final forms. &quot;The Plymouth Express&quot; was adapted in both its original short story form and as &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;.

<text>Paiute (; also Piute) refers to three non-contiguous groups of Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin. Although their languages are related within the Numic group of Uto-Aztecan languages, these three languages do not form a single subgroup and they are no more closely related to each than they are to the Central Numic languages (Timbisha, Shoshoni, and Comanche) which are spoken between them. 

The term &quot;Paiute&quot; does not refer to a single, unique, unified group of Great Basin tribes, but is a historical label comprising:
* Northern Paiute people of northeastern California, northwestern Nevada, eastern Oregon, and southern Idaho
* Southern Paiute people of northern Arizona, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah
* Mono people of east central California, divided into Owens Valley Paiute (Eastern Mono) and Western Mono (Monache)

==Linguistic differences==
Though sharing similar Numic roots, the three groups historically called Paiute have different languages as shown below:</text><links>

<text>Jerome Herbert Skolnick (March 21, 1931 – February 22, 2024) was an American professor at Yale University, University of California, Berkeley, New York University and a former president of the American Society of Criminology. He joined the University of California, Berkeley in 1962. Skolnick had a Ph.D. in sociology from Yale University. In the 1950s he was appointed a Law professor at Yale, one of the youngest to ever hold that position.

==Clearance rates==
Jerome Skolnick had argued that clearance rates demonstrate the reality of the criminal justice conflict model by encouraging police to focus on appearing to do their job, rather than on actually doing their job. This is a comparable argument to that regarding standardized testing, and &quot;teaching to the test&quot;. Skolnick noted one incident where police coerced a man to confess to over 400 burglaries so that they could have a high rate of crime solving (clearance).

His awards include Carnegie, Guggenheim and National Science Foundation fellowships as well as prizes for distinguished scholarship from the American Society of Criminology, the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences and the Western Society of Criminology. Jerry received widespread recognition in the United States and abroad throughout his long career.

Skolnick died on February 22, 2024, in New York City, New York, at the age of 92.

==Quotes==
*&quot;The law often, but not always, supports police deception.&quot;
*&quot;Courtroom lying is justified within the police culture by the same sort of necessity rationale that courts have permitted police to employ at the investigative stage: The end justifies the means.&quot;

==Writings by Jerome Skolnick==
Most of his writings deal with criminal justice.

==Personal life==
While attending Yale Law School, Jerome married Arlene Silberstein in New Haven, Connecticut. Both Jerome and Arlene were Reform Jewish. They had two sons who were born in Berkeley, Alex Skolnick, lead guitarist for the thrash metal band Testament and founder of the jazz band Alex Skolnick trio, and Michael Skolnick.

<text>John Davies Cale (born 9 March 1942) is a Welsh musician, composer, and record producer who was a founding member of the American rock band the Velvet Underground. Over his six-decade career, Cale has worked in various styles across rock, drone, classical, avant-garde and electronic music.

He studied music at Goldsmiths College, University of London (UoL), before relocating in 1963 to New York City&#x27;s downtown music scene, where he performed as part of the Theatre of Eternal Music and formed the Velvet Underground. Since leaving the band in 1968, Cale has released seventeen solo studio albums, including the widely acclaimed &quot;Paris 1919&quot; (1973) and &quot;Music for a New Society&quot; (1982). Cale has also acquired a reputation as an adventurous record producer, working on the debut studio albums of several influential artists, including the Stooges and Patti Smith.

== Early life and career ==
John Davies Cale was born on 9 March 1942 in the mining village of Garnant in the valley of the River Amman in Carmarthenshire of Wales to Will Cale, a coal miner, and Margaret Davies, a primary school teacher. Although his father spoke only English, his mother spoke and taught Welsh to Cale, which hindered his relationship with his father, although he began learning English at primary school, at around the age of seven. Cale was molested by two different men during his youth: an Anglican priest who molested him in a church and a music teacher. He played organ at Ammanford church. The BBC recorded Cale playing a toccata he composed primarily on the black keys of the piano in the style of Aram Khachaturian.

Having discovered a talent for viola, Cale joined the National Youth Orchestra of Wales (NYOW) at age 13. Receiving a scholarship, Cale studied music at Goldsmiths College, University of London (UoL). While he was there he organised an early Fluxus concert, &quot;A Little Festival of New Music&quot;, on 6 July 1963. He also contributed to the short film &quot;Police Car&quot; and had two scores published in &quot;Fluxus Preview Review&quot; (July 1963) for the nascent avant-garde collective. He conducted the first performance in the UK of Cage&#x27;s &quot;Concert for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, with the composer and pianist Michael Garrett as soloist. In 1963, he travelled to the United States to continue his musical training with the assistance and influence of Aaron Copland, who recommended him for Tanglewood.

Upon arriving in New York City, Cale met a number of influential composers. On 9 September 1963 he participated, along with John Cage and several others, in an 18-hour and 40 minute piano-playing marathon that was the first full-length performance of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Vexations&quot;. After the performance Cale appeared on the television panel show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Cale&#x27;s secret was that he had performed in an 18-hour concert, and he was accompanied by Karl Schenzer, whose secret was that he was the only member of the audience who had stayed for the duration. Cale would later attribute Cage&#x27;s writings with his own &quot;relaxed&quot; artistic outlook, having hitherto been raised to believe that European composers were obliged to justify their work.

Cale played in La Monte Young&#x27;s ensemble the Theatre of Eternal Music. The heavily drone-laden music he played there proved to be a big influence in his work with his next band, the Velvet Underground. One of his collaborators on these recordings was the Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison. Three albums of his early experimental work from this period were released in 2001.

== The Velvet Underground (1964–1968) ==
Cale had enjoyed and followed rock music as well as avant-garde and European art music from a young age; on a visit to Britain in 1965, he procured records by the Kinks, the Who and Small Faces that had remained unavailable in the United States.

Earlier that year, he co-founded the Velvet Underground with Lou Reed, recruiting his flatmate Angus MacLise and Reed&#x27;s college friend Sterling Morrison to complete the initial line-up. Just before the band&#x27;s first paying gig for $75 at Summit High School in New Jersey, MacLise abruptly quit the band because he viewed accepting money for art as selling out; he was replaced by Moe Tucker as the band&#x27;s drummer. Initially hired to play that one show, she soon became a permanent member and her tribal pounding style became an integral part of the band&#x27;s music, despite the initial objections of Cale to the band having a female drummer.

On his aforementioned visit to Britain in the summer of 1965, Cale shopped a crudely recorded, acoustic-based Velvet Underground demo reel to several luminaries in the British rock scene (including Marianne Faithfull) with the intention of securing a recording contract. Although this failed to manifest, the tape was disseminated throughout the UK underground over the following eighteen months by such figures as producer Joe Boyd and Mick Farren of the Deviants. As a result, the Deviants, the Yardbirds and David Bowie had all covered Velvet Underground songs prior to the release of their debut studio album in 1967.

The very first commercially available recording of the Velvet Underground, an instrumental track called &quot;Loop&quot; given away with the Pop Art issue of &quot;Aspen&quot; magazine, was a feedback experiment written and conducted by Cale. His creative relationship with Reed was integral to the sound of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (recorded in 1966, released in 1967) and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (recorded in 1967, released in 1968). On these albums he plays viola, bass guitar and piano, and sings occasional backing vocals. &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (1968) also features Cale on organ (on &quot;Sister Ray&quot;) as well as two vocal performances: &quot;Lady Godiva&#x27;s Operation&quot;, an experimental song where he shares lead vocal duties with Reed, and &quot;The Gift&quot;, a long spoken word piece written by Reed during his time at Syracuse University. Though Cale co-wrote the music to several songs, his most distinctive contribution is the electrically amplified viola. He also played celesta on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. Cale also played on Nico&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; (1967), which includes songs co-written by Velvet Underground members Cale, Reed and Morrison, who also appear as musicians. Cale makes his debut as lyricist on &quot;Winter Song&quot; &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Little Sister&quot;.

With tensions between Reed and Cale growing, Reed gave an ultimatum to Morrison and Tucker, declaring that unless Cale was fired, he would quit the band. Morrison and Tucker reluctantly went along with the scheme.

In September 1968, Cale played his final gig with the Velvet Underground at the Boston Tea Party and according to Tucker, &quot;When John left, it was really sad. I felt really bad. And of course, this was gonna really influence the music, &#x27;cause, John&#x27;s a lunatic (laughs). I think we became a little more normal, which was fine, it was good music, good songs, it was never the same though. It was good stuff, a lot of good songs, but, just, the lunacy factor was... gone.&quot; After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by Boston-based musician Doug Yule, who played bass guitar, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed.

Michael Carlucci, who was friends with Robert Quine, has given this explanation about Cale&#x27;s dismissal, &quot;Lou told Quine that the reason why he had to get rid of Cale in the band was Cale&#x27;s ideas were just too out there. Cale had some wacky ideas. He wanted to record the next album with the amplifiers underwater, and [Lou] just couldn&#x27;t have it. He was trying to make the band more accessible.&quot;

Arguably, the artistic frictions between Cale and Reed are what shaped the band&#x27;s early sound much more than any other members. The pair often had heated disagreements about the direction of the band, and this tension was central to their later collaborations. When Cale left, he seemed to take the more experimental tendencies with him, as is noticeable in comparing the proto-noise rock of &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (which Cale co-created) to the comparatively dulcet, folk rock–influenced &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; (1969), recorded after his departure.

Cale has favorably compared the dissonance of his Velvet Underground compositions to the indecipherable lyricism of certain strains of Southern hip hop: &quot;If I can use out-of-tune stuff, [rappers] don&#x27;t need words to make sense. There&#x27;s definitely a lineage&quot;.

Cale briefly returned to the Velvet Underground in 1970, albeit in the studio only: he played organ on the track &quot;Ocean&quot; during the practice sessions to produce demos for the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Loaded&quot;, nearly two years after he left the band. He was enticed back into the studio by the band&#x27;s manager, Steve Sesnick, &quot;in a half-hearted attempt to reunite old comrades&quot;, as Cale put it. Although he does not appear on the finished album, the demo recording of &quot;Ocean&quot; was included in the 1997 &quot;Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition&quot; CD re-issue. Finally, five previously unreleased tracks recorded in late 1967 and early 1968 were included on the compilation albums &quot;VU&quot; (1985) and &quot;Another View&quot; (1986).

== Solo career ==
=== 1970s ===
After leaving the Velvet Underground, Cale worked as a record producer and arranger on a number of studio albums, most notably the Stooges&#x27; highly influential 1969 self-titled debut and a trilogy by Nico, including &quot;The Marble Index&quot; (1968), &quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970) and &quot;The End...&quot; (1974). On these he accompanied Nico&#x27;s voice and harmonium using a wide array of instruments to unusual effect. While meeting with Joe Boyd (who co-produced &quot;Desertshore&quot;), he came across Nick Drake&#x27;s music and insisted on collaborating with the fledgling artist. He appeared on Drake&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; (1971), playing viola and harpsichord on &quot;Fly&quot; and piano, organ, and celesta on &quot;Northern Sky&quot;.

In addition to working as a record producer, Cale initiated a solo recording career in early 1970. His debut studio album, &quot;Vintage Violence&quot; (1970), is a lushly produced roots rock effort indebted to a range of disparate influences, including the Band, Leonard Cohen, the Byrds, Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. The more experimental &quot;Church of Anthrax&quot; (a collaboration with minimal music pioneer Terry Riley) followed in February 1971, although it was actually recorded nearly a year prior to its release. While his explorations in art music briefly continued with 1972&#x27;s &quot;The Academy in Peril&quot;, he would not compose in the classical mode thereafter until he began working on film soundtracks in the 1980s.

In 1972, he signed with au courant Reprise Records as a recording artist and staff producer. &quot;The Academy in Peril&quot; (1972) was his first project for Reprise. The subsequent &quot;Paris 1919&quot; (1973) steered back towards the singer-songwriter mode of &quot;Vintage Violence&quot; (1970) with a backing band that included Lowell George of Little Feat and Wilton Felder of the Crusaders, as well as the UCLA Symphony Orchestra. Composed of highly melodic songs with arcane and complex lyrics, it has been cited by critics as one of his best.

While affiliated with the label, he produced studio albums by Jennifer Warnes (her third, &quot;Jennifer&quot;), Chunky, Novi &amp; Ernie, and the self-titled debut of the Modern Lovers, which Reprise chose not to release; it subsequently appeared on Beserkley Records, the latest in a series of important Cale-produced proto-punk records. In 1974, he signed to Island Records as an artist, while continuing to produce a variety of artists, mostly for other labels, including Squeeze, Patti Smith and Sham 69. He worked as a talent scout with Island&#x27;s A&amp;R department.

==== 1974–1979 ====

In 1974, Cale moved back to London. As his second marriage had begun to dissolve, he made a series of solo studio albums which moved in a new direction. His records now featured a dark and threatening aura, often carrying a sense of barely suppressed aggression. A trilogy of studio albums – &quot;Fear&quot; (1974), &quot;Slow Dazzle&quot; (1975), and &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1975) – were rapidly recorded and released over the course of about a year with other Island artists, including Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno of Roxy Music and Chris Spedding, who played in his live band. A showpiece of his concerts from the era was his radically transformed cover version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, initially performed by Cale on &quot;Slow Dazzle&quot; (1975) and the live album &quot;June 1, 1974&quot;, recorded with Kevin Ayers, Nico and Eno. Both &quot;Leaving It Up to You&quot; and &quot;Fear Is a Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; (from &quot;Fear&quot;) begin as relatively conventional songs that gradually grow more paranoid in tone before breaking down into what critic Dave Thompson calls &quot;a morass of discordance and screaming&quot;.

Cale released &quot;Animal Justice&quot; in 1977, an extended play (EP) notable particularly for the epic &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; based very loosely on the 1891 play of the same name by Henrik Ibsen. His loud, abrasive and confrontational live performances fitted well with the punk rock scene developing on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Cale took to wearing a hockey goaltender mask onstage (as evinced by the cover of his 1977 compilation album &quot;Guts&quot;, a compilation drawn from the Island trilogy after the label withheld &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1975) in the United States); this look predated the creation of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;&#x27;s villain, Jason Voorhees, by several years. During one concert in Croydon, south London, Cale chopped the head off a dead chicken with a meat cleaver, leading his band to walk offstage in protest. Cale&#x27;s drummer – a vegetarian – was so bothered he quit the band. Cale mocks his decision on &quot;Chicken Shit&quot; from the &quot;Animal Justice&quot; EP. Cale has admitted that some of his paranoia and erratic behaviour at this time was associated with heavy cocaine use.

Also in 1977, Cale produced &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna&quot;, the debut single by punk rock band Sham 69.

In 1978, Cale produced the majority of Squeeze&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Squeeze&quot;, with Cale instructing the band to discard all of the songs that the band had written up until that point, and to write new songs instead, with Glenn Tilbrook, and Chris Difford finding the process of working with Cale both frustrating and challenging. Also that year he played keyboards on Julie Covington&#x27;s cover version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1979, he began a relationship with Austin, Texas-based groupie and journalist Margaret Moser. Cale named the group of women that Moser hung out with the Texas Blondes. His relationship with Moser lasted about five years, overlapping with the beginning of his third marriage.

In December 1979, Cale&#x27;s embrace of the punk rock ethic that he helped to inspire culminated in the release of &quot;Sabotage/Live&quot;. This record, recorded live over three nights, at CBGB that June, features aggressive vocal and instrumental performances. The album consists entirely of new songs, many of which grapple confrontationally with global politics, militarism and paranoia.

Also in 1979, Cale played piano and the ARP synthesizer on the track &quot;Bastard&quot; by Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople, on his fourth solo studio album &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone with a Schizophrenic&quot;.

The band included Deerfrance on vocals and percussion. An earlier live set, consisting mostly of new material, was recorded at CBGB the previous year. It was released in 1987 as &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. The band on that recording includes Ivan Král (best known for his work with Patti Smith) on bass and longtime Brian Eno associate Judy Nylon providing vocals, and narrating.

=== 1980s ===

In 1980, Cale signed a recording contract with A&amp;M Records and moved in a more commercial direction with his seventh solo studio album &quot;Honi Soit&quot; (1981). He worked with record producer Mike Thorne towards this end. Andy Warhol provided the cover art, in black and white, but against Warhol&#x27;s wishes, Cale colourised it. The new direction did not succeed commercially, however, and his relationship with A&amp;M ended. He signed with ZE Records, a company he had influenced the creation of and which had absorbed SPY Records, the label he had co-founded with Jane Friedman. In 1982, Cale released the sparse studio album &quot;Music for a New Society&quot;. Seeming to blend the refined music of his early solo work with the threatening music that came later, it is by any standard a bleak, harrowing record. It&#x27;s been called &quot;understated, and perhaps a masterpiece.&quot;

He followed it up with his ninth solo studio album &quot;Caribbean Sunset&quot; (1984), also on ZE Records. The album features contributions from Brian Eno and an otherwise &quot;young unknown&quot; band, that consisted of David Young on guitar, Andrew Heermans on bass guitar, and David Lichtenstein (son of artist Roy Lichtenstein) on drums. This work, with much more accessible production than on &quot;Music for a New Society&quot; (1982), was still extremely militant in some ways. &quot;Caribbean Sunset&quot; became Cale&#x27;s only studio album to chart on the Dutch Album Top 100, peaking at No. 28. However, it received negative reviews from critics, and has never been released on CD.

A live album, &quot;John Cale Comes Alive&quot; (1984), followed &quot;Caribbean Sunset&quot; and included two new studio songs, &quot;Ooh La La&quot; and &quot;Never Give Up on You&quot;. Different mixes of the two studio tracks appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. During this period, Eden Cale was born to Cale and his third wife Risé Irushalmi in July 1985.

In a last-ditch attempt at commercial success, Cale recorded &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; (1985), his only studio album for Beggars Banquet Records. With all of its tracks written in collaboration with &quot;High Times&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot; editor Larry &quot;Ratso&quot; Sloman (who had previously co-written two tracks on &quot;Caribbean Sunset&quot;), the album was a pop effort characterised by prominent use of synthesizers and drum machines. It was not significantly more successful than its predecessors, despite the relative success of the single &quot;Satellite Walk&quot;. However, &quot;Dying on the Vine&quot; is generally regarded as one of Cale&#x27;s best songs. That same year, he played a neo-Nazi organizer on an episode of &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, and wrote the music for a dramatization of the Kurt Vonnegut short story, &quot;Who Am I This Time?&quot; (1982), which aired on PBS and starred Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon.

Cale again returned to record producing, producing Belgian pop singer Lio&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Pop model&quot; (1986), and Happy Mondays&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)&quot; (1987). Other albums that he produced during this time were Element of Crime&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Try to Be Mensch&quot; (1987), and Art Bergmann&#x27;s debut solo studio album &quot;Crawl with Me&quot; (1988).

In part because of his young daughter, Cale took a long break from recording and performing. He made a comeback in 1989 with the Brian Eno-produced studio album &quot;Words for the Dying&quot;. The album consists mainly of oral work, read or sung by Cale. It was written in 1982 as a response to the Anglo-Argentinian Falklands War, using poems written by fellow Welshman Dylan Thomas. There are also two orchestral interludes, two other solo piano pieces &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;, and finally a song by Cale, &quot;The Soul of Carmen Miranda&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
Following Warhol&#x27;s death in 1987, Cale again collaborated with Lou Reed on the 1990 studio album &quot;Songs for Drella&quot;, a song cycle about Warhol, their mentor. The album marked an end to a 18-year estrangement from Reed. In his autobiography, Cale revealed that he resented letting Reed take charge of the project. The longstanding friction between Reed and Cale contributed to the passion and lurching frustration evident in the sound of the album, as did the ambivalent relationship Reed had to Warhol. Nevertheless, that same year, following a 20-year hiatus, the Velvet Underground reformed for a Fondation Cartier benefit show in Paris, France. This led to a reunion tour in Europe 1993, and the live album &quot;Live MCMXCIII&quot;.

Cale again collaborated with Brian Eno, also in 1990, &quot;Wrong Way Up&quot;, a collaboration album characterised by an up-tempo accessibility at odds with Cale&#x27;s description of the fraught relationship between the pair. The following year, Cale contributed a cover version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; to the Leonard Cohen tribute album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan&quot;. His mid-tempo, piano arrangement formed the basis of most subsequent cover versions of the song, which has since become a standard.

In 1992, he performed vocals on two songs, &quot;Hunger&quot; and &quot;First Evening&quot;, on French composer and record producer Hector Zazou&#x27;s concept album, &quot;Sahara Blue&quot;. All lyrics on the album were based on the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. In 1994, Cale performed a spoken-word duet with folk rock singer Suzanne Vega on the song &quot;The Long Voyage&quot; on Zazou&#x27;s studio album &quot;Chansons des mers froides&quot;. The lyrics were based on the poem &quot;Les Silhouettes&quot; by Oscar Wilde, and Cale co-wrote the music with Zazou. It was later released as a single (retitled &quot;The Long Voyages&quot; as it featured several remixes by Zazou, Mad Professor and more).

In 1996, he played piano on &quot;Love to Die For&quot; by Marc Almond of Soft Cell, from his ninth solo studio album &quot;Fantastic Star&quot;. He also produced Scottish alternative rock band Goya Dress&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Rooms&quot;.

That same year, Cale released &quot;Walking on Locusts&quot; which turned out to be his only solo studio album of the decade. The record featured appearances by Talking Heads&#x27; David Byrne, the Soldier String Quartet, and original Velvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker. Throughout the rest of the nineties, he worked primarily as a producer or contributor to other&#x27;s recordings.

Cale composed an instrumental score for a ballet titled &quot;Nico&quot;, performed by the Scapino Ballet in Rotterdam in October 1997 and was released as &quot;Dance Music&quot; (1998). Cale has written a number of film soundtracks, often using more classically influenced instrumentation.

In 1998, Cale mainly spent the year on tour with singer Siouxsie Sioux, formerly of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In February, he was the curator of one day festival called With a Little Help from My Friends that took place at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with the presence of the Metropole Orchestra. The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured a song specially composed for the event and still unreleased, &quot;Murdering Mouth&quot;, sung in duet with Siouxsie and her second band the Creatures. Cale and Siouxsie then did a double bill tour in the US for two months from late June until mid-August, both artists collaborating on stage on several songs including a version of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;.

Cale&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;What&#x27;s Welsh for Zen?&quot;, was written in collaboration with Victor Bockris and published in 1999 by Bloomsbury Publishing.

=== 2000s ===

Cale had recorded a cover version of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; by Leonard Cohen for the tribute album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Fan&quot; (1991). Cohen&#x27;s original version of the song had not garnered much interest; it was only through Cale&#x27;s arrangement and recording of it (and Jeff Buckley&#x27;s subsequent cover of Cale&#x27;s arrangement) that it achieved popularity. It was used in the 2001 animated film &quot;Shrek&quot;, although it did not appear in the film&#x27;s soundtrack due to licensing issues.

In 2002, Cale played piano and sang vocals on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Pretend&quot; by Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, from his debut solo studio album &quot;Hitting the Ground&quot;.

Signing to EMI Records in 2003 with the EP &quot;5 Tracks&quot; and studio album &quot;HoboSapiens&quot;, Cale again returned as a regular recording artist, this time with music influenced by modern electronica and alternative rock. The well-received album was co-produced with Nick Franglen of Lemon Jelly. It was followed by his 2005 studio album &quot;blackAcetate&quot;.

In 2005, Cale produced Austin, Texas singer-songwriter Alejandro Escovedo&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Boxing Mirror&quot;, which was released in May 2006. In June 2006, Cale released a radio and digital single, &quot;Jumbo in tha Modernworld&quot;, which was a standalone single. A music video was created for the song as well.

In February 2007, a 23-song live retrospective, &quot;Circus Live&quot;, was released in Europe. This two-disc album, composed of recordings from both the 2004 and 2006 tours, featured new arrangements and reworkings of songs from his entire career. Of particular interest is the &quot;Amsterdam Suite&quot;, a set of songs from a performance at the Amsterdam Paradiso in 2004. A studio-created drone has been edited into these songs. The set also included a DVD, featuring electric rehearsal material and a short acoustic set, as well as the video for &quot;Jumbo in tha Modernworld&quot;, a 2006 single.

In May 2007, Cale contributed a cover version of the song &quot;All My Friends&quot; by LCD Soundsystem to the vinyl and digital single releases of the LCD Soundsystem original. Cale has continued to work with other artists, contributing viola to &quot;Replica Sun Machine&quot;, the Danger Mouse-produced second studio album by London alternative pop trio the Shortwave Set and producing the second studio album of American indie band Ambulance LTD.

On 11 October 2008, Cale hosted an event to pay tribute to Nico called Life Along the Borderline in celebration of what, five days later, would have been her 70th birthday. The event was reprised at the Teatro Communale in Ferrara, Italy on 10 May 2009.

Cale represented Wales at the 2009 Venice Biennale exhibition, collaborating with artists, filmmakers, and poets, and focusing the artwork on his relationship with the Welsh language.

=== 2010s ===
In January 2010, Cale was invited to be the first Eminent Art in Residence (EAR) at the Mona Foma festival curated by Brian Ritchie of the Violent Femmes held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. His work for the 2009 Venice Biennale &#x27;Dyddiau Du (dark days)&#x27; was shown at the festival, along with a number of live performances at venues around Hobart.

The &quot;Paris 1919&quot; (1973) studio album was performed, in its entirety, at the Coal Exchange in Cardiff on 21 November 2009, at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 5 March 2010, and the Theatre Royal in Norwich on 14 May 2010. These performances were reprised in Paris, France, on 5 September 2010; Brescia, Italy, on 11 September 2010; Los Angeles, California, on 30 September 2010 at UCLA&#x27;s Royce Hall; Melbourne, Australia, on 16 October 2010; Barcelona, Spain, on 28 May 2010 and Essen, Germany, on 6 October 2011.

In October 2010, Cale released the two-disc live album &quot;Live at Rockpalast&quot;, recorded during his two shows for German music television show &quot;Rockpalast&quot; on 14 October 1984 at Grugahalle, Essen (first disc; with full band) and 6 March 1983 at Zeche, Bochum (second disc; Cale solo with guitar and piano). This concert is missing &quot;Risé, Sam and Rimsky-Korsakov&quot; (Cale, Shepard) narrated by his then-wife Risé Irushalmi.

In February 2011, Cale signed a recording contract with Domino Records subsidiary Double Six and released an EP, &quot;Extra Playful&quot;, in September 2011.

In May 2011, he and his band appeared at the Brighton Festival, performing songs to the theme of &quot;Émigré/Lost &amp; Found&quot;. Cale appeared at the invitation of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who was the festival&#x27;s guest director.

In the autumn of 2012, Cale released &quot;Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood&quot;, his first studio album since 2005. The album features a collaboration with Danger Mouse, &quot;I Wanna Talk 2 U&quot;. Critical reception of the album was mixed to positive, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper describing it as &quot;an album that combines the 70-year-old&#x27;s experience with the glee of a small child.&quot;

In 2014, he appeared as vendor in an episode &quot;Sorrowsworn&quot; of the crime drama television series &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

Cale released his sixteenth solo studio album &quot;M:FANS&quot; in January 2016. It features new versions of songs from his 1982 studio album &quot;Music for a New Society&quot;.

In July 2016, Cale performed the songs &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at a late-night BBC Prom concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, celebrating the music of David Bowie who had died earlier that year.

At the 2017 Grammy Salute to Music Legends ceremony, Cale performed with, amongst others, Moe Tucker, two Velvet Underground classics, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;. The Velvet Underground were also the recipients of the 2017 Merit Award.

In February 2019, Cale collaborated with Marissa Nadler on her new single &quot;Poison&quot;.

In September 2019, he gave three concerts titled &quot;2019–1964: Futurespective&quot; at the Paris&#x27; Philharmonie, inviting his compatriot Cate Le Bon to join the band.

=== 2020s ===
Cale features on the track &quot;Corner of My Sky&quot; from Welsh electronic musician Kelly Lee Owens&#x27; second studio album &quot;Inner Song&quot; (2020).

On 6 October 2020, Cale released a standalone single and accompanying music video called &quot;Lazy Day&quot;.

In February 2022, Cale announced his first full UK tour in almost a decade. Cale&#x27;s tour was to begin in Liverpool at the Philharmonic Hall on July 15, before calling at Whitley Bay, York, Bexhill, Cambridge and the London Palladium, before closing out the run at Birmingham Town Hall on July 25. However, the tour was postponed to the fall of 2022 due to some
bandmembers contracting COVID-19.

In August 2022, Cale released the new track &quot;Night Crawling&quot;, accompanied by an official animated music video by Mickey Miles. The song is a reminiscence about his friendship with David Bowie who had died in 2016. &quot;It&#x27;s been a helluva past two years and I&#x27;m glad to finally share a glimpse of what&#x27;s coming ahead,&quot; Cale said in a statement. &quot;There was this period around mid-late Seventies when David and I would run into each other in New York. There was plenty of talk about getting some work done but of course we&#x27;d end up running the streets, sometimes until we couldn&#x27;t keep a thought in our heads, let alone actually get a song together!&quot; Cale played synthesizers, bass guitar, piano and drums on the track assisted by Mars Volta drummer Deantoni Parks and guitarist Dustin Boyer. On 19 October 2022, Cale released another track, titled &quot;Story of Blood&quot;, featuring the American chamber pop singer Weyes Blood. &quot;Noise of You&quot; was released as the third track on 11 January 2023. All tracks are from his seventeenth studio album &quot;Mercy&quot;. The album was released on 20 January 2023.

After further postponements, Cale finished his UK tour in 2023, adding two extra dates for Manchester, and Stroud later that year.

Cale released an official music video for &quot;Pretty People&quot; on 5 February 2024. The song is one of the 7&quot; vinyl bonus tracks from the 2023 released &quot;Mercy&quot; album. The video was directed by Abigail Portner.

&quot;How We See the Light&quot; is the first single, accompanied by an official video, released in March 2024 and a second single and official video were released in May 2024, titled &quot;Shark-Shark&quot;. The songs are from his eighteenth studio album &quot;Poptical Illusion&quot;, which was released on 14 June 2024.

== Honours and legacy ==
Cale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996. At the ceremony, Cale, Reed, and Tucker performed a song titled &quot;Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend&quot;, dedicated to Sterling Morrison, who had died the previous August due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Cale was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for services to Music and to the Arts.

== Personal life ==
Cale married American fashion designer Betsey Johnson in 1968. The couple divorced in 1971 having been married three years.

In 1971, Cale met Cynthia &quot;Cindy&quot; Wells, better known as Miss Cinderella or Miss Cindy of the GTOs, and they married soon afterward. Their marriage was rocky and they divorced in 1975.

On 6 December 1981, Cale married his third wife, Risé Irushalmi. They had one daughter together, Eden Cale. They divorced in 1997.

For his 2004 appearance on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; Cale chose &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; by Bob Dylan as his favourite track; he also selected &quot;Repetition&quot; (2001) by Alain Robbe-Grillet as his chosen book and an espresso coffee machine as his luxury item.

=== Substance abuse ===
As a child, Cale suffered from severe bronchial issues, which led to a doctor prescribing him opiates. He would come to rely on the drugs in order to fall asleep. Biographer Tim Mitchell claims Cale&#x27;s early dependence on medicine was a &quot;formative experience&quot;. Cale later told an interviewer that, &quot;When I got to New York, drugs were everywhere, and they quickly became part of my artistic experiment&quot;.

He was heavily involved in New York City&#x27;s drug scene of the 1960s and 1970s, with cocaine as his drug of choice. He is said to have &quot;taken most of the available drugs in the United States.&quot; Cale has said that, &quot;In the &#x27;60s, for me, drugs were a cool experiment... In the &#x27;70s, I got in over my head.&quot;

Cale feels his drug addiction negatively affected his music during the 1980s. He decided to clean up following a series of embarrassing concerts and the birth of his daughter. According to a 2009 BBC interview, the &quot;strongest drug&quot; he was then taking was coffee. Cale has also hosted a documentary called &quot;Heroin, Wales and Me&quot; (2009) to promote awareness of the problems of heroin addiction, easy availability and low cost of the drug in his native Wales and thousands of addicts.

<doc id="170667" wikidata="Q438194" url="?curid=170667" title="Sarah Winnemucca">
<text>Sarah (née Winnemucca) Hopkins ( – October 17, 1891) was a Northern Paiute writer, activist, lecturer, teacher, and school organizer. Her Northern Paiute name was Thocmentony, also spelled Tocmetone, which translates as &quot;Shell Flower.&quot;

Sarah Winnemucca was born near Humboldt Lake, Nevada, into an influential Northern Paiute family who led their community in pursuing friendly relations with the arriving groups of Anglo-American settlers. She was the daughter of Chief Winnemucca of the Paiute nation and the granddaughter of Chief Truckee. At 16, Sarah studied at a Catholic school in San Jose, California. When the Paiute War erupted between the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the settlers, including some who were friends of the Winnemucca family, Sarah and some of her family traveled to San Francisco and Virginia City to escape the fighting. They made a living performing onstage as &quot;A Paiute Royal Family.&quot; In 1865, while the Winnemucca family was away, their band was attacked by the U.S. cavalry, who killed 29 Paiutes, including Sarah&#x27;s mother and several members of her extended family.

At 27, Sarah began working in the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Fort McDermit in 1871 as an interpreter. Subsequently, Winnemucca became an advocate for the rights of Native Americans, traveling across the U.S. to tell Anglo- Americans about the plight of her people. When the Paiute were interned in a concentration camp at Yakima, Washington after the Bannock War, she traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and the executive branch for their release. She also served U.S. forces as a messenger, interpreter, and guide, and as a teacher for imprisoned Native Americans.

Winnemucca published &quot;Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims&quot; (1883), a book that is both a memoir and history of her people during their first 40 years of contact with European Americans. It is considered the &quot;first known autobiography written by a Native American woman.&quot; Anthropologist Omer Stewart described it as &quot;one of the first and one of the most enduring ethnohistorical books written by an American Indian,&quot; frequently cited by scholars. Following the publication of the book, Winnemucca toured the Eastern United States, giving lectures about her people in New England, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. She returned to the West, founding a private school for Native American children in Lovelock, Nevada.

Since the late 20th century, scholars have paid renewed attention to Winnemucca for her accomplishments. In 1993, she was inducted posthumously into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. In 2005, the state of Nevada contributed a statue of her by sculptor Benjamin Victor to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol.

Winnemucca&#x27;s legacy has been controversial. Some biographers have wished to remember her primarily for her activism and social work to better the conditions for her people, while others have criticized her for her tendency to exaggerate her social status among the Paiute. Among the Paiute, her assistance to the U.S. military at a time when they were at war with the Paiute has been criticized, as has her advocacy for assimilation of Natives to Anglo-American culture. Still, Paiute have also recognized her social work and activism for Indigenous rights.

==Early life and family==
Born &quot;somewhere near 1844&quot; at Humboldt Lake in what is now western Nevada, Sarah Winnemucca was the daughter of Winnemucca (&quot;Poito&quot;), a Shoshone who had joined the Paiute through marriage, and his wife &quot;Tuboitonie&quot;. Her father was an influential war chief of a small band of about 150 Northern Paiute people. The town of Winnemucca, Nevada was named after her father. Winnemucca&#x27;s grandfather, &quot;Tru-ki-zo&quot; or &quot;Truckee&quot;, had established positive relations with the European Americans who started exploring in the area. He guided Captain John C. Frémont during his 1843–45 survey and map-making expedition across the Great Basin to California. Later, Truckee fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), earning many white friends and leading the way for his extended family&#x27;s relationships with European Americans.

Sarah had an older sister Mary, younger brother Natchez, and sister Elma. She and her family spent her early childhood in eastern Oregon and western Nevada. She learned the ways of her people, including fishing and gathering plants. At the age of six, Winnemucca traveled with her family to near Stockton, California, where the adults worked in the cattle industry. In 1857, her grandfather arranged for Winnemucca (then 13) and her sister Elma to live and work in the household of William Ormsby and his wife; he had a hotel and was a civic leader of Carson City, Nevada. The couple wanted a companion for their daughter, Lizzie. The Winnemucca girls also did domestic work in the house. They had a chance to improve their English and learn more about European-American ways. After having some time to assimilate the difference between the two cultures, Winnemucca particularly began to be at ease in going back and forth between Paiute and European-American culture. She was one of the few Paiute in Nevada who knew how to read and write English, and her family all spoke English. She took on the English name Sarah. Winnemucca also spoke Spanish.

==Pyramid Lake War and stage==

With the decreasing pressure of new migrants in the region attracted to the Washoe silver finds, Old Winnemucca arranged in 1859 to have his daughters returned to him again in Nevada. In 1860, open conflict occurred. At Williams Station, two Paiute girls were kidnapped and abused, leading the Paiute to kill five men at the station. Settlers and miners organized a militia, with Major William Ormsby leading it by default. He was killed by the Paiute in a disciplined confrontation in the first event of the Pyramid Lake War. Settlers were alarmed at how well the Paiute fought and the ill-prepared miners could not hold their own. Young Winnemucca, Sarah&#x27;s cousin, led the Paiute as a war chief during the war.

The Paiute and whites reached a truce that lasted four years, but it was a difficult time for the Paiute who lived on the Pyramid Lake Reservation, giving up their hunter-gatherer way of life. After the first year, they did not receive the promised supplies from the government and did not have the training needed to be effective farmers. Many Paiute starved to death. After Winnemucca begged for food for her people, military officials at Camp McDermit (later Fort McDermit) sent supplies.

As a mark of development, Nevada was established as a distinct U.S. Territory, and James W. Nye was appointed as its first governor. When he came to the territory, he went to the Pyramid Lake Reservation, where he met Old Winnemucca, Young Winnemucca and the Paiute, who put on a grand display. In October 1860, their grandfather Truckee died of a tarantula bite.

For the next five years (1860–1865), Winnemucca and her family frequently traveled away from the reservation, performing on stage, either in Virginia City, Nevada at Maguire&#x27;s Opera House, or in San Francisco. They were billed as the &quot;Paiute Royal Family.&quot; By this time, her father had taken a second, younger wife, with whom he had a young son.

In Nevada, U.S. forces repeatedly acted against Native Americans to &quot;remind them of who was in charge.&quot; The Natives were repeatedly accused of raids and cattle stealing. In 1865, Almond B. Wells led a Nevada Volunteer cavalry in indiscriminate raids across the northern part of the state, attacking Paiute bands. While Winnemucca and her father were in Dayton, Nevada, Wells and his men attacked Old Winnemucca&#x27;s camp, killing 29 of the 30 persons in the band, who were old men, women and children.

The chief&#x27;s two wives (including Winnemucca&#x27;s mother) and infant son were killed. Although Winnemucca&#x27;s sister Mary escaped from camp, she died later that winter due to the severe conditions. Her younger sister Elma was out of the area, as she had been adopted by a French family in Marysville, California. There Elma Winnemucca married John Smith, a white man, and moved with him to a white community in Montana and, later, Idaho.

In 1868, about 490 Paiute survivors moved to a Camp McDermit, on the Nevada–Oregon border. They sought protection from the U.S. Army against the Nevada Volunteers. In 1872, the federal government established the Malheur Reservation in eastern Oregon, designated by President Ulysses S. Grant for the Northern Paiute and Bannock peoples in the area. Three bands of Paiute moved there at the time. In 1875, Winnemucca, her brother Natchez and his family, and their father Old Winnemucca moved there, too.

==Teaching and interpreter==
In 1871, at the age of 27, Winnemucca began working in the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Fort McDermitt as an interpreter, and later was invited to interpret at the Malheur Reservation by Indian Agent Samuel B. Parrish. She found in observing Parrish that he worked well with the Paiute; he encouraged them in learning some new ways and helped them plant crops that could support the people, establishing a well-managed agricultural program. He had a school built at the reservation, and Winnemucca became an assistant teacher.

==First marriage ==
Winnemucca married Edward Bartlett, a former First Lieutenant in the Army, on January 29, 1872, at Salt Lake City, Utah. He abandoned her, and she returned to Camp McDermit. In 1876, after having moved to Malheur Reservation, she got a divorce and filed to take back her name of Winnemucca, which the court granted. In the divorce decree, Sarah stated what she did to support herself when her husband left her with no money, writing, &quot;I did sewing. I made gloves for a living.&quot;

==Bannock War==
Parrish was replaced in the summer of 1876 by agent William V. Rinehart. The Paiute were sorry to see Parrish leave. A proponent of extermination-style warfare, Rinehart emphasized keeping the Paiute under his thumb. He reversed many of the policies that Parrish had initiated, telling the Paiute the reservation land belonged to the government. He failed to pay their workers for agricultural labor in communal fields, and alienated many tribal leaders. Conditions at the Malheur Reservation quickly became intolerable.

In her 1883 book, Winnemucca recounted that Rinehart sold supplies intended for the Paiute people to local whites. Much of the good land on the reservation was illegally expropriated by white settlers. In 1878, virtually all of the Paiute and Bannock people left the reservation because of these abuses and their difficulties in living. The Bannock from southern Idaho had left the Fort Hall Reservation due to similar problems. They moved west, raiding isolated white settlements in southern Oregon and northern Nevada, triggering the Bannock War (1878). The degree to which Northern Paiute people participated with the Bannock is unclear. Winnemucca wrote that she and several other Paiute families were held hostage by the Bannock during the war.

During the Bannock War, Winnemucca worked as a translator for General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Army, whom she had met during his visit to the reservation; she also acted as a scout and messenger. According to her account, the Bannock warriors and the Army soldiers liked each other so much that they rarely shot to kill. For whatever reason, casualties were relatively few. Winnemucca was highly regarded by the officers she worked for, and she included letters of recommendation from several of them in her 1883 book. Impressed by many of the officers, Winnemucca began to support the U.S. Army&#x27;s position to have the military take over administration of the Indian reservations, rather than political appointees.

==Move to Yakama Reservation==

Following the Bannock War, the Northern Paiute bands were ordered from Nevada to the Yakama Indian Reservation (in eastern Washington Territory), where they endured great deprivation. A total of 543 Paiute were interned in what has been described as a &quot;concentration camp.&quot;

Winnemucca accompanied them to serve as a translator. Since she had an official job, she was not required to live on a reservation. Outraged by the harsh conditions forced on the Paiute, she began to lecture across California and Nevada on the plight of her people. During the winter of 1879 and 1880, she, her father, and two other Winnemucca visited Washington, D.C. to lobby for release of the Paiute from the Yakama Reservation. They gained permission from Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, for the Paiute to be allowed to return to Malheur, at their own expense. Instead, the government decided to &quot;discontinue&quot; the Malheur Reservation in 1879, closing it.

==Second marriage==
In 1881, General Oliver O. Howard hired Winnemucca to teach Shoshone prisoners held at Vancouver Barracks. While there, she met and became close to Lieutenant Lewis H. Hopkins, an Indian Department employee. They married that year in San Francisco. Winnemucca&#x27;s husband had contributed to his wife&#x27;s efforts by gathering material for the book at the Library of Congress. But, he ran through Winnemucca&#x27;s money. Her husband died of tuberculosis on October 18, 1887, and was buried in Lovelock at the Lone Mountain Cemetery. Despite a bequest from Mary Peabody Mann and efforts to turn the school into a technical training center, Winnemucca was struggling financially by the time of her husband&#x27;s death in 1887.

==Lectures and writing==

In 1883, the Hopkinses traveled east, where Winnemucca delivered nearly 300 lectures throughout major cities of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, seeking to heighten awareness of injustice against Native Americans. The press reported her talks and sometimes referred to her as the &quot;Paiute Princess&quot; or &quot;Indian princess&quot;.

In Boston, Winnemucca met the sisters Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Peabody Mann, the latter married to the educator Horace Mann; they began to promote her speaking career. In addition, the two women helped her to compile and prepare her lecture materials for publication as &quot;Life Among the Piutes&quot;. Her book was published in 1883, the &quot;first known autobiography written by a Native American woman&quot; and the first U.S. copyright registration secured by a Native American woman.

After returning to Nevada in 1884, Winnemucca spent a year lecturing in San Francisco. When she returned again to Pyramid Lake, she and her brother built a school for Indian children at Lovelock, Nevada, in order to promote the Paiute culture and language. The Peabody Indian School, named for their benefactor Mary Peabody Mann in Boston, operated for a couple of years. Changes in federal policy following what was considered the success of the Carlisle Indian School prompted the federal government to promote education for Native American children at English-language boarding schools. Winnemucca&#x27;s school was closed in 1887 and the children were transferred to a facility in Grand Junction, Colorado.

The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 required allotment of communal lands on reservations to individual households to force assimilation of tribes.

==Later years and death==
Winnemucca spent the last four years of her life retired from public activity. She died of tuberculosis at her sister Elma Smith&#x27;s home at Henry&#x27;s Lake, Idaho.

<doc id="170671" wikidata="Q2423312" url="?curid=170671" title="Thomas D. Rice">
<text>Thomas Dartmouth Rice (May 20, 1808 – September 19, 1860) was an American performer and playwright who performed in blackface and used African American vernacular speech, song and dance to become one of the most popular minstrel show entertainers of his time. He is considered the &quot;father of American minstrelsy&quot;. His act drew on aspects of African American culture and popularized them with a national, and later international, audience. 

Rice&#x27;s &quot;Jim Crow&quot; character was based on a folk trickster of that name that was long popular among black slaves. Rice also adapted and popularized a traditional slave song called &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot;. The name became used for the &quot;Jim Crow laws&quot; that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States between the 1870s and 1965.

==Biography==
Thomas Dartmouth Rice was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. His family resided in the commercial district near the East River docks. Rice received some formal education in his youth, but ceased in his teenage years when he acquired an apprenticeship with a woodcarver named Dodge. Despite this occupational training, Rice quickly made a career as a performer.

By 1827, Rice was a traveling actor, appearing not only as a stock player in several New York theaters, but also performing on frontier stages in the coastal South and the Ohio River valley. According to a former stage colleague, Rice was &quot;tall and wiry, and a great deal on the build of Bob Fitzsimmons, the prizefighter&quot;, and according to another account he was at least six feet tall. He frequently told stories of George Washington, who he claimed had been a friend of his father.

==Career==
Rice had made the Jim Crow character his signature act by 1832. Rice went from one theater to another, singing his Jim Crow Song. He became known as &quot;Jim Crow Rice&quot;. There had been other blackface performers before Rice, however it was Rice who became so indelibly associated with a single character. Rice claimed to have been inspired by a crippled black stable groom, who sang and danced as he did his work, and even claimed to have bought the man&#x27;s clothes for &quot;authenticity.&quot; The time, place and truth of this claim have been disputed.

He soon expanded his repertoire, with his most popular routine being his &quot;shadow dance.&quot; Rice would appear on stage carrying a sack slung over his shoulder, then sing the song &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot; (not the better-known 1920s song). As Rice began to dance, a child actor in blackface would crawl out of the sack, and emulate each of Rice&#x27;s moves and steps. Rice also performed as the &quot;Yankee&quot; character, an already-established stage stereotype who represented rural America and dressed in a long blue coat and striped pants.

Rice&#x27;s greatest prominence came in the 1830s, before the rise of full-blown blackface minstrel shows, when blackface performances were typically part of a variety show or as an entr&#x27;acte in another play.

During the years of his peak popularity, from roughly 1832 to 1844, Rice often encountered sold-out houses, with audiences demanding numerous encores. In 1836 he introduced his blackface performances overseas when he appeared in London, although he and his character were known there by reputation at least by 1833.

Rice not only performed in more than 100 plays, but also created plays of his own, providing himself slight variants on the Jim Crow persona—as Cuff in &quot;Oh, Hush!&quot; (1833), Ginger Blue in &quot;Virginia Mummy&quot; (1835), and Bone Squash in &quot;Bone Squash Diavolo&quot; (1835). Shortly after making his first hit in London in &quot;Oh, Hush&quot;, Rice starred in a more prestigious production, a three-act play at the Adelphi Theatre in London. Moreover, Rice wrote and starred in &quot;Otello&quot; (1844); he also played the title character in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Starting in 1854 he played in one of the more prominent (and one of the least abolitionist) &quot;Tom shows&quot;, loosely based on Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s book.

&quot;The Virginny Cupids&quot; was an operatic olio and the most popular of the time. It is centered on a song &quot;Coal Black Rose&quot;, which predated the playlet. Rice played Cuff, boss of the bootblacks, and he wins the girl, Rose, away from the black dandy Sambo Johnson, a former bootblack who made money by winning a lottery.

According to Broadbent, &quot;T. D. Rice, the celebrated negro comedian, performed &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot; with witty local allusions&quot; at Ducrow&#x27;s Royal Amphitheatre (now The Royal Court Theatre), Liverpool, England.

At least initially, blackface could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society. As early as 1832, Rice was singing, &quot;An&#x27; I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey&#x27;ll in de gutter lay.&quot; It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, &quot;Aldough I&#x27;m a black man, de white is call&#x27;d my broder.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
On one of his stage tours in England, Rice married Charlotte Bridgett Gladstone in 1837. She died in 1848. They had four children.

Rice enjoyed displaying his wealth, and on his return from London wore a blue dress coat with gold guineas for buttons, and a vest on which each gold button bore a solitaire diamond.

As early as 1840, Rice suffered from a type of paralysis which began to limit his speech and movements, and eventually led to his death on September 19, 1860. His funeral services were at St. Thomas Church and he is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. A reminiscence of him in &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggests his death was alcohol-related, and states that although he had made a considerable fortune in his time, his later years were spent in a liquor saloon and his burial was paid for by public subscription.

==In popular culture==
In the later half of the 19th century, a wooden statue of Rice in his &quot;Jim Crow&quot; character stood in various New York locations, including outside the Chatham Garden Theatre. It was painted and made in four pieces, with both arms and the right leg below the knee being separate parts screwed to the trunk. Prior to at least 1871 it had stood on Broadway outside &quot;a well-known resort of actors and showmen&quot;. According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it had apparently been carved by Rice himself in 1833, although a different account in the same paper says it had been carved by a celebrated figurehead carver called Weeden, and yet another article attributes it to Rice&#x27;s former employer &quot;Charley&quot; Dodge. It had long been used by Rice as an advertising feature and accompanied him on his successful tour of London.

<text>&quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot;, often shortened to just &quot;Jim Crow&quot;, is a song and dance from 1828 that was done in blackface by white minstrel performer Thomas Dartmouth (T. D.) &quot;Daddy&quot; Rice. The song is speculated to have been taken from Jim Crow (sometimes called Jim Cuff or Uncle Joe), a physically disabled enslaved African-American, who is variously claimed to have lived in St. Louis, Cincinnati, or Pittsburgh. The song became a 19th-century hit and Rice performed it all over the United States as &quot;Daddy Pops Jim Crow&quot;.

&quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot; was a key initial step in a tradition of popular music in the United States that was based on the racist &quot;imitation&quot; of black people. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. A couple of decades saw the mockery genre explode in popularity with the rise of the minstrel show.

&quot;Abolitionists on both sides of the Atlantic seized upon this new format, including burnt-cork blackface, to promote the end of slavery.&quot;

As originally printed, the song contained &quot;floating verses&quot;, which appear in altered forms in other popular folk songs. The chorus of the song is closely related to the traditional &quot;Uncle Joe / Hop High Ladies&quot;; some folklorists consider &quot;Jim Crow&quot; and &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; to be a single, continuous family of songs.

As a result of Rice&#x27;s fame, the term &quot;Jim Crow&quot; had become a pejorative term for African Americans by 1838, and from this time onward, the laws of racial segregation became known as Jim Crow laws.

==Lyrics==
As they are most commonly quoted, the lyrics of the song are as follows:

===Standard English===
Other verses, quoted in non-dialect standard English:

==Variants==
As he extended it from a single song into an entire minstrel revue, Rice routinely wrote additional verses for &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot;. Published versions from the period run as long as 66 verses; one extant version of the song, as archived by American Memory, includes 150 verses. Verses range from the boastful doggerel of the original version to an endorsement of President Andrew Jackson (known as &quot;Old Hickory&quot;); his Whig opponent in the 1832 election was Henry Clay:

Other verses by Rice, also written in 1832, demonstrate anti-slavery sentiments and cross-racial solidarity, sentiments that were rarely expressed in later blackface minstrelsy:

The song also condemns Virginia for being the birthplace of George Washington, and the landing place for slaves from Guinea in Africa.

== Origins ==
The origin of the name &quot;Jim Crow&quot; is obscure but may have evolved from the use of the pejorative &quot;crow&quot; to refer to black people in the 1730s. Jim may be derived from &quot;Jimmy&quot;, an old cant term for a crow, which is based on a pun for the tool &quot;crow&quot; (crowbar). Before 1900, crowbars were called &quot;crows&quot; and a short crowbar was and still is called a &quot;jimmy&quot; (&quot;jemmy&quot; in British English), a typical burglar&#x27;s tool. The folk concept of a dancing crow predates the Jump Jim Crow minstrelsy and has its origins in the old farmer&#x27;s practice of soaking corn in whiskey and leaving it out for the crows. The crows eat the corn and become so drunk that they cannot fly, but wheel and jump helplessly near the ground, where the farmer can kill them with a club.

<text>Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (May 16, 1804January 3, 1894) was an American educator who opened the first English-language kindergarten in the United States. Long before most educators, Peabody embraced the premise that children&#x27;s play has intrinsic developmental and educational value.

With a grounding in history and literature and a reading knowledge of ten languages, in 1840, she also opened a bookstore that held Margaret Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Conversations&quot;. She published books from Nathaniel Hawthorne and others in addition to the periodicals &quot;The Dial&quot; and &quot;Æsthetic Papers&quot;. She was an advocate of antislavery and of Transcendentalism. 

Peabody also led efforts for the rights of the Paiute Indians. She was the first translator into English of the Buddhist scripture the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, translating a chapter from its French translation in 1844. It was the first English version of any Buddhist scripture. 

==Personal life==
===Early years===
Peabody was born in Billerica, Massachusetts, on May 16, 1804. She was the eldest daughter of Nathaniel Peabody, a physician, and Elizabeth () Peabody, the granddaughter of Joseph Palmer, a general during the American Revolutionary War. The Peabodys were a two-income family. Elizabeth advocated for preschool child education and taught school. Nathaniel was an apothecary, doctor, and dentist. Her sisters were Mary, reformer, educator, and pioneer in establishing kindergarten schools and Sophia, painter and the wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Peabody had three brothers, Nathaniel, George Francis, and Wellington Peabody. George and Wellington died in the twenties. Nathaniel relied on Peabody for his living expenses.

The Peabody family lived in Salem, Massachusetts, and worshiped at the Second Church (later Unitarian Church) there. The children received a thorough education at home. Elizabeth Peabody operated a school from the family home, providing a classical education for boys and girls. Nathaniel tutored the Peabody children. Peabody developed an interest in philosophy, theology, literature, and history over the years and she spoke ten languages. 

In 1820, the Peabodys moved to a farm in Lancaster, Massachusetts, and Peabody taught and ran the school beginning at age 16, based on what she learned from her mother&#x27;s . Peabody taught from an enlightened perspective, helping her students build character, grow spiritually, and engage in discussions about school work. In 1822, the Peabodys left the farm life of Lancaster for the social city life of Salem, where Nathaniel worked as a dentist.

===The Peabody sisters===
The Peabody sisters, intelligent and capable on their own, were stronger together. Sophia was an artist. Peabody and Mary were educators who played significant roles in the creation of kindergarten programs and improvements to traditional education. In 1825, Peabody and Mary lived in a boarding house on Beacon Hill, where they met a fellow boarder Horace Mann in 1832 or 1833. Rebecca Clarke, the mother of James Freeman Clarke, operated the boarding house, Ashburton Place. Living there at the time were George Stillman Hillard, Edward Kennard Rand, and Jared Sparks. The sisters were Unitarians who embraced the Transcendentalism movement and supported fellow Transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, who married Sophia.

Mann, a widow, came to Boston to recuperate from losing his wife. Peabody and Mary frequently talked with him about their lives and viewpoints. Sometimes, they read to one another. The young women helped Mann manage what Josephine E. Roberts called his &quot;hopeless sorrow&quot;. Peabody shared an interest in education with Horace Mann. Although working in the fields of politics and the law, Mann had developed his educational theories. 

In 1833, Mary went to Cuba, where she worked as a governess and looked after her sister Sophia, who went to the country to recuperate from some medical conditions. Mary and Sophia lived there until 1835 when they returned to Salem, where Mary taught until 1840. During that time, Mary and Mann stayed in contact via letters. Mann visited and wrote to Peabody periodically to learn what she knew of Mary. Mary questioned Peabody about the affection and &quot;brotherly tenderness&quot; she shared with Mann during his visits. After Mary returned from Cuba, Mann visited and wrote Mary regularly in Salem in friendship and confidence, to the exclusion of her sister.

===Transcendentalism===
Peabody developed a network of intellectual friends and transcendentalists, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Ellery Channing, Bronson Alcott, and Jones Very, who in 1837 founded the Transcendentalist Club. They sought to question traditional religious and societal thinking, and develop their political, philosophical, and literary views of the world. They advanced the belief in the inherent goodness of people.

===Personal life after 1852 and death===
After Peabody shut down the West Street Bookshop in 1852, she moved in with her parents in West Newton, Massachusetts, and cared for them. Peabody moved in with her sister Mary in Concord in 1859.
Peabody died on January 3, 1894, aged 89. She is buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.

==Career==
===Educator===
Peabody operated a private school for girls in Boston from 1822 to 1823. She was a governess to the children of Benjamin Vaughn in Hallowell, Maine, and taught other children in Maine. In 1825, Peabody set up a school in Boston, and Mary helped run it. Peabody and Mary developed an &quot;active interest&quot; in the work of Samuel Gridley Howe and his school, Perkins School for the Blind, after they visited the school with Mann, who sat on the board of trustees.

After 1822, Peabody resided principally in Boston where she engaged in teaching. She also became a writer and a prominent figure in the Transcendental movement. Peabody and her sister Mary operated a school in Brookline, Massachusetts, from 1825 to 1832, when there was a scandal about finances. Peabody opened a school for women to empower women. She held reading parties, gave lectures, and conducted discussions on a variety of subjects.
During 1834 and 1835, Peabody worked as an assistant teacher to Amos Bronson Alcott at his experimental Temple School in Boston. After the school closed, Peabody published &quot;Record of a School&quot;, outlining the plan of the school and Alcott&#x27;s philosophy of early childhood education, which had drawn on German models.

===Kindergarten===

In 1859 or 1860, Peabody opened the first English language kindergarten in the country on Beacon Hill in Boston with her sister Mary. They influenced the creation of public kindergarten schools. The school taught reading, writing, arithmetic, gymnastics, singing, and French. They encouraged moral and positive social engagement among the children. The sisters wrote the &quot;Moral Culture of Infancy and Kindergarten Guide&quot; in 1863 to provide information about how to set up and operate a kindergarten.

When Peabody opened her kindergarten in 1860, the practice of providing formal schooling for children younger than six was largely confined to Germany. She had a particular interest in the educational methods of Friedrich Fröbel, particularly after meeting one of his students, Margarethe Schurz, in 1859. In 1867, Peabody visited Germany to study Fröbel&#x27;s teachings more closely. Through her kindergarten and as editor of the &quot;Kindergarten Messenger&quot; (1873–1877), Peabody helped establish kindergarten as an accepted institution in American education. In 1877, she organized the American Froebel Union. She also wrote numerous books in support of the cause. The extent of her influence is apparent in a statement submitted to Congress on February 12, 1897, in support of free kindergartens:

===Bookstore owner===
In 1840, Peabody established the West Street Bookshop near Beacon Hill and Boston Common in Boston and had a home above the bookstore where her sisters and parents lived with her. Sophia and Mary lived there until they were married. Peabody purchased foreign journals and books for her business, which was part bookstore, a lending library, and a place for scholars, liberal thinkers, and transcendentalists to meet.

It was there that Margaret Fuller held &quot;Conversations&quot; for women beginning on November 6, 1839. Topics for these discussions and debates included fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Fuller served as the &quot;nucleus of conversation&quot; and hoped to answer the &quot;great questions&quot; facing women: &quot;What were we born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves &#x27;till their best years are gone by&quot;, Many figures in the woman&#x27;s rights movement took part, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.

Peabody lived above the bookstore until 1852, when the bookstore and library closed down. Members of the Transcendentalist movement had begun to disperse since the mid-1840s, and income from the bookstore gradually declined. In 2011, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated the building a Boston Landmark.

===&quot;The Dial&quot;===

For a time, Peabody was the business manager of &quot;The Dial&quot;, the main publication of the Transcendentalists. In 1843, she noted that the journal&#x27;s income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. In 1844 the magazine published Peabody&#x27;s translation of a chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; from French, which was the first English version of a Buddhist scripture. The publication ceased shortly thereafter in April 1844.

===Author and publisher===
Peabody published antislavery literature and books, like &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; by Henry David Thoreau and children&#x27;s stories written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. She was one of the country&#x27;s first female publisher. In the 1860s and 1870s, Peabody wrote about social and educational reform, producing 50 articles and 10 books.

<doc id="170683" wikidata="Q833322" url="?curid=170683" title="Murder, She Wrote">
<text>Murder, She Wrote is an American crime drama television series, created by Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link, starring Angela Lansbury, and produced and distributed by Universal Television for the CBS network. The series focuses on the life of Jessica Fletcher, a mystery writer and amateur detective, who becomes involved in solving murders that take place in the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine, across the United States, and abroad. The program ran for 12 seasons from September 30, 1984, to May 19, 1996, for a total of 264 episodes and included amongst its recurring cast Tom Bosley, William Windom and Ron Masak, as well as a vast array of guest cast members including Mickey Rooney, Michael Horton, Keith Michell, George Segal, Kevin McCarthy, Gene Barry, Martin Milner, Earl Holliman, Pat Morita, Tom Wopat, John Astin, Loretta Swit, John Saxon, Ruth Roman, Kathryn Grayson, Ken Howard, Bradford Dillman, Jean Peters, Neil Patrick Harris, Harvey Fierstein, Bill Maher, Cynthia Nixon, Bryan Cranston, and Julie Adams.

The series was a ratings hit during its broadcast, becoming a staple of CBS Sunday night TV schedule for around a decade, while achieving distinction as one of the most successful and longest-running television shows in history, averaging 25 million viewers per week in its prime. In syndication, the series is still highly successful and popular throughout the world. For her role on the program, Lansbury was nominated for ten Golden Globes, winning four, along with nominations for 12 Emmy Awards, earning her the record for the most Golden Globe nominations and wins for Best Actress in a television drama series and the most Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. The series itself also received three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, and six Golden Globe nominations in the same category, with two major wins.

After the series finished in 1996, four television films were released from 1997 to 2003. Two point-and-click video games were released for PC: one in 2009, and a sequel in 2012. A spin-off book series continues publication as of 2025.

==History==
===Origin===

Series producers Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link developed the lead role for actress Jean Stapleton, who was initially somewhat interested but eventually turned it down, threatening the project.

Scrambling to find another major star, the producers thought Angela Lansbury would be perfect for the part of Jessica Fletcher but did not think that she would be interested in a television series. Earlier, she had acted in two film adaptations of Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery novels: as Salome Otterbourne in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) and as Miss Marple in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980). When the latter film did poorly—despite an all-star cast including Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis—the offer for Lansbury to reprise Miss Marple in three more films never materialized.

When she made it known she would be available if the right project came along, the three creators sent her the script and almost immediately, Lansbury felt she could do something with the role of Jessica Fletcher. With &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; debuting on Sunday, September 30, 1984, the producers were able to parlay their &quot;mystery writer/amateur detective&quot; premise into a 12-year hit for CBS. It also made Lansbury, known previously for her motion picture and Broadway stage work, a household name for millions of television viewers. The title comes from &quot;Murder, She Said&quot;, which was the title of a 1961 film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple novel &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot;.

=== Premise ===
The show revolves around the day-to-day life of Jessica Fletcher (née MacGill, which was Lansbury&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name), a widowed and retired English teacher, who becomes a successful mystery writer. Despite fame and fortune, Jessica remains a resident of Cabot Cove, a small coastal community in Maine (the first season episode &quot;Murder Takes the Bus&quot; establishes that Cabot Cove is just north of the town of Newcastle), and maintains her links with all of her old friends, never letting her success go to her head.

The show usually starts with a preview of the episode&#x27;s events, with Jessica stating: &quot;Tonight on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;...&quot; Jessica invariably proves more perceptive than the official investigators of a case, who are almost always willing to arrest the most likely suspect. By carefully piecing the clues together and asking astute questions, she leads the authorities to arrest the real murderer. Murder occurred with such regularity in her vicinity that the term &quot;Cabot Cove syndrome&quot; was coined to describe the constant appearance of dead bodies in remote locations. Indeed, if Cabot Cove existed in real life, it would top the FBI&#x27;s national crime statistics in numerous categories, with some analysis suggesting that the homicide rate in Cabot Cove exceeds even that of the real-life murder capital of the world.

Jessica&#x27;s relationship with law enforcement officials varies from place to place. Both sheriffs of Cabot Cove resign themselves to having her meddle in their cases. However, most detectives and police officers do not want her anywhere near their crime scenes, until her accurate deductions convince them to listen to her. Some are happy to have her assistance from the start, often because they are fans of her books. With time, she makes friends in many police departments across the U.S., as well as with a British police officer attached to Scotland Yard. At the start of season eight, more of the stories were set in New York City with Jessica moving into an apartment there part-time in order to teach criminology at the city university.

==Production==
&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was mostly filmed on sound stages at Universal Studios in Universal City, California (near Los Angeles). The series also filmed exterior shots and some episodes on location in the Northern California town of Mendocino, which stood in for the fictional Maine town of Cabot Cove. Cabot Cove dockside scenes were filmed a few miles north at Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg, California.

Bruce Lansbury, Angela&#x27;s brother, served as producer of 88 episodes of the show. He was also a writer for 15 episodes.

===Lansbury considers retirement in 1988===

In August 1988, Lansbury expressed weariness of her commitment to the series as she was not sure, at 63, that she could continue at the pace now required of her; she specifically cited the change from seven to eight days to shoot each episode. Thus, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; went into its fifth season that autumn with the distinct possibility that it would cease production at the end of it and the series finale would air in May 1989.

A solution was worked on, however, which enabled Lansbury to continue but also give her time to rest. This also enabled some secondary characters to get significant stories. For the next two seasons, Lansbury reduced her appearances in several episodes, only appearing at the beginning and the end, to introduce stories starring several friends of Jessica, such as private investigator Harry McGraw, reformed thief Dennis Stanton or MI5 agent Michael Hagarty. The &quot;experiment&quot; ended in 1991. In 1992, Lansbury took on a more extensive role in production as she became the show&#x27;s executive producer.

===Move from Sundays in 1995===
&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was renewed for a twelfth season after finishing the 1994-95 season as the eighth-most watched program on television, tied with NBC&#x27;s new sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; for the spot. Despite the continued popularity of the program, Lansbury was considering retirement again after the upcoming season as she would be nearing seventy years of age at its conclusion. The decision, ultimately, would not be left up to her as CBS would make a decision regarding the series that would prove problematic for the network on two separate nights of programming.

&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was, at the time, the most popular scripted series on CBS; in fact, it had been one of only two series on the network to garner a rating in the top ten (&quot;60 Minutes&quot; was the other). Meanwhile, over at NBC, their Thursday night Must See TV lineup had been a ratings powerhouse for years and CBS decided to use &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in an effort to cut into their viewership. So, after eleven years on Sunday night, the series moved to Thursday for the 1995–1996 season. It would keep the same time slot (8:00 p.m.) on its new night, leading off a lineup that included the new drama &quot;New York News&quot; and the long-running news magazine &quot;48 Hours&quot;.

The move was met with protests from fans, and the entire Thursday night lineup for CBS proved to be no match for NBC&#x27;s lineup. Going up against &quot;Friends&quot; and a pair of freshman comedies in its time slot, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; saw its ratings drop significantly on Thursday; in fact, the series dropped below a 10.0 rating when the final season ratings were tabulated. (Its follow-up, &quot;New York News&quot;, continued the downward trend and did even lower ratings, with CBS cancelling the new drama before December 1995.)

Meanwhile, in the Sunday time slot that &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was vacating, CBS elected to try a situation comedy block. Leading off the 8 o&#x27;clock hour, CBS went with &quot;Cybill&quot;, which starred Cybill Shepherd and had finished its abbreviated first season just outside the top 20 in the Nielsen ratings. The second half of the hour featured the new series &quot;Almost Perfect&quot;, which starred Nancy Travis as a television producer. Neither series performed well; &quot;Cybill&quot;, which had relocated from Monday night, saw its ratings drop to the point where it nearly fell out of the top 50. &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; found itself relocated to Monday night in the hopes of improving its ratings; its replacement, a retooled &quot;Bonnie&quot;, lasted five episodes on Sunday before it was cancelled.

Ultimately, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; finished in 58th place in the final ratings and CBS opted not to renew the series for a thirteenth season. The network did, however, eventually reverse itself on the scheduling. Two episodes were scheduled for Sunday nights as 1996 began, with the first airing on January 7 and the second on February 25. Both of these episodes pulled in significantly higher ratings than the show had been garnering on Thursday, approaching nearly twenty million viewers for each of the two airings. CBS elected to return &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; to Sundays for the last four episodes of the series, which began on April 28. Three of the four episodes drew over sixteen million viewers and the finale, which aired on May 19, 1996, finished in the top 20 of that week&#x27;s ratings.

===After the series===
The network also agreed to commission four &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; movies over the next few years. The first was &quot;South by Southwest&quot; (1997), with three more following as &quot;A Story to Die For&quot; (2000), &quot;The Last Free Man&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Celtic Riddle&quot; (2003).

Lansbury stated in May 2011 that she would like to make a comeback appearance as Jessica Fletcher. However, in a 2015 interview, she quashed the idea of reprising the much beloved character, stating, &quot;I think it would be a downer. In some way, we&#x27;d have to show her as a much older woman, and I think it&#x27;s better to maintain that picture we have in our mind&#x27;s eye of her as a vigorous person. I&#x27;m still pretty vigorous, especially in the garden … but if I wanted to transform myself back into the woman I looked like then, it would be ridiculous. And I can&#x27;t do that.&quot; Dame Angela Lansbury died on October 11, 2022, at age 96.

In 2023, over-the-top video streaming service The Roku Channel launched a 24-hour &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; channel.

==Cast==
* Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher (1984–1996; 264 episodes), a retired English teacher who, after being widowed in her early 50s, becomes a very successful mystery writer. The only cast member to appear in every episode as the series is centered around her.

=== Recurring cast ===
* Tom Bosley as Sheriff Amos Tupper (1984–1988; 19 episodes), Cabot Cove&#x27;s sheriff at the start of the series. Tupper later retires and goes to live with his sister.
* Michael Horton as Grady Fletcher (12 episodes, 1984–1990, 1995), Jessica&#x27;s unlucky favorite nephew, who (through no fault of his own) always seems to get in trouble with the law. After some romantic disasters, he eventually marries his girlfriend Donna.
* Jerry Orbach as Harry McGraw (7 episodes, 1985–1987, 1989, 1991), an old-school private investigator who becomes friends with Jessica. Orbach was popular enough to garner his own, short-lived spin-off series in 1987, &quot;The Law &amp; Harry McGraw&quot;, and returned to &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; after his show was cancelled. Harry ceased to be a character permanently after Orbach took on the role of Lennie Briscoe on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 1992.
* Len Cariou as Michael Hagarty (7 episodes, 1985–86, 1988–1992), a British former MI5 agent, who often appeared when Jessica least expected him to drag her into a dangerous case. Cariou had previously starred with Lansbury on Broadway in &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; as the titular character.
*William Windom as Dr. Seth Hazlitt (1985–1996; 52 episodes), the local doctor of Cabot Cove and one of Jessica&#x27;s best friends and most intrepid supporters. Windom previously appeared as another character, a lawyer named Sam Breen, in the season 1 finale, &quot;Funeral at Fifty-Mile&quot;. Windom also played a separate character in &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;, which takes place in the same universe.
* Richard Paul as Sam Booth (7 episodes, 1986–89, 1991–1992), the genial, ineffectual mayor of Cabot Cove who is elected on his campaign promise to do nothing.
* Julie Adams as Eve Simpson (10 episodes, 1987–1993), the Cabot Cove realtor with a great love for men, both single and married, and for gossiping.
* Keith Michell as Dennis Stanton (9 episodes, 1988–1991, 1993), a suave English former jewel thief turned insurance claims investigator, who always solves his cases using unusual methods, and often sends a copy of the story to Jessica afterwards. Many of the episodes starring Dennis do not involve Jessica, and usually begin with her introducing the story to the audience, breaking the fourth wall. Keith Michell is the only actor other than Angela Lansbury to receive star billing (before the episode titles), on episodes which focus on Dennis.
* Ron Masak as Sheriff Mort Metzger (1988–1996; 39 episodes), a former NYPD officer who takes Sheriff Tupper&#x27;s place as sheriff in the mistaken belief that he would be living in a more peaceful place. His unseen wife, Adele, a former Marine capable of prodigious acts of strength, teaches self-defense classes. Masak previously appeared as other characters in earlier episodes: a police officer in the season 1 episode &quot;Footnote to Murder&quot;, and a store owner in trouble with the IRS in the season 3 episode &quot;No Accounting for Murder&quot;.

* Louis Herthum as Deputy Andy Broom (1991–1996, 25 episodes), Sheriff Metzger&#x27;s second deputy.
* Herb Edelman as Artie Gelber (7 episodes, 1992–1995), a NYPD Lieutenant and Jessica&#x27;s friend. Edelman had previously appeared as various characters in the series pilot, the season 2 episode &quot;Murder by Appointment Only&quot;, and the season 3 episode &quot;Murder in a Minor Key&quot;.

===Occasional cast===
* Hallie Todd as Rhoda Markowitz (6 episodes, 1990–1991), Dennis Stanton&#x27;s assistant. Todd had previously appeared as another character in the season 6 episode &quot;Class Act&quot;.
* Ken Swofford as Lt. Perry Catalano (6 episodes, 1990–1991). Swofford also appeared in four previous episodes and one later episode as various characters.
* James Sloyan as Robert Butler (5 episodes, 1990–1991). Sloyan had previously appeared as different characters in the season 3 episode &quot;Corned Beef and Carnage&quot; and the season 4 episode &quot;The Body Politic&quot;.
* Wayne Rogers as Charlie Garrett (5 episodes, 1993–1995), a disreputable private investigator who usually gets into trouble and needs Jessica&#x27;s help. Charlie&#x27;s character was the replacement for Harry McGraw after Jerry Orbach&#x27;s departure. 
* Leonard Lightfoot as Detective Henderson (5 episodes, 1993–1994).
* Debbie Zipp as Donna Mayberry Fletcher (5 episodes, 1988–1990), Grady&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife. Zipp had previously played another character in the season 3 episode &quot;The Days Dwindle Down&quot;. Zipp and Horton are married in real life, and have been since prior to the show.

* Madlyn Rhue as Jean O&#x27;Neil (4 episodes, 1993–1996), Cabot Cove&#x27;s disabled librarian. Rhue had previously appeared as another character in the season 6 episode &quot;Seal of the Confessional&quot;.
* John Astin as Harry Pierce (3 episodes, 1984–1985), a local real estate agent. In his final appearance, Pierce briefly becomes Sheriff when Amos Tupper retires but turns out to be unsuitable for the job when he commits murder. Astin had previously appeared in the season 1 episode &quot;Hooray for Homicide&quot;, and later appeared in the season 11 episode &quot;Film Flam&quot;, portraying different characters.
* Genie Francis as Victoria Brandon Griffin (3 episodes, 1984, 1986, 1990), Jessica&#x27;s niece. Other than Grady Fletcher, she is the only one of Jessica&#x27;s many nieces and nephews to appear more than once. Victoria&#x27;s husband, hapless actor Howard Griffin (Jeff Conaway), also featured in two of the episodes.
* Ruth Roman as Loretta Speigel (3 episodes, 1987–1989), Cabot Cove&#x27;s lovelorn hairdresser and an inveterate gossip.
* Kathryn Grayson as Ideal Molloy (3 episodes, 1987–1989), one of the regulars at Loretta&#x27;s beauty parlour.
* Gloria DeHaven as Phyllis Grant (3 episodes, 1987–1989), one of the regulars at Loretta&#x27;s beauty parlour.
* Bruce Gray as Ted Hartley (3 episodes, 1991–1994). Gray had previously appeared as different characters in two other episodes.
* Gregory Sierra as Lt. Gabriel Caceras (3 episodes, 1993–1995). Sierra had previously appeared as various characters in three other episodes.
* Paddi Edwards as Lois Hoey (2 episodes, 1984), a resident of Cabot Cove and member of its PTA, and a friend of Jessica&#x27;s. Appears in the Pilot and another episode of Season 1.
*Many actors and actresses also appeared in many episodes playing various characters, sometimes a different character in each one. These include Rosanna Huffman, who portrayed a member of the PTA in the Pilot episode and various others across all the seasons, appearing in 7 episodes overall; Tricia O&#x27;Neil who appeared in the Pilot and 5 episodes overall; and Barbara Babcock, who portrayed different characters in 5 episodes. There are several other examples including veteran character actor Steve Forrest famous for &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; and a memorable appearance on &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Episodes==


===Crossover with &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;===

The third-season episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; entitled &quot;Magnum on Ice&quot; concludes a crossover that began on the seventh-season &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; episode &quot;Novel Connection&quot;. In the episode&#x27;s plot, Jessica comes to Hawaii to investigate an attempt to murder Robin Masters&#x27; guests, and then tries to clear Magnum when he&#x27;s accused of killing the hitman. The &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; episode originally aired on November 19, 1986, with the concluding &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode following four days later on November 23.

The &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; episode of the crossover is included on the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; Season 3 DVD set, as well as the Complete Series Set. The &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; Season 7 DVD set, as well as its Complete Series set, includes the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode.

==Awards and honors==
Over its 12 year run &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; received numerous award nominations. Lansbury herself holds the record for the most Emmy nominations for outstanding lead actress in a drama series with twelve, one for each season. She never won, which is also a record. Mary Dodson, the art director for 102 of the series&#x27; 264 episodes, received three Emmy nominations for her work on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. In total, the show was nominated for 41 Emmys.

==US television ratings==
&quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; maintained extremely high ratings, finishing in the top 15 of shows for eleven of its 12 seasons (eight of which it was in the top 10), even well into its late seasons. By its 11th season, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; was still averaging 25 million viewers per week. At its very peak, the show even hit above 40 million US viewers. However, at the beginning of its 12th season in 1995, CBS moved the show from its extremely popular Sunday night time slot to Thursday night forcing it to compete with NBC&#x27;s Must See TV line up, and as a result the ratings plummeted, during Season 11 and 12 CBS lost affiliates during the television realignment, meaning major markets could not find the network. The show rated as the following:

==Cancelled reboot==
&quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported in October 2013 that NBC was planning a reboot of the series, starring Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer as a &quot;hospital administrator and amateur sleuth who self-publishes her first mystery novel.&quot; The next month, Lansbury said that while she was a fan of Spencer, she was not a fan of using the title; she said &quot;I think it&#x27;s a mistake to call it &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; because &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; will always be about Cabot Cove and this wonderful little group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a piece of that place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare and very individual kind of person.&quot; It was decided by producers that Spencer&#x27;s character would not be named Jessica Fletcher, for only Lansbury could play Fletcher. On January 21, 2014, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced that the reboot would not be going forward.

==Film adaptation==
On September 9, 2023, it was revealed that a film adaptation of the series is in the early stages of development at Universal Pictures. &quot;Dumb Money&quot; screenwriters Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo will write the script while Amy Pascal acts as producer.

==Merchandise==
In 1985, Warren Company released a &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; board game. In the game, one player takes the hidden role of a killer and the other players try to determine which player is the killer through deduction. The killer wins for killing five of the characters on the game-board and escaping, while the detective players win by correctly deducing the identity of the killer.

In December 2009, casual game developer and publisher Legacy Interactive, under license with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG), announced the release a PC and Macintosh video game, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, based on the television series. In the game, players help Jessica Fletcher to solve five unusual murders. A sequel, &quot;Murder She Wrote 2&quot;, was launched by Legacy Interactive in November 2012.

In 2020, Funko released a Jessica Fletcher POP! vinyl collectible figure.

<doc id="170685" wikidata="Q231187" url="?curid=170685" title="Sarah Miles">
<text>Sarah Miles (born 31 December 1941) is a retired English actress. She is known for her roles in films &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot; (1973), &quot;White Mischief&quot; (1987) and &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987). For her performance in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Miles received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Sarah Miles was born in Ingatestone, Essex, in south east England; her brother was film director, producer, and screenwriter Christopher Miles. Miles&#x27;s parents were Clarice Vera Remnant and John Miles, of a family of engineers; her father&#x27;s inability to secure a divorce from his first wife meant Miles and her siblings were illegitimate. Per Miles&#x27;s own account, her maternal grandfather, Frank Remnant, was the illegitimate son of Prince Francis of Teck (1870–1910), which would make Miles a second cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II. Unable to speak until the age of nine because of a stammer and dyslexia, she attended Roedean and three other schools but was expelled from all of them. Miles enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), graduating in 1960 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).

==Career==
===Early career===
Shortly after finishing at RADA, Miles performed in an episode of the TV series &quot;Deadline Midnight&quot; titled &quot;Manhunt&quot;. Her film debut was as Shirley Taylor, a &quot;husky wide-eyed nymphet&quot; in &quot;Term of Trial&quot; (1962), which featured Laurence Olivier; she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer.

Miles appeared in &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; (1963) for TV and then played Vera from Manchester in Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), and &quot;thrust sexual appetite into British films&quot; according to David Thomson.

Miles was in a short directed by her brother, &quot;The Six-Sided Triangle&quot; (1963) and a feature film directed by and starring Laurence Harvey, &quot;The Ceremony&quot; (1963). She did &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; (1964) for TV.

16 June 1965 saw the release of Ken Annakin&#x27;s &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,&quot; a British period comedy film revolving around the craze of early aviation circa 1910. A pompous newspaper magnate (Robert Morley) is convinced, by his daughter (Miles) and her fiancé (James Fox), to organise an air race from London to Paris. A large sum of money is offered to the winner, hence it attracts a variety of characters who participate. The film received positive reviews, described as funny, colourful and clever, capturing the early enthusiasm for aviation.

She was in &quot;Time Lost and Time Remembered&quot; (1966), directed by Desmond Davis.

In 1966, Miles gained another BAFTA nomination, this time as Best Actress. She had a &quot;peripheral&quot; part in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot;. At Antonioni&#x27;s death in 2007, she referred to him as &quot;a rogue and a tyrant and a brilliant man&quot;.

===Robert Bolt===
After acting in several plays from 1966 to 1969, Miles was cast as Rosy in the leading title role of David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970). It was critically savaged, which discouraged Lean from making a film for some years, despite Miles&#x27;s performance gaining her an Oscar nomination and an Oscar win for John Mills, and the film making a substantial profit. In Terence Pettigrew&#x27;s biography of Trevor Howard, Miles describes the filming of &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in Ireland in 1969. She recalls, &quot;My main memory is of sitting on a hilltop in a caravan at six in the morning in the rain. There was no other actor or member of the crew around me. I would sit there getting mad, waiting for either the rain to stop or someone to arrive. Film-acting is so horrifically belittling.&quot;

Miles married the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Robert Bolt. He wrote and directed &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972) starring Miles in the title role. She then appeared in &quot;The Hireling&quot; (1973).

On 11 February 1973, while filming &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot;, aspiring screenwriter David Whiting, who was briefly one of her lovers, was found dead in her motel room. She was acquitted of culpability in his death. Miles later commented: &quot;It went on for six months. Murder? Suicide? Murder! Suicide! Murder! Suicide! And, gradually, the truth came out, which I&#x27;m not going to speak about, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t me. I had actually saved the man from three suicide attempts, so why would I want to murder him? I really can&#x27;t imagine.&quot; This led to the end of her first marriage to Bolt.

===Television===
Miles starred in some TV movies: &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1974), &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; (1975), and &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1976) as well as the Spanish film &quot;Bride to Be&quot; (1975).

Her performance as Anne Osborne in &quot;The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; (1976) was nominated for a Golden Globe.

Miles appeared in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978), &quot;Venom&quot; (1981), &quot;Walter and June&quot; (1983), &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; (1984), &quot;Steaming&quot; (1985), &quot;Harem&quot; (1986) and &quot;Queenie&quot; (1987).

She received great acclaim for &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;. Interviewer Lynn Barber wrote of Miles&#x27; appearances in &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, &quot;White Mischief&quot;, and her two earliest films that she &quot;has that Vanessa Redgrave quality of seeming to have one skin fewer than normal people, so that the emotion comes over unmuffled and bare.&quot;

Filming &quot;White Mischief&quot; on location in Kenya in 1987, Miles worked for the second and last time with Trevor Howard, who had a supporting role, but was by then seriously ill from alcoholism. The company wanted to fire him, but Miles was determined that Howard&#x27;s distinguished film career would not end that way. In an interview with Terence Pettigrew for his biography of Howard, she describes how she gave an ultimatum to the executives, threatening to quit the production if they got rid of him. The gamble worked. Howard was kept on. It was his last major film; he died the following January.

===Later career===
She appeared in &quot;A Ghost in Monte Carlo&quot; (1990), &quot;The Touch&quot; (1992), &quot;Dandelion Dead&quot; (1994), &quot;Jurij&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Accidental Detective&quot; (2004).

She most recently (2008) appeared in &quot;Well&quot; at the Trafalgar Studios and the Apollo Theatre opposite Natalie Casey.

==Personal life==
Miles was married twice to the British playwright Robert Bolt, 1967–1975 and 1988–1995. He wrote and directed the film &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot;, in which Miles played the eponymous heroine, and wrote &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, as well. After his stroke, the couple reunited and Miles cared for him. &quot;I would be dead without her&quot;, Bolt said in 1987, &quot;When she&#x27;s away, my life takes a nosedive. When she returns, my life soars.&quot; The couple had a son. Miles stated, in 2007, that she had been drinking her own urine for 30 years for health reasons. In 2016, she reported that she had written a sequel to &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

<text>Haverford College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Haverford, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1833 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Haverford began accepting non-Quakers in 1849 and women in 1980.

The college offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences disciplines. It is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which includes Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore colleges, as well as the Quaker Consortium, which includes those schools as well as the University of Pennsylvania.

All of the college&#x27;s approximately 1,400 students are undergraduates, and nearly all reside on campus. Social and academic life is governed by an honor code and influenced by Quaker philosophy. Its suburban campus has predominantly stone Quaker Colonial Revival architecture. The college&#x27;s athletics teams compete as the Fords in the Centennial Conference of NCAA Division III.

== History ==
Haverford College was founded in 1833 by members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. It was the earliest Quaker liberal arts college. In 1849 it opened enrollment to non-Quakers. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in 1969 and became fully co-educational in 1980. The first woman to graduate (the wife of a faculty member) was a member of the class of 1971. The first Black student to graduate from Haverford, Osmond Pitter, a Jamaican Quaker, did so in 1926. He became a doctor and returned to practice medicine in his native land. The second (and first African-American to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree) was Paul B. Moses, class of 1951, who became an art history professor at the University of Chicago. During the intervening quarter century, a number of other Black men, including Howard Thurman, enrolled as graduate students.

For most of the 20th century, Haverford&#x27;s total enrollment was kept below 300, but the college went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, reaching a total of about 1350 students in 2020. Thomas R. Tritton was president of the college between 1997 and 2007 and oversaw the construction of several new buildings, including the Marian E. Koshland Integrated Natural Sciences Center and the Douglas B. Gardner Integrated Athletic Center.

In the fall of 2020, much of the student body went on strike, sparked by anger at the administration&#x27;s response to the killing of Walter Wallace in Philadelphia. The strike later expanded into a broader protest over concerns of racial injustice at the college. Some students opposed the strike, arguing that strikers were demonizing students who expressed concerns and suppressing dissenting views. After two weeks, the strike ended when the administration agreed to most of the organizers&#x27; demands.

Wendy Raymond has been president of the college since 2019.

== Honor code ==
In 1897, the students and faculty of Haverford voted to adopt an honor code to govern academic affairs. Since 1963, every student has been allowed to schedule his or her own final exams. Take-home examinations are also standard at Haverford and may include strict instructions such as time limits, prohibitions on using assigned texts or personal notes, and calculator usage. All students are bound to follow these instructions by the code.

Originally conceived as a code of academic honesty, the honor code had expanded by the 1970s to govern social interactions. The code does not list specific rules of behavior, but rather emphasizes a philosophy of mutual trust, concern and respect, as well as genuine engagement, that students are expected to follow. A student (or other community member) who feels that another has broken the code, is encouraged not to look the other way but rather to confront and engage in a dialogue with the potential offender, before taking matters to an honor council which can help mediate the dispute.

Every student is required to sign a pledge agreeing to the honor code prior to matriculation. The honor code is entirely student-run. It originated with a body of students who felt it necessary and it is amended and ratified by current students annually at an event called &quot;Plenary&quot;. Student government officers administer the code and all academic matters are heard by student juries. More severe matters are addressed by administrators. Abstracts from cases heard by students and joint administrator-student panels are distributed to all students by several means, including as print-outs in mailboxes. The trial abstracts are made anonymous by the use of pseudonyms who are often characters from entertainment or history.

The honor code failed to be ratified in 2013, 2018, and 2023 although on all occasions it was reinstated following special assemblies of the student body.

== Academics ==

Haverford offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. All departments require a senior thesis, project or research for graduation, and many departments also have junior-level seminar or year-long project such as in biology (superlab) and chemistry (superlab). The college also maintains a distribution requirement, spreading course work in all three areas of humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, in addition to major course works. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Chemistry (34)
::Computer science (31)
::Economics (31)
::Political science &amp; government (29)
::Biology/biological sciences (27)
::Psychology (25)
::English language &amp; literature (21)
::Mathematics (20)

===Consortium===
Haverford&#x27;s consortium relationship with Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, and the University of Pennsylvania (the Quaker Consortium) greatly expands its course offerings. Haverford and Bryn Mawr have a particularly close relationship (the Bi-College Consortium), with over 2,000 students cross-registering between the two schools. The campuses are only 1 mile apart and a shuttle called the Blue Bus runs frequently back and forth. Some departments, such as Religion and Music, are housed at Haverford, while others like Theatre and Growth and Structure of Cities are at Bryn Mawr. Students can major in these departments from both colleges. Furthermore, students of one of the Tri-Collegiate Consortium Schools (Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford) are allowed to pursue a major in a subject at a Tri-Collegiate institution apart from the one they are a student of.

===Admissions===

&quot;U.S. News&quot; deemed Haverford&#x27;s admissions &quot;most selective,&quot; with the class of 2026 acceptance rate being 14.2%. Applying for admission to the class of 2026 were 5,658 applicants; 804 were admitted. Of those admitted submitting such data, 96% were in the top 10% of their high school class and 100% were in the top 20% of their high school. Of those admitted to the class of 2026, 54.5% identified themselves as persons of color, and 14% of those admitted were first generation college students. The college is need-aware for domestic applicants, having ended its need-blind policy in 2016.

=== Rankings ===
Haverford is ranked 8th among liberal arts colleges in the 2022 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;/&quot;Times Higher Education&quot; College Rankings, and 24th among U.S. liberal arts colleges in the 2025 &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranking by &quot;U.S News &amp; World Report&quot;, and ranked 16th for &quot;Best Value&quot; and tied at 14th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; among liberal arts colleges. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Haverford 5th in 2023 among 218 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. The college was ranked 72nd across 500 universities and colleges in the 2024-25 edition of &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;Top Colleges&quot;, and 18th among liberal arts colleges alone. Niche ranked the school the 7th best national liberal arts college for 2021.

===Graduates===
According to the National Science Foundation, Haverford is sixth among liberal arts college, and eighth among all colleges and universities in the United States, in the proportion of its graduates who went on to earn PhDs across all fields from 2008 to 2017. When limited to doctorates in science and engineering disciplines, Haverford ranks sixth among liberal arts colleges and tenth among all colleges and universities.

==Campus==
Haverford College is located on the Main Line northwest of Philadelphia. The school is connected to Center City Philadelphia by the Paoli/Thorndale Line commuter rail system and Norristown High Speed Line (R100). The campus itself is situated in an affluent suburban neighborhood, adjacent to the Haverford School, the Merion Golf Club and the Merion Cricket Club, one of the oldest country clubs in the United States. Nearby attractions within walking distance include various food markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and Suburban Square, which hosts retail stores, restaurants and a local farmer&#x27;s market.

The larger Southern portion of campus is in Haverford Township, with a smaller Northern portion in Lower Merion Township.

===Buildings===

The college has more than 50 academic, athletic, and residential buildings, which are mostly stone and reflect Quaker and colonial design principles. The most recent additions are the Marian E. Koshland Integrated Natural Science Center and the Douglas B. Gardner &#x27;83 Integrated Athletic Center (colloquially referred to as the GIAC). Two dorms, by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, began housing freshman and upperclassman in the fall of 2012.

Haverford&#x27;s Lutnick Library (formerly known as Magill Library) boasts more than a half million of its own volumes and has access to nearly two million more through its unusual Tripod computerized catalog system, which integrates its library with those of neighboring Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore Colleges. In addition to Lutnick&#x27;s main resources, the college maintains three smaller music, science, and astronomy libraries and a number of special collections including the Quaker and Special Collections sections that include numerous rare books and other treasures such as the C.C. Morris (Class of 1904) Cricket Library. 
In the fall of 2017, the college unveiled renovations to Ryan Gym, which now serves as a new Visual Culture, Arts, and Media facility (VCAM), housing the Visual Studies Minor, the Haverford Innovations Program, a Maker Arts Space, and the John B. Hurford &#x27;60 Center for the Arts and Humanities and its Philadelphia Area Creative Collaboratives Initiative. The project, designed by MSR Architects, earned a 2018 Education Facility Design Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Architects. The second phase of the college&#x27;s Lives That Speak campaign involved a renovation of Magill Library, which began in Spring 2018 under the direction of Perry, Dean, Rogers Architects, and the library opened under the new name Lutnick Library in fall 2019.

===Haverford College Arboretum===
Comprising the entire campus, the Haverford College Arboretum is the oldest collegiate arboretum in the United States. In 1834, a year after the college&#x27;s founding, the English landscape gardener William Carvill was hired to design the plan for the campus. Carvill developed a design to replace the tilled fields, woodlots and pastures, using trees to frame and complement open spaces. He bordered the lanes with alleés of trees and planted groups of trees in odd numbers. Carvill also constructed grape arbors and a serpentine walk, reflecting the English landscape tradition of Sir Humphrey Repton. Carvill&#x27;s mark is still evident today in the pastoral landscape which includes several original trees including a Swamp white oak, Quercus bicolor, and Bur oak, Quercus macrocarpa, on Founders Green.

In 1901, a group of students and alumni formed the Campus Club to help preserve the campus landscape after discovering Carvill&#x27;s original plan. Their work eventually led to the founding of the Haverford College Campus Arboretum Association (now the Haverford College Arboretum Association) in 1974, which continues to perpetuate Carvill&#x27;s original design. To date, the arboretum&#x27;s contain a nature trail distancing 2.2 miles, a pinetum with 300 different conifers, a duck pond, historic trees of diverse species, sculpture, as well as flower and Asian gardens.

===Housing===
Roughly 99% of the student body resides on campus, where housing options include apartments, themed houses and traditional dormitories. The minute fraction who choose to seek other accommodations do so nearby in neighboring townships. Approximately 60% of faculty also reside on campus.

Themed housing options include La Casa Hispanica, which &quot;supports the endeavors of students actively engaged in organizing programs concerned with the cultures and civilizations of the Spanish-speaking world&quot;, the Ira de A. Reid House, which seeks students active in the Black Students&#x27; League or members of the African Diaspora interested in the culture and politics of Africans, Cadbury house, which provides a substance-free and quiet living environment, and Yarnall, which has no permanent theme. Various housing and room arrangements exist, including suites of singles, doubles, and triples.

==Student life==

===Journalism===
Student publications include &quot;The Bi-College News&quot;, a newspaper in collaboration with students at Bryn Mawr College that serves both campuses; &quot;The Clerk&quot;, an independent, online newspaper; &quot;Feathers &amp; Fur&quot;, a fashion magazine also in collaboration with students at Bryn Mawr College; &quot;Milkweed&quot;, a student literary magazine; &quot;Without a (Noun&quot;), the Haverford satire/humor magazine; &quot;Body Text&quot;, an academic journal; &quot;Margin&quot;, a student-edited creative magazine; and &quot;The Record&quot;, the student yearbook.

== Athletics ==
Haverford College competes at the NCAA Division III level in the Centennial Conference.

Haverford is home to the only varsity cricket team in the United States. Haverford&#x27;s cricket team (started in 1833) is generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans and won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association (which existed from 1881 to 1924) championship 19 times.

Its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field and cross country teams are perennial powerhouses in their division, with men&#x27;s cross country winning the 2010 Cross Country Division III National Championships.
Haverford&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team is among the nation&#x27;s oldest, having won its first intercollegiate match in 1905 against Harvard College, and in 2015 made it to quarterfinals of the NCAA Division III Championships.

Haverford&#x27;s fencing team has competed since the early 1930s and is a member of both the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) and the National Intercollegiate Women&#x27;s Fencing Association (NIWFA).

Several Haverford athletic teams are highly competitive in the Centennial Conference; for example, women&#x27;s basketball won the 2014 Centennial Conference Championship and progressed to the second round of the NCAA Division III women&#x27;s basketball tournament. Women&#x27;s softball also won Centennial Conference titles in 2006, 2014, and in 2016. The 2016 team advanced to the Super Regional tournament, a first for any Centennial Conference softball team. The Men&#x27;s Lacrosse team won the Centennial Conference Championship in 2010.

Despite the rest of the Centennial Conference choosing to play sports in the spring of 2021 (as well as their academic rivals in the NESCAC), Haverford decided to opt-out of competition due to COVID-19 concerns.

<text>The Famous Five is a series of children&#x27;s adventure novels and short stories written by English author Enid Blyton. The first book, &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children – Julian, Dick, Anne, George and their dog Timmy.

The vast majority of the stories take place in the children&#x27;s school holidays. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George&#x27;s family home at Kirrin Cottage, such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George&#x27;s own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or smugglers&#x27; tunnels.

In some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and Welsh countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, bicycle trips and swimming.

Blyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length &quot;Famous Five&quot; novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday. By the end of 1953, more than six million copies had been sold. Today, more than two million copies of the books are sold each year, making them one of the best-selling series for children ever written, with sales totalling over a hundred million. All the novels have been adapted for television, and several have been adapted as films in various countries.

Blyton&#x27;s publisher, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, first used the term &quot;The Famous Five&quot; in 1951, after nine books in the series had been published. Before this, the series was referred to as &quot;The &#x27;Fives&#x27; Books&quot;.

==Characters==
===The Five===
* is the oldest of the five, cousin to George and elder brother to Dick and Anne. He is tall, strong and intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny. He is the leader of the group and is very protective towards Anne and sometimes, to her frustration, towards George. Julian is the most mature of the group but, although well-meaning, his manner can at times come over as overbearing, pompous or priggish. At the start of the series, Julian is 12 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult.
* has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, 1 year younger than his brother Julian and a year older than his sister Anne – eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures but probably has the least clearly-drawn character of the four cousins.
* is the youngest in the group, and generally takes care of the domestic duties during the Five&#x27;s various camping holidays. As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Top&quot; it is suggested she is claustrophobic, as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is.
*George (actually, Georgina) is Julian, Dick and Anne&#x27;s cousin. She is a tomboy, who demands that people call her instead of Georgina; she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Introduced to the other characters in the first book, she later attends a boarding school with Anne where the teachers also agree to call her &#x27;George&#x27;. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself. It is notable that the chief protagonist of the Malory Towers stories also possessed a fiery temper as a defining character trait. George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her birth name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In &quot;Five Get into a Fix&quot;, old Mrs Janes mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had told her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with Master instead of Miss. Various references have been made to what meaning should be read into this – for instance &quot;I remember reading in my first Famous Five book about a girl called Master George. What a puzzle and thrill. She claims to never tell lies as that is cowardly.&quot;
* Alias Timmy is George&#x27;s faithful dog. He is a large, brown mongrel with a long tail. George adopted him after finding him abandoned on the moors as a puppy. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. Timmy&#x27;s presence is frequently given as the reason the children&#x27;s parents allow them to wander unsupervised. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes furious when people insult or threaten him. This is shown in &#x27;Five On A Secret Trail&#x27; when she runs away from home with Timmy because he was being teased as he was forced to wear a cardboard collar. In the first book of the series, George&#x27;s parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five&#x27;s first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house and also take him with her to boarding school. It is a notable feature of the stories that Timmy&#x27;s thoughts and feelings are frequently described.

===Friends the Five meet===
*, the fisherboy, appears in some of the books set in Kirrin Cottage. In the first book, after George&#x27;s parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George&#x27;s boat. In later books Alf only looks after George&#x27;s boat, as George&#x27;s parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as James of the same background.
*, the ragamuffin girl, clever but wild, joins the Five on three adventures throughout the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the circus, but her mother died and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him.
* is the housekeeper at George&#x27;s house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. Joanna contracts scarlet fever in the last book. She is sometimes referred to as Joan in Blyton&#x27;s Famous Five short stories like &quot;Five Have a Puzzling Time and other stories&quot;.
* appears in two books. He has a habit of imitating cars (which drives his father mad) and has a pet monkey called Mischief. His father is also a scientist who is Uncle Quentin&#x27;s friend.
* is a friend of Jo&#x27;s who works in the circus. The Five meet in him in the fourteenth book in the series, &quot;Five Have Plenty of Fun&quot;.
*Wilfred meets the Five in the book &quot;Five Have a Mystery to Solve&quot;. He has an inexplicable ability to attract animals.
* is in the same form as Dick in school. He is known for his hair that holds a resemblance to soot and therefore inherited the name Sooty. He welcomed the five to his home at smugglers top in &quot;Five go to smugglers top&quot; and aids them in solving the mystery of signallers and smuggling at smugglers top.
* (Ned in some more recent editions) is part of a troupe of circus folk who travel in caravans. He befriends the five in &quot;Five Go Off in a Caravan&quot;. He lives a hard life with his uncle known as &#x27;Tiger Dan&#x27; and acrobat Lou. He gives the five the idea of a caravaning holiday. The character of Nobby was later renamed &quot;Ned&quot; in some editions from 2010, in an attempt to modernise the text.
* is a member of the riding school that Anne and George visit in &quot;Five Go to Mystery Moor&quot;. She is well known for having disputes with George as both girls badly want to be a boy and are jealous of each other, although she gets on with the rest of the five.
* is a friend of Julian and Dick&#x27;s who lets the five stay on his farm near Billycock Hill in &quot;Five go to Billycock Hill&quot;.He has a cousin called Jeff who is a flight lieutenant at the nearby airfield. He is a bit of a joker as he likes to play tricks.
* likes to follow the five around to their annoyance when they were staying on Tremannon Farm in Cornwall for the holidays in &quot;Five Go Down to Sea&quot;. He enjoys eating the five&#x27;s sweets and shows them places in the area such as &#x27;The Wrecker&#x27;s Way&#x27; and the tower.
* are met by Anne and George on a hike in &quot;Five on a Secret Trail&quot;. They are identical twins which confuses the five, who thought that there was only Guy. Guy and Harry are often in conflict with each other and ignore each other. Guy owns a Roman camp as his father is a famous archeologist.
* are children of Mrs Philpot who lets the five stay on Finniston Farm in &quot;Five on Finniston Farm&quot;. They are often eager to help their mother with chores and are very busy. They hold a grudge against Junior, the irritable American boy featured in the book. They own a dog called Snippet and a crow called Nosy.
* is the daughter of Elbur, a colleague of Uncle Quentin and is featured in &quot;Five Have Plenty of Fun&quot;. Elbur is threatened with the kidnapping of Berta if Elbur and Uncle Quentin do not reveal project secrets.She consequently stays with the five and has to change her name to &#x27;Lesley&#x27; as well as look like a boy to avoid being kidnapped, to the resentment of George. She has a dog called Sally.
* is the son of Thurlow Kent, who is very wealthy and features in the book &quot;Five Get Into Trouble&quot;. He is known for his cowardly nature for which he is mocked by the five. His father had a body guard named &#x27;Rooky&#x27; who Richard resents but is also fears. Rooky tries to hunt down Richard and kidnap him for ransom.

===Grown-ups in the Famous Five===
* is George&#x27;s mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton&#x27;s Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman, and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness.
* is George&#x27;s father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children&#x27;s adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne.
* is a very nice woman. In &quot;Five Go Off In a Caravan&quot;, she persuades the children&#x27;s father to let them travel in the caravan. She&#x27;s referred to as Mrs. Barnard in &quot;Five Get Into a Fix&quot;.

==Critical discussion==
Blyton was a nature writer early in her career, and the books are strongly atmospheric, with a detailed but idealised presentation of the rural landscape. The books present children exploring this landscape without parental supervision as natural and normal. Pete Cash of the English Association has noted that the children &quot;are allowed to go off on their own to an extent that today would contravene the Child Protection Act (1999) and interest Social Services.&quot;

The books are written in a nostalgic style even for the time they were written, avoiding reference to specific political events or technological developments. Cash noted that the characters do not watch television apart from one appearance in 1947, or even make much use of radios, despite George&#x27;s father&#x27;s work presumably involving advanced technology.

The books have been criticised for being repetitive, with repeated use of stock elements such as obnoxious, unfriendly people who turn out to be criminals and the discovery of a secret passageway. Blyton wrote rapidly and could finish a book in a week, which meant that unlike other book series of the period, such as Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys, she was able to maintain control of her creations and write all the stories in a series herself.

The treatment of girls in the books provides a contrast, with Anne, the youngest and most fragile character, a contrast to the brash and headstrong George.

===Floating timeline===
The seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a floating timeline. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. J. K. Rowling commented of her Harry Potter series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: &quot;in book four the hormones are going to kick in – I don&#x27;t want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!&quot;

====The German &quot;Geisterbände&quot;====
In Germany, two books came out with a questionable author. The titles are:

# &quot;Fünf Freunde auf der verbotenen Insel&quot; (&quot;Five Friends on the Forbidden Island&quot;) (1977)
# &quot;Fünf Freunde und der blaue Diamant&quot; (&quot;Five Friends and the Blue Diamond&quot;) (1979)
Although Enid Blyton is named as author on the cover, the books were most likely written by German author Brigitte Blobel, who is credited as the translator. The books were recalled after the first edition owing to copyright issues, and are now rare and high-priced collector&#x27;s items.

The New &quot;Famous Five&quot;

In 2025, author Chris Smith published &quot;Five and the Forgotten Treasure&quot; inspired by Enid Blyton that features &quot;The New Famous Five&quot; consisting of the three grandchildren of Dick, their dog Gilbert and George, who is now a professor living at Kirrin Cottage.

==Film and television adaptations==
===Films===
The Children&#x27;s Film Foundation made two films based on &quot;Famous Five&quot; books: &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;, in 1957, and &quot;Five Have a Mystery to Solve&quot;, in 1964.

Two of the Famous Five stories by Enid Blyton have been filmed by Danish director Katrine Hedman. The cast consisted of Danish actors and were originally released in Danish. Ove Sprogøe stars as Uncle Quentin. The movies are: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Five and the Spies&quot;) (1969) and &quot;De 5 i fedtefadet&quot; (&quot;Famous Five Get in Trouble&quot;) (1970).

All four of the films have been released on DVD in their respective countries.

In Germany, a series of movies have been released:
*&quot;Fünf Freunde&quot; (2012, based on &quot;Five on Kirrin Island Again&quot;, with Marcus Harris in a small role)
*&quot;&quot; (2013, based on &quot;Five Get into Trouble&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; (2014, based on &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Five Fall into Adventure&quot;)
*&quot; (2015)
*&quot; (2018, literally &quot;Five Friends and the Valley of Dinosaurs&quot;)

===Television===
====1978–79 series====
The &quot;Famous Five&quot; television series was produced by Southern Television and Portman Productions for ITV in the UK, in 26 episodes of thirty minutes (including time for advertisements). It starred Michele Gallagher as Georgina, Marcus Harris as Julian, Jennifer Thanisch as Anne, Gary Russell as Dick, Toddy Woodgate as Timmy, Michael Hinz as Uncle Quentin and Sue Best as Aunt Fanny. It also starred Ronald Fraser, John Carson, Patrick Troughton, James Villiers, Cyril Luckham and Brian Glover. The screenplays were written by Gloria Tors, Gail Renard, Richard Carpenter and Richard Sparks. The episodes were directed by Peter Duffell, Don Leaver, James Gatward and Mike Connor. The series was produced by Don Leaver and James Gatward. Most of the outdoor filming was done in the New Forest and parts of Dorset and Devon.The series was set in the present day, fifteen years after Blyton&#x27;s last novel in the series.

Of the original 21 novels, three were not adapted for this series; &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Five Have a Mystery to Solve&quot; because the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation still own the film and TV rights to the books, while &quot;Five Have Plenty of Fun&quot; did not fit in the production schedule. Due to the success of the series, Southern Television were keen to make another season of episodes, but the Enid Blyton estate forbade them to create original stories.

The 1978 series was originally released on video by Portman Productions with reasonable regularity between 1983 and 1999, many of which are still easy to find second-hand, although the sound and picture quality is not always what it could be. A four-disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release.

A seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non-removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012.

A four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s The Famous Five: The Complete Collection&quot;.
(The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.)

====1995 series====

A later series, &quot;The Famous Five&quot;, initiated by Victor Glynn of Portman Zenith was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including Tyne Tees Television, HTV, Zenith North and the German channel ZDF. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably Jemima Rooper, who played George. Julian was portrayed by Marco Williamson, Dick by Paul Child, and Anne by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.)

The 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005, and is marked &quot;Revised Edition&quot; to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork. A complete edition of the series was released on DVD in Australia and New Zealand in 2016. Other episodes have reportedly been released on DVD in Europe, but only the adaptation of &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot; was released on DVD in the UK.

====&quot;Famous 5: On the Case&quot;====

A new Famous Five animated TV series began airing in 2008. &quot;Famous 5: On the Case&quot; is set in modern times and features the children of the original Famous Five: Max (the son of Julian and Brandine), Dylan (son of Dick and Michelle), Jo (daughter of George and Ravi – a tomboy who, like her mother, prefers a shorter name to her given name Jyoti) and Allie (daughter of Anne and John). It has not been stated whether their dog is a descendant of Timmy. The new series was first announced in 2005, and is a co-production of Chorion (which currently owns all Famous Five rights) and Marathon, in association with France 3 and The Disney Channel. Disney confirmed their involvement in December 2006. Stories were developed by Douglas Tuber and Tim Maile, who have previously written for &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. Chorion claims on its website that &quot;these new programmes will remain faithful to the themes of mystery and adventure central to Enid Blyton&#x27;s classic series of books.&quot; A total of 26 episodes, each 22 minutes long, were produced.

==== 2023 series ====

On 26 June 2023, the BBC announced that filming has begun on a new adaptation of The Famous Five, in co-production with the German channel ZDF. The series will comprise three episodes, each 90 minutes long, and will aim to bring the stories to a &quot;progressive new audience&quot;. The series creator is Danish film director Nicolas Winding Refn.

==Other adaptations==
===Audio dramas===
Hodder Headline produced in the late 1990s audio dramas in English, which were published on audio cassette and CD. All 21 episodes of the original books were dramatised.

The 21 original stories by Enid Blyton have been released in the 1970s as &quot;Fünf Freunde&quot; audio dramas in Germany as well. The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series.

For the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more &quot;modern&quot; action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 110+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and more than 30 books different from the radioplays in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers.

===Theatre===
A 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton&#x27;s birth with the title &quot;The Famous Five&quot; and later released on DVD as &quot;The Famous Five – Smuggler&#x27;s Gold – The Musical&quot;.
Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, Jon Lee, Director: Roz Storey
and also in the five

A brand new musical adaptation was premièred at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010.

===Gamebooks===
Two sets of gamebooks in a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows:

#&quot;The Wreckers&#x27; Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea&quot;
#&quot;The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp&quot;
#&quot;The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve&quot;
#&quot;The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together&quot;
#&quot;The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon&#x27;s Rocks&quot;
#&quot;The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill&quot;
#&quot;The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix&quot;
#&quot;The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time&quot;

The second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled &quot;The Famous Five and You&quot;. These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books:

#&quot;The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure!&quot;
#&quot;The Famous Five and You Find Adventure!&quot;
#&quot;The Famous Five and You Run Away!&quot;
#&quot;The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers!&quot;
#&quot;The Famous Five and You Take Off!&quot;
#&quot;The Famous Five and You Underground!&quot;

===Comics===
A weekly comic strip based on the 1978 television series was published in &quot;Look-in&quot; magazine from 1978 to 1980.

Six comic albums drawn by Bernard Dufossé and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title &quot;Le Club des Cinq&quot;. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by Claude Voilier. Books were released by Hachette Livre. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name &quot;Famous Five&quot;. The titles included &quot;Famous Five and the Golden Galleon&quot; (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, &quot;Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars&quot;, where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and &quot;Famous Five and the Inca God&quot; which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish.

Beginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s Adventure Magazine&quot; were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.

==Parodies==
===The Comic Strip Presents...===
The Five inspired the parody &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot; (1982) and its 1983 sequel &quot;Five Go Mad on Mescalin&quot;, both produced by The Comic Strip, in which the characters express sympathies with Nazi Germany and opposition to the Welfare State, homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad parody not so much of Blyton but of views perceived to be common in the 1950s. The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five &quot;era&quot; (1942–63) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states &quot;We&#x27;re the Famous Five!&quot;, the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for &quot;some of your home-made ices&quot; at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin.

The series was revived in 2012 with &quot;Five Go to Rehab&quot;, with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick&#x27;s birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a &quot;dyke&quot; – an accusation made against George by Toby in the original &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot;. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics&#x27; sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. &quot;Five Go to Rehab&quot; utilises a form of a floating timeline; although the original films&#x27; events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and &quot;five years after the war&quot;, the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming.

===Other parodies===

Parodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, John Lennon in his work &quot;In His Own Write&quot; had the short story &quot;The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey&quot;. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists ten members of the Five, and a dog named Cragesmure.

Viz comic has parodied the series&#x27; style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions.

In the late eighties, Australian comedy team &quot;The D-Generation&quot; parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled &quot;The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In&quot;. The parody was based on the first book &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;.

The fourth short story in &quot;Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids&quot; by Jamie Rix is named &quot;The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping&quot;, which is about five children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a shotgun. It was later adapted for the &quot;Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids&quot; cartoon, which aired on CITV in 2000.

A 2005 story in &quot;The Guardian&quot; also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are caricatures rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, Lucy Mangan, considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.

On 31 October 2009, the BBC programme &quot;The Impressions Show&quot; featured a sketch in which Ross Kemp meets The Famous Five. It was a parody of his Sky One show, &quot;Ross Kemp on Gangs&quot;.

British comedian John Finnemore did a radio sketch in which Julian and George run into each other as adults and reminisce. It is revealed that Julian has gone on to a career as a smuggler and regularly has to deal with copycat groups of children trying to thwart his plans. George is a happily married mother, Dick has gone to live in a commune in America, and Anne has just been released from prison having murdered a man with a ginger beer bottle.

&quot;Bert Fegg&#x27;s Nasty Book for Boys and Girls&quot; features &quot;The Famous Five Go Pillaging&quot;, – a short story which parodies the writing style of Enid Blyton; five children witness the collapse of Roman imperialism and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading Vikings.

The satirical website The Daily Mash reported a lost Blyton manuscript titled &quot;Five Go Deporting Gypsies&quot;.

A spoof series of five books written by Bruno Vincent was published in November 2016. The books are titled &quot;Five Give Up the Booze&quot;, &quot;Five Go Gluten Free&quot;, &quot;Five Go On A Strategy Away Day&quot;, &quot;Five Go Parenting&quot; and &quot;Five on Brexit Island&quot;. Vincent went on to write several more titles in the series: &quot;Five at the Office Christmas Party&quot;, &quot;Five Get Gran Online&quot;, &quot;Five Get On the Property Ladder&quot;, &quot;Five Go Bump in the Night&quot;, &quot;Five Escape Brexit Island&quot;, &quot;Five Get Beach Body Ready&quot;, &quot;Five Lose Dad in the Garden Centre&quot;, and &quot;Five Forget Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;.

In November 2017, Return to Kirrin was released, written by Neil and Suzy Howlett. Set in 1979, it involves the Five (now middle-aged) reuniting on Kirrin Island, to discuss Julian&#x27;s plans to develop Kirrin into a theme resort. Julian has become a successful stockbroker, Dick is a well-meaning but inept and overweight policeman, Anne is a worrisome housewife, and George is a feminist community worker (with her flatulent bulldog Gary in tow). Adventures then ensue, involving a host of other original characters.
