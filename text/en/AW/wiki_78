<text>Ferdinand I (Italian: &quot;Ferdinando I&quot;; 12 January 1751 – 4 January 1825) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1816 until his death. Before that he had been, since 1759, King of Naples as Ferdinand IV and King of Sicily as Ferdinand III. He was deposed twice from the throne of Naples: once by the revolutionary Parthenopean Republic for six months in 1799, and again by a French invasion in 1806, before being restored in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

Ferdinand was born in Naples as the third son of King Charles VII and Queen Maria Amalia. In August 1759, Charles succeeded his half-brother Ferdinand VI of Spain as King Charles III, but treaty provisions made him ineligible to hold all three crowns. On 6 October, he abdicated his Neapolitan and Sicilian titles in favour of his third son, Ferdinand, because his eldest son Philip had been excluded from succession due to intellectual disability and his second son Charles was heir-apparent to the Spanish throne. Ferdinand was the founder of the cadet House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.

==Childhood==

Ferdinand was born in Naples and grew up amidst many of the monuments erected there by his father which can be seen today; the Palaces of Portici, Caserta and Capodimonte.

Ferdinand was his parents&#x27; third son; his elder brother Charles was expected to inherit Naples and Sicily. When his father ascended the Spanish throne in 1759, he abdicated the thrones of Naples and Sicily in Ferdinand&#x27;s favour in accordance with the treaties forbidding the union of the two crowns. A regency council presided over by the Tuscan Bernardo Tanucci was set up. Tanucci, an able, ambitious man, wishing to keep the government as much as possible in his own hands, purposely neglected the young king&#x27;s education, and encouraged him in his love of pleasure, his idleness and his excessive devotion to outdoor sports.

==Reign==
Ferdinand&#x27;s minority/childhood ended in 1767, and his first act was the expulsion of the Jesuits. The following year he married Archduchess Maria Carolina, daughter of Empress Maria Theresa. By the marriage contract, the queen was to have a voice in the council of state after the birth of her first son, and she was not slow to avail herself of this means of political influence.

Tanucci, who attempted to thwart her, was dismissed in 1777. The Englishman Sir John Acton, who in 1779 was appointed director of marine, won Maria Carolina&#x27;s favour by supporting her scheme to free Naples from Spanish influence, securing &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Great Britain. He became practically and afterward actually prime minister. Although not a mere grasping adventurer, he was largely responsible for reducing the internal administration of the country to a system of espionage, corruption and cruelty.

==French occupation and the Parthenopaean Republic==
Although peace was made with France in 1796, the demands of the French Directory, whose troops occupied Rome, alarmed Ferdinand once more. At his wife&#x27;s instigation, he took advantage of Napoleon&#x27;s absence in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria and of Horatio Nelson&#x27;s victories to go to war. Ferdinand marched with his army against the French and entered Rome (29 November). On the defeat of some of his columns, Ferdinand hurried back to Naples. On the approach of the French, Ferdinand fled on 23 December 1798 aboard Nelson&#x27;s ship to Palermo, leaving his capital in a state of anarchy. The weather was extremely stormy and the king&#x27;s 6-year-old younger son Prince Alberto died of exhaustion during the voyage, in the arms of Emma, Lady Hamilton, Nelson&#x27;s mistress.

The French entered the city despite the fierce resistance of the &quot;lazzaroni&quot;, and with the aid of the nobles and bourgeoisie, established the Parthenopean Republic in January 1799. A few weeks later, when the French troops were recalled to northern Italy, Ferdinand sent a hastily assembled force under Fabrizio Cardinal Ruffo to reconquer the mainland kingdom. Ruffo, with the support of British artillery, the Church, and the pro-Bourbon aristocracy, succeeded in reaching Naples in May 1799, and the Parthenopean Republic collapsed. After some months, King Ferdinand returned to the throne.

The king and the queen were anxious that no mercy should be shown to the rebels, and Maria Carolina (a sister of the executed Marie Antoinette) made use of Lady Hamilton to induce Nelson to carry out her vengeance.

==Third Coalition==
The king returned to Naples soon afterwards, and ordered the execution of a few hundred French collaborators. This stopped only when the French successes forced him to agree to a treaty which included amnesty for members of the French party. When the War of the Third Coalition broke out between France and the Austrian Empire in 1805, Ferdinand signed a treaty of neutrality with the former. A few days later, Ferdinand allied himself with Austria and allowed an Anglo-Russian force to land at Naples.

The French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December enabled Napoleon to launch an invasion of the Kingdom of Naples. Ferdinand fled to Palermo on 23 January 1806, followed soon after by his wife and son, and on 14 February 1806 the French again entered Naples. Napoleon declared that the Bourbon dynasty had forfeited the crown, and proclaimed his brother Joseph King of Naples and Sicily. But Ferdinand continued to reign over the latter kingdom (becoming the first King of Sicily in centuries to actually reside there) under British protection.

Parliamentary institutions of a feudal type had long existed on the island, and Lord William Bentinck, the British minister, insisted on a reform of the constitution on English and French lines. The king indeed practically abdicated his power, appointing his son Francis as regent, and the queen, at Bentinck&#x27;s insistence, was exiled to Austria, where she died in 1814.

==Restoration==
After the fall of Napoleon, Joachim Murat, who had succeeded Joseph Bonaparte as king of Naples in 1808, was dethroned in the Neapolitan War in 1815, and Ferdinand returned to Naples. By a secret treaty he had bound himself not to advance further in a constitutional direction than Austria should at any time approve; but, though on the whole he acted in accordance with Metternich&#x27;s policy of preserving the &quot;status quo&quot;, and maintained with but slight change Murat&#x27;s laws and administrative system. Ferdinand took advantage of the situation to abolish the Sicilian constitution, in violation of his oath, and to proclaim the union of the two states into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (12 December 1816).

Ferdinand was now completely subservient to Austria, an Austrian, Count Nugent, being even made commander-in-chief of the army. For the next four years, Ferdinand reigned as an absolute monarch within his domain, granting no constitutional reforms.

==1820 revolution==
The suppression of liberal opinion caused an alarming spread of the influence and activity of the secret society of the Carbonari, which in time affected a large part of the army. In July 1820, a military revolt broke out under General Guglielmo Pepe, and Ferdinand was terrorised into signing a constitution on the model of the Spanish Constitution of 1812. On the other hand, a revolt in Sicily, in favour of the recovery of its independence, was suppressed by Neapolitan troops.

The success of the military revolution at Naples seriously alarmed the powers of the Holy Alliance, who feared that it might spread to other Italian states and so lead to a general European conflagration. The Troppau Protocol of 1820 was signed by Austria, Prussia and Russia, although an invitation to Ferdinand to attend the adjourned Congress of Laibach (1821) was issued at which he failed to distinguish himself. He had twice sworn to maintain the new constitution but was hardly out of Naples before he repudiated his oaths and, in letters addressed to all the sovereigns of Europe, declared his acts to have been null and void. Metternich had no difficulty in persuading the king to allow an Austrian army to march into Naples &quot;to restore order&quot;.

The Neapolitans, commanded by General Pepe, made no attempt to defend the difficult defiles of the Abruzzi, and were defeated at Battle of Rieti (7 March 1821). The Austrians entered Naples.

==Later years==
Following the Austrian victory, the Parliament was dismissed and Ferdinand suppressed the Liberals and Carbonari. The victory was used by Austria to force its grasp over Naples&#x27; domestic and foreign policies. Count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont was appointed as the Austrian ambassador to Naples, practically administering the country as well as managing the occupation and strengthening Austrian influence over Neapolitan elites.

Ferdinand died in Naples on 4 January 1825. He was the last surviving child of Charles III.

<doc id="173248" wikidata="Q1856900" url="?curid=173248" title="Vespa 400">
<text>The Vespa 400 is a rear-engined microcar, produced by ACMA in Fourchambault, France, from 1957 until 1961 to the designs of the Italian Piaggio company. Three different versions were sold, the &quot;Luxe&quot; , &quot;Tourisme&quot; and &quot;GT&quot;.

== Overview ==

The car made its high-profile public debut on 26 September 1957 at a press presentation staged in Monaco. The ACMA directors ensured a good attendance from members of the press by also inviting three celebrity racing drivers to the Vespa 400 launch.

The 400 was a two seater with room behind the seats to accommodate luggage or two small children on an optional cushion. The front seats were simple tubular metal frames with cloth upholstery on elastic &quot;springs&quot; and between the seats were the handbrake, starter and choke. The gear change was centrally floor mounted. The rear hinged doors were coated on the inside with only a thin plastic lining attached to the metal door panel skin allowing valuable extra internal space. On the early cars the main door windows did not open which attracted criticism, but increased the usable width for the driver and passenger. Instrumentation was very basic with only a speedometer and warning lights for low fuel, main beam, dynamo charging and indicators. The cabriolet fabric roof could be rolled back from the windscreen header rail to the top of the rear engine cover leaving conventional metal sides above the doors. The 12-volt battery was located at the front of the car, behind the dummy front grill, on a shelf that could be slid out. The spare wheel was stowed in a well under the passenger seat.

== Marketing ==
The high-profile launch paid off, with 12,130 cars produced in 1958. That turned out to be the high point, however, and output fell to 8,717 in 1959 despite a price reduction for the entry level 2-seater &quot;normal&quot; coupé from 345,000 francs to 319,500 francs between October 1957 and October 1958. Commentators suggested that the chic image created at the time of the launch was not always matched by the car itself, with its awkward gear change, poor sound-proofing and, especially before a modification to the carburetor specification, high fuel consumption. The car&#x27;s origins, developed by a leading world producer of motor scooters, Italy&#x27;s Piaggio Company, makers of the Vespa since 1946, was reflected in the installation, in the Vespa 400, of a two stroke (motorbike style) engine which required oil to be added to the petrol/gasoline whenever the car was refueled. During the summer of 1958 the cars were fitted with a semi-automatic device for adding oil to the fuel, but a fully automatic fuel mixing device was not included until two years later.

== Road test ==

The British &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a 400 de luxe saloon in 1959 recording a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 23.0 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost 351,725 &quot;old&quot; French Francs, cheaper than the 374,000 &quot;old&quot; French Francs domestic market starting price quoted towards the end of 1958 for the cheapest version of the larger but (even) less powerful Citroën 2CV.

== Specifications ==
;Engine: Two cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled. Bore and stroke: 63 mm x 63 mm (393 cc). Motor cyclists at the time were used to mixing oil into their fuel, but the manufacturer belatedly realised that this might compromise the 400&#x27;s standing as a &quot;car&quot;, and from the summer of 1958 the two-stroke oil was held in separate reservoir with a semi-automatic dispenser on the right side of the engine bay.
;Compression ratio: 6.4:1 with 13 hp, later increased respectively to 6.6:1 and 14 hp.

;Suspension: Four wheel independent. Four double acting hydraulic shock absorbers with coil springs. Front anti-roll bar.
;Manual transmission: 3 speed plus reverse, with 2nd &amp; 3rd synchromesh. 4 speed available only in Europe markets.
;Brakes: Hydraulically operated drums of diameter.

;Performance:With only 14 hp (10 kW), top speed is 50 to 55 mph (80 to 90 km/h), depending on road grade, wind conditions, etc. Achieving top speed takes 25 seconds. Fuel economy is about .

<doc id="173272" wikidata="Q309254" url="?curid=173272" title="Multi-exposure HDR capture">
<text>In photography and videography, multi-exposure HDR capture is a technique that creates high dynamic range (HDR) images (or extended dynamic range images) by taking and combining multiple exposures of the same subject matter at different exposures. Combining multiple images in this way results in an image with a greater dynamic range than what would be possible by taking one single image. The technique can also be used to capture video by taking and combining multiple exposures for each frame of the video. The term &quot;HDR&quot; is used frequently to refer to the process of creating HDR images from multiple exposures. Many smartphones have an automated HDR feature that relies on computational imaging techniques to capture and combine multiple exposures.

A single image captured by a camera provides a finite range of luminosity inherent to the medium, whether it is a digital sensor or film. Outside this range, tonal information is lost and no features are visible; tones that exceed the range are &quot;burned out&quot; and appear pure white in the brighter areas, while tones that fall below the range are &quot;crushed&quot; and appear pure black in the darker areas. The ratio between the maximum and the minimum tonal values that can be captured in a single image is known as the dynamic range. In photography, dynamic range is measured in exposure value (EV) differences, also known as &quot;stops&quot;.

The human eye&#x27;s response to light is non-linear: halving the light level does not halve the perceived brightness of a space, it makes it look only slightly dimmer. For most illumination levels, the response is approximately logarithmic. Human eyes adapt fairly rapidly to changes in light levels. HDR can thus produce images that look more like what a human sees when looking at the subject.

This technique can be applied to produce images that preserve local contrast for a natural rendering, or exaggerate local contrast for artistic effect. HDR is useful for recording many real-world scenes containing a wider range of brightness than can be captured directly, typically both bright, direct sunlight and deep shadows. Due to the limitations of printing and display contrast, the extended dynamic range of HDR images must be compressed to the range that can be displayed. The method of rendering a high dynamic range image to a standard monitor or printing device is called tone mapping; it reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to permit display on devices or prints with lower dynamic range.

== Benefits ==
One aim of HDR is to present a similar range of luminance to that experienced through the human visual system. The human eye, through non-linear response, adaptation of the iris, and other methods, adjusts constantly to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.
Most cameras are limited to a much narrower range of exposure values within a single image, due to the dynamic range of the capturing medium. With a limited dynamic range, tonal differences can be captured only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no details can be distinguished: when the tone being captured exceeds the range in bright areas, these tones appear as pure white, and when the tone being captured does not meet the minimum threshold, these tones appear as pure black. Images captured with non-HDR cameras that have a limited exposure range (low dynamic range, LDR), may lose detail in highlights or shadows.

Modern CMOS image sensors have improved dynamic range and can often capture a wider range of tones in a single exposure reducing the need to perform multi-exposure HDR. Color film negatives and slides consist of multiple film layers that respond to light differently. Original film (especially negatives versus transparencies or slides) feature a very high dynamic range (in the order of 8 for negatives and 4 to 4.5 for positive transparencies).

Multi-exposure HDR is used in photography and also in extreme dynamic range applications such as welding or automotive work. In security cameras the term &quot;wide dynamic range&quot; is used instead of HDR.

=== Limitations ===
A fast-moving subject, or camera movement between the multiple exposures, will generate a &quot;ghost&quot; effect or a staggered-blur strobe effect due to the merged images not being identical. Unless the subject is static and the camera mounted on a tripod there may be a tradeoff between extended dynamic range and sharpness. Sudden changes in the lighting conditions (strobed LED light) can also interfere with the desired results, by producing one or more HDR layers that do have the luminosity expected by an automated HDR system, though one might still be able to produce a reasonable HDR image manually in software by rearranging the image layers to merge in order of their actual luminosity.

Because of the nonlinearity of some sensors image artifacts can be common.

Camera characteristics such as gamma curves, sensor resolution, noise, photometric calibration and color calibration affect resulting high-dynamic-range images.

== Process ==
High-dynamic-range photographs are generally composites of multiple standard dynamic range images, often captured using exposure bracketing. Afterwards, photo manipulation software merges the input files into a single HDR image, which is then also tone mapped in accordance with the limitations of the planned output or display.

=== Capturing multiple images (exposure bracketing) ===
Any camera that allows manual exposure control can perform multi-exposure HDR image capture, although one equipped with automatic exposure bracketing (AEB) facilitates the process. Some cameras have an AEB feature that spans a far greater dynamic range than others, from ±0.6 in simpler cameras to ±18 EV in top professional cameras, 

The exposure value (EV) refers to the amount of light applied to the light-sensitive detector, whether film or digital sensor such as a CCD. An increase or decrease of one stop is defined as a doubling or halving of the amount of light captured. Revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires an increased EV, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low EVs.

EV is controlled using one of two photographic controls: varying either the size of the aperture or the exposure time. A set of images with multiple EVs intended for HDR processing should be captured only by altering the exposure time; altering the aperture size also would affect the depth of field and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.

Multi-exposure HDR photography generally is limited to still scenes because any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, because the photographer must capture three or more images to obtain the desired luminance range, taking such a full set of images takes extra time. Photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is advised to minimize framing differences between exposures.

=== Merging the images into an HDR image ===
Tonal information and details from shadow areas can be recovered from images that are deliberately overexposed (i.e., with positive EV compared to the correct scene exposure), while similar tonal information from highlight areas can be recovered from images that are deliberately underexposed (negative EV). The process of selecting and extracting shadow and highlight information from these over/underexposed images and then combining them with image(s) that are exposed correctly for the overall scene is known as exposure fusion. Exposure fusion can be performed manually, relying on the HDR operator&#x27;s judgment, experience, and training, but usually, fusion is performed automatically by software.

=== Storing ===

Information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional digital images, which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called &quot;scene-referred&quot;, in contrast to traditional digital images, which are &quot;device-referred&quot; or &quot;output-referred&quot;. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human visual system (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called &quot;gamma encoding&quot; or &quot;gamma correction&quot;. The values stored for HDR images are often gamma compressed using mathematical functions such as power laws logarithms, or floating point linear values, since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.

HDR images often do not use fixed ranges per color channel, other than traditional images, to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range (multiple channels). For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0–255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common values are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating-point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10 to 12 bits (8 to 14 values) for luminance and 8 bits (10 values) for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.

=== Tone mapping ===
Tone mapping reduces the dynamic range, or contrast ratio, of an entire image while retaining localized contrast. Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDR files by the same software package.

Tone mapping is often needed because the dynamic range that can be displayed is often lower than the dynamic range of the captured or processed image. HDR displays can receive a higher dynamic range signal than SDR displays, reducing the need for tone mapping.

=== Types of HDR ===
HDR can be done via several methods:

* DOL: Digital overlap
* BME: Binned multiplexed exposure
* SME: Spatially multiplexed exposure
* QBC: Quad Bayer Coding

=== Examples ===
This is an example of four standard dynamic range images that are combined to produce three resulting tone mapped images:


This is an example of a scene with a very wide dynamic range:

=== Photography ===

Several camera manufacturers offer built-in multi-exposure HDR features. For example, the Pentax K-7 DSLR has an HDR mode that makes 3 or 5 exposures and outputs (only) a tone mapped HDR image in a JPEG file. The Canon PowerShot G12, Canon PowerShot S95, and Canon PowerShot S100 offer similar features in a smaller format. Nikon&#x27;s approach is called &#x27;Active D-Lighting&#x27; which applies exposure compensation and tone mapping to the image as it comes from the sensor, with the emphasis being on creating a realistic effect.

Some smartphones provide HDR modes for their cameras, and most mobile platforms have apps that provide multi-exposure HDR picture taking. Google released a HDR+ mode for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 smartphones in 2014, which automatically captures a series of images and combines them into a single still image, as detailed by Marc Levoy. Unlike traditional HDR, Levoy&#x27;s implementation of HDR+ uses multiple images underexposed by using a short shutter speed, which are then aligned and averaged by pixel, improving dynamic range and reducing noise. By selecting the sharpest image as the baseline for alignment, the effect of camera shake is reduced.

Some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may combine two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing.

=== Videography ===
Although not as established as for still photography capture, it is also possible to capture and combine multiple images for each frame of a video in order to increase the dynamic range captured by the camera. This can be done via multiple methods:

* Creating a time-lapse of individually images created via the multi-exposure HDR technique.
* Taking consecutively two differently exposed images by cutting the frame rate in half.
* Taking simultaneously two differently exposed images by cutting the resolution in half.
* Taking simultaneously two differently exposed images with full resolution and frame rate via a sensor with dual gain architecture. For example: Arri Alexa&#x27;s sensor, Samsung sensors with Smart-ISO Pro.

Some cameras designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame, with changing exposure. For example, a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time.

In 2020, Qualcomm announced Snapdragon 888, a mobile SoC able to do computational multi-exposure HDR video capture in 4K and also to record it in a format compatible with HDR displays.

In 2021, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra smartphone is able to do computational multi-exposure HDR for video capture.

===Surveillance cameras===

HDR capture can be implemented on surveillance cameras, even inexpensive models. This is usually termed a wide dynamic range (WDR) function Examples include CarCam Tiny, Prestige DVR-390, and DVR-478.

== History ==

=== Mid-19th century ===

The idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered as early as the 1850s by Gustave Le Gray to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.

=== Mid-20th century ===
Manual tone mapping was accomplished by dodging and burning – selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction. This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph &quot;Schweitzer at the Lamp&quot; by W. Eugene Smith, from his 1954 photo essay &quot;A Man of Mercy&quot; on Albert Schweitzer and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took five days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.

Ansel Adams elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called &quot;The Print&quot;, which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his Zone System.

With the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.
Color film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by Charles Wyckoff and EG&amp;G &quot;in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force&quot;. This XR film had three emulsion layers, an upper layer having an ASA speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an intermediate rating, and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004. The film was processed in a manner similar to color films, and each layer produced a different color. The dynamic range of this extended range film has been estimated as 1:108. It has been used to photograph nuclear explosions, for astronomical photography, for spectrographic research, and for medical imaging. Wyckoff&#x27;s detailed pictures of nuclear explosions appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine in the mid-1950s.

=== Late 20th century ===
Georges Cornuéjols and licensees of his patents (Brdi, Hymatom) introduced the principle of HDR video image, in 1986, by interposing a matricial LCD screen in front of the camera&#x27;s image sensor, increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops.

The concept of neighborhood tone mapping was applied to video cameras in 1988 by a group from the Technion in Israel, led by Oliver Hilsenrath and Yehoshua Y. Zeevi. Technion researchers filed for a patent on this concept in 1991, and several related patents in 1992 and 1993.

In February and April 1990, Georges Cornuéjols introduced the first real-time HDR camera that combined two images captured successively by a sensor or simultaneously by two sensors of the camera. This process is known as bracketing used for a video stream.

In 1991, the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures, and producing an HDR video image, by Hymatom, licensee of Georges Cornuéjols.

Also in 1991, Georges Cornuéjols introduced the HDR+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera: for low-light environments, several successive images are accumulated, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

In 1993, another commercial medical camera producing an HDR video image, by the Technion.

Modern HDR imaging uses a completely different approach, based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations (across the entire image), and then tone mapping the result. Global HDR was first introduced in 1993 resulting in a mathematical theory of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that was published in 1995 by Steve Mann and Rosalind Picard.

On October 28, 1998, Ben Sarao created one of the first nighttime HDR+G (high dynamic range + graphic) image of STS-95 on the launch pad at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center. It consisted of four film images of the space shuttle at night that were digitally composited with additional digital graphic elements. The image was first exhibited at NASA Headquarters Great Hall, Washington DC, in 1999 and then published in &quot;Hasselblad Forum&quot;.

The advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for HDR imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors, which had a much smaller dynamic range than film. Steve Mann developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the MIT Media Lab. Mann&#x27;s method involved a two-step procedure: First, generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations (operations that affect all pixels identically, without regard to their local neighborhoods). Second, convert this image array, using local neighborhood processing (tone-remapping, etc.), into an HDR image. The image array generated by the first step of Mann&#x27;s process is called a &quot;lightspace image&quot;, &quot;lightspace picture&quot;, or &quot;radiance map&quot;. Another benefit of global-HDR imaging is that it provides access to the intermediate light or radiance map, which has been used for computer vision, and other image processing operations.

=== 21st century ===
In February 2001, the Dynamic Ranger technique was demonstrated, using multiple photos with different exposure levels to accomplish high dynamic range similar to the naked eye.

In the early 2000s, several scholarly research efforts used consumer-grade sensors and cameras. A few companies such as RED and Arri have been developing digital sensors capable of a higher dynamic range. RED EPIC-X can capture time-sequential HDRx images with a user-selectable 1–3 stops of additional highlight latitude in the &quot;x&quot; channel. The &quot;x&quot; channel can be merged with the normal channel in post production software. The Arri Alexa camera uses a dual-gain architecture to generate an HDR image from two exposures captured at the same time.

With the advent of low-cost consumer digital cameras, many amateurs began posting tone-mapped HDR time-lapse videos on the Internet, essentially a sequence of still photographs in quick succession. In 2010, the independent studio Soviet Montage produced an example of HDR video from disparately exposed video streams using a beam splitter and consumer grade HD video cameras. Similar methods have been described in the academic literature in 2001 and 2007.

In 2005, Adobe Systems introduced several new features in Photoshop CS2 including &quot;Merge to HDR&quot;, 32 bit floating point image support, and HDR tone mapping.

On June 30, 2016, Microsoft added support for the digital compositing of HDR images to Windows 10 using the Universal Windows Platform.

<text>Goguryeo (37 BC – 668 AD) (; ; Old Korean: Guryeo) also later known as Goryeo (; ; Middle Korean: 고ᇢ롕〮, &quot;kwòwlyéy&quot;), was a Korean kingdom which was located on the northern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula and the southern and central parts of modern-day Northeast China (Manchuria). At its peak of power, Goguryeo encompassed most of the Korean Peninsula and large parts of Manchuria, along with parts of eastern Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and modern-day Russia.

Along with Baekje and Silla, Goguryeo was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It was an active participant in the power struggle for control of the Korean peninsula and was also associated with the foreign affairs of neighboring polities in China and Japan.

The Samguk Sagi, a text from the 12th century in Goryeo, claims that Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC, but today the date of the dynasty&#x27;s foundation is in &quot;doubt&quot;, as &quot;archaeological evidence&quot; suggests that &quot;Goguryeo was founded before Silla&quot;, and four things support this:

# Kim Pu-sik was a 12th-century historian and author of the Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms). Since &quot;he was a descendant of the Silla royal family&quot;, it is likely that he distorted history to show the superiority of his ancestor, Silla, and this is undeniable.
# Since Kim Pu-sik wrote the History of the Three Kingdoms at least 5 centuries after the events of the Three Kingdoms and was not an eyewitness to the events of that era, his book is considered a secondary source and cannot be considered a primary source alone.
# The age of Goguryeo in the Samguk Sagi contradicts what is inscribed in Gwanggaeto the Great&#x27;s stele (which is a primary source). Gwanggaeto the Great&#x27;s stele states that Goguryeo is &quot;900 years old&quot;, but the Samguk Sagi mentions Goguryeo as a dynasty that lasted 705 years.
# Also, the Old Book of Tang (945), a primary source, written by &quot;Li Shimin&quot; (Taizong), mentions that Goguryeo is &quot;about 900 years old&quot;.

Goguryeo was one of the great powers in East Asia until its defeat by a Silla–Tang alliance in 668 after prolonged exhaustion and internal strife following the death of Yeon Gaesomun. After its fall, its territory was divided between the Tang dynasty, Later Silla and Balhae.

The name &quot;Goryeo&quot; (alternatively spelled &quot;Koryŏ&quot;), a shortened form of Goguryeo (Koguryŏ), was adopted as the official name in the 5th century, and is the origin of the English name &quot;Korea&quot;.

==Names and etymology==
The kingdom was originally called &quot;Guryeo&quot; (Old Korean: 句麗, Yale: &quot;Kwulye&quot;, ) or something similar to &quot;kaukuri&quot; ()), Both words were derived from &quot;忽&quot; (&quot;*kuru&quot; or &quot;*kolo&quot;) which meant castle or fortress. The word was possibly a Wanderwort like the Middle Mongolian &quot;qoto-n&quot;.

Several possible cognates for 忽 exist as well, which was used at a later stage as an administrative subdivision with the spelling of &quot;hwol&quot; , as in 買忽 &quot;mwoyhwol/michwuhwol&quot; , alongside the likely cognate of 骨 &quot;kwol&quot; . Nam Pung-hyun presents it also as a Baekje term, probably a cognate with the Goguryeo word with the same meaning and spelling.

The iteration of 徐羅伐 &quot;Syerapel&quot; as 徐羅城 &quot;*SyeraKUY&quot; equated the Old Korean word for village, 伐 &quot;pel&quot; with the Old Japanese one for castle 城 &quot;ki&quot;, considered a borrowing from Baekje 己 &quot;*kuy&quot;, in turn a borrowing from Goguryeo 忽 &quot;*kolo&quot;. Middle Korean 골〯 &quot;kwǒl&quot; [ko̞ɭ] and ᄀᆞ옳 &quot;kòwòlh&quot; [kʌ̀.òl] (&quot;district&quot;) are likely descended from &quot;*kolo&quot;.

The name &quot;Goguryeo&quot; (; ), which means &quot;high castle&quot;, is a combination of &quot;Guryeo&quot; and the prefix &quot;Go&quot; (). The name came from &quot;Goguryeo-hyeon&quot;, a subdivision that was established by the Xuantu Commandery. As Han influence over Korea declined, &quot;Goguryeo-hyeon&quot; became the center of the early Goguryeo union.

From the mid-5th century, &quot;Goguryeo&quot; was shortened to the calque of &quot;Goryeo&quot; (; ; Middle Korean: 고ᇢ롕〮, &quot;Kwòwlyéy&quot;), which by itself had the meaning of &quot;high and beautiful&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest record of the name of Goguryeo can be traced to geographic monographs in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; and is first attested as the name of one of the subdivisions of the Xuantu Commandery, established along the trade routes within the Amnok river basin following the destruction of Gojoseon in 113 BC. The American historian Christopher Beckwith offers the alternative proposal that the Guguryeo people were first located in or around Liaoxi (western Liaoning and parts of Inner Mongolia) and later migrated eastward, pointing to another account in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. The early Goguryeo tribes from whom the administrative name is derived were located close to or within the area of control of the Xuantu Commandery. Its tribal leaders also appeared to have held the ruler title of &quot;marquis&quot; over said nominal Gaogouli/Goguryeo county. The collapse of the first Xuantu Commandery in 75 BC is generally attributed to the military actions of the Goguryeo natives. In the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; (945), it is recorded that Emperor Taizong refers to Goguryeo&#x27;s history as being some 900 years old. According to the 12th-century &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and the 13th-century &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, a prince from the Buyeo kingdom named Jumong fled after a power struggle with other princes of the court and founded Goguryeo in 37 BC in a region called Jolbon Buyeo, usually thought to be located in the middle Amnok/Yalu and Hun River basin.

In 75 BC, a group of Yemaek who may have originated from Goguryeo made an incursion into China&#x27;s Xuantu Commandery west of the Yalu. The first mention of Goguryeo as a group label associated with Yemaek tribes is a reference in the &quot;Han Shu&quot; that discusses a Goguryeo revolt in 12 AD, during which they broke away from the influence of the Xuantu Commandery.

According to Book 37 of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Goguryeo originated north of ancient China, then gradually moved east to the side of Taedong River. At its founding, the Goguryeo people are believed to be a blend of people from Buyeo and Yemaek, as leadership from Buyeo may have fled their kingdom and integrated with existing Yemaek chiefdoms. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in the section titled &quot;Accounts of the Eastern Barbarians&quot;, implied that Buyeo and the Yemaek people were ethnically related and spoke a similar language.

Chinese people were also in Gorguyeo. Book 28 of Samguk sagi stated that &quot;many people of China fled [to] East of the Sea due to the chaos of war by Qin and Han&quot;. Later Han dynasty established the Four Commanderies, and in 12 AD Goguryeo made its first attack on the Xuantu Commandery. The population of Xuantu Commandery was about 221,845 in 2 AD, and they lived in the commandery&#x27;s three counties of Gaogouli, Shangyintai, and Xigaima. Later on, Goguryeo gradually annexed all the Four Commanderies of Han during its expansion.

Both Goguryeo and Baekje shared founding myths and originated from Buyeo.

===Jumong and the foundation myth===

The earliest mention of Jumong is in the 4th-century Gwanggaeto Stele. Jumong is the modern Korean transcription of the hanja &quot;Jumong&quot;, &quot;Chumo&quot;, or &quot;Jungmo&quot;.

The Stele states that Jumong was the first king and ancestor of Goguryeo and that he was the son of the prince of Buyeo and daughter of Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (). The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; paint additional detail and names Jumong&#x27;s mother as Yuhwa (). Jumong&#x27;s biological father was said to be a man named Haemosu who is described as a &quot;strong man&quot; and &quot;a heavenly prince.&quot; The river god chased Yuhwa away to the Ubal River () due to her pregnancy, where she met and became the concubine of Geumwa.

Jumong was well known for his exceptional archery skills. Eventually, Geumwa&#x27;s sons became jealous of him, and Jumong was forced to leave Eastern Buyeo. The Stele and later Korean sources disagree as to which Buyeo Jumong came from. The Stele says he came from Buyeo and the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; and &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; say he came from Eastern Buyeo. Jumong eventually made it to Jolbon, where he married Soseono, daughter of its ruler. He subsequently became king himself, founding Goguryeo with a small group of his followers from his native country.

A traditional account from the &quot;Annals of Baekje&quot; section in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; says that Soseono was the daughter of Yeon Tabal, a wealthy influential figure in Jolbon and married to Jumong. However, the same source officially states that the king of Jolbon gave his daughter to Jumong, who had escaped with his followers from Eastern Buyeo, in marriage. She gave her husband, Jumong, financial support in founding the new statelet, Goguryeo. After Yuri, son of Jumong and his first wife, Lady Ye, came from Dongbuyeo and succeeded Jumong, she left Goguryeo, taking her two sons Biryu and Onjo south to found their own kingdoms, one of which was Baekje.

Jumong&#x27;s given surname was &quot;Hae&quot; (), the name of the Buyeo rulers. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, Jumong changed his surname to &quot;Go&quot; () in conscious reflection of his divine parentage. Jumong is recorded to have conquered the tribal states of Biryu () in 36 BC, Haeng-in () in 33 BC, and Northern Okjeo in 28 BC.

===Centralization and early expansion (mid-first century)===
Goguryeo developed from a league of various Yemaek tribes to an early state and rapidly expanded its power from their original basin of control in the Hun River drainage. In the time of Taejodae in 53 AD, five local tribes were reorganized into five centrally ruled districts. Foreign relations and the military were controlled by the king. Early expansion might be best explained by ecology; Goguryeo controlled territory in what is currently central and southern Manchuria and northern Korea, which are both very mountainous and lacking in arable land. Upon centralizing, Goguryeo might have been unable to harness enough resources from the region to feed its population and thus, following historical pastoralist tendencies, would have sought to raid and exploit neighboring societies for their land and resources. Aggressive military activities may have also aided expansion, allowing Goguryeo to exact tribute from their tribal neighbors and dominate them politically and economically.

Taejo conquered the Okjeo tribes of what is now northeastern Korea as well as the Dongye and other tribes in Southeastern Manchuria and Northern Korea. From the increase of resources and manpower that these subjugated tribes gave him, Taejodae led Goguryeo in attacking the Han Commanderies of Lelang and Xuantu on the Korean and Liaodong peninsulas, becoming fully independent from them.

Generally, Taejodae allowed the conquered tribes to retain their chieftains, but required them to report to governors who were related to Goguryeo&#x27;s royal line; tribes under Goguryeo&#x27;s jurisdiction were expected to provide heavy tribute. Taejodae and his successors channeled these increased resources to continuing Goguryeo&#x27;s expansion to the north and west. New laws regulated peasants and the aristocracy, as tribal leaders continued to be absorbed into the central aristocracy. Royal succession changed from fraternal to patrilineal, stabilizing the royal court.

The expanding Goguryeo kingdom soon entered into direct military contact with the Liaodong Commandery to its west. Around this time, Chinese warlord Gongsun Kang established the Daifang Commandery by separating the southern half from the Lelang commandery. Balgi, a brother of King Sansang of Goguryeo, defected to Kang and asked for Kang&#x27;s aid to help him take the throne of Goguryeo. Although Goguryeo defeated the first invasion and killed Balgi, in 209, Kang invaded Goguryeo again, seized some of its territory and weakened Goguryeo. Pressure from Liaodong forced Goguryeo to move their capital in the Hun River valley to the Yalu River valley near Hwando.

===Goguryeo–Wei Wars===
In the chaos following the fall of the Han dynasty, the former Han commanderies had broken free of control and were ruled by various independent warlords. Surrounded by these commanderies, who were governed by aggressive warlords, Goguryeo moved to improve relations with the newly created dynasty of Cao Wei in China and sent tribute in 220. In 238, Goguryeo entered into a formal alliance with Wei to destroy the Liaodong commandery.

When Liaodong was finally conquered by Wei, cooperation between Wei and Goguryeo fell apart and Goguryeo attacked the western edges of Liaodong, which incited a Wei counterattack in 244. Thus, Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo–Wei War in 242, trying to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea by attempting to take a Chinese fort. However, the Wei state responded by invading and defeated Goguryeo. The capital at Hwando was destroyed by Wei forces in 244. It is said that Dongcheon, with his army destroyed, fled for a while to the Okjeo state in the east. Wei invaded again in 259 but was defeated at Yangmaenggok; according to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Jungcheon assembled 5,000 elite cavalry and defeated the invading Wei troops, beheading 8,000 enemies.

===Revival and further expansion (300 to 390)===

In only 70 years, Goguryeo rebuilt its capital Hwando and again began to raid the Liaodong, Lelang and Xuantu commanderies. As Goguryeo extended its reach into the Liaodong Peninsula, the last Chinese commandery at Lelang was conquered and absorbed by Micheon in 313, bringing the remaining northern part of the Korean peninsula into the fold. This conquest resulted in the end of Chinese rule over territory in the northern Korean peninsula, which had spanned 400 years. From that point on, until the 7th century, territorial control of the peninsula would be contested primarily by the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

Goguryeo met major setbacks and defeats during the reign of Gogukwon in the 4th century. In the early 4th century, the nomadic proto-Mongol Xianbei people occupied northern China; during the winter of 342, the Xianbei of Former Yan, ruled by the Murong clan, attacked and destroyed Goguryeo&#x27;s capital, Hwando, capturing 50,000 Goguryeo men and women to use as slave labor in addition to taking the Queen Dowager and Queen prisoner, and forced Gogukwon to flee for a while. The Xianbei also devastated Buyeo in 346, accelerating Buyeo migration to the Korean peninsula. In 371, Geunchogo of Baekje killed Gogukwon in the Battle of Chiyang and sacked Pyongyang, one of Goguryeo&#x27;s largest cities.

Sosurim, who succeeded the slain Gogukwon, reshaped the nation&#x27;s institutions to save it from a great crisis. Turning to domestic stability and the unification of various conquered tribes, Sosurim proclaimed new laws, embraced Buddhism as the state religion in 372, and established a national educational institute called the &quot;Taehak&quot; (). Due to the defeats that Goguryeo had suffered at the hands of the Xianbei and Baekje, Sosurim instituted military reforms aimed at preventing such defeats in the future. Sosurim&#x27;s internal arrangements laid the groundwork for Gwanggaeto&#x27;s expansion. His successor and the father of Gwanggaeto the Great, Gogukyang, invaded Later Yan, the successor state of Former Yan, in 385 and Baekje in 386.

Goguryeo used its military to protect and exploit semi-nomadic peoples, who served as vassals, foot soldiers, or slaves, such as the Okjeo people in the northeast end of the Korean peninsula, and the Mohe people in Manchuria, who would later become the Jurchens.

===Zenith of Goguryeo&#x27;s Power (391 to 531 AD)===

Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu. During this period, Goguryeo territories included three fourths of the Korean Peninsula, including what is now Seoul, almost all of Manchuria, and parts of Inner Mongolia. There is archaeological evidence that Goguryeo&#x27;s maximum extent lay even further west in now Mongolia, based on discoveries of Goguryeo fortress ruins in Mongolia.

Gwanggaeto the Great (r. 391–412) was a highly energetic emperor who is remembered for his rapid military expansion of the realm. He instituted the era name of &quot;Yeongnak&quot; or &quot;Eternal Rejoicing&quot;, affirming that Goguryeo was on equal standing with the dynasties in the Chinese mainland. Gwanggaeto conquered 64 walled cities and 1,400 villages during his campaigns. To the west, he destroyed neighboring Khitan tribes and invaded Later Yan, conquering the entire Liaodong Peninsula; to the north and east, he annexed much of Buyeo and conquered the Sushen, who were Tungusic ancestors of the Jurchens and Manchus; and to the south, he defeated and subjugated Baekje, contributed to the dissolution of Gaya, and vassalized Silla after defending it from a coalition of Baekje, Gaya, and Wa. Gwanggaeto brought about a loose unification of the Korean Peninsula, and achieved undisputed control of most of Manchuria and over two thirds of the Korean Peninsula.

Gwanggaeto&#x27;s exploits were recorded on a huge memorial stele erected by his son Jangsu, located in present-day Ji&#x27;an on the border between China and North Korea.

Jangsu (r. 413–491) ascended to the throne in 413 and moved the capital in 427 to Pyongyang, a more suitable region to grow into a burgeoning metropolitan capital, which led Goguryeo to achieve a high level of cultural and economic prosperity. Jangsu, like his father, continued Goguryeo&#x27;s territorial expansion into Manchuria and reached the Songhua River to the north. He invaded the Khitans, and then attacked the Didouyu, located in eastern Mongolia, with his Rouran allies. Like his father, Jangsu also achieved a loose unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He defeated Baekje and Silla and gained large amounts of territory from both. In addition, Jangsu&#x27;s long reign saw the perfecting of Goguryeo&#x27;s political, economic and other institutional arrangements. Jangsu ruled Goguryeo for 79 years until the age of 98, the longest reign in East Asian history.

During the reign of Munja, Goguryeo completely annexed Buyeo, signifying Goguryeo&#x27;s furthest-ever expansion north, while continuing its strong influence over the kingdoms of Silla and Baekje, and the tribes of Wuji and Khitan.

===Internal strife (531 to 551)===
Goguryeo reached its zenith in the 6th century. After this, however, it began a steady decline. Anjang was assassinated, and succeeded by his brother Anwon, during whose reign aristocratic factionalism increased. A political schism deepened as two factions advocated different princes for succession, until the eight-year-old Yang-won was finally crowned. But the power struggle was never resolved definitively, as renegade magistrates with private armies appointed themselves &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of their areas of control.

Taking advantage of Goguryeo&#x27;s internal struggle, a nomadic group called the Tuchueh attacked Goguryeo&#x27;s northern castles in the 550s and conquered some of Goguryeo&#x27;s northern lands. Weakening Goguryeo even more, as civil war continued among feudal lords over royal succession, Baekje and Silla allied to attack Goguryeo from the south in 551.

===Conflicts of the late 6th and 7th centuries===
In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, Goguryeo was often in military conflict with the Sui and Tang dynasties of China. Its relations with Baekje and Silla were complex and alternated between alliances and enmity. A neighbor in the northwest were the Eastern Türks which was a nominal ally of Goguryeo.

====Goguryeo&#x27;s loss of the Han River Valley====
In 551 AD, Baekje and Silla entered into an alliance to attack Goguryeo and conquer the Han River valley, an important strategic area close to the center of the peninsula and a very rich agricultural region. After Baekje exhausted themselves with a series of costly assaults on Goguryeo fortifications, Silla troops, arriving on the pretense of offering assistance, attacked and took possession of the entire Han River valley in 553. Incensed by this betrayal, Seong launched a retaliatory strike against Silla&#x27;s western border in the following year but was captured and killed.

The war, along the middle of the Korean peninsula, had very important consequences. It effectively made Baekje the weakest player on the Korean Peninsula and gave Silla an important resource and population rich area as a base for expansion. Conversely, it denied Goguryeo the use of the area, which weakened the kingdom. It also gave Silla direct access to the Yellow Sea, opening up direct trade and diplomatic access to the Chinese dynasties and accelerating Silla&#x27;s adoption of Chinese culture. Thus, Silla could rely less on Goguryeo for elements of civilization and could get culture and technology directly from China. This increasing tilt of Silla to China would result in an alliance that would prove disastrous for Goguryeo in the late 7th century.

====Goguryeo–Sui War====
The Sui dynasty&#x27;s reunification of China for the first time in centuries was met with alarm in Goguryeo, and Pyeongwon of Goguryeo began preparations for a future war by augmenting military provisions and training more troops. Although Sui was far larger and stronger than Goguryeo, the Baekje-Silla Alliance that had driven Goguryeo from the Han Valley had fallen apart, and thus Goguryeo&#x27;s southern border was secure. Initially, Goguryeo tried to appease Sui by offering tribute as Korean kingdoms had done under the Tributary system of China. However, Goguryeo continued insistence on an equal relationship with Sui, its reinstatement of the imperial title &quot;Taewang&quot; (Emperor in Korean) of the East and its continued raids into Sui territory greatly angered the Sui Court. Furthermore, Silla and Baekje, both under threat from Goguryeo, requested Sui assistance against Goguryeo as all three Korean kingdoms had desired to seize the others&#x27; territories to rule the peninsula, and attempted to curry Sui&#x27;s favor to achieve these goals.

Goguryeo&#x27;s expansion and its attempts to equalize the relationship conflicted with Sui China and increased tensions. In 598, Goguryeo made a preemptive attack on Liaoxi which led to the Battle of Linyuguan, but was beaten back by Sui forces. This caused Emperor Wen to launch a counterattack by land and sea that ended in disaster for Sui.

Sui&#x27;s most disastrous campaign against Goguryeo was in 612, in which Sui, according to the History of the Sui dynasty, mobilized 30 division armies, about 1,133,800 combat troops. Pinned along Goguryeo&#x27;s line of fortifications on the Liao River, a detachment of nine division armies, about 305,000 troops, bypassed the main defensive lines and headed towards the Goguryeo capital of Pyongyang to link up with Sui naval forces, who had reinforcements and supplies.

However, Goguryeo was able to defeat the Sui navy, thus when the Sui&#x27;s nine division armies finally reached Pyongyang, they didn&#x27;t have the supplies for a lengthy siege. Sui troops retreated, but General Eulji Mundeok led the Goguryeo troops to victory by luring the Sui into an ambush outside of Pyongyang. At the Battle of Salsu, Goguryeo soldiers released water from a dam, which split the Sui army and cut off their escape route. Of the original 305,000 soldiers of Sui&#x27;s nine division armies, it is said that only 2,700 escaped to Sui China.

The 613 and 614 campaigns were aborted after launch—the 613 campaign was terminated when the Sui general Yang Xuangan rebelled against Emperor Yang, while the 614 campaign was terminated after Goguryeo offered a truce and returned Husi Zheng (斛斯政), a defecting Sui general who had fled to Goguryeo, Emperor Yang later had Husi executed. Emperor Yang planned another attack on Goguryeo in 615, but due to Sui&#x27;s deteroriating internal state he was never able to launch it. Sui was weakened due to rebellions against Emperor Yang&#x27;s rule and his failed attempts to conquer Goguryeo. They could not attack further because the provinces in the Sui heartland would not send logistical support.

Emperor Yang&#x27;s disastrous defeats in Korea greatly contributed to the collapse of the Sui dynasty.

====Goguryeo–Silla War, Goguryeo-Tang War and the Silla–Tang alliance====

In the winter of 642, King Yeongnyu was apprehensive about Yeon Gaesomun, one of the great nobles of Goguryeo, and plotted with other officials to kill him. However, Yeon Gaesomun caught news of the plot and killed Yeongnyu and 100 officials, initiating a coup d&#x27;état. He proceeded to enthrone Yeongnyu&#x27;s nephew, Go Jang, as King Bojang while wielding de facto control of Goguryeo himself as the Dae Magniji (; a position equivalent to a modern era dual office of prime minister and generalissimo). At the outset of his rule, Yeon Gaesomun took a brief conciliatory stance toward Tang China. For instance, he supported Taoism at the expense of Buddhism, and to this effect in 643, sent emissaries to the Tang court requesting Taoist sages, eight of whom were brought to Goguryeo. This gesture is considered by some historians as an effort to pacify Tang and buy time to prepare for the Tang invasion Yeon thought inevitable given his ambitions to annex Silla.

However, Yeon Gaesomun took an increasingly provocative stance against Silla Korea and Tang China. Soon, Goguryeo formed an alliance with Baekje and invaded Silla, Daeya-song (modern Hapchon) and around 40 border fortresses were conquered by the Goguryeo-Baekje alliance. Since the early 7th century, Silla had been forced on the defensive by both Baekje and Goguryeo, which had not yet formally allied but had both desired to erode Sillan power in the Han Valley. During the reign of King Jinpyeong of Silla, numerous fortresses were lost to both Goguryeo and the continuous attacks took a toll on Silla and its people. During Jinpyeong&#x27;s reign, Silla made repeated requests beseeching Sui China to attack Goguryeo. Although these invasions were ultimately unsuccessful, in 643, once again under pressure from the Goguryeo–Baekje alliance, Jinpyeong&#x27;s successor, Queen Seondeok of Silla, requested military aid from Tang. Although Taizong had initially dismissed Silla&#x27;s offers to pay tribute and its requests for an alliance on account of Seondeok being a woman, he later accepted the offer due to Goguryeo&#x27;s growing belligerence and hostile policy towards both Silla and Tang. In 644, Tang began preparations for a major campaign against Goguryeo.

In 645, Emperor Taizong, who had a personal ambition to defeat Goguryeo and was determined to succeed where Emperor Yang had failed, personally led an attack on Goguryeo. The Tang army captured a number of Goguryeo fortresses, including the important Yodong/Liaodong Fortress (遼東城, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning). During his first campaign against Goguryeo, Taizong famously showed generously to the defeated inhabitants of numerous Goguryeo fortresses, refusing to permit his troops to loot downs and enslave inhabitants and when faced with protest from his commanders and soldiers, rewarded them with his own money. Ansi City (in modern Haicheng, Liaoning), which was the last fortress that would clear the Liaodong Peninsula of significant defensive works and was promptly put under siege. Initially, Taizong and his forces achieve great progress, when his numerically inferior force smashed a Goguryeo relief force at the Battle of Mount Jupil. Goguryeo&#x27;s defeat at Mount Jupil had significant consequences, as Tang forces killed over 20,000 Goguryeo soldiers and captured another 36,800, which crippled Goguryeo&#x27;s manpower reserves for the rest of the conflict. However, the capable defense put up by Ansi&#x27;s commanding general (whose name is controversial but traditionally is believed to be Yang Manchun) stymied Tang forces and, in late fall, with winter fast approaching and his supplies running low, Tang forces under the command Prince Li Daozong attempted to build a rampart to seize the city in a last ditch effort, but was foiled when Goguryeo troops managed to seize control of it. Afterwards, Taizong decided to withdraw in the face of incoming Goguryeo reinforcements, deteriorating weather conditions and the difficult supply situation. The campaign was unsuccessful for the Tang Chinese, failing to capture Ansi Fortress after a protracted siege that lasted more than 60 days. Emperor Taizong invaded Goguryeo again in 647 and 648, but was defeated both times.

Emperor Taizong prepared another invasion in 649, but died in the summer, possibly due to an illness he contracted during his Korean campaigns. His son Emperor Gaozong continued his campaigns. Upon the suggestion of Kim Chunchu, the Silla–Tang alliance first conquered Baekje in 660 to break up the Goguryeo–Baekje alliance, and then turned its full attention to Goguryeo. However, Emperor Gaozong, too, was unable to defeat Goguryeo led by Yeon Gaesomun; one of Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s most notable victories came in 662 at the &quot;Battle of Sasu&quot; (蛇水), where he annihilated the Tang forces and killed the invading ex-rebel Nanman general Pang Xiaotai (龐孝泰) and all 13 of his sons. Therefore, while Yeon Gaesomun was alive, Tang could not defeat Goguryeo.

====Fall====
In the summer of 666, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother. He was initially succeeded as &quot;Dae Mangniji&quot;, the highest position newly made under the ruling period of Yeon Gaesomun, by his oldest son Yeon Namsaeng. As Yeon Namsaeng subsequently carried out a tour of Goguryeo territory, however, rumors began to spread both that Yeon Namsaeng was going to kill his younger brothers Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, whom he had left in charge at Pyongyang, and that Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan were planning to rebel against Yeon Namsaeng. When Yeon Namsaeng subsequently sent officials close to him back to Pyongyang to try to spy on the situation, Yeon Namgeon arrested them and declared himself &quot;Dae Mangniji&quot;, attacking his brother. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son Cheon Heonseong (泉獻誠), as Yeon Namsaeng changed his family name from Yeon (淵) to Cheon (泉) observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu, to Tang to seek aid. Emperor Gaozong saw this as an opportunity and sent an army to attack and destroy Goguryeo. In the middle of Goguryeo&#x27;s power struggles between Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s successors, his younger brother, Yeon Jeongto, defected to the Silla side.

In 667, the Chinese army crossed the Liao River and captured Shin/Xin Fortress (新城, in modern Fushun, Liaoning). The Tang forces thereafter fought off counterattacks by Yeon Namgeon, and joined forces with and received every possible assistance from the defector Yeon Namsaeng, although they were initially unable to cross the Yalu River due to resistance. In spring of 668, Li Ji turned his attention to Goguryeo&#x27;s northern cities, capturing the important city of Buyeo (扶餘, in modern Nong&#x27;an, Jilin). In fall of 668, he crossed the Yalu River and put Pyongyang under siege in concert with the Silla army.

Yeon Namsan and Bojang surrendered, and while Yeon Namgeon continued to resist in the inner city, his general, the Buddhist monk Shin Seong (信誠) turned against him and surrendered the inner city to Tang forces. Yeon Namgeon tried to commit suicide, but was seized and treated. This was the end of Goguryeo, and Tang annexed Goguryeo into its territory, with Xue Rengui being put initially in charge of former Goguryeo territory as protector general. The violent dissension resulting from Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s death proved to be the primary reason for the Tang–Silla triumph, thanks to the division, defections, and widespread demoralization it caused. The alliance with Silla had also proved to be invaluable, thanks to the ability to attack Goguryeo from opposite directions, and both military and logistical aid from Silla. The Tang established the Andong Protectorate on former Goguryeo lands after the latter&#x27;s fall.

However, there was much resistance to Tang rule (fanned by Silla, which was displeased that Tang did not give it Goguryeo or Baekje&#x27;s territory), and in 669, following Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s order, a part of the Goguryeo people were forced to move to the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, as well as the regions south of the Qinling Mountains and west of Chang&#x27;an, only leaving old and weak inhabitants in the original land. Over 200,000 prisoners from Goguryeo were taken by the Tang forces and sent to Chang&#x27;an. Some people entered the service of the Tang government, such as Go Sagye and his son Gao Xianzhi (Go Seonji in Korean), the famed general who commanded the Tang forces at the Battle of Talas.

Silla thus unified most of the Korean peninsula in 668, but the kingdom&#x27;s reliance on China&#x27;s Tang dynasty had its price. Tang set up the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, governed by Xue Rengui, but faced increasing problems ruling the former inhabitants of Goguryeo, as well as Silla&#x27;s resistance to Tang&#x27;s remaining presence on the Korean Peninsula. Silla had to forcibly resist the imposition of Chinese rule over the entire peninsula, which lead to the Silla–Tang Wars, but their own strength did not extend beyond the Taedong River. Although the Tang forces were expelled from territories south of Taedong River, Silla failed to regain the former Goguryeo territories north of the Taedong River, which were now under Tang dominion.

====Revival movements====

After the fall of Goguryeo in 668, many Goguryeo people rebelled against the Tang and Silla by starting Goguryeo revival movements. Among these were Geom Mojam, Dae Jung-sang, and several famous generals. The Tang dynasty tried but failed to establish several commanderies to rule over the area.

In 677, Tang crowned Bojang as the &quot;King of Joseon&quot; and put him in charge of the Liaodong commandery of the Protectorate General to Pacify the East. However, Bojang continued to foment rebellions against Tang in an attempt to revive Goguryeo, organizing Goguryeo refugees and allying with the Mohe tribes. He was eventually exiled to Sichuan in 681, and died the following year.

The Protectorate General to Pacify the East was installed by the Tang government to rule and keep control over the former territories of the fallen Goguryeo. It was first put under the control of Tang General Xue Rengui, but was later replaced by Bojang due to the negative responses of the Goguryeo people. Bojang was sent into exile for assisting Goguryeo revival movements, but was succeeded by his descendants. Bojang&#x27;s descendants declared independence from Tang during the same period as the An Lushan Rebellion and Li Zhengji (Yi Jeong-gi in Korean)&#x27;s rebellion in Shandong. The Protectorate General to Pacify the East was renamed &quot;Little Goguryeo&quot; until its eventual absorption into Balhae under the reign of Seon.

Geom Mojam and Anseung rose briefly at the Han Fortress (한성, 漢城, in modern Chaeryong, South Hwanghae), but failed, when Anseung surrendered to Silla. Go Anseung ordered the assassination of Geom Mojam, and defected to Silla, where he was given a small amount of land to rule over. There, Anseung established the State of Bodeok (), incited a rebellion, which was promptly crushed by Sinmun. Anseung was then forced to reside in the Silla capital, given a Silla bride and had to adopt the Silla royal surname of &quot;Kim.&quot;

Dae Jung-sang and his son Dae Jo-yeong, either a former Goguryeo general or a Mohe chief, regained most of Goguryeo&#x27;s northern land after its downfall in 668, established the Kingdom of Jin (), which was renamed to Balhae after 713. To the south of Balhae, Silla controlled the Korean peninsula south of the Taedong River, and Manchuria (now northeastern China) was conquered by Balhae. Balhae considered itself (particularly in diplomatic correspondence with Japan) a successor state of Goguryeo.

In 901, the general Gung Ye rebelled against Later Silla and founded Later Goguryeo (renamed to Taebong in 911), which considered itself to be a successor of Goguryeo. Later Goguryeo originated in the northern regions, including Songak (modern Kaesong), which were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees. Later Goguryeo&#x27;s original capital was established in Songak, the hometown of Wang Geon, a prominent general under Gung Ye. Wang Geon was a descendant of Goguryeo and traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. In 918, Wang Geon overthrew Gung Ye and established Goryeo, as the successor of Goguryeo, and laid claim to Manchuria as Goryeo&#x27;s rightful legacy. Wang Geon unified the Later Three Kingdoms in 936, and Goryeo ruled the Korean Peninsula until 1392.

In the 10th century, Balhae collapsed and much of its ruling class and the last crown prince Dae Gwang-hyeon fled to Goryeo. The Balhae refugees were warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, who felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo.

==Government==
Early Goguryeo was a federation of five tribes, which later turned into five districts. As the autonomy of these five tribal collectives waned, regional officers were appointed with valley as a unit.As Goguryeo progressed into the 4th century, a regional administration unit arose that centred around fortresses that were built in the newly enlarged areas. From the 4th century to the early 6th century, The gun (roughly translated as counties) system began to be established in most of the regions controlled by Goguryeo, though not all, evidenced by the existence of 16 counties near the Han river and the nickname of a military post called Malyak, nicknamed the gundu (roughly translated as the head of county). The gun subdivision had sub subdivisions which was either a seong (fortress) or chon (village). The official that was governing the whole county was called a susa, though its names changed to Yoksal, Choryogunji and Rucho. Yoksal and Choryogunji had both military and civil capabilities, and its residence often assigned inside fortresses.

==Military==
Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state. Goguryeo has been described as an empire by Korean scholars. Initially, there were four partially autonomous districts based on the cardinal directions, and a central district led by the monarch; however, in the first century the cardinal districts became centralized and administered by the central district, and by the end of the 3rd century, they lost all political and military authority to the monarch. In the 4th century, after suffering defeats against the Xianbei and Baekje during the reign of Gogukwon, Sosurim instituted military reforms that paved the way for Gwanggaeto&#x27;s conquests. During its height, Goguryeo was able to mobilize 300,000 troops. Goguryeo often enlisted semi-nomadic vassals, such as the Mohe people, as foot soldiers. Every man in Goguryeo was required to serve in the military, or could avoid conscription by paying extra grain tax. A Tang treatise of 668 records a total of 675,000 displaced personnel and 176 military garrisons after the surrender of Bojang.

===Equipment===
The main projectile weapon used in Goguryeo was the bow. The bows were modified to be more composite and increase throwing ability on par with crossbows. To a lesser extent, stone-throwing machines and crossbows were also used. Polearms, used against the cavalry and in open order, were mostly spears. Two types of swords were used by Goguryeo warriors. The first was a shorter double-edged variant mostly used for throwing. The other was longer single-edged sword with minimal hilt and ring pommel, of eastern Han influence. The helmets were similar to helmets used by Central Asian peoples, decorated with wings, leathers and horsetails. The shield was the main protection, which covered most of the soldier&#x27;s body. Goguryeo would likely have been the earliest Korean state to incorporate horses into combat, and artifacts like wall paintings indicate that horses and soldiers alike wore armor. Scholars and archaeologists posit that contemporary Korean and Japanese adversaries first encountered fortified Goguryeo mounted troops between the fourth and fifth centuries CE. The cavalry were called &quot;Gaemamusa&quot; (), and similar in type to the Cataphract.

====Hwandudaedo====
Goguryeo used a sword called Hwandudaedo. It looks like the sword drawing in the following picture which is 2000 years old from an old Goguryeo tomb. As Korean swords changed from Bronze Age to Iron Age, the sword shapes changed. There are many archaeological finds on ancient Korean iron swords particularly the swords with a ring at the end.

===Fortifications===
The most common form of the Goguryeo fortress was one made in the shape of the moon, located between a river and its tributary. Ditches and ground walls between the shores formed an extra defense line. The walls were extensive in their length, and they were constructed from huge stone blocks fixed with clay, and even Chinese artillery had difficulty to break through them. Walls were surrounded by a ditch to prevent an underground attack, and equipped with guard towers. All fortresses had sources of water and enough equipment for a protracted siege. If rivers and mountains were absent, extra defense lines were added.

===Organization===
Two hunts per year, led by the king himself, maneuvers exercises, hunt-maneuvers and parades were conducted to give the Goguryeo soldier a high level of individual training.

There were five armies in the capital, mostly cavalry that were personally led by the king, numbering approximately 12,500. Military units varied in number from 21,000 to 36,000 soldiers, were located in the provinces, and were led by the governors. Military colonies near the boundaries consisted mostly of soldiers and peasants. There were also private armies held by aristocrats. This system allowed Goguryeo to maintain and utilize an army of 50,000 without added expense, and 300,000 through large mobilization in special cases.

Goguryeo units were divided according to major weapons: spearmen, axemen, archers composed of those on foot and horseback, and heavy cavalry that included armored and heavy spear divisions. Other groups like the catapult units, wall-climbers, and storm units were part of the special units and were added to the common. The advantage of this functional division is highly specialized combat units, while the disadvantage is that it was impossible for one unit to make complex, tactical actions.

===Strategy===
The military formation had the general and his staff with guards in the middle of the army. The archers were defended by axemen. In front of the general were the main infantry forces, and on the flanks were rows of heavy cavalry ready to counterattack in case of a flank attack by the enemy. In the very front and rear was the light cavalry, used for intelligence, pursuit, and for weakening the enemy&#x27;s strike. Around the main troops were small groups of heavy cavalrymen and infantry. Each unit was prepared to defend the other by providing mutual support.

Goguryeo implemented a strategy of active defense based on cities. Besides the walled cities and fortified camps, this &quot;active defense&quot; system used small units of light cavalry to continuously harass the enemy, de-blockade units and strong reserves, consisting of the best soldiers, to strike hard at the end.

Goguryeo also employed military intelligence and special tactics as an important part of the strategy. Goguryeo was good at disinformation, such as sending only stone spearheads as tribute to the Chinese court when they were in the Iron Age. Goguryeo had developed its system of espionage. One of the most famous spies, &quot;Baekseok&quot;, mentioned in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, was able to infiltrate the Hwarangs of Silla.

==Foreign relations==
The militaristic nature of Goguryeo frequently drew them into conflicts with the dynasties of China. In the times when they are not in war with China, Goguryeo occasionally sent tributes to some of the Chinese dynasties as a form of trade and nonaggression pact. Like Buyeo before it, Goguryeo alternately offered tribute to and raided China. These activities of exchange promoted cultural and religious flow from China into the Korean peninsula. Goguryeo has also received tribute from other Korean kingdoms and neighboring tribal states, and frequently mobilized Malgal people in their military. Baekje and Goguryeo maintained their regional rivalry throughout their history, although they eventually formed an alliance in their wars against Silla and Tang.

==Culture==

The culture of Goguryeo was shaped by its climate, religion, and the tense society that people dealt with due to the numerous wars Goguryeo waged.

The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (Volume 81) recorded: &quot;The customs, laws and clothes of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla are generally identical.&quot;

Attributed with the earliest kimchi, the Goguryeo people were skilled at fermenting and widely consumed fermented food.

Singing and dancing played an important part in Goguryeo society, a legacy that, according to Kim Hunggyu, continues to this day in modern Korean society.

The practice of matrilocality in Korea started in the Goguryeo period, continued through the Goryeo period and ended in the early Joseon period. The Korean saying that when a man gets married, he is &quot;entering &quot;jangga&quot;&quot; (the house of his father-in-law), stems from the Goguryeo period.

Goguryeo held an annual national &quot;seokjeon&quot; (stone battle) attended by the king himself. Originally a product of the warlike Goguryeo period, &quot;seokjeon&quot; gradually evolved into a widely enjoyed pastime during the more peaceful Goryeo and Joseon periods.

The Korean tradition of mothers eating seaweed after birth originated in Goguryeo. The Korean word for seaweed, &quot;miyeok&quot;, originated in Goguryeo.

===Goguryeo tombs===

The tombs of Goguryeo display the prosperity and artistry of the kingdom of the period. The murals inside many of the tombs are significant evidence of Goguryeo&#x27;s lifestyle, ceremonies, warfare and architecture. Mostly tombs were founded in Ji&#x27;an in China&#x27;s Jilin province, Taedong river basin near Pyongyang, North Korea and the Anak area in South Hwanghae province of North Korea. There are over 10,000 Goguryeo tombs overall, but only about 90 of those unearthed in China and North Korea have wall paintings. In 2004, Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom located in Ji&#x27;an of Jilin Province of China and Complex of Koguryo Tombs located in North Korea became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Lifestyle===
The inhabitants of Goguryeo wore a predecessor of the modern hanbok, just as the other cultures of the three kingdoms. There are murals and artifacts that depict dancers wearing elaborate white dresses.

===Festivals and pastimes===
Common pastimes among Goguryeo people were drinking, singing, or dancing. Games such as wrestling attracted curious spectators.

Every October, the Dongmaeng Festival was held. The Dongmaeng Festival was practiced to worship the gods. The ceremonies were followed by huge celebratory feasts, games, and other activities. Often, the king performed rites to his ancestors.

Hunting was a male activity and also served as an appropriate means to train young men for the military. Hunting parties rode on horses and hunted deer and other game with bows-and-arrows. Archery contests also occurred.

=== Religion ===
Goguryeo people worshipped ancestors and considered them to be supernatural. Jumong, the founder of Goguryeo, was worshipped and respected among the people. There was even a temple in Pyongyang dedicated to Jumong. At the annual Dongmaeng Festival, a religious rite was performed for Jumong, ancestors, and gods.

Mythical beasts and animals were also considered to be sacred in Goguryeo. The Fenghuang and Loong were both worshipped, while the Sanzuwu, the three-legged crow that represented the sun, was considered the most powerful of the three. Paintings of mythical beasts exist in Goguryeo king tombs today.

They also believed in the &#x27;Sasin&#x27;, which were 4 mythical animals. Chungryong or Chunryonga (blue dragon) guarded the east, baek-ho (white tiger) guarded the west, jujak (red phoenix (bird)) guarded the south, and hyunmu (black turtle, sometimes with snakes for a tail) guarded the north.

Buddhism was first introduced to Goguryeo in 372. The government recognized and encouraged the teachings of Buddhism and many monasteries and shrines were created during Goguryeo&#x27;s rule, making Goguryeo the first kingdom in the region to adopt Buddhism. However, Buddhism was much more popular in Silla and Baekje, which Goguryeo passed Buddhism to.

Buddhism, a religion originating in what is now India, was transmitted to Korea via China in the late 4th century. The Samguk yusa records the following 3 monks among first to bring the Buddhist teaching, or Dharma, to Korea: Malananta (late 4th century) – an Indian Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to Baekje in the southern Korean peninsula, Sundo – a Chinese monk who brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea, and Ado monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in central Korea.

&quot;Xian&quot; and Taoists seeking to become immortals were thought to aid in fortune telling and divination about the future.

===Cultural legacy===

As the Three Kingdoms period emerged, each Korean state sought ideologies that could validate their authority. Many of these states borrowed influences from Chinese culture, sharing a writing system that was originally based on Chinese characters. However the language was different and not mutually intelligible with Chinese. An integral part of Goguryeo&#x27;s culture, along with other Korean states, was Korean shamanism. In the 4th century, Buddhism gained wide prominence in Baekje and spread rapidly across the peninsula. Buddhism struck a careful balance between shamanism, the Korean people, and the rulers over these states, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms. Buddhism&#x27;s foothold in the Korean peninsula would surge up to the Goryeo period and would spread rapidly into Yamato Japan, playing a key role in the neighboring state&#x27;s development and its relations with the Korean peninsula.

In Baekje, King Onjo founded the kingdom and according to legend, he is the third son of Jumong of Goguryeo and the younger brother of King Yuri, Goguryeo&#x27;s second king. The Korean Kingdoms of Balhae and Goryeo regarded themselves as successors to Goguryeo, recognized by Tang China and Yamato Japan.

Goguryeo art, preserved largely in tomb paintings, is noted for the vigour and fine detail of its imagery. Many of the art pieces have an original style of painting, depicting various traditions that have continued throughout Korea&#x27;s history.

Cultural legacies of Goguryeo are found in modern Korean culture, for example: Korean fortress, ssireum, taekkyeon, Korean dance, ondol (Goguryeo&#x27;s floor heating system) and the hanbok.

==Legacy==
Remains of walled towns, fortresses, palaces, tombs, and artifacts have been found in North Korea and Manchuria, including ancient paintings in a Goguryeo tomb complex in Pyongyang. Some ruins are also still visible in present-day China, for example at Wunü Mountain, suspected to be the site of Jolbon fortress, near Huanren in Liaoning province on the present border with North Korea. Ji&#x27;an is also home to a large collection of Goguryeo era tombs, including what Chinese scholars consider to be the tombs of Gwanggaeto and his son Jangsu, as well as perhaps the best-known Goguryeo artifact, the Gwanggaeto Stele, which is one of the primary sources for pre-5th-century Goguryeo history.

===World Heritage Site===
UNESCO added Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom in present-day China and Complex of Koguryo Tombs in present-day North Korea to the World Heritage Sites in 2004.

===Name===
The modern English name &quot;Korea&quot; derives from Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ) (918–1392), which regarded itself as the legitimate successor of Goguryeo. The name Goryeo was first used during the reign of Jangsu in the 5th century. Goguryeo is also referred to as Goryeo after 520 AD in Chinese and Japanese historical and diplomatic sources.

== Language ==
There have been some academic attempts to reconstruct the Goguryeo words based on the fragments of toponyms, recorded in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, of the areas once possessed by Goguryeo. However, the reliability of the toponyms as linguistic evidence is still in dispute. The linguistic classification of the language is difficult due to the lack of historical sources. The most cited source, a body of placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, has been interpreted by different authors as Koreanic, Japonic, or an intermediate between the two. Lee and Ramsey also look broadly to include Altaic and/or Tungusic.

Chinese records suggest that the languages of Goguryeo, Buyeo, East Okjeo, and Gojoseon were similar, while they differed from that of the Malgal (Mohe).

==Controversies==
Goguryeo was viewed as a Korean kingdom in premodern China, but in modern times, there is a dispute between China and Korea over whether Goguryeo can be considered part of Chinese history or if it is part of Korean history.

In 2002, Chinese government started a five-year research project on the history and current situation of the frontiers of Northeast China which lasted from 2002 to 2007. It was launched by the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) and received financial support from both the Chinese government and the CASS.

The stated purpose of the Northeast Project was to use authoritative academic research to restore historical facts and protect the stability of Northeast China—a region sometimes known as Manchuria—in the context of the strategic changes that have taken place in Northeast Asia since China&#x27;s &quot;Reform and Opening&quot; started in 1978. Two of the project&#x27;s leaders accused some foreign scholars and institutions of rewriting history to demand territory from China or to promote instability in the frontier regions, hence the necessity of the Project.

The Project has been criticized for applying the contemporary vision of China as a &quot;unified multiethnic state&quot; to ancient ethnic groups, states and history of the region of Manchuria and northern Korea. According to this idea, there was a greater Chinese state in the ancient past. Accordingly, any pre-modern people or state that occupied any part of what is now the People&#x27;s Republic of China is defined as having been part of Chinese history. Similar projects have been conducted on Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang, which have been named North Project, Southwest Project and Xinjiang Project respectively.

Due to its claims on Gojoseon, Goguryeo and Balhae, the project sparked disputes with Korea. In 2004, this dispute threatened to lead to diplomatic disputes between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and South Korea, although all governments involved seem to exhibit no desire to see the issue damage relations.

In 2004, the Chinese government made a diplomatic compromise, pledging not to place claims to the history of Goguryeo in its history textbooks. However, online discussion regarding this topic among the general public has since increased. The Internet has provided a platform for a broadening participation in the discussion of Goguryeo in both South Korea and China. Thomas Chase points out that despite the growing online discussion on this subject, this has not led to a more objective treatment of this history, nor a more critical evaluation of its relationship to national identity.

<text>The Pilgrimage Church of Wies () is an oval Rococo church, designed in the late 1740s by brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann, the latter of whom lived nearby for the last eleven years of his life. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany. Because of its outstanding rococo architecture, the &quot;Wieskirche&quot; was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983.

== History and description ==
It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. The legend of this miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. &quot;Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form&quot;. 

There is a popular belief that the Bavarian government planned to sell or demolish the rococo masterpiece during the secularization of Bavaria at the beginning of the 19th century, and that only protests from the local farmers saved it from destruction. Available sources, however, document that the responsible state commission clearly advocated the continuation of Wies as a pilgrimage site, even in spite of economic objections from the abbot of Steingaden. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site. The church underwent extensive restoration between 1985 and 1991.

The Wieskirche has an oval plan, with a semi-circular narthex. Inside, twin columns in front of the walls support the elaborate cornice, with elaborate stucco decorations (painted by J. B. Zimmerman) and a long, deep choir. The ceilings are painted in a trompe-l&#x27;œil style, appearing to open up to an iridescent sky.

<doc id="173276" wikidata="Q64365" url="?curid=173276" title="Bonsai">
<text>Bonsai (; , ) is the Japanese art of growing and shaping miniature trees in containers, with a long documented history of influences and native Japanese development over a thousand years, and with unique aesthetics, cultural history, and terminology derived from its evolution in Japan. Similar arts exist in other cultures, including Korea&#x27;s &quot;bunjae&quot;, the Chinese art of &quot;penjing&quot;, and the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese .

The loanword &quot;bonsai&quot; has become an umbrella term in English, attached to many forms of diminutive potted plants, and also on occasion to other living and non-living things. According to Stephen Orr in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[i]n the West, the word is used to describe virtually all miniature container trees, whether they are authentically trained bonsai or just small rooted cuttings. Technically, though, the term should be reserved for plants that are grown in shallow containers following the precise tenets of bonsai pruning and training, resulting in an artful miniature replica of a full-grown tree in nature.&quot; In the most definitive sense, &quot;bonsai&quot; refers to miniaturized, container-grown trees adhering to Japanese bonsai tradition and principles.

Purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation for the viewer, and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity for the grower. In contrast to other plant cultivation practices, bonsai are not grown for the production of food or for medicine.

A bonsai is created beginning with a specimen of source material. This may be a cutting, seedling, a tree from the wild (known as &quot;yamadori&quot;) or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles or aged-looking bark, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai.

The source specimen is shaped to be relatively small and to meet the aesthetic standards of bonsai, which emphasizes not the entirety of a landscape but the unique form of a specimen bonsai tree or trees. When the candidate bonsai nears its planned final size, it is planted in a display pot, usually one designed for bonsai display in one of a few accepted shapes and proportions. From that point forward, its growth is restricted by the pot environment. Throughout the year, the bonsai is shaped to limit growth, redistribute foliar vigor to areas requiring further development, and meet the artist&#x27;s detailed design.

The practice of bonsai is sometimes confused with dwarfing, but dwarfing generally refers to research, discovery, or creation of plants that are permanent, genetic miniatures of existing species. Plant dwarfing often uses selective breeding or genetic engineering to create dwarf cultivars. Bonsai does not require genetically-dwarfed trees but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-size trees.

==History==
===Early versions===

The Japanese art of bonsai is believed to have originated from &quot;bonkei&quot; (, &quot;penjing&quot; in Chinese) introduced from China. In the Tang Dynasty, there was the art of representing natural scenery with plants and stones in a tray

At that time, the term &quot;bonkei&quot; (&quot;penjing&quot;) was not yet used in China or Japan. Instead, the term &quot;penchi&quot; (, ) was used in the Tang Dynasty. &quot;Penchi&quot; is a water tray in which water plants such as lotus and rice are planted.

In Japan, the term &quot;kazan&quot; (, , later &quot;bonsan&quot;) was used. In Japan&#x27;s Shōsōin, an incomplete specimen of a &quot;kazan&quot;, in which modeled beaches and mountains fashioned from wood are decorated with small trees of silver metal, can be found today. A miniature lotus pond made of wood and gilt bronze has also been handed down in the Shōsōin. In this way, there were already &quot;bonsan&quot;-like works in Japan during the Nara period (710-794), in which natural scenery was represented in a reduced scale.
In the Heian period (794-1185), &quot;suhama&quot; (, ), which expressed a beautiful landscape with plants and trees (often made of artificial materials) and accessories to match the title of a waka poem, were exhibited at poetry contests and competed with each other. &quot;Suhama&quot; is similar to &quot;bonkei&quot;, but expresses a uniquely Japanese scene of white sand and green pine trees on a tray with legs that imitate a sandy beach. Later, it came to be called &quot;shimadai&quot; (, ), and has been passed down to the present as a wedding ornament.
In the medieval period, recognizable bonsai were portrayed in handscroll paintings like the &quot;Ippen Shōnin Eden&quot; (, 1299). The 1195 scroll &quot;Saigyo Monogatari Emaki&quot; ( is the earliest known to depict dwarfed potted trees in Japan. Wooden tray and dish-like pots with dwarf landscapes on modern-looking wooden shelves also appear in the 1309 &quot;Kasuga Gongen Genki E&quot; (, Legends of Kasuga Shrine) scroll. Dwarf trees displayed on short poles are portrayed in the 1351 &quot;Boki Ekotoba&quot; scroll. Several other scrolls and paintings also include depictions of these kinds of trees.

A close relationship between Japan&#x27;s Zen Buddhism and the potted trees began to shape bonsai reputation and aesthetics, which were introduced to Japan from China. In this period, Chinese Chan (pronounced &quot;Zen&quot; in Japanese) Buddhist monks taught at Japan&#x27;s monasteries. One of the monks&#x27; activities was to introduce political leaders to various arts of miniature landscapes as admirable accomplishments for men of taste and learning. Potted landscape arrangements up to this period included miniature figurines after the Chinese fashion. Japanese artists eventually adopted a simpler style for bonsai, increasing focus on the tree by removing miniatures and other decorations, and using smaller, plainer pots.

Around the 14th century, the term for dwarf potted trees was . This indicated use of a fairly deep pot rather than the shallow pot denoted by the eventual term &quot;bonsai&quot;. is also the title of a circa 1383 noh play by Zeami Motokiyo, based on a story about an impoverished samurai who burns his last three potted trees as firewood to warm a traveling monk. The monk is a disguised official who later rewards the samurai for his actions. In later centuries, woodblock prints by several artists depicted this popular drama. There was even a fabric design of the same name. Through these and other popular media, bonsai became known to a broad Japanese population.

Bonsai cultivation reached a high level of expertise in this period. Bonsai dating to the 17th century have survived to the present. One of the oldest-known living bonsai trees, considered one of the National Treasures of Japan, can be seen in the Tokyo Imperial Palace collection. A five-needle pine (&quot;Pinus pentaphylla&quot; var. &quot;negishi&quot;) known as &quot;Sandai Shogun&quot; (, the third shogun) is documented as having been cared for by Tokugawa Iemitsu. The tree is thought to be at least 500 years old and was trained as a bonsai by 1610.

By the end of the 18th century, bonsai cultivation in Japan was becoming widespread and began to interest the general public. In the Tenmei era (1781–88), an exhibit of traditional dwarf potted pines began to be held every year in Kyoto. Connoisseurs from five provinces and neighboring areas would bring one or two plants each to the show in order to submit them to visitors for ranking.

===Classical period===
In Japan after 1800, bonsai began to move from being the esoteric practice of a few specialists to becoming a widely popular art form and hobby. In Itami, Hyōgo, Japanese scholars of Chinese arts gathered in the early 19th century to discuss recent styles in the art of miniature trees. Many terms and concepts adopted by this group were derived from the (&quot;Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden&quot; in English; in Japanese). The Japanese version of potted trees, which had been previously called or other terms, were renamed &quot;bonsai&quot;. This word connoted a shallow container, not a deeper bowl style. The term &quot;bonsai&quot;, however, would not become broadly used in describing Japan&#x27;s dwarf potted trees for nearly a century.

The popularity of bonsai began to grow outside the limited scope of scholars and the nobility. On October 13, 1868, the Meiji Emperor moved to his new capital in Tokyo. Bonsai were displayed both inside and outside Meiji Palace, and those placed in the grand setting of the Imperial Palace had to be &quot;Giant Bonsai&quot;, large enough to fill the grand space. The Meiji Emperor encouraged interest in bonsai, which broadened its importance and appeal to his government&#x27;s professional staff.

New books, magazines, and public exhibitions made bonsai more accessible to the Japanese populace. An Artistic Bonsai Concours was held in Tokyo in 1892, followed by publication of a three-volume commemorative picture book. This event demonstrated a new tendency to see bonsai as an independent art form. In 1903, the Tokyo association Jurakukai held showings of bonsai and ikebana at two Japanese-style restaurants. In 1906, &quot;Bonsai Gaho&quot; became the first monthly magazine on the subject. It was followed by &quot;Toyo Engei&quot; and &quot;Hana&quot; in 1907. The initial issue of &quot;Bonsai&quot; magazine was published in 1921, and this influential periodical ran for 518 consecutive issues.
Bonsai shaping aesthetics, techniques, and tools became increasingly sophisticated as bonsai popularity grew in Japan. In 1910, shaping with wire rather than the older string, rope, and burlap techniques, appeared in the Sanyu-en Bonsai-Dan (History of Bonsai in the Sanyu nursery). Zinc-galvanized steel wire was initially used. Expensive copper wire was used only for selected trees that had real potential. In the 1920s and 1930s, toolsmith Masakuni I (1880–1950) helped design and produce the first steel tools specifically made for the developing requirements of bonsai styling. This included the concave cutter, a branch cutter designed to leave a shallow indentation on the trunk when a branch was removed. Properly treated, this indentation would fill over with live tree tissue and bark over time, greatly reducing or eliminating the usual pruning scar.

Prior to World War II, international interest in bonsai was fueled by increased trade in trees and the appearance of books in popular foreign languages. By 1914, the first national annual bonsai show was held (an event repeated annually through 1933) in Tokyo&#x27;s Hibiya Park. Another great annual public exhibition of trees began in 1927 at the Asahi Newspaper Hall in Tokyo. Beginning in 1934, the prestigious Kokufu-ten annual exhibitions were held in Tokyo&#x27;s Ueno Park. The first major book on the subject in English was published in the Japanese capital: &quot;Dwarf Trees (Bonsai)&quot; by Shinobu Nozaki.

By 1940, about 300 bonsai dealers worked in Tokyo. Some 150 species of trees were being cultivated, and thousands of specimens were shipped annually to Europe and America. The first bonsai nurseries and clubs in the Americas were started by first and second-generation Japanese immigrants. Though this progress to international markets and enthusiasts was interrupted by the war, by the 1940s bonsai had become an art form of international interest and involvement.

===Modern bonsai===
Following World War II, several trends made the Japanese tradition of bonsai increasingly accessible to Western and world audiences. One key trend was the increase in the number, scope, and prominence of bonsai exhibitions. For example, the Kokufu-ten bonsai displays reappeared in 1947 after a four-year cancellation and became annual affairs. These displays continue to this day and are by invitation only for eight days in February. In October 1964, a great exhibition was held in Hibya Park by the private Kokufu Bonsai Association, reorganized into the Nippon Bonsai Association, to mark the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

A large display of bonsai and suiseki was held as part of Expo &#x27;70, and formal discussion was made of an international association of enthusiasts. In 1975, the first gafu-ten (elegant-style exhibit) of &quot;shohin&quot; bonsai (13–25 cm or 5–10 in tall) was held. So was the first sakufu-ten (creative bonsai exhibit), the only event in which professional bonsai growers exhibit traditional trees under their own names rather than under the name of the owner.

The first World Bonsai Convention was held in Osaka during the World Bonsai and Suiseki Exhibition in 1980. Nine years later, a series of World Bonsai Conventions was launched by the newly-formed World Bonsai Friendship Federation (WBFF) in Omiya. These conventions attracted several hundreds of participants from dozens of countries and have since been held every four years at different locations around the globe: 1993, Orlando, Florida; 1997, Seoul, Korea; 2001, Munich, Germany; 2005, Washington, D.C.; 2009, San Juan, Puerto Rico; 2013, Jitan, Jiangsu, China; 2017, Saitama, Saitama, Japan; and 2022&#x27;s virtual convention in Perth, Australia, which replaced the one originally scheduled a year earlier but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, Japan continues to host regular exhibitions with the world&#x27;s largest numbers of bonsai specimens and the highest recognized specimen quality.

Another key trend was the increase in books on bonsai and related arts, being published for the first time in English and other languages for audiences outside of Japan. In 1952, Yuji Yoshimura, the son of a Japanese bonsai community leader, collaborated with German diplomat and author Alfred Koehn to give bonsai demonstrations. Koehn had been an enthusiast before the war, and his 1937 book &quot;Japanese Tray Landscapes&quot; had been published in English in Beijing. Yoshimura&#x27;s 1957 book &quot;The Art of Bonsai&quot;, written in English with his student Giovanna M. Halford, went on to be called the &quot;classic Japanese bonsai bible for westerners&quot; with over thirty printings.
The related art of saikei was introduced to English-speaking audiences in 1963 in Kawamoto and Kurihara&#x27;s book &quot;Bonsai-Saikei&quot;. This book describes tray landscapes made with younger plant material than was traditionally used in bonsai, providing an alternative to the use of large, older plants, few of which had escaped war damage.

A third trend was the increasing availability of expert bonsai training, at first only in Japan, and then more widely. In 1967, the first group of Westerners studied at an Ōmiya nursery. Returning to the U.S., they established the American Bonsai Society. Other groups and individuals from outside Asia then visited and studied at the various Japanese nurseries, occasionally even apprenticing under the masters. These visitors brought back to their local clubs the latest techniques and styles, which were then further disseminated. Japanese teachers also traveled widely, bringing hands-on bonsai expertise to all six continents.

The final trend supporting world involvement in bonsai is the widening availability of specialized bonsai plant stock, soil components, tools, pots, and other accessory items. Bonsai nurseries in Japan advertise and ship specimen bonsai worldwide. Most countries have local nurseries providing plant stock as well. Japanese bonsai soil components, such as Akadama clay, are available worldwide, and suppliers also provide similar local materials in many locations. Specialized bonsai tools are widely available from Japanese and Chinese sources. Potters around the globe provide material to hobbyists and specialists in many countries.

Bonsai has now reached a worldwide audience. There are over fourteen hundred books on bonsai and the related arts in at least twenty-eight languages available in over one-hundred-and-ten countries and territories. A few dozen magazines in over thirteen languages are in print. Several score of club newsletters are available online, and there are at least that many discussion forums and blogs. There are at least a hundred thousand enthusiasts in some fifteen hundred clubs and associations worldwide, as well as over five million unassociated hobbyists. Plant material from every location is being trained into bonsai and displayed at local, regional, national, and international conventions and exhibitions for enthusiasts and the general public.

==Cultivation and care==


===Material sources===
All bonsai start with a specimen of source material, a plant that the grower wishes to train into bonsai form. Bonsai practice is an unusual form of plant cultivation in that growth from seeds is rarely used to obtain source material. To display the characteristic aged appearance of a bonsai within a reasonable time, the source plant is often mature or at least partially grown when the bonsai creator begins work. Sources of bonsai material include:
* &quot;Propagation&quot; from a source tree through cuttings or layering.
* &quot;Nursery stock&quot; directly from a nursery, or from a garden centre or similar resale establishment.
* &quot;Commercial bonsai growers&quot;, which, in general, sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already.
* &quot;Collecting&quot; suitable bonsai material in its original wild situation, successfully moving it, and replanting it in a container for development as bonsai. These trees are called yamadori and are often the most expensive and prized of all bonsai.

===Techniques===

The practice of bonsai development incorporates a number of techniques either unique to bonsai or, if used in other forms of cultivation, applied in unusual ways that are particularly suitable to the bonsai domain. These techniques include:
* &quot;Leaf trimming&quot;, the selective removal of leaves (for most varieties of deciduous tree) or needles (for coniferous trees and some others) from a bonsai&#x27;s trunk and branches.
* &quot;Pruning&quot; the trunk, branches, and roots of the candidate tree.
* &quot;Wiring&quot; branches and trunks allows the bonsai designer to create the desired general form and make detailed branch and leaf placements.
* &quot;Clamping&quot; using mechanical devices for shaping trunks and branches; bending of branches or trunks may also be achieved by the use of tension cables or guy-wires.
* &quot;Grafting&quot; new growing material (typically a bud, branch, or root) into a prepared area on the trunk or under the bark of the tree.
* &quot;Defoliation&quot;, which can provide short-term dwarfing of foliage for certain deciduous species.
* &quot;Deadwood bonsai techniques&quot; such as &quot;jin&quot; and &quot;shari&quot; simulate age and maturity in a bonsai.

==Aesthetics==
Bonsai aesthetics are the aesthetic goals characterizing the Japanese tradition of growing an artistically shaped miniature tree in a container. Many Japanese cultural characteristics, in particular the influence of Zen Buddhism and the expression of &quot;wabi-sabi&quot;, inform the bonsai tradition in Japan. Established art forms that share some aesthetic principles with bonsai include penjing and saikei. A number of other cultures around the globe have adopted the Japanese aesthetic approach to bonsai, and, while some variations have begun to appear, most hew closely to the rules and design philosophies of the Japanese tradition.

Over centuries of practice, the Japanese bonsai aesthetic has encoded some important techniques and design guidelines. Like the aesthetic rules that govern, for example, Western common practice period music, bonsai&#x27;s guidelines help practitioners work within an established tradition with some assurance of success. Simply following the guidelines alone will not guarantee a successful result. Nevertheless, these design rules can rarely be broken without reducing the impact of the bonsai specimen. Some key principles in bonsai aesthetics include:
* &quot;Miniaturization&quot;: By definition, a bonsai is a tree kept small enough to be container-grown while otherwise fostered to have a mature appearance.
* &quot;Proportion among elements&quot;: The most prized proportions mimic those of a full-grown tree as closely as possible. Small trees with large leaves or needles are out of proportion and are avoided, as is a thin trunk with thick branches.
* &quot;Asymmetry&quot;: Bonsai aesthetics discourage strict radial or bilateral symmetry in branch and root placement.
* &quot;No trace of the artist&quot;: The designer&#x27;s touch must not be apparent to the viewer. If a branch is removed in shaping the tree, the scar will be concealed. Likewise, wiring should be removed or at least concealed when the bonsai is shown, and must leave no permanent marks on the branch or bark.
* &quot;Poignancy&quot;: Many of the formal rules of bonsai help the grower create a tree that expresses Wabi-sabi, or portrays an aspect of &quot;mono no aware&quot;.

==Display==
A bonsai display presents one or more bonsai specimens in a way that allows a viewer to see all the important features of the bonsai from the most advantageous position. That position emphasizes the bonsai&#x27;s defined &quot;front&quot;, which is designed into all bonsai. It places the bonsai at a height that allows the viewer to imagine the bonsai as a full-size tree seen from a distance, siting the bonsai neither so low that the viewer appears to be hovering in the sky above it nor so high that the viewer appears to be looking up at the tree from beneath the ground. Noted bonsai writer Peter Adams recommends that bonsai be shown as if &quot;in an art gallery: at the right height; in isolation; against a plain background, devoid of all redundancies such as labels and vulgar little accessories.&quot;

For outdoor displays, there are few aesthetic rules. Many outdoor displays are semi-permanent, with the bonsai trees in place for weeks or months at a time. To avoid damaging the trees, therefore, an outdoor display must not impede the amount of sunlight needed for the trees on display, must support watering, and may also have to block excessive wind or precipitation. As a result of these practical constraints, outdoor displays are often rustic in style, with simple wood or stone components. A common design is the bench, sometimes with sections at different heights to suit different sizes of bonsai, along which bonsai are placed in a line. Where space allows, outdoor bonsai specimens are spaced far enough apart that the viewer can concentrate on one at a time. When the trees are too close to each other, aesthetic discord between adjacent trees of different sizes or styles can confuse the viewer, a problem addressed by exhibition displays.

Exhibition displays allow many bonsai to be displayed in a temporary exhibition format, typically indoors, as would be seen in a bonsai design competition. To allow many trees to be located close together, exhibition displays often use a sequence of small alcoves, each containing a single bonsai. The walls or dividers between the alcoves make it easier to view only one bonsai at a time. The back of the alcove is a neutral color and pattern to avoid distracting the viewer&#x27;s eye. The bonsai pot is almost always placed on a formal stand, of a size and design selected to complement the bonsai and its pot.

Indoors, a formal bonsai display is arranged to represent a landscape, and traditionally consists of the featured bonsai tree in an appropriate pot atop a wooden stand, along with a shitakusa (companion plant) representing the foreground, and a hanging scroll representing the background. These three elements are chosen to complement each other and evoke a particular season, and are composed asymmetrically to mimic nature. When displayed inside a traditional Japanese home, a formal bonsai display will often be placed within the home&#x27;s tokonoma or formal display alcove. An indoor display is usually very temporary, lasting a day or two, as most bonsai are intolerant of indoor conditions and lose vigor rapidly within the house.
===Containers===

A variety of informal containers may house the bonsai during its development, and even trees that have been formally planted in a bonsai pot may be returned to growing boxes from time to time. A large growing box can house several bonsai and provide a great volume of soil per tree to encourage root growth. A training box will have a single specimen, and a smaller volume of soil that helps condition the bonsai to the eventual size and shape of the formal bonsai container. There are no aesthetic guidelines for these development containers, and they may be of any material, size, and shape that suit the grower.

Completed trees are grown in formal bonsai containers. These containers are usually ceramic pots, which come in a variety of shapes and colors and may be glazed or unglazed. Unlike many common plant containers, bonsai pots have drainage holes at the bottom surface to complement fast-draining bonsai soil, allowing excess water to escape the pot. Growers cover the holes with a screening to prevent soil from falling out and to hinder pests from entering the pots from below. Pots usually have vertical sides, so that the tree&#x27;s root mass can easily be removed for inspection, pruning, and replanting, although this is a practical consideration and other container shapes are acceptable.

There are alternatives to the conventional ceramic pot. Multi-tree bonsai may be created atop a fairly flat slab of rock, with the soil mounded above the rock surface and the trees planted within the raised soil. In recent times, bonsai creators have also begun to fabricate rock-like slabs from raw materials including concrete and glass-reinforced plastic. Such constructed surfaces can be made much lighter than solid rock, can include depressions or pockets for additional soil, and can be designed for drainage of water, all characteristics difficult to achieve with solid rock slabs. Other unconventional containers can also be used, but in formal bonsai display and competitions in Japan, the ceramic bonsai pot is the most common container.

For bonsai being shown formally in their completed state, pot shape, color, and size are chosen to complement the tree as a picture frame is chosen to complement a painting. In general, containers with straight sides and sharp corners are used for formally-shaped plants, while oval or round containers are used for plants with informal designs. Many aesthetic guidelines affect the selection of pot finish and color. For example, evergreen bonsai are often placed in unglazed pots, while deciduous trees usually appear in glazed pots. Pots are also distinguished by their size. The overall design of the bonsai tree, the thickness of its trunk, and its height are considered when determining the size of a suitable pot.

Some pots are highly collectible, like ancient Chinese or Japanese pots made in regions with experienced pot makers such as Tokoname, Japan, or Yixing, China. Today, many potters worldwide produce pots for bonsai.

==Bonsai styles==



The Japanese tradition describes bonsai tree designs using a set of commonly understood, named styles. The most common styles include formal upright, informal upright, slanting, semi-cascade, cascade, raft, literati, and group/forest. Less common forms include windswept, weeping, split-trunk, and driftwood styles. These terms are not mutually exclusive, and a single bonsai specimen can exhibit more than one style characteristic. When a bonsai specimen falls into multiple style categories, the common practice is to describe it by the dominant or most striking characteristic.

A frequently used set of styles describes the orientation of the bonsai tree&#x27;s main trunk. Different terms are used for a tree with its apex directly over the center of the trunk&#x27;s entry into the soil, slightly to the side of that center, deeply inclined to one side, and inclined below the point at which the trunk of the bonsai enters the soil.
* is a style of trees characterized by a straight, upright, tapering trunk. Branches progress regularly from the thickest and broadest at the bottom to the finest and shortest at the top.
* is a style of trees incorporating visible curves in trunk and branches, but the apex of the informal upright is located directly above the trunk&#x27;s entry into the soil line.
* is a style of bonsai possessing straight trunks like those of bonsai grown in the formal upright style. However, the slant style trunk emerges from the soil at an angle, and the apex of the bonsai will be located to the left or right of the root base.
* &#x27; is a style of specimens modeled after trees that grow over water or down the sides of mountains. The apex (tip of the tree) in the &#x27; style bonsai extend just at or beneath the lip of the bonsai pot; the apex of a &quot;full&quot; cascade-style falls below the base of the pot.

A number of styles describe the trunk shape and bark finish. For example, the deadwood bonsai styles identify trees with prominent dead branches or trunk scarring.
* is a style involving the portrayal of a tree in its struggle to live while a significant part of its trunk is bare of bark.

Although most bonsai trees are planted directly into the soil, there are styles describing trees planted on rock.
* is a style in which the roots of the tree are wrapped around a rock, entering the soil at the base of the rock.
* Growing-in-a-rock ( or ) is a style in which the roots of the tree are growing in soil contained within the cracks and holes of the rock.

While the majority of bonsai specimens feature a single tree, there are well-established style categories for specimens with multiple trunks.
* is a style comprising the planting of several or many trees of one species, typically an odd number, in a bonsai pot.
* Multi-trunk styles like and have all the trunks growing out of one spot with one root system, so the bonsai is actually a single tree.
* is a style of bonsai that mimic a natural phenomenon that occurs when a tree topples onto its side from erosion or another natural force. Branches along the top side of the trunk continue to grow as a group of new trunks.

===Other styles===
A few styles do not fit into the preceding categories. These include:
* is a style employed for trees with fine branching, like elms. The trunk is straight and branches out in all directions about of the way up the entire height of the tree. The branches and leaves form a ball-shaped crown.
* is a style describing a tree that appears to be affected by strong winds blowing continuously from one direction, as might shape a tree atop a mountain ridge or on an exposed shoreline.

== Bonsai artists ==
Below is a list of some notable bonsai artists.


== Bonsai exhibitions ==
There are exhibitions, shows, and competitions dedicated to bonsai all around the world. However, there is a consensus that the best specimens are in Japan. Japan has several private and public museums dedicated to bonsai, such as the Shunka-en Bonsai Garden in Tokyo and the Omiya Bonsai Museum in Saitama.

In the United States, there are two museums dedicated to bonsai, the National Bonsai &amp; Penjing Museum at the National Arboretum in Washington DC, and the Pacific Bonsai Museum close to Tacoma, WA.

Japan also hosts several annual bonsai competitions where trees compete for awards in different categories. The most prestigious bonsai competition for amateur-owned trees, although most trees are prepared for display by professionals, is the Kokufu-ten, held every year in the month of February in the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. The Kokufu-ten is the oldest competition in Japan, celebrating in 2023 its 97th edition. Awards are presented in different categories.

For bonsai professionals, the top competition in Japan is the Nippon Bonsai Sakufu-ten organized by the Japan Bonsai Cooperative Association. The competition is held in December of each year and the top prize is the Prime Minister Award, which went to Hiroaki Suzuki in 2022 for a Shimpaku Juniper tree.

==Size classifications==
Japanese bonsai exhibitions and catalogs frequently refer to the size of individual bonsai specimens by assigning them to size classes (see table below). Not all sources agree on the exact sizes or names for these size ranges, but the concept of the ranges is well-established and useful to both the cultivation and the aesthetic understanding of the trees. A photograph of a bonsai may not give the viewer an accurate impression of the tree&#x27;s real size, so printed documents may complement a photograph by naming the bonsai&#x27;s size class. The size class implies the height and weight of the tree in its container.

In the very largest size ranges, a recognized Japanese practice is to name the trees &quot;two-handed&quot;, &quot;four-handed&quot;, and so on, based on the number of men required to move the tree and pot. These trees will have dozens of branches and can closely simulate a full-size tree. The very largest size, called &quot;imperial&quot;, is named after the enormous potted trees of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Palace.

At the other end of the size spectrum, there are a number of specific techniques and styles associated solely with the smallest common sizes, &quot;mame&quot; and &quot;shito&quot;. These techniques take advantage of the bonsai&#x27;s minute dimensions and compensate for the limited number of branches and leaves that can appear on a tree this small.

==Indoor bonsai==
The Japanese tradition of bonsai does not include indoor bonsai, and bonsai appearing at Japanese exhibitions or in catalogs have been grown outdoors for their entire lives. In less-traditional settings, including climates more severe than Japan&#x27;s, indoor bonsai may appear in the form of potted trees cultivated for the indoor environment.

Traditionally, bonsai are temperate climate trees grown outdoors in containers. Kept in the artificial environment of a home, these trees weaken and die. However, a number of tropical and sub-tropical tree species will survive and grow indoors, such as the jade plant and members of the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
 is taught in schools. It has also featured in manga, anime, and been shown on television.
* In the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; film franchise, Mr. Miyagi practices bonsai and teaches through it, up to even being the central feature of the film in &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;, and many years later, being part of the plot of the Cobra Kai sequel TV series.
* In the Discworld series of books by Terry Pratchett, most notably in &quot;Small Gods&quot;, the History Monk Lu-Tze practices the art of bonsai mountains, a parody of bonsai, due to his expanded lifespan.

<text>Yrjö Väisälä (; 6 September 1891 – 21 July 1971) was a Finnish astronomer and physicist.

His main contributions were in the field of optics. He was also active in geodetics, astronomy and optical metrology. He had an affectionate nickname of &quot;Wizard of Tuorla&quot; (Observatory/Optics laboratory), and a book with the same title in Finnish describes his works. His discoveries include 128 asteroids and 3 comets.

His brothers were mathematician Kalle Väisälä (1893–1968) and meteorologist Vilho Väisälä (1889–1969). His daughter Marja Väisälä (1916–2011) was an astronomer and discoverer of minor planets.

Väisälä was a fervent supporter of Esperanto, presiding over the &quot;Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista&quot; (&quot;International Association of Esperanto Scientists&quot;) in 1968.

== Optician ==

He developed several methods for measuring the quality of optical elements, as well as a lot of practical methods of manufacturing said elements. This allowed the construction of some of the earliest high-quality Schmidt cameras, in particular a &quot;field-flattened&quot; version known as Schmidt-Väisälä camera. Contemporary to Bernhard Schmidt&#x27;s design, but unpublished was also Prof. Yrjö Väisälä&#x27;s identical design which he had mentioned in lecture notes in 1924 with a footnote: &quot;problematic spherical focal surface&quot;.

Once he saw Schmidt&#x27;s publication, he promptly went ahead and &quot;solved&quot; the field flattening problem by placing a doubly convex lens slightly in front of the film holder – back in the 1930s, astronomical films were glass plates &quot;(also see photographic plates)&quot;. The resulting system is known as the Schmidt-Väisälä camera or sometimes as the &quot;Väisälä camera&quot;. (This solution is not perfect, as images of different colour end up at slightly different places.) Prof. Väisälä made a small test unit of 7 mirrors in a mosaic on stiff background steel frame, however it proved to be impossible to stabilize as &quot;just adjust and forget&quot; structure, and next time anybody tried it, was with active controls on Multiple Mirror Telescope.

== Geodesy ==
In the 1920s and 1930s Finland was doing its first precision triangulation chain measurements, and to create long-distance vertices Prof. Väisälä proposed usage of flash-lights on altitude balloons, or on some big fireworks rockets. The idea was to measure the exact position of the flash against background stars, and by precisely knowing one camera location, to derive an accurate location for another camera. This required better wide-field cameras than were available, and was discarded.

Later, Prof. Väisälä developed a method to multiply an optical length reference using white light interferometry to precisely determine lengths of baselines used in triangulation chains. Several such baselines were created in Finland for second high-precision triangulation campaign in 1950s and 1960s.

Later GPS made these methods largely obsolete. The Nummela Standard Baseline established by Väisälä is still maintained by the Finnish Geodetic Institute in Nummela for the calibration of other distance measurement instruments.

Prof. Väisälä also developed excellent tools to measure earth rotational axis position by building so called zenith telescopes, and in the 1960s Tuorla Observatory was in the top rank of North Pole position tracking measurements.

In the 1980s radioastronomy was able to replace Earth rotation tracking by referring things against &quot;non-moving background&quot; of quasars.

For these Zenith Telescopes, Prof. Väisälä made also one of the first experiments at doing mirrors of liquid mercury. (Such mirror needs extremely smooth rotational speeds which were achieved in the late 1990s.)

== Astronomer ==

The big Schmidt-Väisälä telescope he built was used at the University of Turku for searching asteroids and comets. His research group discovered 7 comets and 807 asteroids.

For this rather massive photographic survey work, Prof. Väisälä developed also a protocol of taking two exposures on same plate some 2–3 hours apart and offsetting those images slightly. Any dot-pairs that differed from background were moving, and deserved follow-up photos. This method halved the film consumption compared to method of &quot;blink comparing&quot;, where plates get single exposures, and are compared by rapidly showing first and second exposures to human operator. (Blink-comparing was used to find e.g. Pluto.)

Yrjö Väisälä is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 128 asteroids &quot;(see below)&quot; during 1935–1944. He used to name them with the names of his personal friends that had birthdays. One of them was the professor Matti Herman Palomaa, after whom an asteroid 1548 Palomaa was named. For this reason the Palomar Mountain Observatory in California has never had an asteroid bearing its name – the rules for naming asteroids state that the names have to differ from each other with more than one letter.

Besides minor planets, he has also discovered 3 comets. The parabolic comet C/1944 H1 observed in 1944 and 1945, as well as the two short period comets, 40P/Väisälä, a Jupiter-family comet, and C/1942 EA, a Halley-type and near-Earth comet. Together with Liisi Oterma he co-discovered the Jupiter-family comet 139P/Väisälä–Oterma, which was first classified as asteroid and received the provisional designation &quot;1939 TN&quot;.

== Honors and awards ==

The University of Turku Astronomy department is known as &quot;VISPA: Väisälä Institute for Space Physics and Astronomy&quot; in honour of its founder. The lunar crater &quot;Väisälä&quot; is named after him, and so are the minor planets 1573 Väisälä and 2804 Yrjö.

<doc id="173279" wikidata="Q1542294" url="?curid=173279" title="Ley line">
<text>Ley lines () are straight alignments drawn between various historic structures, prehistoric sites and prominent landmarks. The idea was developed in early 20th-century Europe, with ley line believers arguing that these alignments were recognised by ancient societies that deliberately erected structures along them. Since the 1960s, members of the Earth Mysteries movement and other esoteric traditions have commonly believed that such ley lines demarcate &quot;earth energies&quot; and serve as guides for alien spacecraft. Archaeologists and scientists regard ley lines as an example of pseudoarchaeology and pseudoscience.

The idea of &quot;leys&quot; as straight tracks across the landscape was put forward by the English antiquarian Alfred Watkins in the 1920s, particularly in his book &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot;. He argued that straight lines could be drawn between various historic structures and that these represented trade routes created by ancient British societies. Although he gained a small following, Watkins&#x27; ideas were never accepted by the British archaeological establishment, a fact that frustrated him. His critics noted that his ideas relied on drawing lines between sites established at different periods of the past. They also argued that in prehistory, as in the present, it was impractical to travel in a straight line across hilly or mountainous areas of Britain, rendering his leys unlikely as trade routes. Independently of Watkins&#x27; ideas, a similar notion—that of (&#x27;holy lines&#x27;)—was raised in Germany in the 1920s.

During the 1960s, Watkins&#x27; ideas were revived in altered form by British proponents of the countercultural Earth Mysteries movement. In 1961, Tony Wedd put forward the belief that leys were established by prehistoric communities to guide alien spacecraft. This view was promoted to a wider audience in the books of John Michell, particularly his 1969 work &quot;The View Over Atlantis&quot;. Michell&#x27;s publications were accompanied by the launch of the &quot;Ley Hunter&quot; magazine and the appearance of a ley hunter community keen to identify ley lines across the British landscape. Ley hunters often combined their search for ley lines with other esoteric practices like dowsing and numerology and with a belief in a forthcoming Age of Aquarius that would transform human society. Although often hostile to archaeologists, some ley hunters attempted to ascertain scientific evidence for their belief in earth energies at prehistoric sites, evidence they could not obtain. Following sustained archaeological criticism, the ley hunter community dissipated in the 1990s, with several of its key proponents abandoning the idea and moving into the study of landscape archaeology and folkloristics. Belief in ley lines nevertheless remains common among some esoteric religious groups, such as forms of modern Paganism, in both Europe and North America.

Archaeologists note that there is no evidence that ley lines were a recognised phenomenon among ancient European societies and that attempts to draw them typically rely on linking together structures that were built in different historical periods. Archaeologists and statisticians have demonstrated that a random distribution of a sufficient number of points on a plane will inevitably create alignments of random points purely by chance. Skeptics have also stressed that the esoteric idea of earth energies running through ley lines has not been scientifically verified, remaining an article of faith for its believers.

==History==
===Early prototypes===

The idea that ancient sacred sites might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the Reverend Edward Duke, who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other.
In 1909, the idea was advanced in Germany. There, Wilhelm Teudt had argued for the presence of linear alignments connecting various sites but suggested that they had a religious and astronomical function.
In Germany, the idea was referred to as (&#x27;holy lines&#x27;), an idea adopted by some proponents of Nazism.

===Alfred Watkins and &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot;===

The idea of &quot;leys&quot; as paths traversing the British landscape was developed by Alfred Watkins, a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in Hereford. According to his account, he was driving across the hills near Blackwardine, Herefordshire, when he looked across the landscape and observed the way that several features lined up together. He subsequently began drawing lines across his Ordnance Survey maps, developing the view that ancient British people had tended to travel in straight lines, using &quot;mark points&quot; along the landscape to guide them.

He put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book &quot;Early British Trackways&quot; and then again, in greater depth, in the 1925 book &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot;. He proposed the existence of a network of completely straight roads that cut through a range of prehistoric, Roman, and medieval structures. In his view, these straight tracks were ancient trade routes. Watkins had drawn upon earlier research; he cited the work of the English astronomer Norman Lockyer, who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices.

His work referred to G. H. Piper&#x27;s paper presented to the Woolhope Naturalists&#x27; Field Club in 1882, which noted that: &quot;A line drawn from the Skirrid-fawr mountain northwards to Arthur&#x27;s Stone would pass over the camp and southernmost point of Hatterall Hill, Oldcastle, Longtown Castle, and Urishay and Snodhill castles.&quot;

Watkins referred to these lines as &quot;leys&quot; although had reservations about doing so. The term &quot;ley&quot; derived from the Old English term for a cleared space, with Watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place-names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced. He also observed the recurrence of &quot;cole&quot; and &quot;dod&quot; in English place-names, thus suggesting that the individuals who established these lines were referred to as a &quot;coleman&quot; or &quot;dodman&quot;. He proposed that the Long Man of Wilmington chalk geoglyph in Sussex was a depiction of such an individual with their measuring equipment.

His ideas were rejected by most experts on British prehistory at the time, including both the small number of recognised archaeological scholars and local enthusiasts. His critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain, and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins. Some of Watkins&#x27; other ideas, such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later, would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists. Part of archaeologists&#x27; objections was their belief that prehistoric Britons would not have been sophisticated enough to produce such accurate measurements across the landscape. British archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism, and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent British development.

In 1926, advocates of Watkins&#x27; beliefs established the Straight Track Club. To assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape, in 1927, Watkins published &quot;The Ley Hunter&#x27;s Manual&quot;.

Proponents of Watkins&#x27; ideas sent in letters to the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then editor of the &quot;Antiquity&quot; journal. Crawford filed these letters under a section of his archive titled &quot;Crankeries&quot; and was annoyed that educated people believed such ideas when they were demonstrably incorrect. He refused to publish an advert for &quot;The Old Straight Track&quot; in &quot;Antiquity&quot;, at which Watkins became very bitter towards him.

Watkins&#x27; last book, &quot;Archaic Tracks Around Cambridge&quot;, was published in 1932. Watkins died on 7 April 1935. The Club survived him, although it became largely inactive at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and formally disbanded in 1948. The archaeoastronomer Clive Ruggles noted that after the 1920s, &quot;ley lines soon faded into obscurity&quot;. The historian Ronald Hutton similarly noted that there had been a &quot;virtual demise&quot; in the idea by the 1950s, in part due to &quot;a natural weariness with a spent enthusiasm&quot;.

===Earth Mysteries movement===

From the 1940s through to the 1960s, the archaeological establishment blossomed in Britain due to the formation of various university courses on the subject. This helped to professionalise the discipline, and meant that it was no longer an amateur-dominated field of research. It was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture, where—in the words of the archaeologist Matthew Johnson—they were attributed with &quot;sacred significance or mystical power&quot;. Ruggles noted that in this period, ley lines came to be conceived as &quot;lines of power, the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought&quot;.

In his 1961 book &quot;Skyways and Landmarks&quot;, Tony Wedd published his idea that Watkins&#x27; leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting Earth. He came to this conclusion after comparing Watkins&#x27; ideas with those of the French ufologist Aimé Michel, who argued for the existence of &quot;orthotenies&quot;, lines along which alien spacecraft travelled. Wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a &quot;magnetic current&quot; flowing across the Earth.

Wedd&#x27;s ideas were taken up by the writer John Michell, who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book &quot;The Flying Saucer Vision&quot;. In this book, Michell promoted the ancient astronaut belief that extraterrestrials had assisted humanity during prehistory, when humans had worshipped these entities as gods, but that the aliens left when humanity became too materialistic and technology-focused. He also argued that humanity&#x27;s materialism was driving it to self-destruction, but that this could be prevented by re-activating the ancient centres which would facilitate renewed contact with the aliens.

Michell repeated his beliefs in his 1969 book &quot;The View Over Atlantis&quot;. Hutton described it as &quot;almost the founding document of the modern earth mysteries movement&quot;. Here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the Chinese concept of geomantic energy lines which he transliterated as &quot;&quot;, i.e., &quot;dragon veins&quot; (). He proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this energy. Translating the term &quot;&quot; as &quot;dragon paths&quot;, he reinterpreted tales from English mythology and folklore in which heroes killed dragons so that the dragon-slayers became the villains. Hutton later noted that Michell&#x27;s ideas &quot;embodied a fervent religious feeling, which though not Christian was heavily influenced by Christian models&quot;, adopting an &quot;evangelical and apocalyptic tone&quot; that announced the coming of an Age of Aquarius in which ancient wisdom would be restored. Michell invented various claims about archaeological evidence to suit his purpose. He viewed archaeologists as antagonists, seeing them as the personification of the modern materialism he was railing against.

In the mid-1970s Michell then published a detailed case study of the West Penwith district of Cornwall, laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in the area. He presented this as a challenge to archaeologists, urging them to examine his ideas in detail and stating that he would donate a large sum of money to charity if they could disprove them. Hutton noted that it represented &quot;the finest piece of surveying work&quot; then undertaken by a pseudo-archaeologists in Britain. However Michell had included natural rock outcrops as well as medieval crosses in his list of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments.

====The ley hunting community====
In 1962, a group of ufologists established the Ley Hunter&#x27;s Club. Michell&#x27;s publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the British landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures. Parish churches were particularly favoured by the ley hunters, who often worked on the assumption that such churches had almost always been built atop pre-Christian sacred sites. The 1970s and 1980s also saw the increase in publications on the topic of ley lines. One ley lines enthusiast, Philip Heselton, established the &quot;Ley Hunter&quot; magazine, which was launched in 1965. It was later edited by Paul Screeton, who also wrote the book &quot;Quicksilver Heritage&quot;, in which he argued that the Neolithic period had seen an idyllic society devoted to spirituality but that this was brought to an end through the introduction of metal technologies in the Bronze Age. He argued that this golden age could nevertheless be restored. Another key book produced among the ley hunting community was &quot;Mysterious Britain&quot;, written by Janet and Colin Bord.

Part of the popularity of ley hunting was that individuals without any form of professional training in archaeology could take part and feel that they could rediscover &quot;the magical landscapes of the past&quot;. Ley hunting welcomed those who had &quot;a strong interest in the past but feel excluded from the narrow confines of orthodox academia&quot;. The ley hunting movement often blended their activities with other esoteric practices, such as numerology and dowsing. The movement had a diverse base, consisting of individuals from different classes and of different political opinions: it contained adherents of both radical left and radical right ideologies. Ley hunters often differed on how they understood the ley lines; some believed that leys only marked a pre-existing energy current, whereas others thought that the leys helped to control and direct this energy. They were nevertheless generally in agreement that the ley lines were laid out between 5000 BCE and 2600 BCE, after the introduction of agriculture but before the introduction of metal in Britain. For many ley hunters, this Neolithic period was seen as a golden age in which Britons lived in harmony with the natural environment.

Attitudes to the archaeological establishment varied among ley hunters, with some of the latter wanting to convert archaeologists to their beliefs and others believing that that was an impossible task. Ley hunters nevertheless often took an interest in the work of archaeo-astronomers like Alexander Thom and Euan Mackie, being attracted to their arguments about the existence of sophisticated astronomer-priests in British prehistory. In suggesting that prehistoric Britons were far more advanced in mathematics and astronomy than archaeologists had previously accepted, Thom&#x27;s work was seen as giving additional credibility to the beliefs of ley hunters. Thom lent the idea of leys some support; in 1971 he stated the view that Neolithic British engineers would have been capable of surveying a straight line between two points that were otherwise not visible from each other.

Paul Devereux succeeded Screeton as the editor of the &quot;Ley Hunter&quot;. He was more concerned than many other ley hunters with finding objective evidence for the idea that unusual forms of energy could be measured at places where prehistoric communities had erected structures. He was one of the founding members of the Dragon Project, launched in London in 1977 with the purpose of conducting radioactivity and ultrasonic tests at prehistoric sites, particularly the stone circles created in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. The Dragon Project continued its research throughout the 1980s, finding that certain prehistoric sites did show higher or lower than average rates of radiation but that others did not and that there was no consistent pattern. Professional archaeologists, whose view of the ley hunters was largely negative, took little interest in such research.

It was only in the 1980s that professional archaeologists in Britain began to engage with the ley hunting movement. In 1983, &quot;Ley Lines in Question&quot;, a book written by the archaeologists Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, was published. In this work, Williamson and Bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines proponents had amassed in support of their beliefs. As part of their book, they examined the example of the West Penwith district that Michell had set out as a challenge to archaeologists during the previous decade. They highlighted that the British landscape was so highly covered in historic monuments that it was statistically unlikely that any straight line could be drawn across the landscape without passing through several such sites. They also demonstrated that ley hunters had often said that certain markers were Neolithic, and thus roughly contemporary with each other, when often they were of widely different dates, such as being Iron Age or medieval. The overall message of Williamson and Bellamy&#x27;s book was that the idea of leys, as it was being presented by Earth Mysteries proponents, had no basis in empirical reality. Looking back on the book&#x27;s reception in 2000, Williamson noted that &quot;archaeologists weren&#x27;t particularly interested, and ley-line people were hostile&quot;.

====Schism in the community====
Williamson and Bellamy&#x27;s book brought two different responses from the ley hunter community. Some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation, this did not matter; for them, a belief in ley lines was an act of faith, and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality. The other approach was to further engage archaeologists by seeking out new data and arguments to bolster their beliefs in ley lines. Hutton noted that this pulled along &quot;a potential fissure between rationalism and mysticism which had always been inherent in the movement&quot;.

In 1989, a book that Devereux had co-written with Nigel Pennick, &quot;Lines on the Landscape&quot;, was published. It laid aside ideas of leys representing channels for earth energy, noting that this was beyond the realm of scientific verification, and instead focused on trying to build a case for ley lines that archaeologists could engage with. In particular, it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world, proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric Britain. Hutton called the book &quot;an important development&quot;, for it was &quot;by far the most well-researched, intelligently written and beautifully produced work yet published on leys&quot;. Devereux pursued this approach in a series of further books.

Reflecting his move towards archaeology, in 1991, Devereux published an article on sightlines from the prehistoric site of Silbury Hill, Wiltshire in &quot;Antiquity&quot;. By the 1990s, British archaeology had become more open to ideas about language and cognition, topics that Earth Mysteries enthusiasts had long been interested in. A prominent example of this was the work of Christopher Tilley, who devised the idea of phenomenology, or using human senses to experience a landscape as a means of trying to ascertain how past societies would have done the same.

The &quot;Ley Hunter&quot; magazine ceased publication in 1999. Its last editor, Danny Sullivan, stated that the idea of leys was &quot;dead&quot;. Hutton suggested that some of the enthusiasm formerly directed toward leys was instead directed toward archaeo-astronomy. He also noted that the ley hunting community had &quot;functioned as an indispensable training ground for a small but important group of non-academic scholars who have made a genuine contribution to the study of folklore and mythology.&quot; Pennick for instance went on to write a range of short books and pamphlets on European folklore. Another prominent ley hunter, Bob Trubshaw, also wrote several books on these subjects and served as a publisher for others. Jeremy Harte, editor of &quot;Wessex Earth Mysteries&quot;, subsequently produced several books on folklore; his book on British fairy lore later won the Folklore Society&#x27;s annual prize.

====Continuing belief====
In 2005, Ruggles noted that &quot;for the most part, ley lines represent an unhappy episode now consigned to history&quot;. However belief in ley lines persists among various esoteric groups, having become an &quot;enduring feature of some brands of esotericism&quot;. As Hutton observed, beliefs in &quot;ancient earth energies have passed so far into the religious experience of the &#x27;New Age&#x27; counter-culture of Europe and America that it is unlikely that any tests of evidence would bring about an end to belief in them.&quot; During the 1970s and 1980s, a belief in ley lines fed into the modern Pagan community. Research that took place in 2014 for instance found that various modern Druids and other Pagans believed that there were ley lines focusing on the Early Neolithic site of Coldrum Long Barrow in Kent, southeast England.

In the US city of Seattle a dowsing organisation called the Geo Group plotted what they believed were the ley lines across the city. They stated that their &quot;project made Seattle the first city on Earth to balance and tune its ley-line system&quot;. The Seattle Arts Commission contributed $5,000 to the project, bringing criticisms from members of the public who regarded it as a waste of money.

==Scientific views==

Ley lines have been characterised as a form of pseudoscience. On &quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, the American philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll noted that none of the statements about magnetic forces underpinning putative ley lines has been scientifically verified.

Williamson and Bellamy characterised ley lines as &quot;one of the biggest red herrings in the history of popular thought&quot;. One criticism of Watkins&#x27; ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in Britain and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that &quot;connect&quot; sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence. Johnson stated that &quot;ley lines do not exist&quot;. He cited Williamson and Bellamy&#x27;s work in demonstrating this, noting that their research showed how &quot;the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will &#x27;clip&#x27; a number of sites&quot;.

Other statistical significance tests have shown that supposed ley-line alignments are no more significant than random occurrences and/or have been generated by selection effects. The paper by statistician Simon Broadbent is one such example and the discussion after the article involving a large number of other statisticians demonstrates the high level of agreement that alignments have no significance compared to the null hypothesis of random locations.

A study by David George Kendall used the techniques of shape analysis to examine the triangles formed by standing stones to deduce if these were often arranged in straight lines. The shape of a triangle can be represented as a point on the sphere, and the distribution of all shapes can be thought of as a distribution over the sphere. The sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average.

The archaeologist Richard Atkinson once demonstrated this by taking the positions of telephone booths and pointing out the existence of &quot;telephone box leys&quot;. This, he argued, showed that the mere existence of such lines in a set of points does not prove that the lines are deliberate artefacts, especially since it is known that telephone boxes were not laid out in any such manner or with any such intention.

<text>Upper Rhine ( ; ; kilometres 167 to 529 of the Rhine) is the section of the Rhine between the Middle Bridge in Basel, Switzerland, and the Rhine knee in Bingen, Germany. It is surrounded by the Upper Rhine Plain (). Most of its upper section marks the France–Germany border.

The Upper Rhine is one of four sections of the river (the others being the High Rhine, Middle Rhine and Lower Rhine) between Lake Constance and the North Sea. The countries and states along the Upper Rhine are Switzerland, France (Alsace) and the German states of Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. The largest cities along the river are Basel, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Mainz.

The Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and made navigable between 1928 and 1977. The Treaty of Versailles allows France to use the Upper Rhine for hydroelectricity in the Grand Canal d&#x27;Alsace.

On the left bank are the French region of Alsace and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate; on the right bank are the German states of Baden-Württemberg and Hesse. The first few kilometres are in the Swiss city of Basel.

== Geology ==

Around 35 million years ago, a rift valley of about long and wide came into being between the present cities of Basel and Frankfurt. This was due to tensile stresses in the Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle, which resulted in lowering the earth&#x27;s surface. The moat has been partially filled up again by sedimentation. On the edges we find mountain ridges, the so-called &quot;rift flanks&quot;. On the eastern side, they are the Black Forest and Odenwald mountains, in the west the Vosges and Palatinate Forest. During the Tertiary, the High Rhine continued west from Basel and flowed via the Doubs and the Saône, into the Rhône. The rift diverted the Rhine into the newly formed Upper Rhine Valley.

The Rhine knee at Basel marks the transition from the High Rhine to the Upper Rhine with a change of direction from West to North and a change of landscape from the relatively small-chamber high-Rhine cuesta landscape to the wide rift zone of the Upper Rhine Rift Valley. The two largest tributaries come from the right: the Neckar in Mannheim, the Main across from Mainz. In the northwest corner of the Upper Rhine Valley, at Rhine-kilometre 529.1, near Bingen, where the Nahe flows into the Rhine, the Rhine flows into a gorge in the Rhenish Massif and thereby changes into the Middle Rhine.

=== Tri-national metropolitan region ===

The Upper Rhine tri-national region (French: &quot;Région Métropolitaine Trinationale du Rhin Supérieur&quot;, German: &quot;Trinationale Metropolregion Oberrhein&quot;) is a Euroregion that covers the border areas of the Upper Rhine (the northern part of the Upper Rhine valley and the Palatinate are not included as they are not border areas) and parts of the High Rhine. As the name suggests, it is a tri-national region comprising parts of France, Germany and Switzerland. The regional Upper Rhine Conference is a framework for future political and administrative cooperation in the area.

The tripoint between France, Germany and Switzerland, called &quot;Dreiländereck&quot;, lies within the uppermost portion of the Upper Rhine. A monument in Basel, known as the &quot;Pylon&quot;, is located southeast of the actual tripoint.

== Interventions ==
=== Straightening ===

In 1685, Louis XIV started a project to move the Upper Rhine, change its course and drain the floodplain, in order to gain land. By 1840, the river had been moved up to to the east, taking territory away from Baden. Around 1790, large parts of the Rhine Valley were deforested, creating arable land, fields and pasture to feed the population. The Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and changed from a relatively sluggish meandering river with major and many smaller branches into a fast flowing stream flanked by embankments. The length of the Upper Rhine was reduced by . Some cut-off river arms and ox-bows remain; they are typically called the &#x27;Old Rhine&#x27; () or (similar to the Old Rhine () in the Alpine Rhine Valley, where the Rhine was also straightened).

=== Canalising and dams ===
The Rhine between Basel and Iffezheim is almost entirely canalised. On a stretch of , there are 10 dams, provided with hydropower stations and locks. Between Basel and Breisach, the old river bed carries hardly any water; almost all water is diverted through the Grand Canal d&#x27;Alsace on the French side, to ensure safe shipping and hydropower generation around the clock. Only when there is a large supply of water, then the old river bed will receive more water than the canal. France gained the right to do this in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles; the right applies to the segment between Basel and Neuburgweier/Lauterbourg, where the Rhine forms the border between France and Germany.

The straightening (1817–76) and channeling (1928–77) reduced the water table by up to and thus had a negative effect on flora and fauna. Gravel is also missing from the river, due to the dams. This has caused erosion below the dam at Iffezheim. To counter this, per year of a mixture of sand and gravel with an average grain diameter of (corresponding to the local sediment transport capacity) has been dumped into the river, since 1978, using two motorized barges.
=== Integrated Rhine Programme (IRP) ===

The Upper Rhine plays a key role in flood control on the Middle and Lower Rhine. As a result of the straightening of the Upper Rhine, floods from the Alps now reach the Middle Rhine much faster than in the past. Thus, the risk of such a peak coinciding with a flood peak of Neckar, Moselle or Main has increased. About of floodplain have been lost. Authorities in riparian states of France, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have launched the &quot;Integrated Rhine Programme&quot;, a framework for designating water retention areas. to combat downstream flooding. A French-German treaty was concluded in 1982, in which the parties agreed to restore the retention capacity on the stretch below Iffezheim to the level it had before the area was developed.

This means:
For the stretch between Iffezheim and the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 200-year flood (i.e. a flood that statistically occurs once in 200 years) of the Rhine to a discharge of at the Maxau gauge station, that is, a reduction from to .
* for the stretch below the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 220-year flood to a discharge of at the Worms gauge station, that is, a reduction from to .

For this purpose the following measures are planned and partially implemented:
* By France: Special operations power stations on the Rhine and construction of two polders Erstein and Moder
* By Baden-Württemberg: construction of about 13 polders
* By Rhineland-Palatinate: construction of polders and relocating levees

The effectiveness of the flood protection measures was verified using a computer model. The State Institute for the Environment, Nature Protection and Measurements in Baden-Württemberg carried out forecast calculations with the help of a mathematical &quot;synoptic flood progression model&quot;. The analysis of the calculations and the evaluation of the results were made on the basis of the requirements and methods set by the international Flood Study Commission for the Rhine. The implementation of the proposed flood control measures on the Upper Rhine can prevent the occurrence of a 200-year-flood between Iffezheim and Bingen, with an overall economic loss estimated at around 6.2 billion euros.

== Conservation ==

The floodplains between Mainz and Bingen are important for nature conservation. In this section, the so-called &quot;Island Rhine&quot;, there are many nature reserves and bird sanctuaries.

<text>Autobahn is the fourth studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk, released in November 1974 by Philips Records. The album marked several personnel changes in the band, which was initially a duo consisting of Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter; later, the group added Klaus Röder on guitar and flute, and Wolfgang Flür on percussion. The album also completed the group&#x27;s transition from the experimental krautrock style of their earlier work to an electronic pop sound consisting mostly of synthesizers and drum machines. Recording started at the group&#x27;s own Kling Klang facility, but was predominantly made at Conny Plank&#x27;s studio. &quot;Autobahn&quot; also includes lyrics and a new look for the group that was suggested by Emil Schult, an associate of Schneider and Hütter.

Most of the album is taken up by the 22-minute &quot;Autobahn&quot;, featuring lyrics by Schneider, Hütter, and Schult. The song was inspired by the group&#x27;s joy of driving on Germany&#x27;s autobahns, and recorded music that reflected a trip emulating the sounds of a vehicle. The album&#x27;s release in West Germany saw little press attention. &quot;Autobahn&quot; was released as a single and received airplay at a Chicago radio station, leading it to spread across the United States. In 1975, the song became an international hit and Kraftwerk&#x27;s first release of their music in the US. &quot;Autobahn&quot; success led to the band touring the United States with new member Karl Bartos, who replaced Röder, followed by a tour of the United Kingdom.

Initial reception to &quot;Autobahn&quot; was mixed; receiving negative reviews, from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Village Voice&quot;, who felt the music was inferior to earlier electronic music from Wendy Carlos and Mike Oldfield, and positive reviews that praised the title track as hypnotic and arresting for its imagery of driving on the autobahn. Critics from the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot; included the album in their &quot;Honorable Mentions&quot; sections of their year-end lists. Retrospectively, the album has been unanimously praised; Simon Witter wrote in &quot;NME&quot; the album is of &quot;enormous historical significance&quot; and Simon Reynolds said the album is where Kraftwerk&#x27;s music really starts to matter. Musicians of the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, cited the album as a major influence.

==Background and production==

Prior to the release of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, Kraftwerk consisted of Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter, who had released an album titled &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot; in October 1973. Prior to &quot;Autobahn&quot;, electronic music did not develop a popular following in the United States with a few exceptions such as Michael Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and the works of fellow German band Tangerine Dream. According to critic Lynn Van Matre of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1975, &quot;far too often much of what has been profferred has been either boring, painfully self-indulgent, or just plain painful&quot;. In comparison, Van Matre found &quot;Autobahn&quot; to be &quot;what you might call middle-of-the-road electronics&quot;. Comparing the albums sounds to the group&#x27;s earlier work, Michael Hooker of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted the music of &quot;Ralf und Florian&quot; is more traditional compared to that of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, noting its resemblance to the works of composers Morton Subotnik and Edgar Froese rather than the &quot;monotonous pulse&quot; of &quot;Autobahn&quot;. Kraftwerk became more conscious of their visual image and, under the guidance of their associate Emil Schult, they began redesigning their look. Schult, who had studied under Joseph Beuys, consulted the band on their themes and image. This led to Kraftwerk having small, carefully staged promotional images for the rest of their career. In a 1975 interview published in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Karl Dallas noted Kraftwerk&#x27;s music and look were &quot;as far as you get from the Gothic romanticism of Tangerine Dream&quot; and that &quot;visually they also present a completely different image&quot;, comparing Tangerine Dream&#x27;s Froese&#x27;s &quot;untidy red locks&quot;, and bandmates Peter Baumann&#x27;s and Christopher Franke&#x27;s &quot;long, lank tresses&quot;.

In early 1974, like their German contemporaries, Kraftwerk purchased a Minimoog synthesizer, which they used alongside customized versions of the Farfisa Rhythm Unit 10 and Vox Percussion King drum machines on the album. &quot;Autobahn&quot; was recorded at the group&#x27;s home studio Kling Klang and at Conny Plank&#x27;s new studio in a farmhouse outside Cologne. The majority of &quot;Autobahn&quot; was made on Plank&#x27;s equipment. Accompanying Schneider and Hütter on the album are Klaus Roeder on violin and guitar, and Wolfgang Flür on percussion. Roeder, who was a member of Düsseldorf&#x27;s music scene, had built an electronic violin that intrigued Schneider. Flür was an interior design student who had drummed for a Düsseldorf band called The Beathovens. Flür stated he found initial jam sessions with the group somewhat strange but soon developed a rapport with his bandmates. Conny Plank is credited as the engineer on the album but he had a key contribution to its sound. Roeder later stated: &quot;Plank played a decisive role. He mixed everything and assembled individual sounds into a whole. That was, I believe the last time that Conny did that. He then told me he did know what Kraftwerk would sound like when he was no longer there.&quot;

==Music==

In the book &quot;Kraftwerk: Music Non-Stop&quot;, Carsten Brocker said that with &quot;Autobahn&quot;, Kraftwerk completed the transition from their earlier style of experimental krautrock to electronic pop music. The album was recorded primarily on synthesizer and drum machine, with occasional flute and guitar. Brocker commented on the group&#x27;s simple melodies and harmonies suggest pop music. According to Bartos, the group&#x27;s change in style occurred because Hütter and Schneider came from a classical music background, and they moved to pop music by adding lyrics because &quot;There is no pop music without lyrics apparently&quot;. The change in musical direction was influenced by Schult, who was not trained as a musician but has an ear for melody and chose effective parts of improvised sessions, and led Hütter and Schneider to explore by simplifying their own musical sessions. There are very few vocals on &quot;Autobahn&quot;; critic Van Matre described the album as &quot;simply an impression of the sounds and sensory perceptions of the road&quot;.

Hütter repeatedly described Kraftwerk&#x27;s music as (), specifically referencing a modern version of German regional musical traditions rather than the industrial music sound of groups like Throbbing Gristle. In Britain, electronic music was popularly known as &quot;&quot;Doctor Who&quot; music&quot;, referencing the pioneering electronic soundtrack to the television series. Hütter stated in 1975 Kraftwerk got the idea for the album by driving on the autobahn, stating it was an &quot;exciting experience that makes you run through a huge variety of feelings. We tried to convey through music what it felt like.&quot; Flür later described &quot;Autobahn&quot; as a journey from Düsseldorf to Hamburg and said that the route included musical pieces such as the industrial sounds of the Ruhr valley, the conveyor belts of the mining towns such as Bottrop and Castrop-Rauxel, and the rural Münster region, which is symbolized by the flute in the song. Other sounds of road travel are heard throughout the song; according to Hütter, the group included &quot;car sounds, horns, basic melodies and tuning motors. Adjusting the suspension and tyre pressure, rolling on the asphalt, that gliding sound—phhhwwtphhhwwt—when the wheels go onto those painted stripes. It&#x27;s sound poetry, and also very dynamic.&quot;

&quot;Autobahn&quot; was co-written by Schult, whom Hütter asked to write some lyrics. The song&#x27;s lyrics are in German; Schneider reflected on this, stating: &quot;Part of our music is derived from the feeling of our language ... our method of speaking is interrupted, hard-edged if you want; a lot of consonants and noises&quot;. According to Hütter, their language was used like a musical instrument; he said: &quot;we are not singers in the sense of Rod Stewart, we use our voices as another instrument. Language is just another pattern of rhythm, it is one part of our unified sound.&quot; In a 1991 interview, Hütter stated that there was no expectations for the release of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, and that &quot;We played it to our friends, and a few of them said &#x27; You&#x27;ve gone crazy!&#x27;. We just put records out and see what happens, otherwise we&#x27;d end up over-calculating this or that.&quot; The album&#x27;s four other tracks are shorter electro-acoustic pieces. &quot;&quot; (&quot;Comet Melody&quot;) was inspired by Comet Kohoutek, which passed by Earth in 1973. Hütter said &quot;&quot; (&quot;Morning Walk&quot;) was influenced by the group&#x27;s early morning walk when leaving their studio after late-night sessions, when they observed the silence of their surroundings. The two-part &quot;&quot; was described as &quot;post-psychedelic kosmische&quot; by Chris Power in &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Autobahn&quot; was released in Germany in November 1974 by Philips Records as the third of the group&#x27;s three-album deal with the label. The album was released in the United States in January 1975, and the group&#x27;s first album to be released in the US. &quot;Autobahn&quot; charted in the US for 22 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top LPs and Tapes chart&quot; and peaked at number 5 on 3 May 1975. In the UK, the album was released by Phonogram with a blue-and-white motorway logo rather than Schult&#x27;s painted cover. The UK cover became the default sleeve on later reissues. &quot;Autobahn&quot; was digitally remastered for released on CD, LP and cassette in 1985. In 2009, Kraftwerk remastered and released eight of their albums, including &quot;Autobahn&quot;, as part of a compilation called &quot;The Catalogue&quot;.

A Chicago radio station was the first to play the single release of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, which it had received as an import. Jem Records in New Jersey imported a large quantity of the studio album, leading Vertigo Records to release both the single and the album in the US. The single cut of &quot;Autobahn&quot; became an international hit song in early 1975; only a small portion of the song was played on top-40 radio. The single version of &quot;Autobahn&quot; is three-and-a-half minutes long; Hütter stated cutting down the track was simple because it was &quot;loosely constructed, so making a short version was easy because you don&#x27;t have to worry so much about boundaries and continuity&quot;. Following the popularity of &quot;Autobahn&quot; in the US, Vertigo also released Kraftwerk&#x27;s earlier album &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot; (1973). Philips released &quot;Kometenmelodie 2&quot; as the album&#x27;s second single.

===Tour===
At the end of 1974, Kraftwerk had a short tour in West Germany; where the group remained a quartet, retaining Wolfgang Flür and hiring Karl Bartos, who replaced Roeder in the group. Bartos was a 22-year old music student at Robert Schumann Hochschule, Düsseldorf, who was hoping to become a percussionist with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. Bartos had played percussion at concerts in Germany with works by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel. Kraftwerk toured the US for three months, starting in April 1975. The US tour was followed by a seventeen-date tour of the UK in September. Bartos noted poor ticket sales for the British shows, recalling the group played to mostly empty halls in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, London, Bournemouth, Bath, Cardiff, Birmingham, and Liverpool.

During the tour, the material consisted mostly of music from &quot;Autobahn&quot; and some of their earlier material. The group had difficulties with their initial road crew, who were fired and replaced during the American tour. Issues also arose with the group&#x27;s equipment; synthesizers had to be turned on in the afternoon to be tuned for the evening, and lighting from rigs was strong enough to put the instruments out of tune. They also experienced problems with the differences in mains voltages between countries.

==Reception==
===Contemporaneous reviews===

According to Kraftwerk biographer Uwe Schütte, on its initial release in Germany, &quot;Autobahn&quot; was generally ignored by the mainstream German music press. The group invited members of the German rock press to drive with them and played &quot;Autobahn&quot; from the car&#x27;s speakers. Schult recalled the general response from these journalists was an emphatic &quot;So what!&quot; The only major publication that covered the album was the November 1974 issue of German magazine &quot;Sounds&quot;, in which reviewer Hans-Joachim Krüger called the album &quot;varied, and above all entertaining jaunt which particularly impresses listeners wearing headphones&quot;. In a review of a later Kraftwerk album, a reviewer credited as &quot;N.N.&quot; said of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, &quot;[S]omething like that doesn&#x27;t even deserve to be released&quot;. Flür said of the album&#x27;s initial critical reception: &quot;In Germany, artists are often not well regarded unless they&#x27;ve scored great achievements abroad&quot; and &quot;Our success in the US finally brought good headlines in the German newspapers&quot;.

In 2013, Jude Rogers of &quot;The Observer&quot; called some English-language responses to the album xenophobic. Rogers cited examples such as Barry Miles&#x27; live review of the band that was titled &quot;This is what your fathers fought to save you from&quot;, and an interview between Hütter and Lester Bangs in which Bangs asked if Kraftwerk were &quot;the final solution&quot; for music. When the &quot;NME&quot; printed Bangs&#x27; interview, a photograph of the group was superimposed over an image of a Nuremberg rally. Among contemporaneous reviews, John Mendelsohn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a negative review, finding it not as good as the music of Wendy Carlos, who &quot;hasn&#x27;t been in the Top Ten in months and months&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau gave the album a C+ rating, comparing it with the music of Mike Oldfield but said it was made &quot;for unmitigated simpletons, sort of, and yet in my mitigated way I don&#x27;t entirely disapprove&quot;.

Bill Provick of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; was initially hesitant about the group, stating he mocked &quot;Autobahn&quot; at first, but upon listening to it and &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot;, he called his initial reaction &quot;a bad mistake, a grave injustice and a sad example of the rock snobbery I always bemoan in others&quot;. Provick said the album &quot;works on two levels – as pleasing background atmosphere&quot; and &quot;upon closer listening as lovely escape route for the mind&quot;, finding &quot;Kraftwerk opting for calm competence rather than spectacular gimmickry – a nice change in the world of electronic music&quot;. Gary Deane of &quot;The Leader-Post&quot; said &quot;Autobahn&quot; was Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious and coherent [album] to date&quot;, and that the track &quot;Autobahn&quot; is repetitive due to its running time but added: &quot;the effect is deliberate and the periodic familiarly of the Autobahn&#x27;s scenery keeps the work together as a whole. It&#x27;s really quite fascinating and offers a new dimension to most our musical lives.&quot; Van Matre described the title track as &quot;an impression of the sounds and sensory perceptions of the road, at times nerve-wracking, at times as repetitious as the center dividing strip, but chiefly hypnotic&quot;; and called the track &quot;by far the finest and most accessible thing on the album&quot;. Van Matre also said the remaining tracks on the album are &quot;more experimental, less catchy – but it makes the whole thing worthwhile&quot;. Some critics such as Gerry Baker of &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; and Wayne Robins of &quot;Newsday&quot; included the album in their honorable mentions on their lists of the best albums of 1975.

===Retrospective reviews===
In 1985, Simon Witter wrote in the &quot;NME&quot; &quot;Autobahn&quot; is not as strong as Kraftwerk&#x27;s four subsequent albums but that it has &quot;enormous historical significance&quot;. Witter said: &quot;In the glam era of glitter and guitars, Kraftwerk were four besuited squares playing keyboards&quot;, and that the group was &quot;Mentally and sonically decades ahead of their contemporaries&quot;, noting their unique rhythms, textures and melodies. Simon Reynolds wrote in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995): &quot;Esoterics will claim they prefer the first three albums: they&#x27;re excellent, but truthfully &quot;Autobahn&quot; is when Kraftwerk&#x27;s muzak-of-the-sphere starts to matter&quot;. Reynolds said the title track &quot;sounds like a pastoral symphony, even as it hymns the exhilaration of cruising down the freeway&quot;.

David Cavanagh gave the 2009 remaster of &quot;Autobahn&quot; a five-star rating in &quot;Uncut&quot;, saying the title track is its main attraction and called the tracks &quot;freckled with warmth: sunny vocal harmonies (&quot;...mit Glitzerstrahl&quot;), a carefree flute solo (Schneider) and clever modulations (denoting gear-changes) to break the tension&quot;, Cavanagh called the remastering of the album a fiasco, and said it is worse than the compact discs previously released by EMI. Mat Snow wrote in &quot;Mojo&quot; the album is a &quot;pop landmark&quot; and a &quot;blueprint for their entire enterprise&quot;. Tom Ewing of Pitchfork commented positively on the album in their review of &quot;The Catalogue&quot;, noting tracks on the album are a showcase for Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;gift for simple, wistful melodies&quot; but said the themes explored on the album were done better on &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;. Other later album reviews, such as a four-star rating from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and a three-and-a-half star rating in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, were generally positive with no specific details on &quot;Autobahn&quot; Christgau upgraded his initial ranking of C+ for &quot;Autobahn&quot; to a B−. In the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, Stephen Dalton called &quot;Autobahn&quot; &quot;...a landmark in avant-garde pop minimalism&quot;.

==Legacy==

Kraftwerk later signed with EMI to establish the Kling Klang company. This worldwide licensing deal placed them with Electrola for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, EMI in the United Kingdom, Vertigo in the United States and Pathé-Marconi in France. Kraftwerk followed-up &quot;Autobahn&quot; with &quot;Radio-Activity&quot;, which was released in 1975. Kraftwerk did not repeat the high sales of &quot;Autobahn&quot; on any subsequent album in the 1970s but were one of the most commercially successful groups in their style, selling well throughout Europe. Hütter and Schneider later dismissed Kraftwerk&#x27;s earlier music; according to Hütter, &quot;Autobahn&quot; was &quot;really the first&quot;, and Schneider called the earlier music &quot;history, archaeology&quot;. 
&quot;Autobahn&quot; was Conny Plank&#x27;s final work with Kraftwerk. At the home studio where he worked on &quot;Autobahn&quot;, Plank later worked with groups and artists such as Killing Joke, Clannad, Brian Eno, The Eurythmics and Devo, as well as German groups such as Neu! and DAF.

In his review of &quot;Sequencer&quot; (1976) by Synergy, critic Michael Hooker noted the increasing interest in synthesizer composition since the release of &quot;Autobahn&quot;. Other artists, such as David Bowie, began noting &quot;Autobahn&quot; as an influence. Bowie said: &quot;the preponderance of electronic instruments convinced me that this was an area that I had to investigate a little further&quot;. Michael Rother stated &quot;Autobahn&quot; had an impact on his band Harmonia, and led him to starting thinking about adding voices on tracks; he said: &quot;on Harmonia&#x27;s &quot;Deluxe&quot; you can hear an echo of that&quot;. Producer Arthur Baker first heard Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Autobahn&quot; when working at record store in high school; he later used a medley of the group&#x27;s songs for &quot;Planet Rock&quot; for Afrika Bambaataa.

According to Patrick Codenys of the band Front 242, in the early 1970s most &quot;creative groups, were virtuosos like King Crimson and Yes whose music was based around sophisticated jam sessions. When I bought &quot;Autobahn&quot; I had the feeling that it was changing. For the first time, it was music that was impossible to touch – not being made up with the usual components of rock.&quot; Codenys said the music was made by only one person, which helped encourage him to make music on his own. Music critic Simon Frith stated disco heralded the future of music, and said &quot;Autobahn&quot; was the bridge between five minutes of unchanging rhythms of AM radio and the 24-hour concerts by avant-garde musicians like Terry Riley. Author Thomas Jerome Seabrook named the album among the &quot;finest kosmische records.&quot; In 2014, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a diverse collection to represent historically significant recordings that reflect the changing climate of music through the decades.

<text>The Minimoog is an analog synthesizer first manufactured by Moog Music between 1970 and 1981. Designed as a more affordable, portable version of the modular Moog synthesizer, it was the first synthesizer sold in retail stores. It was first popular with progressive rock and jazz musicians and found wide use in disco, pop, rock and electronic music.

Production of the Minimoog stopped in the early 1980s after the sale of Moog Music. In 2002, founder Robert Moog regained the rights to the Moog brand, bought the company, and released an updated version of the Minimoog, the Minimoog Voyager. In 2016 and in 2022, Moog Music released another new version of the original Minimoog.

== Development ==

In the 1960s, RA Moog Co manufactured Moog synthesizers, which helped bring electronic sounds to music but remained inaccessible to ordinary people. These modular synthesizers were difficult to use and required users to connect components manually with patch cables to create sounds. They were also sensitive to temperature and humidity, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Most were owned by universities or record labels, and used to create soundtracks or jingles; by 1970, only 28 were owned by musicians.

Hoping to create a smaller, more reliable synthesizer, Moog engineer Bill Hemsath created a prototype by sawing a keyboard in half and wiring several components into a small cabinet. Moog president Robert Moog felt the prototype was fun, but did not initially see a market for it. Moog and the engineers created several more prototypes, adding features such as the suitcase design to aid portability.

In early 1970, Moog Co began losing money as interest in its modular synthesizers fell. Fearing they would lose their jobs if the company closed, the engineers developed a version of Hemsath&#x27;s miniature synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D, while Moog was away. Moog chastised them, but came to see the potential in the Model D and authorized its production.

As the engineers could not properly stabilize the power supply, the Minimoog&#x27;s three oscillators were never completely synchronized. Although unintentional, this created the synthesizer&#x27;s &quot;warm, rich&quot; sound. Its voltage-controlled filter was unique, allowing users to shape sounds to create &quot;everything from blistering, funky bass blurps ... to spacey whistle lead tones&quot;. The Minimoog also was the first synthesizer to feature a pitch wheel, which allows players to bend notes as a guitarist or saxophonist does, allowing for more expressive playing. Moog&#x27;s associate David Borden felt that Moog would have become extremely wealthy had he patented the pitch wheel.

== Release ==
Moog Co released the first Minimoog in 1970. Moog said it was conceived as a portable tool for session musicians, and the team expected to sell &quot;maybe 100 of them&quot;. Moog became acquainted with former evangelist and musician David Van Koevering, who was so impressed with the Minimoog that he began demonstrating it to musicians and music stores. Van Koevering&#x27;s friend Glen Bell, founder of the restaurant chain Taco Bell, allowed him to use a building on a private island Bell owned in Florida. There, Van Koevering hosted an event he billed as Island of Electronicus, a &quot;pseudo-psychedelic experience that brought counterculture (minus the drugs) to straight families and connected it with the sound of the Minimoog&quot;. 

The Minimoog was the first synthesizer sold in retail stores. Despite the success, the company could not afford to meet demand, nor had credit for a loan, and in November 1971 Moog sold R. A. Moog, Inc. to rival company muSonics and stayed on as an employee until 1976. Van Koevering was hired as head of sales and marketing, expanding the sales of the Minimoog worldwide. The Minimoog was in continuous production for 13 years and over 12,000 were made. Production of the Minimoog stopped in July 1981. In 1993, Moog Co ceased all production.

=== Later models ===
In the 1980s, the rights to use the Moog Music name in the United Kingdom were purchased by Alex Winter of Caerphilly, Wales, who commenced limited production of an updated Minimoog in 1998 as the Moog Minimoog 204E. The 204E added pulse width modulation and MIDI to the Model D specification.
In 2002, Robert Moog reacquired the rights to the Moog name and bought the company. In 2002, Moog Co released the Minimoog Voyager, an updated version of the Minimoog that sold more than 14,000 units, more than the original Minimoog. Although the Welsh incarnation of Moog Music went into administration shortly afterwards, Winter retained the rights to the Moog name in the UK, with the result that the Minimoog Voyager was launched there as the Voyager by Bob Moog.

In 2016, Moog Music began manufacturing an updated version of the Model D, with an independent LFO and MIDI, and an aftertouch and velocity-sensitive keyboard. Production ended around August 2017, after a little under a year. In 2018, Moog Music released the Minimoog Model D app for iOS. In 2022, after being out of production for over five years, the Model D was reissued a third time. The basic architecture remained the same as the previous version, but also included new features like a spring-loaded pitch-bend wheel and updates to the previous unit&#x27;s MIDI specs.

== Impact ==
According to TJ Pinch, author of &quot;Analog Days&quot;, the Minimoog was the first synthesizer to become a &quot;classic&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; described it as &quot;the most famous synthesizer in music history ... a ubiquitous analog keyboard that can be heard in countless pop, rock, hip-hop, and techno tracks from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s&quot;. It was also important for its portability. David Borden, an associate of Moog, said that the Minimoog &quot;took the synthesizer out of the studio and put it into the concert hall&quot;. According to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Tweaked now so that the synthesizer could reliably perform as either a melodic lead or propulsive bass instrument (rather than just as a complex sound-generating machine), the Minimoog changed everything ... the Moogs oozed character. Their sound could be quirky, kitsch and cute, or pulverising, but it was always identifiable as Moog.&quot;

The Minimoog changed the dynamics of rock bands. For the first time, keyboardists could play solos in the style of lead guitarists, or play synthesized basslines. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman said: &quot;For the first time you could go on [stage] and give the guitarist a run for his money... A guitarist would say, &#x27;Oh shoot, he&#x27;s got a Minimoog,&#x27; so they&#x27;re looking for eleven on their volume control - it&#x27;s the only way they can compete.&quot; Wakeman said the instrument &quot;absolutely changed the face of music&quot;.

The Minimoog took a place in mainstream black music, most notably in the work of Stevie Wonder. Its use for basslines became particularly popular in funk, as in the Parliament track &quot;Flash Light&quot;. It was also popular in jazz, and Sun Ra became perhaps the first musician to perform and record with the instrument (on his 1970 album &quot;My Brother the Wind&quot;). Herbie Hancock, Dick Hyman and Chick Corea were other early adopters.

The Minimoog became a staple of progressive rock. In the early 1970s, Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer added the Minimoog to his modular &#x27;Monster Moog&#x27; as an occasional part of his performances. Wakeman used five Minimoogs on stage so he could play different sounds without having to reconfigure them. It was also used by electronic artists such as Kraftwerk, who used it on their albums &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; (1978)&quot;,&quot; and later by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Gary Numan. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, it was widely used in the emerging disco genre by artists including ABBA and Giorgio Moroder.

In 2005, the Minimoog was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot; In 2012, to celebrate Bob Moog&#x27;s birthday, Google created an interactive Minimoog softsynth web application as its Google Doodle.

In 2024, JoE Silva published a 384-page coffee table book about the Minimoog, &quot;The Minimoog Book&quot;.

<doc id="173283" wikidata="Q146123" url="?curid=173283" title="Poly(methyl methacrylate)">
<text>Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a synthetic polymer derived from methyl methacrylate. It is a transparent thermoplastic, used as an engineering plastic. PMMA is also known as acrylic, acrylic glass, as well as by the trade names and brands Crylux, Hesalite, Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex, among several others (see below). This plastic is often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. It can also be used as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and for many other purposes.

It is often technically classified as a type of glass, in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance—hence its occasional historic designation as &quot;acrylic glass&quot;.

==History==

The first acrylic acid was created in 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was formulated in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. 

It was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William R. Conn, Otto Röhm, and Walter Bauer, and first brought to market in 1933 by German &quot;Röhm &amp; Haas AG&quot; (as of January 2019, part of Evonik Industries) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas.

Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the United Kingdom. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Röhm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 ICI Acrylics (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windscreen, canopies, and gun turrets. Scraps of acrylic were also used to make clear pistol grips for the M1911A1 pistol or clear handle grips for the M1 bayonet or theater knifes so that soldiers could put small photos of loved ones or pin-up girls&#x27; pictures inside. They were called &quot;Sweetheart Grips&quot; or &quot;Pin-up Grips&quot;. Others were used to make handles for theater knives made from scrap materials. Civilian applications followed after the war.

== Names ==

Common orthographic stylings include &quot;polymethyl methacrylate&quot; and &quot;polymethylmethacrylate&quot;. The full IUPAC chemical name is poly(methyl 2-methylpropoate), although it is a common mistake to use &quot;an&quot; instead of &quot;en&quot;.

Although PMMA is often called simply &quot;acrylic&quot;, &quot;acrylic&quot; can also refer to other polymers or copolymers containing polyacrylonitrile. Notable trade names and brands include Acrylite, Altuglas, Astariglas, Cho Chen, Crystallite, Cyrolite, Hesalite (when used in Omega watches), Lucite, Optix, Oroglas, PerClax, Perspex, Plexiglas, R-Cast, and Sumipex.

PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than impact strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate and is a far better choice for laser cutting. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.

== Properties ==

PMMA is a strong, tough, and lightweight material. It has a density of 1.17–1.20 g/cm, which is approximately half that of glass, which is generally, depending on composition, 2.2–2.53 g/cm. It also has good impact strength, higher than both glass and polystyrene, but significantly lower than polycarbonate and some engineered polymers. PMMA ignites at and burns, forming carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and low-molecular-weight compounds, including formaldehyde.

PMMA transmits up to 92% of visible light ( thickness), and gives a reflection of about 4% from each of its surfaces due to its refractive index (1.4905 at 589.3nm). It filters ultraviolet (UV) light at wavelengths below about 300 nm (similar to ordinary window glass). Some manufacturers add coatings or additives to PMMA to improve absorption in the 300–400 nm range. PMMA passes infrared light of up to 2,800 nm and blocks IR of longer wavelengths up to 25,000 nm. Colored PMMA varieties allow specific IR wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light (for remote control or heat sensor applications, for example).

PMMA swells and dissolves in many organic solvents; it also has poor resistance to many other chemicals due to its easily hydrolyzed ester groups. Nevertheless, its environmental stability is superior to most other plastics such as polystyrene and polyethylene, and therefore it is often the material of choice for outdoor applications.

PMMA has a maximum water absorption ratio of 0.3–0.4% by weight. Tensile strength decreases with increased water absorption. Its coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively high at (5–10)×10 °C.

The Futuro house was made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic, polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methylmethacrylate); one of them was found to be degrading by cyanobacteria and Archaea.

PMMA can be joined using cyanoacrylate cement (commonly known as superglue), with heat (welding), or by using chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane or trichloromethane (chloroform) to dissolve the plastic at the joint, which then fuses and sets, forming an almost invisible weld. Scratches may easily be removed by polishing or by heating the surface of the material. Laser cutting may be used to form intricate designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very clean cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable &quot;stress-crazing&quot; at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.

In the majority of applications, PMMA will not shatter. Rather, it breaks into large dull pieces. Since PMMA is softer and more easily scratched than glass, scratch-resistant coatings are often added to PMMA sheets to protect it (as well as possible other functions).

Pure poly(methyl methacrylate) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product, since it is not optimized for most applications. Rather, modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers, additives, and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required. For example:

* A small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in PMMA grades destined for heat processing, since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization (&quot;unzipping&quot;) during processing.
* Comonomers such as butyl acrylate are often added to improve impact strength.
* Comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications.
* Plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties, lower the glass transition temperature, improve impact properties, and improve mechanical properties such as elastic modulus 
* Dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications, or to protect against (or filter) UV light.
* Fillers may be substituted to reduce cost.

== Synthesis and processing ==

PMMA is routinely produced by emulsion polymerization, solution polymerization, and bulk polymerization. Generally, radical initiation is used (including living polymerization methods), but anionic polymerization of PMMA can also be performed.

The glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;) of atactic PMMA is . The &quot;T&quot; values of commercial grades of PMMA range from ; the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions that are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate. PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its &quot;T&quot;. The forming temperature starts at the glass transition temperature and goes up from there. All common molding processes may be used, including injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion. The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by cell casting, but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently. The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high molecular mass. Rubber toughening has been used to increase the toughness of PMMA to overcome its brittle behavior in response to applied loads.

== Applications ==

Being transparent and durable, PMMA is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles, appliances, and lenses for glasses. PMMA in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows, skylights, bulletproof security barriers, signs and displays, sanitary ware (bathtubs), LCD screens, furniture and many other applications. It is also used for coating polymers based on MMA provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of VOC. Methacrylate polymers are used extensively in medical and dental applications where purity and stability are critical to performance.

=== Glass substitute ===
* PMMA is commonly used for constructing residential and commercial aquariums. Designers started building large aquariums when poly(methyl methacrylate) could be used. It is less often used in other building types due to incidents such as the Summerland disaster.
* PMMA is used for viewing ports and even complete pressure hulls of submersibles, such as the &quot;Alicia&quot; submarine&#x27;s viewing sphere and the window of the bathyscaphe Trieste.
* PMMA is used in the lenses of exterior lights of automobiles.
* Spectator protection in ice hockey rinks is made from PMMA.
* Historically, PMMA was an important improvement in the design of aircraft windows, making possible such designs as the bombardier&#x27;s transparent nose compartment in the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Modern aircraft transparencies often use stretched acrylic plies.
* Police vehicles for riot control often have the regular glass replaced with PMMA to protect the occupants from thrown objects.
* PMMA is an important material in the making of certain lighthouse lenses.
* PMMA was used for the roofing of the compound in the Olympic Park for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. It enabled a light and translucent construction of the structure.
* PMMA (under the brand name &quot;Lucite&quot;) was used for the ceiling of the Houston Astrodome.

=== Daylight redirection ===
* Laser cut acrylic panels have been used to redirect sunlight into a light pipe or tubular skylight and, from there, to spread it into a room. Their developers Veronica Garcia Hansen, Ken Yeang, and Ian Edmonds were awarded the Far East Economic Review Innovation Award in bronze for this technology in 2003.
* Attenuation being quite strong for distances over one meter (more than 90% intensity loss for a 3000 K source), acrylic broadband light guides are then dedicated mostly to decorative uses.
* Pairs of acrylic sheets with a layer of microreplicated prisms between the sheets can have reflective and refractive properties that let them redirect part of incoming sunlight in dependence on its angle of incidence. Such panels act as miniature light shelves. Such panels have been commercialized for purposes of daylighting, to be used as a window or a canopy such that sunlight descending from the sky is directed to the ceiling or into the room rather than to the floor. This can lead to a higher illumination of the back part of a room, in particular when combined with a white ceiling, while having a slight impact on the view to the outside compared to normal glazing.

=== Medicine ===

* PMMA has a good degree of compatibility with human tissue, and it is used in the manufacture of rigid intraocular lenses which are implanted in the eye when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts. This compatibility was discovered by the English ophthalmologist Harold Ridley in WWII RAF pilots, whose eyes had been riddled with PMMA splinters coming from the side windows of their Supermarine Spitfire fighters – the plastic scarcely caused any rejection, compared to glass splinters coming from aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane. Ridley had a lens manufactured by the Rayner company (Brighton &amp; Hove, East Sussex) made from Perspex polymerised by ICI. On 29 November 1949 at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, Ridley implanted the first intraocular lens at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in London.
In particular, acrylic-type lenses are useful for cataract surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation (uveitis), as acrylic material induces less inflammation.
* Eyeglass lenses are commonly made from PMMA.
* Historically, hard contact lenses were frequently made of this material. Soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer, where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyl groups make them hydrophilic.
* In orthopedic surgery, PMMA bone cement is used to affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA is considered to be an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. Bone cement acts like a grout and not so much like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant; rather, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated.
* In cosmetic surgery, tiny PMMA microspheres suspended in some biological fluid are injected as a soft-tissue filler under the skin to reduce wrinkles or scars permanently. PMMA as a soft-tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with HIV-related facial wasting. PMMA is used illegally to shape muscles by some bodybuilders.
* Plombage is an outdated treatment of tuberculosis where the pleural space around an infected lung was filled with PMMA balls, in order to compress and collapse the affected lung.
* Emerging biotechnology and biomedical research use PMMA to create microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices, which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids. These small geometries are amenable to using PMMA in a biochip fabrication process and offers moderate biocompatibility.
* Bioprocess chromatography columns use cast acrylic tubes as an alternative to glass and stainless steel. These are pressure rated and satisfy stringent requirements of materials for biocompatibility, toxicity, and extractables.

=== Dentistry ===
Due to its aforementioned biocompatibility, poly(methyl methacrylate) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry, particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics, artificial teeth, and orthodontic appliances.

* Acrylic prosthetic construction: Pre-polymerized, powdered PMMA spheres are mixed with a Methyl Methacrylate liquid monomer, Benzoyl Peroxide (initiator), and NN-Dimethyl-P-Toluidine (accelerator), and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized PMMA structure. Through the use of injection molding techniques, wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients&#x27; mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition. PMMA polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis, and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process. Pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage, ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis. Though other methods of polymerizing PMMA for prosthetic fabrication exist, such as chemical and microwave resin activation, the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage.
* Artificial teeth: While denture teeth can be made of several different materials, PMMA is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics. Mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics, easy surface adjustments, decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity, and minimal wear against opposing teeth. Additionally, since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using PMMA, adherence of PMMA denture teeth to PMMA denture bases is unparalleled, leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic.

=== Art and aesthetics ===


* Acrylic paint essentially consists of PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is hydrophobic, a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension.
* Modern furniture makers, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic, incorporated Lucite and other PMMA products into their designs, especially office chairs. Many other products (for example, guitars) are sometimes made with acrylic glass to make the commonly opaque objects translucent.
* Perspex has been used as a surface to paint on, for example by Salvador Dalí.
* Diasec is a process which uses acrylic glass as a substitute for normal glass in picture frames. This is done for its relatively low cost, light weight, shatter-resistance, aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard picture framing glass.
* As early as 1939, Los Angeles-based Dutch sculptor Jan De Swart experimented with samples of Lucite sent to him by DuPont; De Swart created tools to work the Lucite for sculpture and mixed chemicals to bring about certain effects of color and refraction.
* From approximately the 1960s onward, sculptors and glass artists such as Jan Kubíček, Leroy Lamis, and Frederick Hart began using acrylics, especially taking advantage of the material&#x27;s flexibility, light weight, cost and its capacity to refract and filter light.
* In the 1950s and 1960s, Lucite was an extremely popular material for jewelry, with several companies specialized in creating high-quality pieces from this material. Lucite beads and ornaments are still sold by jewelry suppliers.
* Acrylic sheets are produced in dozens of standard colors, most commonly sold using color numbers developed by Rohm &amp; Haas in the 1950s.


Methyl methacrylate &quot;synthetic resin&quot; for casting (simply the bulk liquid chemical) may be used in conjunction with a polymerization catalyst such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), to produce hardened transparent PMMA in any shape, from a mold. Objects like insects or coins, or even dangerous chemicals in breakable quartz ampules, may be embedded in such &quot;cast&quot; blocks, for display and safe handling.

=== Other uses ===


* PMMA, in the commercial form Technovit 7200 is used vastly in the medical field. It is used for plastic histology, electron microscopy, as well as many more uses.
* PMMA has been used to create ultra-white opaque membranes that are flexible and switch appearance to transparent when wet.
* Acrylic is used in tanning beds as the transparent surface that separates the occupant from the tanning bulbs while tanning. The type of acrylic used in tanning beds is most often formulated from a special type of polymethyl methacrylate, a compound that allows the passage of ultraviolet rays.
* Sheets of PMMA are commonly used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from . These letters may be used alone to represent a company&#x27;s name and/or logo, or they may be a component of illuminated channel letters. Acrylic is also used extensively throughout the sign industry as a component of wall signs where it may be a backplate, painted on the surface or the backside, a faceplate with additional raised lettering or even photographic images printed directly to it, or a spacer to separate sign components.
* PMMA was used in Laserdisc optical media. (CDs and DVDs use both acrylic and polycarbonate for impact resistance).
* It is used as a light guide for the backlights in TFT-LCDs.
* Plastic optical fiber used for short-distance communication is made from PMMA, and perfluorinated PMMA, clad with fluorinated PMMA, in situations where its flexibility and cheaper installation costs outweigh its poor heat tolerance and higher attenuation versus glass fiber.
* PMMA, in a purified form, is used as the matrix in laser dye-doped organic solid-state gain media for tunable solid state dye lasers.
* In semiconductor research and industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the electron beam lithography process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this can be made by an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA&#x27;s advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.
* PMMA is used as a shield to stop beta radiation emitted from radioisotopes.
* Small strips of PMMA are used as dosimeter devices during the Gamma Irradiation process. The optical properties of PMMA change as the gamma dose increases, and can be measured with a spectrophotometer.
* Blacklight-reactive UV tattoos may use tattoo ink made with PMMA microcapsules and fluorescent dyes.
* In the 1960s, luthier Dan Armstrong developed a line of electric guitars and basses whose bodies were made completely of acrylic. These instruments were marketed under the Ampeg brand. Ibanez and B.C. Rich have also made acrylic guitars.
* Ludwig-Musser makes a line of acrylic drums called Vistalites, well known as being used by Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham.
* Artificial nails in the &quot;acrylic&quot; type often include PMMA powder.
* Some modern briar, and occasionally meerschaum, tobacco pipes sport stems made of Lucite.
* PMMA technology is utilized in roofing and waterproofing applications. By incorporating a polyester fleece sandwiched between two layers of catalyst-activated PMMA resin, a fully reinforced liquid membrane is created &quot;in situ&quot;.
* PMMA is a widely used material to create deal toys and financial tombstones.
* PMMA is used by the Sailor Pen Company of Kure, Japan, in their standard models of gold-nib fountain pens, specifically as the cap and body material.

<text>{4} a^2&lt;/math&gt;
| angle = 60°
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length, and all three angles are equal. Because of these properties, the equilateral triangle is a regular polygon, occasionally known as the regular triangle. It is the special case of an isosceles triangle by modern definition, creating more special properties.

The equilateral triangle can be found in various tilings, and in polyhedrons such as the deltahedron and antiprism. It appears in real life in popular culture, architecture, and the study of stereochemistry resembling the molecular known as the trigonal planar molecular geometry.

== Properties ==
An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has three equal sides. It is a special case of an isosceles triangle in the modern definition, stating that an isosceles triangle is defined at least as having two equal sides. Based on the modern definition, this leads to an equilateral triangle in which one of the three sides may be considered its base.

The follow-up definition above may result in more precise properties. For example, since the perimeter of an isosceles triangle is the sum of its two legs and base, the equilateral triangle is formulated as three times its side. The internal angle of an equilateral triangle are equal, 60°. Because of these properties, the equilateral triangles are regular polygons. The cevians of an equilateral triangle are all equal in length, resulting in the median and angle bisector being equal in length, considering those lines as their altitude depending on the base&#x27;s choice. When the equilateral triangle is flipped across its altitude or rotated around its center for one-third of a full turn, its appearance is unchanged; it has the symmetry of a dihedral group formula_1 of order six. Other properties are discussed below.

=== Area ===

The area of an equilateral triangle with edge length formula_2 is
formula_3
The formula may be derived from the formula of an isosceles triangle by Pythagoras theorem: the altitude formula_4 of a triangle is the square root of the difference of squares of a side and half of a base. Since the base and the legs are equal, the height is:
formula_5
In general, the area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height. The formula of the area of an equilateral triangle can be obtained by substituting the altitude formula. Another way to prove the area of an equilateral triangle is by using the trigonometric function. The area of a triangle is formulated as the half product of base and height and the sine of an angle. Because all of the angles of an equilateral triangle are 60°, the formula is as desired.

A version of the isoperimetric inequality for triangles states that the triangle of greatest area among all those with a given perimeter is equilateral. That is, for perimeter formula_6 and area formula_7, the equality holds for the equilateral triangle:
formula_8

=== Relationship with circles ===
The radius of the circumscribed circle is:
formula_9
and the radius of the inscribed circle is half of the circumradius:
formula_10

The theorem of Euler states that the distance formula_11 between circumradius and inradius is formulated as formula_12. As a corollary of this, the equilateral triangle has the smallest ratio of the circumradius formula_13 to the inradius formula_14 of any triangle. That is:
formula_15

Pompeiu&#x27;s theorem states that, if formula_16 is an arbitrary point in the plane of an equilateral triangle formula_17 but not on its circumcircle, then there exists a triangle with sides of lengths formula_18, formula_19, and formula_20. That is, formula_18, formula_19, and formula_20 satisfy the triangle inequality that the sum of any two of them is greater than the third. If formula_16 is on the circumcircle then the sum of the two smaller ones equals the longest and the triangle has degenerated into a line, this case is known as Van Schooten&#x27;s theorem.

A packing problem asks the objective of formula_25 circles packing into the smallest possible equilateral triangle. The optimal solutions show formula_26 that can be packed into the equilateral triangle, but the open conjectures expand to formula_27.

=== Other mathematical properties ===

Morley&#x27;s trisector theorem states that, in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle.

Viviani&#x27;s theorem states that, for any interior point formula_16 in an equilateral triangle with distances formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31 from the sides and altitude formula_32, formula_33 independent of the location of formula_16.

An equilateral triangle may have integer sides with three rational angles as measured in degrees, known for the only acute triangle that is similar to its orthic triangle (with vertices at the feet of the altitudes), and the only triangle whose Steiner inellipse is a circle (specifically, the incircle). The triangle of the largest area of all those inscribed in a given circle is equilateral, and the triangle of the smallest area of all those circumscribed around a given circle is also equilateral. It is the only regular polygon aside from the square that can be inscribed inside any other regular polygon.

Given a point formula_35 in the interior of an equilateral triangle, the ratio of the sum of its distances from the vertices to the sum of its distances from the sides is greater than or equal to 2, equality holding when formula_16 is the centroid. In no other triangle is there a point for which this ratio is as small as 2. This is the Erdős–Mordell inequality; a stronger variant of it is Barrow&#x27;s inequality, which replaces the perpendicular distances to the sides with the distances from formula_16 to the points where the angle bisectors of formula_38, formula_39, and formula_40 cross the sides (formula_41, formula_42, and formula_43 being the vertices). There are numerous other triangle inequalities that hold equality if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

== Construction ==

The equilateral triangle can be constructed in different ways by using circles. The very first proposition in the &quot;Elements&quot; by Euclid starts by drawing a circle with a certain radius, placing the point of the compass on the circle, and drawing another circle with the same radius; the two circles intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by joining the two centers of the circles and one of the points of intersection.

An alternative way to construct an equilateral triangle is by using Fermat prime. A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form
formula_44
wherein formula_45 denotes the non-negative integer, and there are five known Fermat primes: 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. A regular polygon is constructible by compass and straightedge if and only if the odd prime factors of its number of sides are distinct Fermat primes. To do so geometrically, draw a straight line and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, then swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment; repeat with the other side of the line, which connects the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment in the aftermath.

If three equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of an arbitrary triangle, either all outward or inward, by Napoleon&#x27;s theorem the centers of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle.

== Appearances ==
=== In other related figures ===

Notably, the equilateral triangle tiles the Euclidean plane with six triangles meeting at a vertex; the dual of this tessellation is the hexagonal tiling. Truncated hexagonal tiling, rhombitrihexagonal tiling, trihexagonal tiling, snub square tiling, and snub hexagonal tiling are all semi-regular tessellations constructed with equilateral triangles. Other two-dimensional objects built from equilateral triangles include the Sierpiński triangle (a fractal shape constructed from an equilateral triangle by subdividing recursively into smaller equilateral triangles) and Reuleaux triangle (a curved triangle with constant width, constructed from an equilateral triangle by rounding each of its sides).
Equilateral triangles may also form a polyhedron in three dimensions. A polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles is called a deltahedron. There are eight strictly convex deltahedra: three of the five Platonic solids (regular tetrahedron, regular octahedron, and regular icosahedron) and five of the 92 Johnson solids (triangular bipyramid, pentagonal bipyramid, snub disphenoid, triaugmented triangular prism, and gyroelongated square bipyramid). More generally, all Johnson solids have equilateral triangles among their faces, though most also have other other regular polygons.

The antiprisms are a family of polyhedra incorporating a band of alternating triangles. When the antiprism is uniform, its bases are regular and all triangular faces are equilateral.

As a generalization, the equilateral triangle belongs to the infinite family of formula_46-simplexes, with formula_47.
=== Applications ===

Equilateral triangles have frequently appeared in man-made constructions and in popular culture. In architecture, an example can be seen in the cross-section of the Gateway Arch and the surface of the Vegreville egg. It appears in the flag of Nicaragua and the flag of the Philippines. It is a shape of a variety of road signs, including the yield sign.

The equilateral triangle occurs in the study of stereochemistry. It can be described as the molecular geometry in which one atom in the center connects three other atoms in a plane, known as the trigonal planar molecular geometry.

In the Thomson problem, concerning the minimum-energy configuration of formula_46 charged particles on a sphere, and for the Tammes problem of constructing a spherical code maximizing the smallest distance among the points, the best solution known for formula_49 places the points at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, inscribed in the sphere. This configuration is proven optimal for the Tammes problem, but a rigorous solution to this instance of the Thomson problem is unknown.

<doc id="173286" wikidata="Q2347693" url="?curid=173286" title="Extropianism">
<text>Extropianism, also referred to as the philosophy of extropy, is an &quot;evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition&quot;. Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or by volunteering to test new technology.

Originated by a set of principles developed by the philosopher Max More in &quot;The Principles of Extropy&quot;, extropian thinking places strong emphasis on rational thinking and on practical optimism. According to More, these principles &quot;do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies&quot;. Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting considerable advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and the like. Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of indefinite lifespans or immortality, and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology or mind uploading, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of cryonics.

== Extropy ==
The term extropy, as defined by Max More, is &quot;The extent of a living or organizational system’s intelligence, functional order, vitality, and capacity and drive for improvement&quot;. It means the opposite of entropy, metaphorically interpreted as the tendency to degenerate and die out. Extropianism is &quot;the philosophy that seeks to increase extropy&quot;.

== Extropy Institute ==
In 1986, More joined Alcor, a cryonics company, and helped establish (along with Michael Price, Garret Smyth and Luigi Warren) the first European cryonics organization, Mizar Limited (later Alcor UK). In 1987, More moved to Los Angeles from Oxford University in England to work on his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Southern California.

In 1988, &quot;Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought&quot; was first published. (For the first few issues, it was &quot;Extropy: Vaccine for Future Shock&quot;.) This brought together thinkers with interests in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, life extension, mind uploading, idea futures, robotics, space exploration, memetics, and the politics and economics of transhumanism. Alternative media organizations soon began reviewing the magazine, and it attracted interest from like-minded thinkers. Later, More and Tom Bell co-founded the Extropy Institute (ExI), a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization. The institute was formed as a transhumanist networking and information center to use current scientific understanding along with critical and creative thinking to define a small set of principles or values that could help make sense of new capabilities opening up to humanity.

In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute made a decision to close the organisation, stating that its mission was &quot;essentially completed.&quot;

<doc id="173290" wikidata="Q827306" url="?curid=173290" title="Proton Holdings">
<text>Proton Holdings Berhad, commonly known as Proton (stylised PROTON), is a Malaysian multinational automotive company. Proton was established on 7 May 1983, as Malaysia&#x27;s sole national budget car company until the advent of Perodua in 1993. The company is headquartered in Shah Alam, Selangor, and operates additional facilities in Proton City, Perak.

Proton began manufacturing rebadged versions of Mitsubishi Motors (MMC) products in the 1980s and 1990s. Proton produced its first indigenously designed, non-badge-engineered car in 2000 with a Mitsubishi engine. It elevated Malaysia as the 11th country in the world with the capability to design cars from the ground up. Since the 2000s, Proton has produced a mix of locally engineered and badge-engineered vehicles.

Proton was founded under majority ownership by HICOM, with a minority stake being held by Mitsubishi Group members. By 2005, Mitsubishi had divested its stake in Proton to Khazanah Nasional. In 2012, Proton was fully acquired by DRB-HICOM. Proton was the owner of Lotus Cars from 1996 to 2017. In May 2017, DRB-HICOM announced plans to sell a 49.9% stake in Proton and a 51% stake in Lotus to Chinese company Geely. The deal was signed in June 2017, and Lotus has ceased to be a unit of Proton.

== Etymology ==
Proton is a Malay backronym for &quot;Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional&quot; (National Automobile Enterprise).

== History ==

=== 1980s ===
The concept of a national car was conceived in 1979 by then-Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato&#x27; Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, now Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, with the goal of enhancing the Malaysian automotive industry. The National Car Project was approved by the Cabinet in 1982, leading to the equity investment of Proton on May 7, 1983, with Mitsubishi Corporation for the future of the company. At its creation, it was wholly owned by the government of Malaysia through Khazanah Nasional. It was headed by its founder, Dr. Mahathir. Proton approached Mitsubishi Motors between 1983 and 1984 and brokered a joint venture between both companies for the production of the first Malaysian car. The result of the collaboration was the Proton Saga, which launched on July 9, 1985.

The Proton Saga was based on the second-generation 1983 Mitsubishi Lancer Fiore 4-door saloon, powered by a 1.3-liter Mitsubishi Orion 4G13 engine. The first Proton Saga to roll off the production line in Shah Alam is preserved in the National Museum () as a symbol of the beginning of the Malaysian automotive industry. Sales of the new Saga outstripped supply, and Proton struggled to meet the growing demand, but by mid-1986, it had captured a 64% majority domestic market share in the &quot;below 1600cc segment.&quot; Later in October 1987, a hatchback variant called the Proton Saga Aeroback was launched and had a more powerful 1.5L Mitsubishi 4G15 engine and a redesigned rear-end. Exports to Ireland began in 1988, and by March 1989, Proton had entered the United Kingdom car market with the Saga saloon and hatchback duo, where the Malaysian company set the record for the &quot;Fastest Selling Make of New Car Ever to Enter the United Kingdom.&quot;

Proton&#x27;s sales declined during the late 1980s as a result of the worldwide economic recession, and the lack of technical expertise in Proton&#x27;s management. Kenji Iwabuchi, a former Mitsubishi Motors executive, was appointed as the managing director of Proton in 1988.

=== 1990s ===
On 15 August 1992, the Proton Saga Iswara was launched. It shares the older Mitsubishi platform used in the original Proton Saga, but its exterior and interior styling are unique to Proton. The Saga Iswara was widely used as taxicabs in Malaysia during the 1990s and 2000s, and many continue in service.
On 21 May 1993 the Proton Wira was introduced. It is based on the fourth-generation 1991 Mitsubishi Lancer and was sold in a four-door saloon guise at launch. The Proton Wira Aeroback, a five-door hatchback variant featuring a Proton-designed rear-end joined the range in 1993. By 1996, the Wira saloon and hatchback shared six different engines, all of which were sourced from Mitsubishi Motors. The engines included the 4G13 1.3L and 4G15 1.5L carried over from the Proton Saga, the newer 4G92 1.6L, 4G93 SOHC and DOHC 1.8L and the 4D68 2.0L diesel. The Wira was the first Proton car to be produced in right-hand drive (RHD) and left-hand drive (LHD) configurations, and remains the only Proton car to have been available with a diesel engine.
Proton launched the three-door Proton Satria hatchback in 1994 and the two-door Proton Putra coupé in 1996, both of which are based on the Wira platform and powered by the same range of Mitsubishi engines offered in the Wira, except for the 2.0L diesel. The Proton Wira, Proton Satria and Proton Putra were exported and marketed across the European Union and Middle East during the 1990s. The Proton Perdana, a premium D-segment saloon, was launched in 1995. It is based on the seventh generation Mitsubishi Eterna, introduced in 1992, and was fitted with Mitsubishi&#x27;s 4G63 2.0-litre straight-four engine. It was also offered with the superior 6A12 DOHC 2.0-liter V6 engine after 1999. The Perdana remains the only D-segment, V6-powered car to be commercially produced by Proton. A Citroën AX-based 1.1-litre five-door supermini called the Proton Tiara debuted in 1996. It was the result of a joint venture between Proton and PSA Peugeot Citroën, a collaboration which was later abandoned after the death of Proton&#x27;s then CEO, Tan Sri Yahaya Ahmad in 1997.
On 30 October 1996, Proton acquired an 80% stake in the British company, Lotus Group International Limited, valued at £51 million. The controlling interest was purchased from A.C.B.N. Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, a company controlled by Italian businessman Romano Artioli, then also the owner of Bugatti. By 2003, Proton&#x27;s stake in Lotus was increased to 100%. Lotus has been involved in the development of suspension and handling elements of all Proton cars launched since 1996. The Proton Satria GTi, widely regarded as the best Malaysian car ever produced, owes much of its success to Lotus&#x27; contributions.

=== 2000s ===

The Proton Waja, the company&#x27;s first indigenously designed model, was launched in August 2000. However, it still had a Mitsubishi 4G18 engine at launch as Proton&#x27;s first in-house CamPro engine was unavailable. The Waja marked the end of Proton&#x27;s extensive reliance on other car manufacturers for vehicle platforms and components. However, the model was only a moderate seller, being significantly outsold by Proton&#x27;s own much older and slightly smaller Proton Wira. The Waja also marked the start of a decline in the local market-leading Proton marque which led to Perodua, the second Malaysian vehicle manufacturer, eventually capturing Proton&#x27;s sales crown in 2006. In 2002, Proton introduced the Arena, a ute based on the Proton Wira platform and thus far the only Proton model to enjoy significantly more popularity in its export markets (specifically Australia) than domestically. The Proton Gen-2, a hatchback model, was launched in late 2004. It was the first Proton vehicle equipped with the new CamPro engine.

The RM1.8 billion (US$580 million) Proton Tanjung Malim manufacturing plant in the Malaysian state of Perak commenced operation in November 2003. The new plant had been projected to open in August 1998, but it was deferred due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. However, it was revived in 2001 and completed in late 2003 instead. The new 1,280 acre plant was also developed as part of the Proton City project, which would span 4,000 acres of land in Tanjung Malim and consist of residential, commercial, institutional, industrial and recreational areas. The plant has an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles, but could be expanded to 1 million units in the future. The Proton Tanjung Malim plant complements the original Proton plant in operation since 1985, located in Shah Alam, Selangor. Despite a combined production capacity of around 350,000 units, both plants are underutilised with just 52,235 and 114,645 units produced at the Tanjung Malim and Shah Alam plants in 2011 respectively.

On 7 July 2004, Proton purchased a 57.57% stake in MV Agusta S.p.A. of Italy, valued at €70 million. Proton failed to reverse the misfortunes of MV Agusta and sold the marque to Gevi S.p.A. in December 2005 for €1, with Gevi assuming the €139.44 million debt carried over from MV Agusta.
The latter half of the 2000s marked Proton&#x27;s comeback in the domestic market, with its vehicle sales growing a total of about 37 percent from 2006 to 2011, significantly above total passenger car sales growth of about 10 percent. The comeback was spearheaded by the Proton Persona saloon launched in August 2007, the long-overdue replacement for the best-selling but ageing Proton Wira saloon. The Persona was based on an extended version of the 2004 Proton GEN•2 hatchback platform and shared most of its components and external appearance. The Persona successfully sold 19,840 units in the first three months following its launch.
The second generation Proton Saga was launched on 18 January 2008. Previously, the first generation Proton Saga had been Proton&#x27;s first and most successful model, having had a long 23-year lifespan, the longest of all Proton models to date. The new Saga proved to be a successful model Proton with over 23,000 bookings two weeks into its launch. It has consistently ranked as Proton&#x27;s best-selling vehicle domestically, while placing 3rd overall in 2008, and 2nd between 2009 and 2012, beaten only by its archrival, the Perodua Myvi in overall vehicle sales. Proton further widened its model base when it introduced the Exora, Malaysia&#x27;s first indigenous 7-seater MPV in April 2009. The Exora was based on Proton&#x27;s next generation P2 platform and helped satisfy the growing demand for a budget 7-seater in the domestic market, which had been monopolised by the Nissan Grand Livina and the smaller Toyota Avanza. For several years, it consistently positioned in the Top 10 best-selling vehicles in Malaysia.

=== 2010s ===

On 6 August 2008, the Proton Saga and Proton Persona were seen doing road tests at the Greater Noida Expressway, hinting at the potential to export Proton automobiles to India. However, negotiations for Proton to establish an Indian branch did not materialize.

In December 2008, Proton resumed product collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors. Under the agreement, Proton gained the rights to rebadge the 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer to be sold exclusively in the Malaysian market. The result of the collaboration was the Proton Inspira, which launched on 10 November 2010. It also marked a return to closer ties between Proton and Mitsubishi, the Japanese company which was instrumental in Proton&#x27;s foundation in the 1980s. Proton showcased the EMAS concept hybrid city cars at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. They were designed by Italdesign Giugiaro and related to the Lotus Ethos, a similar concept car from Proton&#x27;s British subsidiary.
The turbocharged inline-four petrol engine from Proton was revealed at the 2010 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show. Officially known as the 1.6L CamPro CFE, it is capable of producing power and torque figures of 138 bhp (103 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 205 N·m at 2,000–4,000 rpm respectively, comparable to a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine, while achieving better fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions.

In January 2012, Proton was acquired by DRB-HICOM, a Malaysian conglomerate in a transaction between Khazanah Nasional and DRB-HICOM which totalled RM1.2 billion. The Proton Prevé, the company&#x27;s latest saloon car was unveiled on 16 April 2012. It became the first Proton car, and to an extent, the first Malaysian car to be awarded the full 5-star safety rating in the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) of Australia and New Zealand. In December 2012, Proton acquired all of Petronas&#x27; E01 engine technologies in addition to associated technology patents at a cost of RM 63 million. The deal encompassed a family of naturally aspirated and turbocharged 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2-litre engines to complement Proton&#x27;s own CamPro 1.3L N/A, 1.6L N/A and 1.6L turbo engines.
On 17 August 2013, Proton launched the Suprima S, the hatchback complement to the Prevé saloon. It became the second 5-star ANCAP rated Proton and the first to offer extensive standard safety features in its domestic market. On 11 December 2013, the second generation Proton Perdana was finally unveiled after a three-year gap in the nameplate&#x27;s production. The new Perdana is a badge engineered eighth generation Honda Accord and is for exclusive sale to Malaysian civil servants and government officials.
The Proton Iriz was unveiled on 25 September 2014 as the company&#x27;s first B-segment 5-door hatchback. The new Iriz competes directly against the Perodua Myvi in its domestic market.

On 18 January 2016, Proton unveiled their all-new four-cylinder GDI/TGDI and three-cylinder VVT engines. The new engines, of which there are six in total, are being developed in collaboration with Ricardo and Lotus Engineering, and are slated to enter production by late 2017.

Proton unveiled their new logo in February 2016, and appointed a new CEO and Deputy CEO in April. The government had also granted Proton a RM 1.5 billion soft loan in mid 2016. The loan came with a number of conditions, including a mandatory tie-up with a foreign automobile company in the near future. Several companies have expressed interest, including Suzuki, Škoda, Groupe PSA, Renault and Geely. This culminated with the entry of China&#x27;s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in June 2017, after the Chinese carmaker acquired 49.9% equity in Proton from DRB-HICOM.
Proton introduced four new models in 2016. The new Perdana launched on 14 June, followed by the new Persona on 23 August, the new Saga on 28 September, and the new Ertiga on 24 November. The launch of four new Proton models within the span of six months was unprecedented in the company&#x27;s history. Masazumi Ogawa was recruited as the director of quality control in Proton.

On 24 May 2017, parent company DRB-HICOM announced plans to sell a 49.9% stake in Proton to Zhejiang Geely Automobile Holdings. Eventually, DRB-HICOM also sold 51% controlling-stake in Lotus to Geely, and the remaining 49% stake to Etika Automotive. The definitive agreement was in July 2017. Proton had owned Lotus since 1996, and largely struggled to turn the fortunes of the sports car maker around. Nonetheless, in late 2016, Lotus announced their first operating profit in over 40 years. Their presence in Proton is said to not affect Japanese auto manufacturers due to being in the market for a very long time. Still, many of Proton&#x27;s cars benefitted from the Lotus relationship, with the Satria GTi specifically mentioned by car reviewers as possessing good handling traits. Subsequent Proton some models received &quot;Lotus Tuned&quot; input.

Proton recruited Yoshiya Inamori as the vice president of manufacturing, who had previously been involved with Proton back in the 80s when it was founded during his time in Mitsubishi from April 1982 until July 2017.

On 29 September 2017, DRB-HICOM announced changes to the board of Proton Holdings Berhad. Following the signing of a Definitive Agreement with China&#x27;s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Limited on 23 June 2017, the Chinese carmaker acquired 49.9% equity in Proton. The announcement on 29 September saw a new board of directors put in place in Proton Holdings, Proton Edar (the local distribution arm) and Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Sdn Bhd (PONSB).

Three nominees from Geely Holding joined the boards; Daniel Donghui Li, the Executive VP and CFO of Geely Holding; Dr Nathan Yuning, the Executive VP of International Business of Geely Holding, and Feng Qing Feng, the Group VP and CTO at HK-listed Geely Auto. DRB-HICOM are represented by Dato&#x27; Sri Syed Faisal Albar, who chairs the boards, and Amalanathan Thomas and Shaharul Farez Hassan. Both are part of the senior management team at DRB-HICOM. On the same day, Dr Li Chunrong joins PONSB as CEO. Dr Li is the third foreigner to head Proton. Between 1993 and 1997, the early years of Proton, two different Japanese nominees of their partners, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, led the carmaker.

===2020s===
On 29 April 2024, Proton announced the opening of a R&amp;D centre at the Geely Automobile Research Institute at Hangzhou Bay in collaboration with Geely.

On 23 August 2024, Proton announced that they are partnering with NSA Motors Limited in Trinidad and Tobago since March 2024 to market and retail their vehicles in the country.

On 16 December 2024, Proton launched the e.MAS 7 with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as the main guest of honor. It will be retailed in Malaysia, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore and Trinidad and Tobago.

== Logo and branding ==
The Proton logo in 1983 was a dark blue shield which encompassed a yellow crescent positioned below a yellow fourteen-pointed star, in reference to the Malaysian flag and coat of arms. However, this emblem was only used for Proton cars which were sold domestically. Proton cars exported to other markets received different badge designs.
In 2000, the new Proton logo was used on the Proton Waja which launched in that year. It featured a stylised yellow tiger head on a green roundel embossed upon a dark blue shield, with the Proton name in yellow capital letters in Frutiger font. The standard text representation of the Proton name was also changed from the lowercase italic text &quot;proton&quot; to the uppercase &quot;PROTON&quot;.

All Proton cars manufactured after 2000 carried the new badge, both in the domestic and export markets. Then its colour was changed into two-tone, silver and black, which was in use since 2008 with the introduction of the second generation Proton Saga.

In June 2016, a new Proton logo was introduced during the launch of 2016 Proton Perdana, which is only a Malayan tiger head with a circle surrounding in three-dimensional style. The new logo is now used on all Proton latest models, including the 2017 Proton Iriz facelift and 2017 Proton Exora Enhanced.

Two years after (i.e., September 2019) Proton&#x27;s global strategic partnership with Geely in 2017, Proton Holdings unveiled a brand new logo and ‘Inspiring Connections’ tagline to outline its ambition to be a global, modern automotive brand. Starting with the Proton X70, and excluding the 2019 Exora, the rear badge was replaced by lettering spelling out &#x27;Proton&#x27;.

==Overseas Operations==
As of 2024, Proton has an overseas presence in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Brunei, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago and Zimbabwe. 

CKD plants are located in Pakistan, Kenya, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

==Sales==

===Domestic===
The first Proton, the Saga saloon launched in July 1985 amid positive reception, but poor sales due to Proton&#x27;s inability to meet the high demand. However, Proton later captured a 47% Malaysian market share in the following year, with 24,148 cars sold. The company&#x27;s market share later grew to 65% in 1987; 85% in the &quot;Under 1,600cc segment&quot;. Proton maintained a majority market share in the following years, which peaked in 1993 at 74% with over 94,100 units sold. Car sales in Malaysia plunged from 404,000 units in 1997 to 163,851 in 1998 due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Proton&#x27;s revenue and profits were severely affected, but a majority market share was still maintained into the early 2000s.

In the mid-2000s, Proton&#x27;s revenues and sales declined sharply. In 2006, Proton&#x27;s market share was 32%, down from 40% in 2005. Proton lost its majority domestic market share for the first time in 20 years to Perodua, the second Malaysian car manufacturer. Factors which contributed to the fall of Proton included the revision of the National Automotive Policy (NAP), Proton&#x27;s newer indigenously designed models (i.e., the Proton Waja, Gen-2 and Savvy) which were poorly designed and manufactured compared to the former Mitsubishi-based models and stronger competitors, specifically Perodua with their best-selling Myvi which launched in 2005. Proton&#x27;s total sales volume and its market share failed to recover to its pre-2002 figures and Perodua remained the domestic market leader from 2006 onwards.

Sales of Proton cars grew at a stable rate in the latter half of the 2000s and in the early 2010s. The company briefly regained the top-spot from Perodua in June 2009, after the introduction of the Proton Exora MPV. Proton also matched Perodua&#x27;s market share in the first quarter of 2011. Factors which contributed to the rise of Proton were well-designed cars which catered to the needs of the domestic market (i.e., the Proton Persona, second generation Saga and Exora) in addition to better management of the company under the then managing director, Syed Zainal Abidin. However, despite the improvements made between 2007 and 2012 in addition to improved overall sales, Proton&#x27;s Malaysian market share continued to decrease. In 2011, the company had a 26.4% (158,657 units) share which plummeted further to 22.5% (141,121 units) in 2012. In comparison, Perodua retained a majority market share of 30.1% (189,137 units) in 2012, with Toyota maintaining its third place at a 16.8% share with 105,151 units sold.

Proton&#x27;s decline in market share stabilised in 2013. In the first half of that year, Proton sold 64,782 cars, representing 20.7% of the market share, a decline of 1.8% over its full-year 2012 share. However, by the end of 2013, Proton had managed to raise its market share to 21.2% with a total of 138,753 units sold. Nonetheless, Proton&#x27;s market share has still declined by an overall 1.3% between 2012 and 2013. In July 2013, Proton sold around 16,600 cars, which accounted for 25% in market share during that specific month, the company&#x27;s highest ever in 2013. Perodua on the other hand sold around 19,200 or 2,600 more cars than Proton in July 2013. The rise in Proton&#x27;s sales were attributed to the launch of the Proton Saga SV, a cheaper variant of the second best-selling car in Malaysia.

Another factor which continues to play a significant role in the sales of Proton cars is the National Automotive Policy (NAP), enforced by the Malaysian government in the interests of Proton, Perodua, Naza and foreign brands with manufacturing plants in Malaysia. Under the NAP, imported vehicles are subjected to varying degrees of import and excise duties depending on the vehicle&#x27;s origin of manufacture and engine displacement, with excise duty imposed at 60 to 105 percent being the highest component in the duty structure. Vehicles imported from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are subject to the least import duties, whereas those from Europe suffer the worst. However, imported hybrid vehicles and cars purchased in duty-free Langkawi are exempted from the import and excise duties. The NAP ensures the survival of Proton and other Malaysian-made vehicles under a biased playing field in the Malaysian market. Nonetheless, the import duties of the NAP have been progressively revised and reduced in line with the eventual liberation of the market, but excise duties, the larger component of tariffs, continues to be high and opaquely applied, with non-tariff barriers effectively reducing the rate for Malaysian made vehicles.

In March 2013, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia) announced that vehicles manufactured in Australia and Japan will face a gradual reduction of import duties in stages to zero by 2016. Proton however responded positively to the announcement, citing their recent positive developments such as the 5-star ANCAP safety recognition of the Proton Prevé as part of its commitment to progress.

===Export===
Proton relies primarily on its domestic market for the majority of its sales and revenues. Nonetheless, small volumes of Proton cars are also exported to various other countries in Asia, in addition to the United Kingdom and Australia. The company held a far larger global sales network in the 1990s, spanning all six continents and over 70 countries, but intends to regain a global foothold with 500,000 annual sales by 2018.

On 24 January 2020, Proton announced that their goal is to export 4,000 vehicles by the end of the year or export 6,000 vehicles if they were offered government incentives.

===History===

Proton first ventured into export markets in December 1986, a year and a half after the launch of the company&#x27;s first car, the Saga. It was only sold in right-hand drive markets like New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Singapore because left-hand drive variants were not produced. Proton attempted to enter the American market in November 1988, but failed to meet strict US automotive regulations. However, the Proton Wira, which launched in 1993 became the company&#x27;s first car to be produced in both left and right-hand drive configurations, paving the way for Proton&#x27;s entry into Continental Europe in October 1994 and other markets in the Middle East and Latin America. The company&#x27;s global sales network peaked between 1994 and the early 2000s, but has since dwindled to around 25 countries as of the 2010s. Proton has commissioned CKD plants in Iran, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and China.

Proton began importing cars to the right-hand drive UK market from March 1989, and reached its 12-month sales target of 5,000 cars after just six months. The Proton brand was initially a huge success in the UK, but sales were declining sharply by 2010 and the brand was withdrawn in 2014.

Proton&#x27;s presence in Singapore was handled by Cycle &amp; Carriage from 1989 to September 2002 due to failures to make a turn around. It made a comeback in 2003 with Proton establishing a direct branch.

In the Philippines, Proton was formerly represented by Proton Pilipinas Corp from 1992 with an assembly plant in Alaminos, Pangasinan that manufactured the Proton Wira.

Proton exported 164,153 cars between December 1986 and December 1997. The United Kingdom is by far the company&#x27;s most successful export market in terms of cumulative sales volume, and at one point Proton set the record for &quot;Fastest Selling Make of New Car Ever to Enter the United Kingdom&quot;. In 1992, the Saga was ranked among the Top 20 best-selling cars in the UK, outselling its primary competitors from Hyundai and SEAT. 100,000 Protons were sold in the UK by 1997.

Additionally, a 1999 survey by the United Kingdom Consumers&#x27; Association ranked Proton as among the most reliable and recommended in Britain. The response from 27,000 members of the association revealed that Proton was ranked third in terms of fewer breakdowns, faults and other mechanical problems, placing Proton behind Honda and Mazda, and ahead of Toyota and Ford. Furthermore, 80% of the surveyed Consumers&#x27; Association members said they would recommend Proton cars to friends and family, compared to 90% for Subaru, 79% for Toyota, 78% for Honda and Mitsubishi, 63% for Hyundai and 47% for Rover respectively. The 1999 award is Proton&#x27;s second consecutive, having received similar appraisal in 1998.

However, sales in the UK have since collapsed, with just 208 Protons sold in 2012. Proton cars were once popular in Singapore, at one time the company&#x27;s second-largest export destination despite its relatively small market size. Sales were also modest in Germany and Belgium during the late 90s, prior to Proton&#x27;s withdrawal from Continental Europe. Kuwait was once a top Middle Eastern export destination for Proton cars in the late 90s and early 2000s, with an average market share of 8% or 1,000 units sold each year, ten times greater than any other Gulf Cooperation Council state. The Kuwaiti dealer, Bahrah Trading Company had focused on the niche fleet market, selling Proton Wiras to fast food delivery services and taxi operators.

By the first half of the 2010s, the Chinese market had become the largest contributor to Proton&#x27;s export revenues. Although Proton cars sold in China carried different names and badges under the local Youngman EuropeStar brand, Proton nonetheless received royalties for the use of their platforms and Campro engines. Proton&#x27;s six-year contract with Youngman expired in 2012, but the Zhejiang-based company continued to unofficially produce Proton&#x27;s cars and engines up until early 2015. In February 2015, Proton announced that they would revive their joint venture with Fujian-based Goldstar, and would not renew their contract with Youngman.

Proton cars were also exported to several countries in Latin America, most notably Chile. Exports to Chile commenced in 1994, and almost 3,000 Protons were sold prior to the company&#x27;s departure in 1998. However, Proton later expressed intentions of returning to Chile following the ratification of the Malaysia-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2012. In July 2015, Proton signed a distributor agreement with Andes Motor, and the first official shipment of 50 left-hand drive Prevé units commenced on 1 March 2016. The Chilean launch of the Proton Prevé took place in May 2016, and formally marked Proton&#x27;s return to Chile after an 18-year absence.

Proton announced that they closed Proton Motor Pars, established in August 2011, since it was dormant and no longer in the company&#x27;s interest to revive it in any way.

On 12 July 2018, Proton resumes exports to the Middle East beginning with 440 units of Proton Gen•2 and 15 units of first-generation Proton Persona in Jordan to be distributed to Iraq as well as neighboring countries.

Proton had also entered Pakistan market in 2007, the line-up from Proton Pakistan were the Proton Saga and the Proton Impian sedans, but unfortunate sale volume due to tough competition from veteran competitor brands and used imported cars in the market had to force them for early departure in 2010.
On 21 March 2019, Proton had announced their plans that they will re-enter Pakistan after their departure in 2010 with a new plant be built in Pakistan in collaboration with Alhaj Automotive. Proton has already booked CBU versions of Proton X70 in Pakistan. The orders for CKD versions of X70 are also being booked by Proton in Pakistan which are expected to be delivered in Q3 of 2021 after the completion of the local assembly plant there. The Proton Saga is also expected to re-launch after 2007 in Pakistan in January 2021.

On 21 August 2020, it was announced that the Proton Saga will be exported to Kenya, most built under CKDs shipped to Simba Corp.

It was announced on 13 November 2020 that Proton vehicles will be sold in Nepal by Jagadamba Motors. The company will formally launch retail operations by January 2021. Proton previously had a presence in Nepal.

On 28 April 2022, an agreement was signed for Proton to re-enter the South African auto market. On 31 May 2022, Proton announced shipments of Proton X50s, X70s and Sagas in an effort to resume a presence in South Africa with CMH Group as the official distributor. In 2015, Proton left South Africa due to bad market conditions.

Proton announced in May 2023 that they have entered Mozambique in partnership with local automobile distributor Entreposto. In March 2024, Proton has a partnership with ANSA Motors to market/distribute Proton vehicles in Trinidad &amp; Tobago with the X50 and X90 being marketed.

On 13 November 2024, Proton announced the opening of a CKD plant in Egypt owned by Ezz Elarab Elsewedy Automotive Factories (ESAF), the third one overseas after Kenya and Pakistan.

===Future===
The United Kingdom has been a key export market for Proton since the late 1980s. However, by the late 2000s, British Proton sales had declined considerably as a result of ageing models and depleting stock. In 2013, Proton Cars UK had attempted to relaunch the brand with four all-new models. However, the relaunch was instead postponed indefinitely in view of more stringent European Union emissions and safety regulations. It was announced on 7 August 2024 that Proton wil return to the UK &quot;later this decade&quot;. This plan was also mentioned again, alongside a planned return to Australia and New Zealand. Proton was formerly seen in New Zealand in the 1980s.

Proton is currently developing a range of all-new petrol engines in collaboration with Ricardo and Lotus Engineering. The engines will feature more advanced technology such as direct injection, cylinder deactivation and stop-start idling, and will meet the highest Euro 6c emissions regulations. On 18 January 2016, Proton fired up a prototype in a live broadcast from Ricardo&#x27;s facility in Shoreham, England. Mass production of the all-new Proton engines will commence in late 2017.

Additionally, Proton has announced their partnership with LG Electronics in the development of autonomous safety technology. In September 2014, Proton previewed an Iriz prototype with LG&#x27;s Advanced Drive Assistance System (ADAS). With the LG ADAS implementation, new autonomous safety features like Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cross Traffic Assist (CTA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) and High Beam Assist (HBA) can be incorporated into Proton&#x27;s future offerings. The inclusion of autonomous safety features has become a necessary prerequisite for a full 5-Star Euro NCAP and ANCAP rating.

On 3 December 2014, Proton announced plans to construct a new car factory in Bangladesh. A deal was made public on 6 February 2015 between Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta to help the latter develop the way for their own national car. There are allegations that President Jokowi Widodo is appointing Abdullah Mahmud Hendropriyono as the representative of PT Adiperkasa Citra Lestari, who was known to be associated with ex-President Megawati Soekarnoputri.

According to Steven Xu of Proton&#x27;s International Sales, the company is still in the process of establishing more distributors to increase its presence in Indonesia as of 10 April 2019.

On 24 April 2019, Proton announced that they&#x27;ll relaunch again in Australia since sales have declined in 2015 after the company established its presence in 1995.

According to Li Churong, the company will expand its presence in the ASEAN countries, such as Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. The company announced on 16 June 2021 that its Indonesian and Thai operations will resume in the near future with plans to be the third biggest automobile manufacturer in the ASEAN region. It was reported that Proton&#x27;s Thai operations could resume by 2022. But in February 2023, it&#x27;s reported that Indonesian and Thai operations have yet to resume, including Fiji.

The presence of a Proton X50 being driven in India for road tests indicate the possible presence of a future Proton branch in India.

On 29 November 2024, Geely announced that they will enter the Australian and Thai auto markets, potentially putting any dampers for Proton to market their vehicles in those two countries. On 17 December 2024, Proton announced that Vincar Group will be the Singaporean distributor/retailer for Proton vehicles in Singapore with the Proton e.MAS 7 being the first vehicle to be retailed in 2025.

== Partnerships ==

=== Mitsubishi ===
Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) and Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) were instrumental in the foundation of Proton. The large majority of vehicle platforms, engines, parts and technical expertise were once sourced from Mitsubishi Motors. Additionally, the managing director of Proton between 1988 and 1993 was Kenji Iwabuchi, a former Mitsubishi Motors executive. Proton&#x27;s staff were also trained by Mitsubishi in Japan as part of a bilateral agreement. Management of Proton was gradually assumed by Malaysians in the 1990s. All Proton cars launched between 1985 and 2000 with the exception of the Proton Tiara were based on Mitsubishi vehicles. Proton began producing indigenously designed models after 2000, but resumed product collaboration with MMC in 2008. The result of the renewed collaboration is the Proton Inspira, a rebadged 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer for sale exclusively in the Malaysian market. It marked a return to closer ties between Proton and MMC.

MMC and MC held a minority 30% joint stake in Proton, while a majority 70% stake was held by the Heavy Industries Corporation of Malaysia (HICOM). The Mitsubishi joint stake was later reduced to 15.86%, or 7.93% each for MMC and MC respectively until it was fully sold to Khazanah Nasional in January 2005. Mitsubishi Motors, Japan&#x27;s sole unprofitable carmaker of that period sold its 7.93% Proton stake earlier in March 2004 in an effort to reduce its ¥1.14 trillion (US$11 billion) debt. The sale of Mitsubishi&#x27;s joint stake in Proton marked the end of its 22-year investment in Proton.

=== Citroën ===
In 1994, French car manufacturer Citroën announced plans for the production of diesel-powered cars in Malaysia under a joint venture with Proton. Proton&#x27;s then CEO, Tan Sri Yahaya Ahmad also advocated an alliance with PSA Peugeot Citroën for the purpose of technology transfer. Negotiations continued until 1995, but materialised in 1996 with the launch of the Proton Tiara. It was based on the Citroën AX and powered by a 1.1L Citroën I4 petrol engine, in contrast to the plans for a diesel option. The joint venture between Proton and Citroën stagnated after the death of Yahaya Ahmad in a helicopter crash the following year. The Proton Tiara failed to compete against its rivals from Perodua and production ended in 2000, four years after its launch.
=== Youngman ===
Proton entered the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2007 under a strategic joint venture with China Youngman Automobile Group Co., Ltd. The agreement involved a minimum of 30,000 Proton Gen-2 CBU units which were rebadged in China under Youngman&#x27;s Europestar marque. In 2008, the Proton Persona became the second model to be sold under the Europestar brand. The Gen-2 and Persona were known as the RCR (short for RaCeR or Racing) and Jing Yue between 2007 and late 2009, but both cars were facelifted and renamed as the L3 5-door and L3 4-door (or L3 Sedan) for the 2010 model year respectively. Both models received unique parts and facelifts from Youngman between 2007 and 2013. The most recent facelifts of the Europestar L3 GT 5-door (Proton Gen-2) and Europestar L3 GT 4-door (Proton Persona) offer new front bumpers, unique grilles and mirror-mounted turn signals on the exterior, in addition to a redesigned climate control cluster and leather upholstery on the interior. Youngman has also introduced less expensive variants of their L3 hatchback and saloon models, powered by the 1.5-litre Mitsubishi 4G15M engine.

Youngman unveiled the Europestar L5 hatchback and saloon models at the 2011 Shanghai Motorshow. The exterior design and interior equipment are indigenous to Youngman, but both cars are based on an extended Proton GEN-2 platform (2,670mm, 70mm longer than the original) and powered by Proton&#x27;s CamPro CPS 1.6-litre engine. The Europestar T5 was previewed on 23 April 2012, a SUV designed by Lotus and Youngman and based on the Proton Gen-2 platform. It was scheduled for a late 2012 launch but it was never put into production.

Between mid-2009 and February 2015, Youngman Lotus had reported total production figures of 196,234 rebadged CKD GEN-2 and Persona units, of which 189,872 were reportedly sold. However, by mid-2015, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) stopped reporting Youngman Lotus sales numbers because they were &quot;way off&quot; from registration numbers. Youngman Lotus had ceased production and sales altogether by mid-2015. In February 2015, Proton announced that they would revive their joint venture with Fujian-based Goldstar, and would not renew their contract with Youngman.

=== Honda ===


On 29 October 2012, Proton entered a collaboration with Honda Motor Company, Ltd. Both companies have agreed to explore collaboration opportunities in the areas of technology enhancement, new product line up and the sharing of vehicle platforms and facilities.

In November 2013, it was revealed that the PRM would be based on the North American eighth generation Honda Accord. The PRM will launch in two phases, the first in mid-December for sale exclusively to the Malaysian government and the second within the next two years for the Malaysian domestic market. Around 3,000 units of the PRM will be produced initially to replace the ageing Proton Perdana V6 fleet in use by the federal government.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

Proton has a significant historical presence in motorsports. In the late 1980s, an alliance consisting of Proton, Malaysian oil and gas company Petronas, Mitsubishi Motors of Japan and distributor of Proton cars, Edaran Otomobil Nasional (EON) led to the formation of the Petronas EON Racing Team (PERT). The team focused primarily on rallying and has been in motorsports as early as 1987. PERT won the 1989 Shell Malaysia Rally with Proton Saga rally cars which were prepared by Mitsubishi&#x27;s Ralliart division, featuring powerful 150 bhp engines as part of its rally specifications. PERT won several other international rallies including the 1991 Rally of Thailand, 1993 Dubai International Rally and the Rallye Ng Philipinas in 1995, 1996 and 1997 respectively.

=== 2000s ===
Proton&#x27;s presence in international motorsports peaked when the Petronas EON Racing Team won the 2002 Production World Rally Championship with veteran Malaysian rally driver Karamjit Singh in a Proton PERT, a rebadged Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The Proton-Karamjit duo also won the 2001, 2002 and 2004 Asia-Pacific Rally Championship titles.

In 2003, the Proton Motorsports Division, also known as &quot;Race.Rally.Research., R3&quot;, was established. R3 assumed the responsibility of Proton&#x27;s motorsports endeavours, which had been held by Ralliart of Mitsubishi Motors. The first model to benefit from R3 engineering was the Proton Satria R3 which launched in late 2004 with a limited run of 150 units.

=== 2010s ===

=== Asia-Pacific Rally Championship ===
Proton re-entered the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) in 2010, an international rally championship organised by the FIA encompassing rounds in Asia and Oceania. Proton had previously participated in the APRC, but withdrew in 2005 due to financial problems. The company competes under the official team name of Proton Motorsports with former WRC drivers Chris Atkinson and Alister McRae from Australia and Scotland respectively in a pair of Proton Satria Neo S2000 rally cars. The new Satria Neo S2000 replaced the Proton PERT as Proton&#x27;s premier rally car, and was prepared by British-based Mellors Elliot Motorsport (MEM) in accordance to FIA Super 2000 specifications. The cars cost over RM1 million each and are equipped with 280 bhp (271Nm) 2.0 litre engines paired to 4WD drivetrains. Despite facing technical problems and stiff competition from the superior Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Subaru Impreza rally cars, Proton drivers McRae and Atkinson placed 3rd and 5th respectively in the 2010 APRC season.

The following year, Malaysian rally veteran Karamjit Singh rejoined the APRC after a 6-year absence under the Proton R3 Cusco Rally Team in a Group N 2WD CUSCO Japan-tuned 1.6L CamPro 145 hp (170Nm) version of the Satria Neo. Japanese rally driver Akira Bamba also contested in the 2011 APRC season in another Satria Neo CUSCO. The 2011 season concluded with a one-two Proton Motorsports victory with drivers McRae and Atkinson in their Satria Neo S2000s. Karamjit placed 1st in the 2WD category and 7th overall in the championship, ahead of Bamba who placed 9th overall.

In the 2012 APRC season, Chris Atkinson left Proton Motorsports after two years of racing history with the team. Atkinson joined Indian Team MRF instead where he piloted a Škoda Fabia S2000 alongside Indian rally veteran Gaurav Gill. The vacant slot in Proton Motorsports was filled by Swedish racer Per-Gunnar Andersson who also raced for Proton in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Additionally, Proton R3 Cusco added a third driver, Malaysian Kenneth Koh, whereas Dreams India driver Sanjay Takle participated in another 2WD Satria Neo. The 2012 season ended with a Team MRF victory, with Atkinson and Gaurav placing first and fourth respectively in their S2000 Škodas. Proton Motorsports driver McRae clinched second, but Andersson placed a lowly seventh overall with the S2000 Satria Neos. Proton R3 Cusco racers Karamjit, Bamba and Kenneth placed fifth, sixth and eight respectively and Dreams India&#x27;s Sanjay placed ninth overall.

=== Intercontinental Rally Challenge ===
Proton entered into the Intercontinental Rally Challenge 2009 with the Proton Satria Neo Super 2000. Their best result in IRC is Alister McRae finish 2nd place at 2009 Rally Scotland. Drivers in 2009 were Karamjit Singh, Guy Wilks, Bryan Bouffier and Alister McRae scoring 13 points. In 2010 Proton team had many retirements and did not score a single point. Drivers for 2010 were Alister McRae, Chris Atkinson, Niall McShea, Keith Cronin, Gilles Panizzi and privateer with factory support, Tom Cave. Best result of 2010 season was 22nd place of Gilles Panizzi at 2010 Rallye Sanremo, although it was the only finish of Proton Satria Neo S2000 in this season.

=== British Touring Car Championship ===
The British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) is a touring car racing series held each year in the United Kingdom. Proton participated in the BTCC between 2002 and 2004 as the Petronas Syntium Proton (Team PSP). The team in the 2002 and 2003 BTCC seasons was headed by Scottish and English drivers David Leslie and Phil Bennett respectively in two heavily modified BTC-T Proton Impian touring cars. They were succeeded by South African Shaun Watson-Smith and Malaysian Fariqe Hairuman in the 2004 season.
In 2011, UK-based Welch Motorsport contested the BTCC in a Proton Persona NGTC, driven by Daniel Welch. Welch Motorsport competes independently and is not tied to Proton, but indirectly supported by Proton UK The team made its debut in the second half of the 2011 BTCC season and scored a point in the final race at the Silverstone Circuit, placing 22nd overall in the tournament. In comparison, 2011 Drivers&#x27; Champion Matt Neal of Honda Racing Team scored 257 points.

Welch Motorsport&#x27;s performance improved significantly in the 2012 BTCC season. Daniel Welch had his best race at Oulton Park, where he finished sixth in race one, and held off defending champion Matt Neal to claim fourth position in race two. Welch Motorsport placed 15th overall with 79 points in the 2012 season, with 2012 Drivers&#x27; Champion Gordon Shedden scoring 408 points in comparison.

Welch Motorsport expanded to a two-car team in the 2013 BTCC season. The Proton Persona NGTC returns in the hands of Daniel Welch, whereas the second car is a Super 2000 Mk 2 Ford Focus driven by David Nye.

== Football ==

Proton and Norwich City F.C. signed a 3-year sponsorship deal in 2003, becoming the &quot;Canaries&quot; main sponsor for their home kit, whilst Proton-owned Lotus Cars would feature on the away kit. The deal, reportedly valued at a &quot;seven-figure sum&quot;, was the largest sponsorship deal in the club&#x27;s history. Proton&#x27;s chief executive officer Tengku Mahaleel Ariff said the sponsorship deal would bring more awareness and recognition to the Proton brand, which it currently lacked.

In 2005, Proton opened a showroom at Norwich City&#x27;s Carrow Road stadium, featuring products from Proton and Proton-owned brands. It was incorporated into the stadium&#x27;s Jarrold Stand.

<doc id="173294" wikidata="Q192762" url="?curid=173294" title="Darren Aronofsky">
<text>Darren Aronofsky (born February 12, 1969) is an American filmmaker. His films are noted for their surreal, melodramatic, and often disturbing elements, frequently in the form of psychological fiction. Over his career he has received a Primetime Emmy Award and has been nominated for several awards including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award.

Aronofsky studied film and social anthropology at Harvard University before studying directing at the AFI Conservatory. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, which became a National Student Academy Award finalist. In 1997, he founded the film and TV production company Protozoa Pictures. His feature film debut, the surrealist psychological thriller &quot;Pi&quot; (1998) which earned him the Directing Award at the Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.

Aronofsky then directed the psychological drama &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000), the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama &quot;The Fountain&quot; (2006), and the sports drama &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008), the latter of which earned the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. He directed the psychological drama &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. His later films include the biblical epic &quot;Noah&quot; (2014), the psychological horror film &quot;Mother!&quot; (2017), and the drama &quot;The Whale&quot; (2022). Aronofsky&#x27;s film &quot;Postcard from Earth&quot; (2023) was produced and filmed exclusively for the Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley on its 16K resolution screen.

==Early life==
Aronofsky was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York, United States, on February 12, 1969, the son of teachers Charlotte and Abraham Aronofsky, both of Polish-Jewish descent. He grew up in Brooklyn&#x27;s Manhattan Beach neighborhood. He said he was &quot;raised culturally Jewish, but there was very little spiritual attendance in the temple. It was a cultural thing—celebrating the holidays, knowing where you came from, knowing your history, having respect for what your people have been through.&quot; He graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School. He has one sister, Patti, who attended a professional ballet school through high school. His parents would often take him to Broadway performances, which sparked his interest in show business.

During his youth, Aronofsky trained as a field biologist with The School for Field Studies in Kenya in 1985 and Alaska in 1986. He attended school in Kenya to pursue an interest in learning about ungulates. He later said that the School for Field Studies &quot;changed the way [he] perceived the world&quot;. Aronofsky&#x27;s interest in the outdoors led him to backpack his way through Europe and the Middle East. At the age of 18, he entered Harvard University, where he majored in social anthropology and studied filmmaking; he graduated in 1991. He became seriously interested in film while attending Harvard after befriending Dan Schrecker, an aspiring animator, and Sean Gullette, who would go on to star in Aronofsky&#x27;s first film, &quot;Pi&quot;. His cinematic influences included Akira Kurosawa, Roman Polanski, Federico Fellini, Terry Gilliam, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hubert Selby Jr. Spike Lee, Satoshi Kon, and Jim Jarmusch.

Aronofsky&#x27;s senior thesis film, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, was a finalist in the 1991 Student Academy Awards. In 1992, Aronofsky received his MFA degree in directing from the AFI Conservatory, where his classmates included Todd Field, Doug Ellin, Scott Silver, and Mark Waters. He won the institute&#x27;s Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal.

==Career==
===Early work===
Aronofsky&#x27;s debut feature, titled &quot;Pi&quot;—sometimes stylized as &quot;π&quot;—was shot in October 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 donations from his friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered &quot;Pi&quot; at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself was nominated for a special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. &quot;Pi&quot; was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.

Aronofsky followed his debut with &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, a film based on Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s novel of the same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of &quot;Pi&quot;, he was capable of hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell&#x27;s soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film (except for &quot;Mother!&quot;, 2017 and &quot;The Whale&quot;, 2022). Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film&#x27;s depiction of drug abuse.

In May 2000, Aronofsky was briefly attached to make an adaptation of David Wiesner&#x27;s 1999 children&#x27;s book &quot;Sector 7&quot; for Nickelodeon Movies, the project remains unmade. In mid-2000, Warner Bros. hired Aronofsky to write and direct &quot;Batman: Year One&quot;, which was to be the fifth film in the Batman franchise. Aronofsky, who collaborated with Frank Miller on an unproduced script for &quot;Ronin&quot;, brought Miller in to co-write &quot;Year One&quot; with him, intending to reboot the series. &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;somewhat&quot; based on the comic book&quot;, Aronofsky later said. &quot;Toss out everything you can imagine about Batman! Everything! We&#x27;re starting completely anew&quot;, who intended to re-imagine the titular character in a darker, adult-oriented and grounded style, with his adaptation aiming for an R-rating. Regular Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique was set as cinematographer, and Aronofsky had also approached Christian Bale for the role of Batman. Bale was ultimately cast in the role for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. After that project failed to develop, Aronofsky declined the opportunity to direct a film in the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise. In March 2001, he helped write the screenplay to the horror film &quot;Below&quot;, which he also produced.

In April 2001, Aronofsky entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct a then-untitled science fiction film, with Brad Pitt in the lead role. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join the film, which Aronofsky, wanting the title to remain secret, had given the working title of &quot;The Last Man&quot;. Production was postponed to wait for a pregnant Blanchett to give birth to her child in December 2001. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney.

By now officially titled &quot;The Fountain&quot;, the film had a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, which had filled the gap after Village Roadshow withdrew. Pitt left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting, halting production. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected it on a $35 million budget with Hugh Jackman in the lead role. In August, actress Rachel Weisz filled the vacancy left by Blanchett. &quot;The Fountain&quot; was released on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday; ultimately it grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide. Audiences and critics were divided in their responses to it.

===Breakthrough===
In 2007, Aronofsky hired writer Scott Silver to develop &quot;The Fighter&quot; with him. Aronofsky approached Bale to star in the film, but Aronofsky dropped out because of its similarities to &quot;The Wrestler&quot; and to work on MGM&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop&quot; remake. In July 2010, Aronofsky had left the project due to uncertainty over the financially distressed studio&#x27;s future. When asked about the film, he said, &quot;I think I&#x27;m still attached. I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t heard from anyone in a while&quot;. Later during 2007, Aronofsky said he was planning to film a movie about Noah&#x27;s Ark.

Aronofsky had the idea for &quot;The Wrestler&quot; for over a decade. He hired Robert Siegel to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered negotiations in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film&#x27;s protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage pulled out of the movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was &quot;a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.&quot; Cage responded, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t quote &#x27;dropped&#x27; from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn&#x27;t think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do&quot;. The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.

&quot;The Wrestler&quot; premiered at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. Initially receiving little attention, the film wound up winning the Golden Lion, the highest award at the world&#x27;s oldest film festival. &quot;The Wrestler&quot; received critical acclaim, and both Rourke and co-star Marisa Tomei received Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA nominations for their performances. Rourke won a Golden Globe, as did Bruce Springsteen for his original song written for the film. &quot;The Wrestler&quot; grossed $44,674,354 worldwide on a budget of $6,000,000 making it Aronofsky&#x27;s highest-grossing film to that point.

Aronofsky&#x27;s next film was &quot;Black Swan&quot;, which had been in development since 2001, a psychological thriller horror film about a New York City ballerina. The film starred actress Natalie Portman, whom Aronofsky had known since 2000. She introduced Aronofsky to Mila Kunis, who joined the cast in 2009. &quot;Black Swan&quot; had its world premiere as the opening film at the 67th Venice Film Festival in September 2010. It received a standing ovation whose length &quot;Variety&quot; said made it &quot;one of the strongest Venice openers in recent memory&quot;.

&quot;Black Swan&quot; has received high praise from film critics, and received a record 12 Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations, four Independent Spirit Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations, three SAG nominations, and many more accolades. Aronofsky received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director. The film broke limited-release box-office records and grossed an unexpectedly high $329,398,046. On January 25, 2011, the film was nominated for a total of five Academy Awards; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. On February 27, 2011, Portman won for Best Actress. The film was awarded the PRISM Award from the Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration for its depiction of mental health issues. Aronofsky served as an executive producer on &quot;The Fighter&quot;, which was also nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars and won two for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo.

===Larger-budget productions===

Aronofsky was attached to &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, which was scheduled to begin production in March 2011, but he left the project due to scheduling issues. The film was set to be sixth entry of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, featuring a story revolving around Wolverine&#x27;s adventures in Japan. In April 2011, Aronofsky was announced as the president of the jury for the 68th Venice International Film Festival.

In December 2011, Aronofsky directed the music video for Lou Reed and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot; from their album &quot;Lulu&quot;.

Aronofsky was set to direct an HBO series pilot called &quot;Hobgoblin&quot;. Announced on June 16, 2011, the series would have depicted a group of magicians and con artists who use their powers of deception to defeat Hitler during World War II. He was set to work on the project with Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon and his wife Ayelet Waldman. In June 2013, it was announced that HBO had dropped the show and Aronofsky had pulled out, as well.

In 2011, Aronofsky tried to launch production on &quot;Noah&quot;, a retelling of the Bible story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, projected for a $115 million budget. By the following year, the film had secured funding and distribution from New Regency and Paramount Pictures, with Russell Crowe hired for the title role. The film was adapted into a serialized graphic novel written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, published in French in October 2011 by the Belgian publisher Le Lombard. By July 2012, Aronofsky&#x27;s crews were building an ark set in Oyster Bay, New York. Aronofsky announced the start of filming on &quot;Noah&quot; on Twitter in the same month, tweeting shots of the filming in Iceland. The film featured Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Logan Lerman, and Jennifer Connelly, with the latter having also starred in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;. During its opening weekend, &quot;Noah&quot; held the largest non-sequel opening within Russia and Brazil, and the fourth-largest opening of all time. Aronofsky did not use live animals for the film, saying in a PETA video that &quot;there&#x27;s really no reason to do it anymore because the technology has arrived&quot;. The Humane Society of the United States gave him their inaugural Humane Filmmaker Award in honor of his use of computer-generated animals. That same year, he was announced as the president of the jury for the 65th Berlin International Film Festival for February 2015.

Aronofsky&#x27;s next film, &quot;Mother!&quot;, was released by Paramount Pictures on September 15, 2017. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, Domhnall Gleeson, Ed Harris and Kristen Wiig. The film sparked controversy upon release for its depiction of violence, and, though it received generally positive reviews, it polarized audiences, becoming one of few films to receive a &quot;F&quot; CinemaScore grade. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 278 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;There&#x27;s no denying that &quot;Mother!&quot; is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though it may be too unwieldy for mainstream tastes.&quot;

His next film would be &quot;A courtroom drama of Artificial intelligence&quot;, in which he would cooperate again with Paramount Pictures, having doing so in &quot;Mother!&quot;. In 2018, he was the co-executive producer of &quot;&quot;, a virtual reality journey through the universe, that was acquired in a seven figure deal at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.

In January 2021, his next film was announced to be &quot;The Whale&quot;, a film adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter&#x27;s play of the same name, starring Brendan Fraser. &quot;The Whale&quot; had its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2022, where it received a six-minute standing ovation. Fraser&#x27;s performance was highly praised and won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.

In 2024, it was announced that Aronofsky would direct the 1990s-set crime thriller &quot;Caught Stealing&quot; for Sony Pictures, with Charlie Huston adapting his own novel and Austin Butler attached to star. The film is set to be theatrically released on August 29, 2025.

===Nonfiction work===
In 2018, Aronofsky executive produced the 10-part documentary series &quot;One Strange Rock&quot; for National Geographic. Episodes cover topics like the universe&#x27;s origins, alien life, human intelligence, and themes of survival and destruction. Daniel Fienberg of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; describes &quot;One Strange Rock&quot; as &quot;spectacular, delivering the same sort of bringing-science-to-life thrills for Earth as &quot;Cosmos&quot; did with the universe and &quot;Blue Planet&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; have done with myriad lifeforms.&quot;

Aronofsky executive produced another National Geographic docuseries showcasing the planet&#x27;s wonders, &quot;Welcome to Earth&quot;. The six-episode program was released in December 2021.

In 2020, Aronofsky produced director Lance Oppenheim&#x27;s debut feature documentary, &quot;Some Kind of Heaven&quot;. Set in The Villages retirement community in Florida, the film follows four residents who struggle to fit into the community&#x27;s prepackaged paradise. In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, A.A. Dowd says &quot;Some Kind of Heaven&quot; &quot;is surely one of the most gorgeously, strikingly shot documentaries in recent memory&quot;. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival before being released by Magnolia Pictures in 2021.

In 2022, Aronofsky produced director Alex Pritz&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Territory&quot;, about the Indigenous Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people&#x27;s struggle against advancing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, caused by farmers and unauthorized settlers. The film had its world premiere at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2022, and was released theatrically on August 19, 2022, by National Geographic to critical praise. Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; writes, &quot;&#x27;The Territory&#x27; is handsome without resting unduly on the natural beauty of its imperiled landscape, though iridescent closeups of plant and insect activity make clear the larger circle of life at stake here.&quot; The film was awarded a 2022 Peabody Award and was shortlisted for an Academy Award in the Documentary Feature Film category.

Aronofsky also created and executive produced &quot;Limitless&quot; for National Geographic, released in November 2022. The six-part series features Chris Hemsworth and delves into the science of longevity and how to live better and longer.

==Directing style==
Aronofsky&#x27;s first two films, &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, were low budget and used montages of extremely short shots, also known as hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots to create a sense of isolation.

With &quot;The Fountain&quot;, Aronofsky restricted the use of computer-generated imagery. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, &quot;Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics ... and I think the results are outstanding.&quot; He used more subtle directing in &quot;The Wrestler&quot; and &quot;Black Swan,&quot; in which a less-visceral directing style better showcases the acting and narratives. Aronofsky filmed both works with a muted palette and a grainy style. Part of this consistent style involves collaborations with frequent partners cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. Mansell&#x27;s music is often an important element of the films.

===Themes and influences===
&quot;Pi&quot; features several references to mathematics and mathematical theories. In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for &quot;Pi&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of Kurosawa and Fellini. In this film in particular I think there&#x27;s a lot of Roman Polanski influence and Terry Gilliam influence as well as a Japanese director named Shinya Tsukamoto—he directed &quot;&quot;.&quot; The visual style of &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; features numerous similarities to &quot;Tetsuo: The Iron Man&quot;.

The majority of reviewers characterized &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; in the genre of &quot;drug movies&quot;, along with films like &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;Spun&quot;, and &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying:
Dream logic is another leitmotif.

With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for &quot;The Fountain&quot;; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that &quot;The Matrix&quot; redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did &quot;The Matrix&quot; and its predecessors &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science.

In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song &quot;The Clown&quot; as a major influence on &quot;The Wrestler&quot;. It is an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance.

Aronofsky called &quot;Black Swan&quot; a companion piece to &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as &quot;too much for one movie&quot;. He compared the two films: &quot;Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would even call it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves.&quot; About the psychological thriller nature of &quot;Black Swan&quot;, actress Natalie Portman compared the film&#x27;s tone to Polanski&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, while Aronofsky said Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976) were &quot;big influences&quot; on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared &quot;Black Swan&quot; to Polanski&#x27;s early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s movies and David Cronenberg&#x27;s early work.

Aronofsky has also mentioned that he &quot;learned a lot&quot; from Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Breathless&quot;.

==Reception to films==
&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; was originally set for release in 2000, but it was met with controversy in the U.S., being rated NC-17 by the MPAA due to a graphic sex scene. Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied and the film&#x27;s distributor Artisan Entertainment decided to release the film unrated.

The question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers in &quot;Black Swan&quot; was one publicized controversy related to the film. The media gave substantial coverage to the dance double controversy: how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to Portman and how much to her &quot;dance double&quot;, Sarah Lane, an American Ballet Theatre soloist. Lane claimed to have danced more than she was credited. The director and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane&#x27;s claim. Their released statements said, &quot;We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film.&quot;

Aronofsky said in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;:

While Aronofsky&#x27;s other movies have evoked significant emotional response, they were surpassed by the controversy aroused by &quot;Noah&quot;. It was screened for the first time on March 28, 2014, and despite its PG-13 rating, it has quickly been recognized by Box Office Mojo as one of the most controversial movies of the last 35 years along with such titles as &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; or &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. &quot;Noah&quot; has been banned in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Indonesia on religious grounds with other countries following suit.

Aronofsky&#x27;s films have also been criticized for content and casting. His seventh film &quot;Mother!&quot; (2017) sparked controversy upon release due to its graphic and disturbing content, polarizing both critics and audiences. His eighth film &quot;The Whale&quot; (2022) also received controversy for lead star Brendan Fraser wearing a prosthetic suit; and for casting the heterosexual Fraser as a homosexual character. Some critics labeled the film&#x27;s messaging relating to its lead character&#x27;s obesity as fatphobic. In preparing for the role, Fraser consulted the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) and conversed with members of the group about their life experiences. The OAC recognized the controversial use of prosthetics in portraying obesity, but the organization supported its role in the film because it helped &quot;realistically portray one person&#x27;s story with obesity, something rarely seen in media&quot; rather than existing to &quot;demean or ridicule&quot;.

==Environmental activism==
Aronofsky is known for his environmental activism. A number of his films, notably &quot;Noah&quot; and &quot;Mother!&quot;, can be read as environmental parables. In 2014 he traveled to the Alberta Tar Sands with the Sierra Club&#x27;s Michael Brune and Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2015, he traveled to Alaska&#x27;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with Brune, Keri Russell, and the leaders of several veterans groups.

In 2014, he received the Humane Filmmaker Award from the Humane Society of the United States.

In 2015, he collaborated with the artist JR on &quot;The Standing March&quot;, a public art installation in Paris encouraging diplomats at COP21 to take action against climate change.

He coproduced the 2022 documentary &quot;The Territory&quot; about a Brazilian rainforest tribe&#x27;s fight to protect its existence from encroaching land grabbers.

He is a board member of the Sierra Club Foundation and The School for Field Studies.

==Personal life==
Aronofsky began dating English actress Rachel Weisz in 2001, and they were engaged in 2005. They lived in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village and had a son on May 31, 2006. In November 2010, they announced that they had been separated for months but were raising their son together.

In September 2016, he began dating American actress Jennifer Lawrence, whom he met during the filming of &quot;Mother!&quot;. The relationship ended in November 2017.

Aronofsky said of his spiritual beliefs in 2014, &quot;I think I definitely believe. My biggest expression of what I believe is in &quot;The Fountain&quot;.&quot; In 2022, he said, &quot;I do TM [Transcendental Meditation] and I love it. It&#x27;s a really helpful exercise.&quot;

In 2024, both he and his sister Patti became Polish citizens. His Polish lawyer explained that Aronofsky applied for Polish citizenship to fulfill his parents&#x27; wish.

<doc id="173296" wikidata="Q1307609" url="?curid=173296" title="Traquair House">
<text>Traquair House, approximately 7 miles southeast of Peebles, is claimed to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. Whilst not strictly a castle, it is built in the style of a fortified mansion. It pre-dates the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, and may have been one of the influences on this style. The estate contains the famous Traquair Brewery.

==History==
The house is built on the site of a hunting seat used by the Scottish kings from the 12th century, though no part of the present building can be dated with certainty before the 15th century. Alexander I was the first Scottish king to stay and hunt at Traquair. At that time it was a remote &quot;castle&quot;, surrounded by forest. Upon Alexander III&#x27;s death in 1286, the peace of the Borders region was shattered and Traquair became a key link in the chain of defence that guarded the Tweed Valley against English invasion.

Over the next two centuries Traquair&#x27;s ownership changed often, at times coming under the control of the English, and at others, the Scottish throne. In the 1460s James III conferred the estate on Dr William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Dr Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum in 1478 to the Earl of Buchan. The Earl gifted the estate to his illegitimate son, James Stuart (1480-1513), 1st Laird of Traquair, in 1491. James Stuart obtained letters of legitimation and married the heiress of the Rutherfords, with whom he received the estates of Rutherford and Wells in Roxburghshire. He was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His daughter, Jane Stewart, had a daughter Janet with the Earl of Angus born out of wedlock, who married Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven. Traquair remained the family seat of the Earls of Traquair for the next four centuries.

Mary, Queen of Scots, visited Traquair in August 1566. James VI came to Traquair on 9 March 1602.

In 1875, Traquair passed to a cousin of the Stuarts, Henry Constable Maxwell. He was a direct descendant, but via the female line. The National Portrait Gallery holds a 1992 portrait of Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair.

==Features==

Traquair is a 50-room house. The rooms include &quot;The Drawing Room&quot;, containing ancestral portraits and photographs of the current residents; &quot;The Dressing Room&quot;, which is decorated to demonstrate life in former times; &quot;The Museum Room&quot;, containing a mural dating from 1530, one of the oldest to survive in a secular building in Scotland, as well as charters stamped with the royal seals and signatures of the Scottish Kings; &quot;The King&#x27;s Room&quot;, where Mary, Queen of Scots stayed in 1566 and which contains some relics belonging to her and the Jacobites, such as her rosary, crucifix, purse, a silk quilt, and letters bearing her signature; &quot;The Still Room&quot;, where breakfast is taken among the 18th-century porcelain that decorates the shelves; and &quot;The Dining Room&quot;, one of the last additions to the house, built in the late 17th century. There is a Roman Catholic chapel built in 1829, following the Catholic emancipation. The 18th-century library contains more than 3,000 volumes. Although three lairds made alterations to the house prior to the 17th century, Traquair has changed little, architecturally, since then.

The Bear Gates at the main entrance to the grounds were installed by the fifth Earl, Charles Stuart, in 1738. When they were closed, after Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) passed through in 1745, the Earl vowed they would never be opened again until a Stuart king returned.

== &quot;Tam-Lin&quot; (film) ==
The 1970 horror film &quot;Tam-Lin&quot; was filmed at Traquair. It starred Ava Gardner; other cast members included Joanna Lumley, Stephanie Beecham and Ian McShane.

==Brewery==
The Traquair House Brewery was revived in 1965 by Peter Maxwell Stuart, the 20th laird of Traquair, using the 18th-century domestic brewery equipment that had previously been used to make beer for the house. Ale is fermented in the original oak tuns, some of which are over 200 years old. The brewery makes a range of beers, though the two main brands are &quot;Jacobite Ale&quot; and &quot;House Ale&quot;. 

Ale was brewed at Traquair during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1739 a 200-gallon copper was installed in the brew house under the chapel.

== The Maze ==
The maze was designed by John Schofield and originally planted with Leyland cypress until the severe winter in 1983 when over two thirds of the trees died. It was replanted with hardier beech trees.

<text>The panopticon is a design of institutional building with an inbuilt system of control, originated by the English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. The concept is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single corrections officer, without the inmates knowing whether or not they are being watched. 

Although it is physically impossible for the single guard to observe all the inmates&#x27; cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched motivates them to act as though they are all being watched at all times. They are effectively compelled to self-regulation. The architecture consists of a rotunda with an inspection house at its centre. From the centre, the manager or staff are able to watch the inmates. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums. He devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a panopticon prison, so the term now usually refers to that.

== Conceptual history ==

The word &quot;panopticon&quot; derives from the Greek word for &quot;all seeing&quot; – . In 1785, Jeremy Bentham, an English social reformer and founder of utilitarianism, travelled to Krichev in Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire (modern Belarus) to visit his brother, Samuel, who accompanied Prince Potemkin. Bentham arrived in Krichev in early 1786 and stayed for almost two years. While residing with his brother in Krichev, Bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters. Bentham applied his brother&#x27;s ideas on the constant observation of workers to prisons. Back in England, Bentham, with the assistance of his brother, continued to develop his theory on the panopticon. Prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison, Bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory. While in his lifetime Bentham was a prolific letter writer, he published little and remained obscure to the public until his death.

Bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity. Bentham tried to put his &quot;duty and interest junction principle&quot; into practice by encouraging a public debate on prisons. Bentham&#x27;s &quot;inspection principle&quot; applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison, but also the manager. The unaccountable gaoler was to be observed by the general public and public officials. The apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question: &quot;Who guards the guards?&quot; 

Bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept, as industrialisation advanced in England and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories. Bentham commissioned drawings from an architect, Willey Reveley. Bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched, the prisoners would need to follow the rules. Bentham also thought that Reveley&#x27;s prison design could be used for factories, asylums, hospitals, and schools. 

Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of &quot;sinister interest&quot; – that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.

== Prison design ==



Bentham&#x27;s proposal for a panopticon prison met with great interest among British government officials not only because it incorporated the pleasure-pain principle developed by the materialist philosopher Thomas Hobbes, but also because Bentham joined the emerging discussion on political economy. Bentham argued that the confinement of the prison &quot;is his punishment, preventing [the prisoner from] carrying the work to another market&quot;. Key to Bentham&#x27;s proposals and efforts to build a panopticon prison in Millbank at his own expense, was the &quot;means of extracting labour&quot; out of prisoners in the panopticon. In his 1791 writing &quot;Panopticon, or The Inspection House&quot;, Bentham reasoned that those working fixed hours needed to be overseen. Also, in 1791, Jean Philippe Garran de Coulon presented a paper on Bentham&#x27;s panopticon prison concepts to the National Legislative Assembly in revolutionary France.

In 1812, persistent problems with Newgate Prison and other London prisons prompted the British government to fund the construction of a prison in Millbank at the taxpayers&#x27; expense. Based on Bentham&#x27;s panopticon plans, the National Penitentiary opened in 1821. Millbank Prison, as it became known, was controversial, even blamed for causing mental illness among prisoners. Nevertheless, the British government placed an increasing emphasis on prisoners doing meaningful work, instead of engaging in humiliating and meaningless kill-times. Bentham lived to see Millbank Prison built and did not support the approach taken by the British government. His writings had virtually no immediate effect on the architecture of taxpayer-funded prisons that were to be built. Between 1818 and 1821, a small prison for women was built in Lancaster. It has been observed that the architect Joseph Gandy modelled it very closely on Bentham&#x27;s panopticon prison plans. The K-wing near Lancaster Castle prison is a semi-rotunda with a central tower for the supervisor and five storeys with nine cells on each floor.

It was the Pentonville prison, which was built in London after Bentham&#x27;s death in 1832, that was to serve as a model for a further 54 prisons in Victorian Britain. Built between 1840 and 1842 according to the plans of Joshua Jebb, Pentonville prison had a central hall with radial prison wings. It has been claimed that Bentham&#x27;s panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the &quot;separate system&quot;, including Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, which opened in 1829. But the Pennsylvania–Pentonville architectural model with its radial prison wings was not designed to facilitate constant surveillance of individual prisoners. Guards had to walk from the hall along the radial corridors and could only observe prisoners in their cells by looking through the cell door&#x27;s peephole.

In 1925, Cuba&#x27;s president Gerardo Machado set out to build a modern prison, based on Bentham&#x27;s concepts and employing the latest scientific theories on rehabilitation. A Cuban envoy tasked with studying US prisons in advance of the construction of Presidio Modelo had been greatly impressed with Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois and the cells in the new circular prison were too faced inwards towards a central guard tower. Because of the shuttered guard tower, the guards could see the prisoners, but the prisoners could not see the guards. Cuban officials theorised that the prisoners would &quot;behave&quot; if there was a probable chance that they were under surveillance, and once prisoners behaved, they could be rehabilitated.

Between 1926 and 1931, the Cuban government built four such panopticons connected with tunnels to a massive central structure that served as a community centre. Each panopticon had five floors with 93 cells. In keeping with Bentham&#x27;s ideas, none of the cells had doors. Prisoners were free to roam the prison and participate in workshops to learn a trade or become literate, with the hope being that they would become productive citizens. However, by the time Fidel Castro was imprisoned at Presidio Modelo, the four circulars were packed with 6,000 men, every floor was filled with trash, there was no running water, food rations were meagre, and the government supplied only the bare necessities of life.

In the Netherlands, historic panopticon prisons include Breda, Arnhem, and Haarlem penitentiary. However, these circular prisons with approximately 400 cells fail as panopticons because the inward-facing cell windows were so small that guards could not see the entire cell. The lack of surveillance that was actually possible in prisons with small cells and doors discounts many circular prison designs from being a panopticon as it had been envisaged by Bentham. In 2006, one of the first digital panopticon prisons opened in the Dutch province of Flevoland. Every prisoner in the Lelystad Prison wears an electronic tag and by design, only six guards are needed for 150 prisoners instead of the usual 15 or more.

== Architecture of other institutions ==

Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s panopticon architecture was not original, as rotundas had been used before, as for example in industrial buildings. However, Bentham turned the rotund architecture into a structure with a societal function, so that humans themselves became the object of control. The idea for a panopticon had been prompted by his brother Samuel Bentham&#x27;s work in Russia and had been inspired by existing architectural traditions. Samuel Bentham had studied at the Ecole Militaire in 1751, and at about 1773 the prominent French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux had finished his designs for the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans. William Strutt in cooperation with his friend Jeremy Bentham built a round mill in Belper, so that one supervisor could oversee an entire shop floor from the centre of the round mill. The mill was built between 1803 and 1813 and was used for production until the late 19th century. It was demolished in 1959. In Bentham&#x27;s 1812 writing &quot;Pauper management improved: particularly by means of an application of the Panopticon principle of construction&quot;, he included a building for an &quot;industry-house establishment&quot; that could hold 2000 persons. In 1812 Samuel Bentham, who had by then risen to brigadier-general, tried to persuade the British Admiralty to construct an arsenal panopticon in Kent. Before returning home to London he had constructed a panopticon in 1807, near St Petersburg, which served as a training centre for young men wishing to work in naval manufacturing. The panopticon, Bentham writes:


Though no panopticon was built during Bentham&#x27;s lifetime, his principles prompted considerable discussion and debate. Shortly after Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by Augustus Pugin, who in 1841 published the second edition of his work &quot;Contrasts&quot; in which one plate shows a &quot;Modern Poor House&quot;. He contrasted an English medieval gothic town in 1400 with the same town in 1840 where broken spires and factory chimneys dominate the skyline, with a panopticon-like building in the foreground replacing the Christian hospice. Pugin, who went on to become one of the most influential 19th-century writers on architecture, was influenced by Hegel and German idealism. In 1835 the first annual report of the Poor Law Commission included two designs by the commission&#x27;s architect Sampson Kempthorne. His Y-shape and cross-shape designs for workhouse expressed the panopticon principle by positioning the master&#x27;s room as the central point. The designs provided for the segregation of occupants and maximum visibility from the centre. Professor David Rothman came to the conclusion that Bentham&#x27;s panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the United States.

== Criticism and use as metaphor ==
In 1965, the conservative historian Shirley Robin Letwin traced the Fabian zest for social planning to early utilitarian thinkers. She argued that Bentham&#x27;s pet gadget, the panopticon prison, was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity. She accused Bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that &quot;in his ardour for reform, Bentham prepared the way for what he feared&quot;. Recent libertarian thinkers began to regard Bentham&#x27;s entire philosophy as having paved the way for totalitarian states. In the late 1960s, the American historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, who had published &quot;The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham&quot; in 1965, was at the forefront of depicting Bentham&#x27;s mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control. David John Manning published &quot;The Mind of Jeremy Bentham&quot; in 1986, in which he reasoned that Bentham&#x27;s fear of instability caused him to advocate ruthless social engineering and a society in which there could be no privacy or tolerance for the deviant.

In the mid-1970s, the panopticon was brought to the wider attention by the French psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller and the French philosopher Michel Foucault. In 1975, Foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;. He argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities, with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system. Foucault first came across the panopticon architecture when he studied the origins of clinical medicine and hospital architecture in the second half of the 18th century. He argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings, and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building, but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology.

Foucault argued that discipline had already crossed the technological threshold in the late 18th century, when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals, schools, and later factories. In his historic analysis, Foucault reasoned that with the disappearance of public executions pain had been gradually eliminated as punishment in a society ruled by reason. The modern prison in the 1970s, with its corrective technology, was rooted in the changing legal powers of the state. While acceptance for corporal punishment diminished, the state gained the right to administer more subtle methods of punishment, such as to observe. The French sociologist Henri Lefebvre studied urban space and Foucault&#x27;s interpretation of the panopticon prison, arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon. Lefebvre contended that architecture is no more than the relationship between the panopticon, people, and objects. In urban studies, academics such as Marc Schuilenburg argue that a different self-consciousness arises among humans who live in an urban area.
In 1984, Michael Radford gained international attention for the cinematographic panopticon he had staged in the film &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Of the telescreens in the landmark surveillance narrative &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), George Orwell said: &quot;there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment ... you had to live ... in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised&quot;. In Radford&#x27;s film the telescreens were bidirectional and in a world with an ever increasing number of telescreen devices the citizens of Oceania were spied on more than they thought possible. In &quot;The Electronic Eye: The Rise of Surveillance Society&quot; (1994) the sociologist David Lyon concluded that &quot;no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance, but important clues are available in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and in Bentham&#x27;s panopticon&quot;.

The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze shaped the emerging field of surveillance studies with the 1990 essay &quot;Postscript on the Societies of Control&quot;. Deleuze argued that the society of control is replacing the discipline society. With regards to the panopticon, Deleuze argued that &quot;enclosures are moulds ... but controls are a modulation&quot;. Deleuze observed that technology had allowed physical enclosures, such as schools, factories, prisons and office buildings, to be replaced by a self-governing machine, which extends surveillance in a quest to manage production and consumption. Information circulates in the control society, just like products in the modern economy, and meaningful objects of surveillance are sought out as forward-looking profiles and simulated pictures of future demands, needs and risks are drawn up.

In 1997, Thomas Mathiesen in turn expanded on Foucault&#x27;s use of the panopticon metaphor when analysing the effects of mass media on society. He argued that mass media such as broadcast television gave many people the ability to view the few from their own homes and gaze upon the lives of reporters and celebrities. Mass media has thus turned the discipline society into a viewer society. In the 1998 satirical science fiction film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, the protagonist eventually escapes the OmniCam Ecosphere, the reality television show that, unknown to him, broadcasts his life around the clock and across the globe. But in 2002, Peter Weibel noted that the entertainment industry does not consider the panopticon as a threat or punishment, but as &quot;amusement, liberation and pleasure&quot;. With reference to the &quot;Big Brother&quot; television shows of Endemol Entertainment, in which a group of people live in a container studio apartment and allow themselves to be recorded constantly, Weibel argued that the panopticon provides the masses with &quot;the pleasure of power, the pleasure of sadism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, scopophilia, and narcissism&quot;. In 2006, Shoreditch TV became available to residents of the Shoreditch in London, so that they could tune in to watch CCTV footage live. The service allowed residents &quot;to see what&#x27;s happening, check out the traffic and keep an eye out for crime&quot;.

The Cornell University professor and information theorist Branden Hookway introduced the concept of a Panspectrons in 2000: an evolution of the panopticon to the effect that it does not define an object of surveillance more, but everyone and everything is monitored. The object is defined only in relation to a specific issue.

Paris School academic Didier Bigo coined the term &quot;Banopticon&quot; to describe a situation where profiling technologies are used to determine who to place under surveillance.

In their 2004 book &quot;Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control&quot;, Derrick Jensen and George Draffan called Bentham &quot;one of the pioneers of modern surveillance&quot; and argued that his panopticon prison design serves as the model for modern supermaximum security prisons, such as Pelican Bay State Prison in California. In the 2015 book &quot;Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness&quot;, Simone Browne noted that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying slaves as cargo while drafting his panopticon proposal. She argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the panopticon. She proposes that the 1789 plan of the slave ship &quot;Brookes&quot; should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint. Drawing on Didier Bigo&#x27;s Banopticon, Browne argues that society is ruled by exceptionalism of power, where the state of emergency becomes permanent and certain groups are excluded on the basis of their future potential behaviour as determined through profiling.

=== Surveillance technology ===
The metaphor of the panopticon prison has been employed to analyse the social significance of surveillance by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public spaces. In 1990, Mike Davis reviewed the design and operation of a shopping mall, with its centralised control room, CCTV cameras and security guards, and came to the conclusion that it &quot;plagiarizes brazenly from Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s renowned nineteenth-century design&quot;. In their 1996 study of CCTV camera installations in British cities, Nicholas Fyfe and Jon Bannister called central and local government policies that facilitated the rapid spread of CCTV surveillance a dispersal of an &quot;electronic panopticon&quot;. Particular attention has been drawn to the similarities of CCTV with Bentham&#x27;s prison design because CCTV technology enabled, in effect, a central observation tower, staffed by an unseen observer.

=== Employment and management ===
Shoshana Zuboff used the metaphor of the panopticon in her 1988 book &quot;In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power&quot; to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used for employee monitoring to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term &#x27;panopticon&#x27; because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the &quot;information panopticon&quot; that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee&#x27;s contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.
Foucault&#x27;s use of the panopticon metaphor shaped the debate on workplace surveillance in the 1970s. In 1981 the sociologist Anthony Giddens expressed scepticism about the ongoing surveillance debate, criticising that &quot;Foucault&#x27;s &#x27;archaeology&#x27;, in which human beings do not make their own history but are swept along by it, does not adequately acknowledge that those subject to the power ... are knowledgeable agents, who resist, blunt or actively alter the conditions of life.&quot; The social alienation of workers and management in the industrialised production process had long been studied and theorised. In the 1950s and 1960s, the emerging behavioural science approach led to skills testing and recruitment processes that sought out employees that would be organisationally committed. Fordism, Taylorism and bureaucratic management of factories was still assumed to reflect a mature industrial society. The Hawthorne Plant experiments (1924–1933) and a significant number of subsequent empirical studies led to the reinterpretation of alienation: instead of being a given power relationship between the worker and management, it came to be seen as hindering progress and modernity. The increasing employment in the service industries has also been re-evaluated. In &quot;Entrapped by the electronic panopticon? Worker resistance in the call centre&quot; (2000), Phil Taylor and Peter Bain argue that the large number of people employed in call centres undertake predictable and monotonous work that is badly paid and offers few prospects. As such, they argue, it is comparable to factory work.

The panopticon has become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft. &quot;Time-theft&quot; by workers has become accepted as an output restriction and theft has been associated by management with all behaviour that include avoidance of work. In the past decades &quot;unproductive behaviour&quot; has been cited as rationale for introducing a range of surveillance techniques and the vilification of employees who resist them. In a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled &quot;Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time&quot; and the 2014 book by Simon Head &quot;Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans&quot;, which describes conditions at an Amazon depot in Augsburg, it is argued that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.

=== Social media ===
The concept of panopticon has been referenced in early discussions about the impact of social media. The notion of &quot;dataveillance&quot; was coined by Roger Clarke in 1987, since then academic researchers have used expressions such as &quot;superpanopticon&quot; (Mark Poster 1990), &quot;panoptic sort&quot; (Oscar H. Gandy Jr. 1993) and &quot;electronic panopticon&quot; (David Lyon 1994) to describe social media. Because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch, early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon.

In modern academic literature on social media, terms like &quot;lateral surveillance&quot;, &quot;social searching&quot;, and &quot;social surveillance&quot; are employed to critically evaluate the effects of social media. However, the sociologist Christian Fuchs treats social media like a classical panopticon. He argues that the focus should not be on the relationship between the users of a medium, but the relationship between the users and the medium. Therefore, he argues that the relationship between the large number of users and the sociotechnical Web 2.0 platform, like Facebook, amounts to a panopticon. Fuchs draws attention to the fact that use of such platforms requires identification, classification and assessment of users by the platforms and therefore, he argues, the definition of privacy must be reassessed to incorporate stronger consumer protection and protection of citizens from corporate surveillance.

== Art and literature ==

According to professor Donald Preziosi, the panopticon prison of Bentham resonates with the &quot;memory theatre&quot; of Giulio Camillo, where the sitting observer is at the centre and the phenomena are categorised in an array, which makes comparison, distinction, contrast and variation legible. Among the architectural references Bentham quoted for his panopticon prison was Ranelagh Gardens, a London pleasure garden with a dome built around 1742. At the center of the rotunda beneath the dome was an elevated platform from which a 360 degrees panorama could be viewed, illuminated through skylights. Professor Nicholas Mirzoeff compares the panopticon with the 19th-century diorama, because the architecture is arranged so that the &quot;seer&quot; views cells or galleries. 
In 1854 the work on the building that was to house the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art in London was completed. The rotunda at the centre of the building was encircled with a 91-meter procession. The interior reflected the taste for religiously meaningless ornament and emerged from the contemporary taste for recreational learning. Visitors of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art could view changing exhibits, including vacuum flasks, a pin making machine, and a cook stove. However, a competitive entertainment industry emerged in London and despite the varying music, the large fountains, interesting experiments, and opportunities for shopping, two years after opening the amateur science panopticon project closed.

Panopticon principle is the central idea in the plot of &quot;We&quot; (), a dystopian novel by Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin, written 1920–1921. Zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls.

The 1948 American film &quot;Call Northside 777&quot; features a scene filmed on location at the Stateville Penitentiary near Chicago, inside the so-called &quot;Roundhouse,&quot; a panopticon cell block built according to Bentham&#x27;s original concept, with the important difference that the central guard tower had transparent windows, making the positions and activities of the men inside it visible to all the prisoners.

Foucault&#x27;s theories positioned Bentham&#x27;s panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s Europe. This led to the widespread use of the panopticon in literature, comic books, computer games, and TV series. In &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; an abandoned panopticon is featured. In the 1981 the novella &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez on the murder of Santiago Nasar, chapter four is written with a view on the characters through the panopticon of Riohacha. Angela Carter, in her 1984 novel&quot; Nights at the Circus,&quot; linked the panopticon of &quot;Countes P&quot; to a &quot;perverse honeycomb&quot; and made the character the matriarchal queen bee. In the 2011 TV series, &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, Foucault&#x27;s panopticon is used to grasp the pressure under which the character Harold Finch suffers in the post-9/11 United States of America. The horror fiction podcast The Magnus Archives features a modified version of the Millbank Prison panopticon. Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 2023 single is named &quot;Panopticom&quot;.

In the 2014 movie, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, the Kyln high security prison incorporates panopticon features.

<doc id="173301" wikidata="Q727839" url="?curid=173301" title="Stoke-upon-Trent">
<text>Stoke-upon-Trent, also known as Stoke, is one of the six towns that along with Hanley, Burslem, Fenton, Longton and Tunstall form the city of Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire, England. 

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1874. In 1910 the six towns federated to become the County Borough of Stoke-on-Trent and later the City of Stoke-on-Trent. Since federation in 1910 it has been the seat of the city&#x27;s council, although the city centre is regarded as being in nearby Hanley.

==Name==
On 1 April 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. By 1925 the area was granted city status.

Confusion can arise over the similarity of this town&#x27;s name to that of the larger city. If the new borough had to be named after one of the original towns, the main reason for using &quot;Stoke&quot; is that this was where the new town&#x27;s administration was sited, which in turn was because Stoke had the main transport links.

The river, canal, mainline railway, and trunk road passed through the centre of Stoke. Stoke also had the main railway station (other towns were connected by the &quot;loop&quot; line) making the name of Stoke perhaps the most familiar outside the area. It made sense to name the city after the oldest and most commonly recognised name, even though it was not then the most significant town from a commercial perspective. (The commercial centre was Hanley, elevated and therefore relatively free, for most of the year, of the city&#x27;s smog and smoke.)

===Renaming proposals===
Owing to the confusion between the town of Stoke and the larger city, there have been various calls, mainly amongst business leaders and academics, to rename either the town or the larger city. Proposals for the renamed town include Old Stoke and Stoke Town. There are also proposals to rename part of Hanley to Stoke-on-Trent City Centre.

==Growth of Stoke and its transport links==
Stoke was located where the upper reaches of the Trent meets the Fowlea Brook. The later Roman road through Stoke remained the basis for local road transport long after the Roman occupation.

The Anglian name given to this ancient place of meeting and worship was the &#x27;stoc&#x27; (meeting place) on the Trent. It was the site of the first church in the area, built of wood around the year 670 by missionaries from Lindisfarne, later rebuilt in stone, and now known as Stoke Minster. A significant small town grew up around this church.

In the 18th century, the &quot;Grand Trunk&quot; canal came along the Trent valley to carry china clay from Cornwall cheaply to the Potteries (and pottery safely away). Many of the promoters of the canal were pottery magnates.

In the 19th century, the railways, too, came along the valley. The mainline Stoke-on-Trent railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) on 9 October 1848, replacing the temporary station sited at Whieldon Road which was constructed for the opening of the first NSR line on 17 April 1848. Travellers to the region would change trains at Stoke for local trains to their ticketed destination.

==King&#x27;s Hall==

The assembly hall, ballroom, exhibition hall and theatre built in 1910–11 at the time of the federation to the design of T. Wallis and J. A. Bowater, and with an impressive 19-bay dressed stone frontage on Kingsway behind the town hall. It has proved itself to be a useful adjunct to the town hall of 1834–50. This was built on Glebe Street, opposite the parish church to the design of Henry Ward. The entire Town Hall–King&#x27;s Hall complex serves the city of Stoke-on-Trent well as its chief administrative offices, including the lord mayor&#x27;s parlour combined with all the facilities of the King&#x27;s Hall for the city&#x27;s formal entertainment.

== Stoke Market==

Stoke has held markets in various locations in the town since 1818. A market was set up within the newly built town hall in the 1830s, but this did not prove popular with the market traders of the time and in 1845 the market moved to Hide Street (the building can still be seen today).

In 1883 the market relocated to a larger purpose-built building fronting Church Street &#x27;befitting its town status&#x27;. This Victorian market was all but destroyed by a fire that started on FA Cup final day (22 May 1982). Only the clock tower, entrance arch, fish section and shop frontage was saved. The current market in South Wolfe Street was opened in 1984. The former market site with its clock tower was block paved for use as an outdoor trading/event space, and a library and one-stop shop has also been added to the site.

==The Potteries==
In the 19th century, Stoke had a thriving pottery industry, hence its nickname, &quot;The Potteries&quot;. Since the last half of the 20th century, however, almost all of the bottle-shaped kilns have been taken down, due to regulations from the Clean Air Act – an estimated 4,000 bottle kilns in the heyday of the pottery industry, today reduced to a mere 46. Successful Stoke-upon-Trent potters include Spode, Copeland, Minton and Biltons.

==Stoke today==
Although Stoke is surpassed by its neighbouring town, Hanley in terms of size, population, and shops, it does have:
* Stoke Minster
* the same (abbreviated) name as the city
* the mainline railway station
* the main campus of Staffordshire University and its library (on the original site of the Staffordshire Cricket Club grounds) and the halls of residence (these latter are located on riverside land that was originally part of Hanley).
* a long-established purpose-built arthouse cinema, The Film Theatre.
* a purpose-built repertory theatre
* the Trent &amp; Mersey canal and its National Cycle Network long-distance bicycle paths (NCN Route 5)
* the main complex of council offices and chamber – clustered in and around the town hall
* the EU-funded Stoke Approach area and the outdoor artworks
* The King&#x27;s Hall music and events venue
* a free public lending library
* the outdoor and indoor markets
* The Spode Copeland pottery factory, disused since 2008 but in August 2010 at the start of a £25m regeneration programme.
* The Villas, the first conservation area in Stoke, containing several Grade II listed houses
* The Royal Stoke University Hospital, a large tertiary centre and teaching hospital affiliated with Keele University and the University of Staffordshire
* Stoke has a thriving music scene, including such bands as Deviant UK and a dedicated band rehearsals room.

Outlying townships or districts within the bounds of Stoke-upon-Trent include Boothen, Hartshill, Mount Pleasant, Penkhull and Trent Vale.

<doc id="173305" wikidata="Q407225" url="?curid=173305" title="Isobutane">
<text>Isobutane, also known as &quot;i&quot;-butane, 2-methylpropane or methylpropane, is a chemical compound with molecular formula HC(CH3)3. It is an isomer of butane. Isobutane is a colorless, odorless gas.
It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon atom. Isobutane is used as a precursor molecule in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane. 
==Production==
Isobutane is obtained by isomerization of butane.
==Uses==
Isobutane is the principal feedstock in alkylation units of refineries. Using isobutane, gasoline-grade &quot;blendstocks&quot; are generated with high branching for good combustion characteristics. Typical products created with isobutane are 2,4-dimethylpentane and especially 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.
===Solvent===
In the Chevron Phillips slurry process for making high-density polyethylene, isobutane is used as a diluent. As the slurried polyethylene is removed, isobutane is &quot;flashed&quot; off, and condensed, and recycled back into the loop reactor for this purpose.

===Precursor to &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hydroperoxide===
Isobutane is oxidized to &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hydroperoxide, which is subsequently reacted with propylene to yield propylene oxide. The tert-butanol that results as a by-product is typically used to make gasoline additives such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).

===Miscellaneous uses===
Isobutane is also used as a propellant for aerosol spray cans.

Isobutane is used as part of blended fuels, especially common in fuel canisters used for camping.

==Refrigerant==
Isobutane is used as a refrigerant. Use in refrigerators started in 1993 when Greenpeace presented the Greenfreeze project with the former East German company . In this regard, blends of pure, dry &quot;isobutane&quot; (R-600a) (that is, isobutane mixtures) have negligible ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential (having a value of 3.3 times the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22 (both of these being commonly known by the trademark Freon), R-134a, and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.

As a refrigerant, isobutane poses a fire and explosion risk in addition to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Substitution of this refrigerant for motor vehicle air conditioning systems not originally designed for isobutane is widely prohibited or discouraged.

Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons.

A leak of isobutane in the refrigerant system of a fridge initiated the 2024 Valencia residential complex fire in Spain, that claimed 10 lives.

==Nomenclature==
The traditional name isobutane was still retained in the 1993 IUPAC recommendations, but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the preferred IUPAC name is 2-methylpropane but the locant (2-) is typically omitted in general nomenclature as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain and forming the constitutional isomer &quot;n&quot;-butane.

<text>In materials science, liquefaction is a process that generates a liquid from a solid or a gas or that generates a non-liquid phase which behaves in accordance with fluid dynamics. 
It occurs both naturally and artificially. As an example of the latter, a &quot;major commercial application of liquefaction is the liquefaction of air to allow separation of the constituents, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and the noble gases.&quot; Another is the conversion of solid coal into a liquid form usable as a substitute for liquid fuels.

==Geology==

In geology, soil liquefaction refers to the process by which water-saturated, unconsolidated sediments are transformed into a substance that acts like a liquid, often in an earthquake. Soil liquefaction was blamed for building collapses in the city of Palu, Indonesia in October 2018.

In a related phenomenon, liquefaction of bulk materials in cargo ships may cause a dangerous shift in the load.

==Physics and chemistry==

In physics and chemistry, the phase transitions from solid and gas to liquid (melting and condensation, respectively) may be referred to as liquefaction. The melting point (sometimes called liquefaction point) is the temperature and pressure at which a solid becomes a liquid. In commercial and industrial situations, the process of condensing a gas to liquid is sometimes referred to as liquefaction of gases.

=== Coal ===

Coal liquefaction is the production of liquid fuels from coal using a variety of industrial processes.

===Dissolution ===

Liquefaction is also used in commercial and industrial settings to refer to mechanical dissolution of a solid by mixing, grinding or blending with a liquid.

====Food preparation====

In kitchen or laboratory settings, solids may be chopped into smaller parts sometimes in combination with a liquid, for example in food preparation or laboratory use. This may be done with a blender, or liquidiser in British English.

=== Irradiation ===
Liquefaction of silica and silicate glasses occurs on electron beam irradiation of nanosized samples in the column of transmission electron microscope.

==Biology ==

In biology, liquefaction often involves organic tissue turning into a more liquid-like state. For example, liquefactive necrosis in pathology, or liquefaction as a parameter in semen analysis.

<doc id="173310" wikidata="Q196695" url="?curid=173310" title="Green League">
<text>The Green League, ( , Vihr; ; ; ; ) shortened to the Greens, (; ) is a green political party in Finland. Ideologically, the Green League is positioned on the centre-left of the political spectrum. It is a reformist party and it supports feminism, animal rights and green liberalism.

Originally split on whether Finland should join the European Union, the Green League adopted a pro-European stance. It was the first Finnish party in favor of the federalisation of the European Union. The Green League is among the midsized political parties in Finland. The Greens hold thirteen of the 200 seats in the Finnish Parliament and two of Finland&#x27;s 15 European Parliament seats. The party is a member of the Global Greens and the European Green Party; its MEPs sit in the Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament.

Founded in 1987, the party absorbed a number of green organizations and their members, electing its first MPs in the 1987 Finnish parliamentary election. The party won ten seats in the 1991 election. Despite small losses in the 1995 election, Pekka Haavisto joined Paavo Lipponen&#x27;s first cabinet, which was composed of a &quot;rainbow&quot; coalition. This made the Green League the first green party to form a national cabinet. The party remained in government until 2002 when it resigned in opposition to nuclear power. The party slowly rose in popularity between 1995 and 2007, winning a total of 15 seats, and joined the centre-led Vanhanen II cabinet. In the 2011 election, the party suffered significant losses, dropping to ten seats, but remained in government. In 2015, the party recovered its losses, returning to 15 seats. In the 2019 election, the party achieved by far its best-ever result, winning 20 seats and 11.5% of the vote. They became the fifth-largest party in parliament and the third-most-big member of the Rinne cabinet.

After the 2017 municipal elections, the Green League was the fourth-largest party with 534 seats. They gained 211 more seats since the 2012 Finnish municipal elections. Since June 2023, the party&#x27;s leader and chairperson has been Sofia Virta. From 2015 to 2019, the party was in opposition. It provided harsh criticism regarding the policies of the conservative Sipilä cabinet on financial support for economically well-off companies, Fortum&#x27;s purchase of Uniper, and the expedited process of constitution-changing surveillance laws.

==History==

=== Founding ===
The Green League was founded on 28 February 1987 and was registered as a political party the next year. Political activity had begun already in the early 1980s, when environmental activists, feminists, disillusioned young politicians from the marginalized Liberal People&#x27;s Party and other active groups began to campaign on green issues in Finland. In 1995, it was the first European green party to be part of a state-level cabinet.

The party was founded as a popular movement, which explains its name&#x27;s descriptor, &quot;liitto&quot;, &quot;league&quot;. Initially, there was much resistance within the movement against founding a political party, motivated by Robert Michels&#x27; iron law of oligarchy, which claims that movements inevitably degenerate into oligarchies when they create a formal organization. The party still stresses openness and democratic decision-making, even if the Finnish word, &quot;liitto&quot;, has been dropped from the party&#x27;s website and advertisements, the word still remains in its official and registered name.

=== Early activities (1983–1994) ===
The first two parliamentary representatives were elected even before the registration, in the 1983 parliamentary election. These were the first independent representatives in the Finnish Parliament. In 1987 the number of seats rose to four, and in 1991 to a total of ten.

About half of the party&#x27;s members were against Finland joining the European Union in 1994. Later, polls showed that most Greens were anti-Eurozone. The party heads declined to fight against euro-adoption.

=== As part of the Lipponen Cabinets (1995–2003) ===
In the 1995 election, the Green League received a total of nine seats out of 200. The party joined the coalition cabinet led by the Social Democratic Party, and Pekka Haavisto became the Minister of the Environment, thus becoming the first green minister in Europe.

The Green League received 7.3% of the vote, and gained two additional seats in the 1999 election, raising the total to 11. The Greens continued in the next coalition cabinet, but resigned in protest on 26 May 2002, after the cabinet&#x27;s decision to allow the construction of a new nuclear plant was accepted by the parliament.

=== Growth to mainstream appeal (2003–present) ===
In 2003, the Green League received 8.0% of the vote, receiving a total of 14 seats. They increased their seats to 15 in the 2007 election while receiving 8.5% of the vote. In the 2011 election, the party lost five seats.

In the 2009 European Parliament elections, the Greens gained two of the thirteen Finnish seats in the European Parliament, which were occupied by Satu Hassi and Heidi Hautala.

At the municipal level, the Greens are an important force in the politics of the main cities of Finland. In the municipal election of 2008 the Greens received 8.9% of the vote; the vote share was considerably higher in Helsinki, where the Greens became the second-largest party with 23.2% of the vote. In several other cities, the Greens achieved the position of the third-largest party. The Greens are weaker in rural area and especially in municipalities that experience high levels of outward migration.

By the 2017 Green League party congress, Niinistö had served three full two-year terms as the chairman and stepped down according to the rules of the party. In the following leadership election, there were six candidates running for party chairman, of whom MP Touko Aalto won the election.

Soon after Aalto&#x27;s election, the popularity of the Green League surged in the polls and raised briefly as the second most popular party in the country. However, in September 2017 the poll numbers turned into a downward slope, which continued until autumn 2018. After taking a month of sick leave due to exhaustion in September 2018, Aalto soon announced that he was resigning from his post, citing depression and fatigue.

In November 2018, the Green League decided to choose a temporary chairman to lead the party into the 2019 parliamentary elections and until the next party convention. In the leadership election, former chairman Pekka Haavisto was once again elected as chairman.

In June 2019, Haavisto stepped down as the chairman of the party. Maria Ohisalo was the only candidate in the leadership election and was thus elected as chairman in the city of Pori.

In the 2023 parliamentary election, Ohisalo was re-elected with 6,937 votes. However, as the Greens suffered an election defeat, Ohisalo announced that she would not seek another term as chairman. In June 2023, she was replaced by Sofia Virta.

==Ideology and policies==
The Green League is no longer a protest party, nor an alternative movement. Some Green candidates reject classifying the party as either left-wing or right-wing. Economic opinions of the members range between left and right. However, members of the party on average place their party left of the Social Democratic Party and right of the Left Alliance.

The party is one of the strongest proponents for same-sex marriage. The party is also distinct in its opposition against universal male conscription and wants to opt for a gender-neutral, selective version. The eventual goal of the Greens is voluntary military service.

In 2015, the party included universal basic income (UBI) as a proposal in their platform. In February 2019, the party announced that it wanted to introduce a €300 universal basic income in the 2019 to 2023 parliamentary term, before transitioning to a €600 tax-free UBI during the following 2023 to 2027 parliamentary term.

In the spring of 2018, the party proposed lowering the voting age to 15.

The party stated in December 2018 that it supports investing €10 billion in Finland&#x27;s railway infrastructure and improving rail connections in the country, including building high-speed rail connections.

In September 2021, the party voted to pass an internal motion supporting the legalisation and regulation of cannabis in Finland. It thus became the first party in Finland&#x27;s Parliament to publicly state support for cannabis being legalised in the country.

<text>Edward Williams Morley (January 29, 1838 – February 24, 1923) was an American scientist known for his precise and accurate measurement of the atomic weight of oxygen, and for the Michelson–Morley experiment.

==Biography==
Morley was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Anna Clarissa Treat and the Reverend Sardis Brewster Morley. Both parents were of early colonial ancestry and of purely British origin. He grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut. During his childhood, he suffered much from ill health and was therefore educated by his father at home until the age of nineteen.

In 1857 Morley entered Williams College at Williamstown, Massachusetts, his father&#x27;s alma mater. He received his A.B. in 1860 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1863. Around 1860 he gradually shifted his attention from chemistry, which fascinated him since he was child, to optics and astronomy. In 1860–61 he mounted a transit instrument, constructed a chronograph, and made the first accurate determination of the latitude of the college observatory. This determination was the subject of his first published paper, which was read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1866.

Upon advice of his parents, Morley entered Andover Theological Seminary in 1861, finishing in 1864. It was here, probably, that he acquired a good working knowledge of Hebrew. From 1866 to 1868 he was a teacher in a private school and later, in 1868, he was called to preach in a small country parish in Ohio. At about the same time, he was appointed professor of chemistry in Western Reserve College (then situated at Hudson, Ohio and later moved to Cleveland and renamed Case Western Reserve University), where he remained until his retirement in 1906. This appointment was the turning point in his career. In 1873 he also became professor of chemistry in Cleveland Medical College, but resigned this chair in 1888 to have more time for research. Just before moving to Hudson he married Miss Imbella A. Birdsall.

During his residence in Cleveland, Morley assembled one of the best private collections of chemical periodicals in the United States. He even included Russian journals and learned enough of the Russian language to use them. After his retirement from teaching, the university purchased his library and relocated to the chemical laboratory named after him. In 1906, he moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, where he built a small house and a laboratory for his personal studies of rocks and minerals.

Morley was a prolific author; he published 55 articles. He outlived his wife by only a few months and, following a surgical operation, died in the Hartford Hospital in 1923.

==Research==

===Optics and astronomy===
Morley&#x27;s most-significant work came in the field of physics and optics. In this, he collaborated with and assisted the physicist Albert A. Michelson for several years around 1887. They set up, executed, and improved their techniques many times in what we call the Michelson–Morley experiment. This involved making more and more accurate measurements of the speed of light in various directions, and at different times of the year, as the Earth revolved in its orbit around the Sun. These careful measurements were created to measure the differences in the speed of light in different directions. Michelson and Morley always found that the speed of light did not vary at all depending on the direction of measurement, or the position of the Earth in its orbit, deducing what we call a &quot;null result&quot; for their speed-of-light experiments.

Neither he nor Michelson ever considered that these null results disproved the hypothesis of the existence of &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;, in which electromagnetic waves were thought to be propagated. Their null results led the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald to postulate what we now call the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction of physical objects in the direction of their movement in inertial frames of reference.

However, other scientists did come to the conclusion that the aether did not exist. The results of the Michelson–Morley experiments supported Albert Einstein&#x27;s strong postulate in 1905 that the speed of light is a constant in all inertial frames of reference for his Special Theory of Relativity.

Morley also collaborated with Dayton Miller on positive aether experiments after his work with Michelson. Morley himself made measurements of the speed of light when it passes through a strong magnetic field. He also studied the thermal expansion of solid materials.

===Chemistry===
At Western Reserve College, Morley was required to teach, not only chemistry, but also geology and botany, leaving him little time for research. Nevertheless, he found time during the first ten years at Hudson to publish five articles, mostly on the accuracy of measurements.

In chemistry, his original field, Morley had worked on determining accurate values for the composition of the atmosphere and the weights of its gases. His work on the atomic weight of oxygen covered a period of eleven years. Much time was spent in the calibration of instruments and improving the measurement accuracy to the highest possible degree (ca. 1 part per 10,000). In 1895 he introduced a new value for the atomic weight ratio of oxygen to hydrogen, providing the most precise determination of the atomic weight of oxygen at the time. His research on the atomic weight of oxygen was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1995.

==Honors==
Morley was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. He was the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1895 and he was the president of the American Chemical Society in 1899. In 1903, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the Davy Medal, named for the great British chemist Sir Humphry Davy, by the Royal Society of London in 1907. He also won the Elliott Cresson Medal, awarded by the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania, in 1912, for important contributions to the science of chemistry. He received the Willard Gibbs Award of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society in 1917.

The lunar crater Morley on the near side was named for him. The Morley Elementary School in West Hartford, Connecticut, was also named for him, as was the Morley Scientific Laboratory on the Williams College campus. His house in West Hartford was made a National Historic Landmark in 1975.

The Cleveland Section of the American Chemical Society (Cleveland-ACS) annually sponsors a regional award named in honor of Edward W. Morley, which consists of the Morley Medal in addition to a monetary honorarium. The purpose of this annual award by the Cleveland-ACS is to recognize contributions to chemistry through outstanding achievements in research, teaching, research administration, engineering, and public service. The contributions for which the award is given should have been made within about 250 miles of Cleveland, the research home of Edward W. Morley. Notable early awardees include Melvin S. Newman (1969) (known for Newman projections in organic chemistry), and Nobel Prize laureate George A. Olah in 1970. A list of all previous awardees to date is maintained by the ACS-Cleveland Section.

<doc id="173316" wikidata="Q194406" url="?curid=173316" title="Strychnine">
<text>Strychnine (, , ) is a highly toxic, colorless, bitter, crystalline alkaloid used as a pesticide, particularly for killing small vertebrates such as birds and rodents. Strychnine, when inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the eyes or mouth, causes poisoning which results in muscular convulsions and eventually death through asphyxia. While it is no longer used medicinally, it was used historically in small doses to strengthen muscle contractions, such as a heart and bowel stimulant and performance-enhancing drug. The most common source is from the seeds of the &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; tree.

== Biosynthesis ==
Strychnine is a terpene indole alkaloid belonging to the &quot;Strychnos&quot; family of &quot;Corynanthe&quot; alkaloids, and it is derived from tryptamine and secologanin. The biosynthesis of strychnine was solved in 2022. The enzyme, strictosidine synthase, catalyzes the condensation of tryptamine and secologanin, followed by a Pictet-Spengler reaction to form strictosidine. Many steps have been inferred by isolation of intermediates from &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;. The next step is hydrolysis of the acetal, which opens the ring by elimination of glucose (O-Glu) and provides a reactive aldehyde. The nascent aldehyde is then attacked by a secondary amine to afford geissoschizine, a common intermediate of many related compounds in the &quot;Strychnos&quot; family.

A reverse Pictet-Spengler reaction cleaves the C2–C3 bond, while subsequently forming the C3–C7 bond via a 1,2-alkyl migration, an oxidation from a Cytochrome P450 enzyme to a spiro-oxindole, nucleophilic attack from the enol at C16, and elimination of oxygen forms the C2–C16 bond to provide dehydropreakuammicine. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester and decarboxylation leads to norfluorocurarine. Stereospecific reduction of the endocyclic double bond by NADPH and hydroxylation provides the Wieland-Gumlich aldehyde, which was first isolated by Heimberger and Scott in 1973, although previously synthesized by Wieland and Gumlich in 1932. To elongate the appendage by two carbons, acetyl-CoA is added to the aldehyde in an aldol reaction to afford prestrychnine. Strychnine is then formed by a facile addition of the amine with the carboxylic acid or its activated CoA thioester, followed by ring-closure via displacement of an activated alcohol.

== Chemical synthesis ==
As early researchers noted, the strychnine molecular structure, with its specific array of rings, stereocenters, and nitrogen functional groups, is a complex synthetic target, and has stimulated interest for that reason and for interest in the structure–activity relationships underlying its pharmacologic activities. An early synthetic chemist targeting strychnine, Robert Burns Woodward, quoted the chemist who determined its structure through chemical decomposition and related physical studies as saying that &quot;for its molecular size it is the most complex organic substance known&quot; (attributed to Sir Robert Robinson).

The first total synthesis of strychnine was reported by the research group of R. B. Woodward in 1954, and is considered a classic in this field. The Woodward account published in 1954 was very brief (3 pages), but was followed by a 42-page report in 1963. The molecule has since received continuing wide attention in the years since for the challenges to synthetic organic strategy and tactics presented by its complexity; its synthesis has been targeted and its stereocontrolled preparation independently achieved by more than a dozen research groups since the first success.

== Mechanism of action ==
Strychnine is a neurotoxin which acts as an antagonist of glycine and acetylcholine receptors. It primarily affects the motor nerve fibers in the spinal cord which control muscle contraction. An impulse is triggered at one end of a nerve cell by the binding of neurotransmitters to the receptors. In the presence of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as glycine, a greater quantity of excitatory neurotransmitters must bind to receptors before an action potential is generated. Glycine acts primarily as an agonist of the glycine receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride channel in neurons located in the spinal cord and in the brain. This chloride channel allows the negatively charged chloride ions into the neuron, causing a hyperpolarization which pushes the membrane potential further from threshold. Strychnine is an antagonist of glycine; it binds noncovalently to the same receptor, preventing the inhibitory effects of glycine on the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, action potentials are triggered with lower levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. When the inhibitory signals are prevented, the motor neurons are more easily activated and the victim has spastic muscle contractions, resulting in death by asphyxiation. Strychnine binds the &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; acetylcholine binding protein (a homolog of nicotinic receptors) with high affinity but low specificity, and does so in multiple conformations.

== Toxicity ==

In high doses, strychnine is very toxic to humans (minimum lethal oral dose in adults is 30–120 mg) and many other animals (oral = 16 mg/kg in rats, 2 mg/kg in mice), and poisoning by inhalation, swallowing, or absorption through eyes or mouth can be fatal. &quot;S. nux-vomica&quot; seeds are generally effective as a poison only when they are crushed or chewed before swallowing because the pericarp is quite hard and indigestible; poisoning symptoms may therefore not appear if the seeds are ingested whole.

=== Animal toxicity ===

Strychnine poisoning in animals usually occurs from ingestion of baits designed for use against gophers, rats, squirrels, moles, chipmunks and coyotes. Strychnine is also used as a rodenticide, but is not specific to such unwanted pests and may kill other small animals. In the United States, most baits containing strychnine have been replaced with zinc phosphide baits since 1990. In the European Union, rodenticides with strychnine have been forbidden since 2006. Some animals are immune to strychnine; usually these have evolved resistance to poisonous strychnos alkaloids in the fruit they eat, such as fruit bats. The drugstore beetle has a symbiotic gut yeast that allows it to digest pure strychnine.

Strychnine toxicity in rats is dependent on sex. It is more toxic to females than to males when administered via subcutaneous injection or intraperitoneal injection. Differences are due to higher rates of metabolism by male rat liver microsomes. Dogs and cats are more susceptible among domestic animals, pigs are believed to be as susceptible as dogs, and horses are able to tolerate relatively large amounts of strychnine. Birds affected by strychnine poisoning exhibit wing droop, salivation, tremors, muscle tenseness, and convulsions. Death occurs as a result of respiratory arrest. The clinical signs of strychnine poisoning relate to its effects on the central nervous system. The first clinical signs of poisoning include nervousness, restlessness, twitching of the muscles, and stiffness of the neck. As the poisoning progresses, the muscular twitching becomes more pronounced and convulsions suddenly appear in all the skeletal muscles. The limbs are extended and the neck is curved to opisthotonus. The pupils are widely dilated. As death approaches, the convulsions follow one another with increased rapidity, severity, and duration. Death results from asphyxia due to prolonged paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Following the ingestion of strychnine, symptoms of poisoning usually appear within 15 to 60 minutes.

=== Human toxicity ===
After injection, inhalation, or ingestion, the first symptoms to appear are generalized muscle spasms. They appear very quickly after inhalation or injection – within as few as five minutes – and take somewhat longer to manifest after ingestion, typically approximately 15 minutes. With a very high dose, the onset of respiratory failure and brain death can occur in 15 to 30 minutes. If a lower dose is ingested, other symptoms begin to develop, including seizures, cramping, stiffness, hypervigilance, and agitation. Seizures caused by strychnine poisoning can start as early as 15 minutes after exposure and last 12–24 hours. They are often triggered by sights, sounds, or touch and can cause other adverse symptoms, including hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuric kidney failure, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory acidosis. During seizures, mydriasis (abnormal dilation), exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyes), and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) may occur.

As strychnine poisoning progresses, tachycardia (rapid heart beat), hypertension (high blood pressure), tachypnea (rapid breathing), cyanosis (blue discoloration), diaphoresis (sweating), water-electrolyte imbalance, leukocytosis (high number of white blood cells), trismus (lockjaw), risus sardonicus (spasm of the facial muscles), and opisthotonus (dramatic spasm of the back muscles, causing arching of the back and neck) can occur. In rare cases, the affected person may experience nausea or vomiting.

The proximate cause of death in strychnine poisoning can be cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, or brain damage.

For occupational exposures to strychnine, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set exposure limits at 0.15 mg/m3 over an 8-hour work day.

Because strychnine produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction, strychnine poisoning is often portrayed in literature and film including authors Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle.

== Treatment ==
There is no antidote for strychnine poisoning. Strychnine poisoning demands aggressive management with early control of muscle spasms, intubation for loss of airway control, toxin removal (decontamination), intravenous hydration and potentially active cooling efforts in the context of hyperthermia as well as hemodialysis in kidney failure (strychnine has not been shown to be removed by hemodialysis). Treatment involves oral administration of activated charcoal, which adsorbs strychnine within the digestive tract; unabsorbed strychnine is removed from the stomach by gastric lavage, along with tannic acid or potassium permanganate solutions to oxidize strychnine.

=== Activated charcoal ===
Activated charcoal is a substance that can bind to certain toxins in the digestive tract and prevent their absorption into the bloodstream. The effectiveness of this treatment, as well as how long it is effective after ingestion, are subject to debate. According to one source, activated charcoal is only effective within one hour of poison being ingested, although the source does not regard strychnine specifically. Other sources specific to strychnine state that activated charcoal may be used after one hour of ingestion, depending on dose and type of strychnine-containing product. Therefore, other treatment options are generally favoured over activated charcoal. 

The use of activated charcoal is considered dangerous in patients with tenuous airways or altered mental states. 

=== Other treatments ===
Most other treatment options focus on controlling the convulsions that arise from strychnine poisoning. These treatments involve keeping the patient in a quiet and darkened room, anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or diazepam, muscle relaxants such as dantrolene, barbiturates and propofol, and chloroform or heavy doses of chloral, bromide, urethane or amyl nitrite. If a poisoned person is able to survive for 6 to 12 hours subsequent to initial dose, they have a good prognosis.

The sine qua non of strychnine toxicity is the &quot;awake&quot; seizure, in which tonic-clonic activity occurs but the patient is alert and oriented throughout and afterwards. Accordingly, George Harley (1829–1896) showed in 1850 that curare (wourali) was effective for the treatment of tetanus and strychnine poisoning.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

=== Absorption ===
Strychnine may be introduced into the body orally, by inhalation, or by injection. It is a potently bitter substance, and in humans has been shown to activate bitter taste receptors TAS2R10 and TAS2R46. Strychnine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

=== Distribution ===
Strychnine is transported by plasma and red blood cells. Due to slight protein binding, strychnine leaves the bloodstream quickly and distributes to bodily tissues. Approximately 50% of the ingested dose can enter the tissues in 5 minutes. Also within a few minutes of ingestion, strychnine can be detected in the urine. Little difference was noted between oral and intramuscular administration of strychnine in a 4 mg dose. In persons killed by strychnine, the highest concentrations are found in the blood, liver, kidney and stomach wall. The usual fatal dose is 60–100 mg strychnine and is fatal after a period of 1–2 hours, though lethal doses vary depending on the individual.

=== Metabolism ===
Strychnine is rapidly metabolized by the liver microsomal enzyme system requiring NADPH and O2. Strychnine competes with the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine resulting in an excitatory state. However, the toxicokinetics after overdose have not been well described. In most severe cases of strychnine poisoning, the patient dies before reaching the hospital. The biological half-life of strychnine is about 10 hours.

=== Excretion ===
A few minutes after ingestion, strychnine is excreted unchanged in the urine, and accounts for about 5 to 15% of a sublethal dose given over 6 hours. Approximately 10 to 20% of the dose will be excreted unchanged in the urine in the first 24 hours. The percentage excreted decreases with the increasing dose. Of the amount excreted by the kidneys, about 70% is excreted in the first 6 hours, and almost 90% in the first 24 hours. Excretion is virtually complete in 48 to 72 hours.

== History ==
Strychnine was the first alkaloid to be identified in plants of the genus &quot;Strychnos&quot;, family Loganiaceae. &quot;Strychnos&quot;, named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, is a genus of trees and climbing shrubs of the Gentianales order. The genus contains 196 various species and is distributed throughout the warm regions of Asia (58 species), America (64 species), and Africa (75 species). The seeds and bark of many plants in this genus contain strychnine.

The toxic and medicinal effects of &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; have been well known from the times of ancient India, although the chemical compound itself was not identified and characterized until the 19th century. The inhabitants of these countries had historical knowledge of the species &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; and Saint-Ignatius&#x27; bean (&quot;Strychnos ignatii&quot;). &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; is a tree native to the tropical forests on the Malabar Coast in Southern India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, which attains a height of about . The tree has a crooked, short, thick trunk and the wood is close grained and very durable. The fruit has an orange color and is about the size of a large apple with a hard rind and contains five seeds, which are covered with a soft wool-like substance. The ripe seeds look like flattened disks, which are very hard. These seeds are the chief commercial source of strychnine and were first imported to and marketed in Europe as a poison to kill rodents and small predators. &quot;Strychnos ignatii&quot; is a woody climbing shrub of the Philippines. The fruit of the plant, known as Saint Ignatius&#x27; bean, contains as many as 25 seeds embedded in the pulp. The seeds contain more strychnine than other commercial alkaloids. The properties of &quot;S. nux-vomica&quot; and &quot;S. ignatii&quot; are substantially those of the alkaloid strychnine.

Strychnine was first discovered by French chemists Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre-Joseph Pelletier in 1818 in the Saint-Ignatius&#x27; bean. In some &quot;Strychnos&quot; plants a 9,10-dimethoxy derivative of strychnine, the alkaloid brucine, is also present. Brucine is not as poisonous as strychnine. Historic records indicate that preparations containing strychnine (presumably) had been used to kill dogs, cats, and birds in Europe as far back as 1640. It was allegedly used by convicted murderer William Palmer to kill his final victim, John Cook. It was also used during World War II by the Dirlewanger Brigade against civilian population.

The structure of strychnine was first determined in 1946 by Sir Robert Robinson and in 1954 this alkaloid was synthesized in a laboratory by Robert B. Woodward. This is one of the most famous syntheses in the history of organic chemistry. Both chemists won the Nobel prize (Robinson in 1947 and Woodward in 1965).

Strychnine has been used as a plot device in the author Agatha Christie&#x27;s murder mysteries.

=== Other uses ===
Strychnine was popularly used as an athletic performance enhancer and recreational stimulant in the late 19th century and early 20th century, due to its convulsant effects. One notorious instance of its use was during the 1904 Olympics marathon, when track-and-field athlete Thomas Hicks was unwittingly administered a concoction of egg whites and brandy laced with a small amount of strychnine by his assistants in a vain attempt to boost his stamina. Hicks won the race, but was hallucinating by the time he reached the finish line, and soon after collapsed.

Maximilian Theodor Buch proposed it as a cure for alcoholism around the same time. It was thought to be similar to coffee, and also has been used and abused recreationally.

Its effects are well-described in H. G. Wells&#x27; novella &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;: the title character states &quot;Strychnine is a grand tonic ... to take the flabbiness out of a man.&quot; Dr Kemp, an acquaintance, replies: &quot;It&#x27;s the devil. It&#x27;s the palaeolithic in a bottle.&quot;

<text>Commerzbank Tower is a 56-story, skyscraper in the banking district of Frankfurt, Germany. An antenna spire with a signal light on top gives the tower a total height of . It is the tallest building in Frankfurt and the tallest building in Germany. It had been the tallest building in Europe from its completion in 1997 until 2003, when it was surpassed by the Triumph-Palace in Moscow. Since the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the tower had briefly reclaimed its position as the tallest building in the European Union only to lose the title again in 2021 when Poland&#x27;s Varso Tower topped out. The Commerzbank Tower is only two metres taller than the Messeturm, which is also located in Frankfurt and was the tallest building in Europe before the construction of the Commerzbank Tower.

Commerzbank Tower was designed by Foster &amp; Partners, with Arup and Krebs &amp; Kiefer (structural engineering), J. Roger Preston with P&amp;A Petterson Ahrens (mechanical engineering), Schad &amp; Hölzel (electrical engineering). Construction of the building began in 1994 and took three years to complete. The building provides of office space for the Commerzbank headquarters, including winter gardens and natural lighting and air circulation. The building is lighted at night with a yellow lighting scheme that was designed by Thomas Ende who was allowed to display this sequence as a result of a competition.

In its immediate neighbourhood are other skyscrapers including the Eurotower (former home of the European Central Bank), the Main Tower, the Silberturm, the Japan Center and the Gallileo. The area forms Frankfurt&#x27;s central business district, commonly known as Bankenviertel.

== Features ==
When the building was planned in the early 1990s, Frankfurt&#x27;s Green Party, who governed the city together with the Social Democratic Party, encouraged the Commerzbank to design a &#x27;green&#x27; skyscraper. The result was the world&#x27;s first so-called ecological skyscraper: besides the use of &#x27;sky-gardens&#x27;, environmentally friendly technologies were employed to reduce energy required for heating and cooling.

===Sky gardens===
Commerzbank Tower is shaped as a wide rounded equilateral triangle with a central, triangular atrium. At nine different levels, the atrium opens up to one of the three sides, forming large sky gardens. These open areas allow more natural light in the building, reducing the need for artificial lighting. At the same time it ensures offices in the building&#x27;s two other sides have a view of either the city or the garden.

In order to eliminate the need of supporting columns in the sky gardens, the building was constructed in steel rather than the conventional (and cheaper) concrete. It was the first skyscraper in Germany where steel was used as the main construction material.

==In popular culture==

*Commerzbank Tower appears under the name &quot;Hurt Enterprise Headquarters&quot; as a vanilla stage 8 Euro-Contemporary building set in &quot;SimCity 4&quot; (Deluxe or with Rush Hour).
*In 2007, Wrebbit released a 3D puzzle from the Towers Made To Scale Collection, which includes Commerzbank Tower and Messeturm in one box-set.
*In his 2011 book &quot;&quot;, Michael Lewis describes a meeting with a German financier who claimed the top of the Commerzbank Tower contains a glass room that serves as a men&#x27;s toilet from which, he joked, one could, &quot;in full view of the world below, [void one&#x27;s bowels] on Deutsche Bank.&quot;

<doc id="173320" wikidata="Q613602" url="?curid=173320" title="Queenstown, New Zealand">
<text>Queenstown () is a resort town in Otago in the south-west of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is the seat and largest town in the Queenstown-Lakes District.

The town located on the northwestern edge of Lake Wakatipu, a long, thin, Z-shaped lake formed by glacial processes, and has views of nearby mountains such as The Remarkables, Cecil Peak, Walter Peak and just above the town, Ben Lomond and Queenstown Hill. Queenstown is known for its tourism businesses, especially adventure and ski tourism.

== Toponymy ==
&quot;Tāhuna&quot;, the &quot;te reo&quot; name for Queenstown, means &#x27;shallow bay&#x27;.

There are various apocryphal accounts of how Queenstown gained its name, of which the following appears to be the most likely:
There was then a public meeting to name the &quot;township on the lake&quot; in January 1863 (probably the weekend of the 3rd and 4th) in which the town was officially given the name of &quot;Queenstown&quot; in reference to Ireland&#x27;s Queenstown. By 9–10 January 1863, the town was being reported with the name of Queenstown in several reports written by a correspondent in the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; on 5 and 6 January.

==History==

===Māori settlement and presence===
The area was discovered and first settled by Māori. Kāi Tahu say that the lake was dug by the Waitaha ancestor, Rākaihautū, with his kō (digging stick) named Tūwhakaroria. After arriving at Whakatū Nelson in the waka Uruao, Rākaihautū divided his crew into two. He led one group through the interior of Te Waipounamu, digging the freshwater lakes of the island. After digging the lakes Hāwea, Wānaka, and Whakatipu Waimāori, he travelled through the Greenstone and Hollyford valleys before finally digging Whakatipu Waitai (Lake McKerrow).

The first non-Māori to see Lake Wakatipu was European Nathanael Chalmers who was guided by Reko, the chief of the Tuturau, over the Waimea Plains and up the Mataura River in September 1853. Evidence of stake nets, baskets for catching eels, spears and ashes indicated the Glenorchy area was visited by Māori. It is likely Ngāi Tahu Māori visited Queenstown en route to collect Pounamu (greenstone). A settlement called Te Kirikiri Pa was occupied by the tribe of Kāti Māmoe which was situated where the Queenstown Gardens are today, but by the time European migrants arrived in the 1860s this settlement was no longer being used.

===European settlement ===
European explorers William Gilbert Rees and Nicholas von Tunzelmann were the first non-Māori to settle the area. Rees established a high country farm in the location of Queenstown&#x27;s current town centre in 1860, but the discovery of gold in the Arrow River in 1862 encouraged Rees to convert his wool shed into a hotel named the Queen&#x27;s Arms, now known as Eichardt&#x27;s.

Many Queenstown streets bear names from the gold mining era (such as Camp Street) and some historic buildings remain. William&#x27;s Cottage, the Lake Lodge of Ophir (now Artbay Gallery), Queenstown Police Station, and St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church lie close together in a designated historic precinct.

=== 1999 flooding ===
There was a severe weather event in the South Island in November 1999, bringing torrential rainfall in the catchments of Lake Wakatipu. The level of the lake rose from 310.5 m to 312.77 m, leading to the most severe flooding in the recorded history of Queenstown. Properties in central Queenstown close to the lakeshore were flooded up to 1 m deep, causing major damage. Total insurance claims were around $50 million. Properties in Glenorchy and Kingston were also flooded, and the road from Queenstown to Glenorchy was damaged by washouts.

== Geography ==
Queenstown is situated on the shore of Lake Wakatipu, the third largest lake by surface area in New Zealand. The town is located close to the lake&#x27;s northeastern bend, at which point a small arm, the Frankton Arm, joins the lake with its principal outflow, the Kawarau River. The centre of the town is on the north shore at the point where the Frankton Arm links with the main body of the lake, but also extends to the major suburb of Frankton at the eastern end of the arm, and across to Kelvin Heights on the Kelvin Peninsula, which forms the Frankton Arm&#x27;s southern shore.

The town is at a relatively low altitude for a ski and snowboarding centre, at above sea level at the lake shore, but is nestled among mountains, most notably the scenic attraction of The Remarkables, to the town&#x27;s southeast. Below the lake lies the deep Kawarau Gorge, and there are nearby plains suitable for agriculture and viticulture. Queenstown lies close to the heart of the Central Otago wine region.

===Suburbs===
Central Queenstown contains many businesses, apartments and homes but is near many suburbs or large areas of housing: Fernhill, Sunshine Bay, Queenstown Hill, Goldfield Heights, Marina Heights, Kelvin Heights, Arthurs Point and Frankton.

Just outside Queenstown are the areas of: Arrowtown, Closeburn, Dalefield, Gibbston, Jack&#x27;s Point, Hanley&#x27;s Farm, Hayes Creek, Lake Hayes Estate, Shotover Country and Quail Rise.

===Climate===
Because of its relatively moderate altitude (310 metres) and high mountain surroundings, Queenstown has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). Summer has long warm days with temperatures that can reach 30 °C while winters are cold with temperatures often in single digits with frequent snowfall, although there is no permanent snow cover during the year. As with the rest of Central Otago, Queenstown lies within the rain shadow of the Southern Alps, but being closer to the west coast the town is more susceptible to rain-bearing fronts than nearby Cromwell, Wānaka and Alexandra. The hottest recorded temperature in Queenstown is and the coldest is , while for Queenstown Airport the hottest is and the coldest is .

=== Flood risk ===
Low-lying areas of Queenstown that are close to Lake Wakatipu are at risk of flooding because during heavy rain and snowmelt, the outflows of the lake via the Kawarau River are less than the inflows and the lake level can rise significantly. Further, the outflow down the Kawarau River is impeded by the large delta of the Shotover River – a major tributary. There is also a narrow gorge that restricts flow in the Kawarau river. As a consequence, Queenstown has been flooded several times since its establishment, and there is an on-going risk of flooding in low-lying areas. As the lake level rises, backflow through the town&#x27;s stormwater system leads to flooding in some Queenstown streets when the lake level reaches 311.3 m. This has occurred around 20 times since 1878. In any one year, there is a 13 percent chance that the lake will reach this level, and a 75 percent chance of at least one event that exceeds this level in a 10 year period.

==Demography==
Queenstown is described by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area with an area of . It had an urban population of making it the 24th-largest urban area in New Zealand. In 2016, Queenstown overtook Oamaru to become the second-largest urban area in Otago, behind Dunedin. Prior to 2023, the Queenstown urban area as defined by Statistics New Zealand didn&#x27;t include Lake Hayes or Arthurs Point, which are contiguous with Queenstown but were designated as separate urban areas.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, the Queenstown urban area had a population of 13,539 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,205 people (19.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,111 people (29.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 4,254 households. There were 7,089 males and 6,447 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.1 males per female, with 1,341 people (9.9%) aged under 15 years, 4,887 (36.1%) aged 15 to 29, 6,264 (46.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,041 (7.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 71.2% European/Pākehā, 4.5% Māori, 1.2% Pacific peoples, 17.8% Asian, and 10.5% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

The proportion of people born overseas was 58.3%, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people objected to giving their religion, 58.5% had no religion, 29.1% were Christian, 2.8% were Hindu, 0.6% were Muslim, 1.7% were Buddhist and 3.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,234 (26.5%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 759 (6.2%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,692 people (13.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 9,165 (75.1%) people were employed full-time, 1,263 (10.4%) were part-time, and 138 (1.1%) were unemployed.

==Economy==
The economy of Queenstown is a major contributor to the economy of the Queenstown Lakes District, although the district covers a much wider area than Queenstown, and includes the towns of Wānaka to the north-east, Glenorchy to the north-west and Kingston to the south.

===Housing===
Residential housing in the Queenstown area is expensive due to factors such as the town being a tourist destination, its lack of land and its desirability to foreigners and investors. Queenstown is rated the least affordable place in New Zealand to buy a property, overtaking Auckland at the start of 2017. In December 2016 the average house price in the Queenstown area rose to $1 million NZD. Between 2016 and 2019, average rents in Queenstown rose progressively; reaching 10.8% in 2016, 16% in 2017, and 7.4% in 2018, and 9.6% in 2019. 2018 census data showed 27 percent of Queenstown homes were marked as unoccupied.

During the early 2020s, Queenstown experienced a decline in rental housing. Between December 2021 and December 2022, the online auction platform Trade Me reported a 49% decline in rental listings across the Queenstown-Lakes District. Similarly, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) reported that the number of rental houses in the District had dropped by 100 between November 2021 and November 2022. Despite a building boom in 2022, Stuff reported that 27% of homes in the Lakes District were unoccupied since their owners preferred to use them as holiday homes or short-term accommodation rather than rentals By November 2022, Radio New Zealand reported that the average home in the Lakes District cost NZ$1.7 million while a three-bedroom rental cost a minimum of NZ$800 per week and a single bedroom rental NZ$500 or more per week.

In October 2022, Environment Minister David Parker confirmed that the New Zealand Government had fast-tracked the Te Pūtahi project at Lake Hayes Estate to build 748 more homes, a public transport area, and a possible school.

By early 2023, Stuff, Radio New Zealand, and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that a shortage of rental housing had forced many workers and businesspeople to sleep in cars, couches, tents, visitor hostels, and others to leave the town. In addition, the housing shortage had contributed to a worker shortage among local businesses since they had trouble attracting foreign visa workers or those from outside Queenstown. The &quot;Herald&quot; also reported that some workers in Queenstown were asking local rental agents if they could stay in vacant properties being sold. In late March 2023, 100 people participated in a protest at Queenstown&#x27;s waterfront to raise awareness of the resort town&#x27;s acute rental housing shortage. The protest was attended by National Party Southland electorate Member of Parliament Joseph Mooney and Queenstown Lakes District Councillor Craig Ferguson.

===Employment===
The area’s growth rate is one of the fastest in the country with the population growing 7.1% from 2015 to 2016 in a 12-month period. Most jobs in Queenstown are tourism- or accommodation-related. Employment growth was also the highest of any area in New Zealand at 10.3% in the March 2016 year.

===Retail===

Queenstown has a tourist-focused shopping area, centred around the Queenstown Mall. The public pedestrian street opened in 1990, and includes Reading Cinemas.

O&#x27;Connells Shopping Centre also opened in 1990, and was upgraded from 2020 through 2022.

In 1986, Queenstown was granted an exemption to allow shops to open every day of the year except Christmas Day, Easter Sunday and before 12 noon on Anzac Day (at the time, shops in New Zealand were required to close on Sundays and public holidays). The exemption was extended in 1990 allow shops to open on Easter Sunday. The exemption applies to all shops within a radius of the intersection of Camp Street and Ballarat Street (the location of the Queenstown post office in 1986), and makes Queenstown and the Lake Wakatipu basin one of only three areas in New Zealand where shops may open on Good Friday (the other two are Picton and Paihia).

==Government==

===Local===
Queenstown lies in the Queenstown-Lakes District territorial authority. It is also part of the Otago region, administered by the Otago Regional Council.

===National===

For the New Zealand Parliament, Queenstown is covered by one general electorate, Southland, and one Maori electorate, Te Tai Tonga. As of the 2023 general election, Southland is represented by Joseph Mooney (National) and Te Tai Tonga is represented by Tākuta Ferris (Te Pāti Māori).

==Tourism==
Tourism is a large component of the Queenstown economy, particularly outdoor and adventure tourism activities including skiing and snowboarding, jet boating, whitewater rafting, bungy jumping, mountain biking, skateboarding, tramping, paragliding, sky diving and fly fishing.

Queenstown is a major centre for snow sports in New Zealand, with four main mountain ski fields: Cardrona Alpine Resort, Coronet Peak, The Remarkables and Treble Cone. Cross country skiing is also available at the Waiorau Snow Farm, near Cardrona village.

A heritage steamship, the twin screw coal fired steamer TSS &quot;Earnslaw&quot; operates on Lake Wakatipu.

Queenstown lies close to the centre of the world&#x27;s southernmost wine region, the Central Otago wine region, which has a growing international reputation for its quality Pinot Noir. The Two Paddocks vineyard is owned by internationally known New Zealand actor Sam Neill, and neighbouring, historic Arrowtown features restaurants and bars.

Other tourist activities include Ben Lomond, a nearby mountain with a panoramic outlook on Bob&#x27;s Peak, and its Skyline Queenstown gondola. Queenstown hosts the Kiwi Park wildlife sanctuary, and Paradise is a nearby rural location known for its paradise duck population (&quot;Tadorna variegata&quot;). The Queenstown Trail and Skippers Road are popular walking, running, and mountain-biking tracks.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
Queenstown is accessible by road and air but not by rail (similar to Kaitaia, Taupō and Nelson).

As a resort centre, many bus services operate into Queenstown, mostly for package tours, but daily services for locals and others are available to and from Invercargill, Dunedin and Christchurch, the main cities closest to Queenstown. Bee Cards replaced GoCards on local buses on 15 September 2020.

Queenstown Airport takes flights from Australia by airlines Air New Zealand, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar and has destinations that include Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourne and Sydney (the frequency is much increased over the ski season and during summer). Domestic flights fly to Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. Queenstown Airport is New Zealand&#x27;s busiest helicopter base, also the fourth-busiest airport by passenger traffic, and is also heavily used for tourist &#x27;flightseeing&#x27;, especially to Milford Sound / Piopiotahi and Aoraki / Mount Cook, using both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.

The primary road access to the Queenstown area is via (SH6), from Cromwell through the Kawarau Gorge to Frankton, where a 9 km spur (SH6A) leads to the CBD and connects with the Glenorchy Road. SH6 continues south, crossing the Kawarau river before heading down the eastern side of Lake Wakatipu to Kingston before crossing the provincial boundary and emerging on the plains of Southland, terminating in the city of Invercargill. A difficult road over the Crown Range leads to Cardrona skifield and Wānaka, and is New Zealand&#x27;s highest paved public road pass.

Queenstown is the departure point for a large number of bus day trips to Milford Sound, which entails a return trip of approximately 12 hours. There are scenic flights available to and from Milford Sound. A return flight, including a two-hour cruise, is approximately four hours.

=== Utilities ===
In September 2023, there was an outbreak of illness caused by cryptosporidium in Queenstown, with most cases located in the central business area and affecting people under the age of 40. Health officials were unable to immediately link the cases, or identify the source of the outbreak, and described the outbreak as very unusual. A &quot;boil water&quot; notice was issued for all water supplies across Queenstown. The regulator Taumata Arowai issued a compliance order to the Queenstown Lakes District Council for one of its water treatment plants, because it did not have a protozoa barrier to prevent cryptosporidium entering the water supply.

Electricity distribution in Queenstown is the responsibility of two companies, Dunedin-based Aurora Energy and Invercargill-based Powernet. Electricity is supplied from Transpower&#x27;s national grid at its substation in Frankton, which in turn is fed by a twin-circuit 110,000-volt line from Transpower&#x27;s Cromwell substation.

Queenstown was one of the last towns in New Zealand to rely on a manual telephone exchange, requiring all calls had to be connected by an operator. By the early 1980s, the outdated system was overloaded, causing frequent delays—sometimes over an hour—frustrating locals and businesses, particularly in the tourism sector. Despite long-standing promises of an upgrade, progress was slow, prompting growing concerns and calls for urgent action. Temporary measures, such as additional switchboards and staff, provided limited relief, but fears persisted that the new system would be inadequate upon installation. After years of setbacks, Queenstown’s long-awaited automatic exchange finally opened in 1986. Fibre to the premises was rolled-out in Queenstown as part of the Fifth National Government&#x27;s Ultra-Fast Broadband programme, with the rollout completed in July 2016.

<text>Chorology (from Greek , &quot;khōros&quot;, &quot;place, space&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;) can mean
* the study of the causal relations between geographical phenomena occurring within a particular region
* the study of the spatial distribution of organisms (biogeography).

In geography, the term was first used by Strabo. In the twentieth century, Richard Hartshorne worked on that notion again. The term was popularized by Ferdinand von Richthofen.

<text>Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo (; ; 29 September 1864 – 31 December 1936) was a Spanish essayist, novelist, poet, playwright, philosopher, professor of Greek and Classics, and later rector at the University of Salamanca.

His major philosophical essay was &quot;The Tragic Sense of Life&quot; (1912), and his most famous novels were &quot;Abel Sánchez: The History of a Passion&quot; (1917), a modern exploration of the Cain and Abel story, and &quot;Mist&quot; (1914), which Literary Encyclopedia calls &quot;the most acclaimed Spanish Modernist novel&quot;.

==Biography==
Miguel de Unamuno was born in Bilbao, a port city of the Basque Country, Spain, the son of Félix de Unamuno and Salomé Jugo. As a young man, he was interested in the Basque language, which he could speak, and competed for a teaching position in the &quot;Instituto de Bilbao&quot; against Sabino Arana. The contest was finally won by the Basque scholar Resurrección María de Azkue.

Unamuno worked in all major genres: the essay, the novel, poetry, and theater, and, as a modernist, contributed greatly to dissolving the boundaries between genres. There is some debate as to whether Unamuno was in fact a member of the Generation of &#x27;98, an &quot;ex post facto&quot; literary group of Spanish intellectuals and philosophers founded by José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín)—a group that includes, besides Azorín, Antonio Machado, Ramón Pérez de Ayala, Pío Baroja, Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, among others.

Unamuno would have preferred to be a philosophy professor, but was unable to get an academic appointment; philosophy in Spain was somewhat politicized. Instead he became a Greek professor.

In 1901 Unamuno gave his well-known conference on the scientific and literary inviability of the Basque. According to Azurmendi, Unamuno went against the Basque language once his political views changed as a result of his reflection on Spain.

In addition to his writing, Unamuno played an important role in the intellectual life of Spain. He served as rector of the University of Salamanca for two periods: from 1900 to 1924 and 1930 to 1936, during a time of great social and political upheaval. During the 1910s and 1920s, he became one of the most passionate advocates of Spanish social liberalism. Unamuno linked his liberalism with his hometown of Bilbao, which, through its commerce and connection with the civilized world, Unamuno believed had developed an individualism and independent outlook in stark contrast to the narrow-mindedness of Carlist traditionalism. When in 1912 José Canalejas was assassinated by an anarchist, he blamed it on the fact that Spain lacked a &quot;true liberal democratic party&quot; and in 1914 denounced the Spanish nobility for their alleged philistinism. Along with many other Spanish writers and intellectuals, such as Benito Pérez Galdós, he was an outspoken supporter of the Allied cause during the First World War despite Spain&#x27;s official neutrality. Unamuno viewed the war as a crusade not just against the Imperial Family of the German Empire, but against the monarchy in Spain, and intensified his attacks upon King Alfonso XIII.

Unamuno was removed from his two university chairs by the dictator General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1924, over the protests of other Spanish intellectuals. As a result of his vociferous criticisms of Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship, he lived in exile until 1930, first banished to Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands; his house there is now a museum, as is his house in Salamanca. From Fuerteventura he escaped to France, as related in his book &quot;De Fuerteventura a Paris&quot;. After a year in Paris, Unamuno established himself in Hendaye, a border town in the French Basque Country, as close to Spain as he could get while remaining in France. Unamuno returned to Spain after the fall of General Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship in 1930 and took up his rectorship again. It is said in Salamanca that the day he returned to the university, Unamuno began his lecture by saying, as Fray Luis de León had done after four years of imprisonment by the Spanish Inquisition, &quot;As we were saying yesterday...&quot; (Decíamos ayer...).

Also after the fall of Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship, Spain embarked on its Second Republic. He was a candidate on the Republican/Socialist ticket and was elected, after which he led a large demonstration in the Plaza Mayor in which he raised the Republic&#x27;s flag and declared its victory. He always was a moderate and refused all political and anticlerical. In a speech delivered on 28 November 1932, at the Madrid Ateneo, Unamuno protested against Manuel Azaña&#x27;s anti-clerical policies: &quot;Even the Inquisition was limited by certain legal guarantees. But now we have something worse: a police force which is grounded only on a general sense of panic and on the invention of non-existent dangers to cover up this over-stepping of the law.&quot;

Unamuno&#x27;s dislike for Manuel Azaña&#x27;s ruling went so far as to tell a reporter who published his statement in &quot;El Adelanto&quot; in June 1936 that President Manuel Azaña &quot;should commit suicide as a patriotic act&quot;. The Republican government had a serious problem with this statement, and on 22 August 1936, they decreed that Unamuno should once again be removed from his position as rector of the university. Moreover, the government removed his name from streets and replaced it with the name of Simón Bolívar.

Having begun his literary career as an internationalist, Unamuno gradually became convinced of the universal values of Spanish culture, feeling that Spain&#x27;s essential qualities would be destroyed if influenced too much by outside forces. Thus he initially welcomed Franco&#x27;s revolt as necessary to rescue Spain from the Red Terror by forces loyal to the Second Spanish Republic. When a journalist questioned how he could side with the military and &quot;abandon a Republic that [he] helped create,&quot; Unamuno responded, it &quot;is not a fight against the liberal Republic, but a fight for civilization. What Madrid represents now is not socialism or democracy, or even communism.&quot;

However, the tactics employed by the Nationalist faction in the struggle against their republican opponents caused Unamuno to also turn against Franco. Unamuno said that the military revolt would lead to the victory of &quot;a brand of Catholicism that is not Christian and of a paranoid militarism bred in the colonial campaigns,&quot; referring in the latter case to the 1921 war with Abd el-Krim in Spanish Morocco.

In 1936 Unamuno had a public argument with Nationalist general Millán Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray—with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s—and elements of the Nationalist faction. Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was removed for a second time as the rector of the University of Salamanca. A few days later he confided to Nikos Kazantzakis:

On 21 November, he wrote to the Italian philosopher Lorenzo Giusso that &quot;The barbarism is unanimous. It is a regime of terror on both sides.&quot; In one of his final letters, dated 13 December, Unamuno, in terms that were to be widely quoted, condemned the White Terror being committed by Franco&#x27;s forces:

Broken-hearted, Unamuno was placed under house arrest by Franco, until his death.

==Confrontation with Millán Astray==

On 12 October 1936, the Spanish Civil War had been underway for just under three months; the celebration of Discovery of America had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Africanist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself.

Unamuno had supported Franco&#x27;s uprising because he believed it necessary to bring order to the anarchy created by the Popular Front, and that day he was representing General Franco in the event. By then the Republican Government had removed Unamuno from his perpetual rectory at the Salamanca University and the rebel government had restored him.

There are different versions of what occurred.

=== The Portillo/Thomas version ===
According to the British historian Hugh Thomas in his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;The Spanish Civil War&quot; (1961), the evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as &quot;cancers on the body of the nation,&quot; adding that &quot;Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.&quot;

From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the Spanish Legion&#x27;s motto &quot;&quot;¡Viva la Muerte!&quot; [Long live death!]. As was his habit, Millán Astray, the founder and first commander of the Spanish Legion, responded with &quot;¡España!&quot; [Spain!]; the crowd replied with &quot;¡Una!&quot; [One!]. He repeated &quot;¡España!&quot;; the crowd then replied &quot;¡Grande!&quot; [Great!]. A third time, Millán Astray shouted &quot;¡España!&quot;; the crowd responded &quot;Libre!&quot;&quot; [Free!] This—Spain, one, great, and free—was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall.

Unamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd:

Unamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca,
Millán Astray responded: &quot;Death to intelligence! Long live death!&quot; provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed &quot;No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!&quot;

Unamuno continued: &quot;This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win &quot;[venceréis]&quot;, because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince &quot;[pero no convenceréis]&quot;. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.&quot; Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted &quot;Take the lady&#x27;s arm!&quot; Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.

=== The Severiano Delgado version ===
In 2018, the details of Unamuno&#x27;s speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who argued that the account in a 1941 article by Luis Gabriel Portillo (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine &quot;Horizon&quot; may not have been an accurate representation of events.

Severiano Delgado, a historian and librarian at the University of Salamanca, asserts that Unamuno&#x27;s words were put in his mouth by Luis Portillo, in 1941, possibly with some help from George Orwell, in a piece in the literary magazine &quot;Horizon&quot;, entitled Unamuno&#x27;s Last Lecture. Portillo had not witnessed the event.

Severiano Delgado&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Archeology of a Myth: The act of October 12, 1936 in the auditorium of the University of Salamanca&quot;, shows how the propaganda myth arose regarding the confrontation that took place that day between Miguel de Unamuno and the general Millán Astray.

Delgado agrees that a &quot;very fierce and violent verbal confrontation&quot; between Unamuno and Millán Astray definitely occurred, which led to Unamuno being removed from his rectorship, but he thinks that the famous speech attributed to Unamuno was invented and written by Luis Portillo.&quot;

Delgado says that:
Unamuno took the floor, not to confront Millán Astray, but to answer a previous speech by Professor of Literature Francisco Maldonado who had identified Catalonia and the Basque Country with the &quot;antiespaña&quot; (Antispain). Unamuno himself was Basque and was revolted with Francisco Maldonado&#x27;s speech, but when addressing the audience, Unamuno used the example of what had happened with José Rizal (a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution). Millán Astray had fought in the Philippines and it was the reference to José Rizal that annoyed Millán Astray, who shouted &quot;The traitoring intellectuals die&quot;.

As proof that the incident was nothing more than a crossroads of hard words, the photograph reproduced on the cover of his book shows Millán Astray and Miguel de Unamuno calmly saying goodbye in the presence of Bishop Plà, with no tension between them. The photo was discovered in 2018 in the National Library and was part of the chronicle of the act that the newspaper &quot;The Advancement of Salamanca&quot; published the following day, 13 October 1936.

According to Delgado, Portillo&#x27;s account of the speech became famous when a then very young British historian Hugh Thomas, aged 30, came across it in a Horizon anthology while researching his seminal book, &quot;The Spanish Civil War&quot;, and mistakenly took it as a primary source.

==Death==
Unamuno died on 31 December 1936 during house arrest imposed by the military forces that occupied Salamanca at the time. He died as a result of the inhalation of gases from a brazier during a one hour long interview with a visitor. A recent theory cites a 2020 book by and to suggest that he may have been murdered by Bartolomé Aragón, the last person to have visited him, based on the fact that he falsely claimed to be a former student of his, was a fascist militant (and requeté) with opposed political ideas to Unamuno and had collaborated with Nationals propaganda before. In fact, the Rabaté couple never defended this theory, since they have no new evidence to support it. These circumstances are, however, well known since the time of the events in 1936, and Aragón and Unamuno had indeed a previous intellectual relationship. Additional telltale findings were: the lack of autopsy (despite having been mandatory, as the cause of death was determined to be a sudden death due to an intracranial bleeding), two screams from Unamuno heard by his maid during the Aragón visit and discrepancies in the time of death registered by the coroner and the authorities.

==Literary career and works==
===Fiction===

* &quot;Paz en la guerra&quot; (&quot;Peace in War&quot;) (1897) – a novel that explores the relationship of self and world through familiarity with death. It is based on his experiences as a child during the Carlist siege of Bilbao in the Third Carlist War.
* &quot;Amor y pedagogía&quot; (&quot;Love and Pedagogy&quot;) (1902) – a novel uniting comedy and tragedy in an absurd parody of positivist sociology.
* &quot;El espejo de la muerte&quot; (&quot;The Mirror of Death&quot;) (1913) – a collection of stories.
* &quot;Niebla&quot; (&quot;Mist&quot;) (1914) – one of Unamuno&#x27;s key works, which he called a &quot;nivola&quot; to distinguish it from the supposedly fixed form of the novel (&quot;novela&quot; in Spanish).
* &quot;Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho&quot; (usually translated into English as &quot;Our Lord Don Quixote&quot;) (1914) – another key work of Unamuno, often perceived as one of the earliest works applying existential elements to &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The book, on Unamuno&#x27;s own admission, is of mixed genre with elements of personal essay, philosophy, and fiction. Unamuno felt that Miguel de Cervantes had not told the story of Don Quijote very well, cluttering it with unrelated tales. Unamuno intended this work to present Cervantes&#x27; story the way it should have been written. He felt that as a &quot;quijotista&quot; (a fan or student of Don Quixote) he was superior to Cervantes. The work is primarily of interest to those studying Unamuno, not Cervantes.
* &quot;Abel Sánchez&quot; (1917) – a novel that uses the story of Cain and Abel to explore envy.
* &quot;Tulio Montalbán&quot; (1920) – a short novel on the threat of a man&#x27;s public image undoing his true personality, a problem familiar to the famous Unamuno.
* &quot;Tres novelas ejemplares y un prólogo&quot; (&quot;Three Exemplary Novels and a Prologue&quot;) (1920) – a much-studied work with a famous prologue. The title deliberately recalls the famous &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot; of Miguel de Cervantes.
* &quot;La tía Tula&quot; (&quot;Aunt Tula&quot;) (1921) – his final large-scale novel, a work about maternity, a theme that he had already examined in &quot;Amor y pedagogía&quot; and &quot;Dos madres&quot;.
* &quot;Teresa&quot; (1924) – a narrative work that contains romantic poetry, achieving an ideal through the re-creation of the beloved.
* &quot;Cómo se hace una novela&quot; (&quot;How to Make a Novel&quot;) (1927) – the autopsy of an Unamuno novel.
* &quot;Don Sandalio, jugador de ajedrez&quot; (&quot;Don Sandalio, Chess Player&quot;) (1930).
* &quot;San Manuel Bueno, mártir&quot; (&quot;Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr&quot;) (1930) – a brief novella that synthesizes virtually all of Unamuno&#x27;s thought. The novella centres on a heroic priest who has lost his faith in immortality, yet says nothing of his doubts to his parishioners, not wanting to disturb their faith, which he recognizes is a necessary support for their lives.

===Philosophy===

Unamuno&#x27;s philosophy was not systematic but rather a negation of all systems and an affirmation of faith &quot;in itself.&quot; He developed intellectually under the influence of rationalism and positivism, but during his youth he wrote articles that clearly show his sympathy for socialism and his great concern for the situation in which he found Spain at the time. An important concept for Unamuno was &quot;intrahistoria&quot;. He thought that history could best be understood by looking at the small histories of anonymous people, rather than by focusing on major events such as wars and political pacts. Some authors relativize the importance of &quot;intrahistoria&quot; in his thinking. Those authors say that more than a clear concept, it is an ambiguous metaphor. The term first appears in the essay &quot;En torno al casticismo&quot; (1895), but Unamuno leaves it soon.

In the late nineteenth century Unamuno suffered a religious crisis and left the positivist philosophy. Then, in the early twentieth century, he developed his own thinking influenced by existentialism. Life was tragic, according to Unamuno, because of the knowledge that we are to die. He explains much of human activity as an attempt to survive, in some form, after our death. Unamuno summarized his personal creed thus: &quot;My religion is to seek for truth in life and for life in truth, even knowing that I shall not find them while I live.&quot; He said, &quot;Among men of flesh and bone there have been typical examples of those who possess this tragic sense of life. I recall now Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, Pascal, Rousseau, &quot;René&quot;, &quot;Obermann&quot;, Thomson, Leopardi, Vigny, Lenau, Kleist, Amiel, Quental, Kierkegaard—men burdened with wisdom rather than with knowledge.&quot; He provides a stimulating discussion of the differences between faith and reason in his most famous work: &quot;Del sentimiento trágico de la vida&quot; (&quot;The Tragic Sense of Life&quot;, 1912).

A historically influential paperfolder from childhood to his last, difficult days, in several works Unamuno ironically expressed philosophical views of Platonism, scholasticism, positivism, and the &quot;science vs religion&quot; issue in terms of &quot;origami&quot; figures, notably the traditional Spanish &quot;pajarita&quot;. Since he was also a linguist (professor of Greek), he coined the word &quot;cocotología&quot; (&quot;cocotology&quot;) to describe the art of paper folding. After the conclusion of &quot;Amor y pedagogía&quot; (&quot;Love and Pedagogy&quot;, 1902), he included in the volume, attributing it to one of the characters, &quot;Notes for a Treatise on Cocotology&quot; (&quot;Apuntes para un tratado de cocotología&quot;).

Along with &quot;The Tragic Sense of Life&quot;, Unamuno&#x27;s long-form essay &quot;La agonía del cristianismo&quot; (&quot;The Agony of Christianity&quot;, 1931) and his novella &quot;San Manuel Bueno, mártir&quot; (&quot;Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr&quot;, 1930) were all included on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;.

After his youthful sympathy for socialism ended, Unamuno gravitated towards liberalism. Unamuno&#x27;s conception of liberalism, elaborated in essays such as &quot;La esencia del liberalismo&quot; in 1909, was one that sought to reconcile a great respect for individual freedom with a more interventionist state, bringing him to a position closer to social liberalism. In writing about the Church in 1932 during the second Spanish Republic, Unamuno urged the clergy to end their attacks on liberalism and instead embrace it as a way of rejuvenating the faith.

Unamuno was probably the best Spanish connoisseur of Portuguese culture, literature, and history of his time. He believed it was as important for a Spaniard to become familiar with the great names of Portuguese literature as with those of Catalan literature. He believed that Iberian countries should come together through the exchange of manifestations of the spirit but he was openly against any type of Iberian Federalism.

In the final analysis Unamuno&#x27;s significance is that he was one of a number of notable interwar intellectuals, along with Julien Benda, Karl Jaspers, Johan Huizinga, and José Ortega y Gasset, who resisted the intrusion of ideology into Western intellectual life.

===Poetry===
For Unamuno, the art of poetry was a way of expressing spiritual problems. His themes were the same in his poetry as in his other fiction: spiritual anguish, the pain provoked by the silence of God, time and death.

Unamuno was always attracted to traditional meters and, though his early poems did not rhyme, he subsequently turned to rhyme in his later works.

Among his outstanding works of poetry are:
* &quot;Poesías&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;) (1907) – his first collection of poetry, in which he outlined the themes that would dominate his poetics: religious conflict, Spain, and domestic life
* &quot;Rosario de sonetos líricos&quot; (&quot;Rosary of Lyric Sonnets&quot;) (1911)
* &quot;El Cristo de Velázquez&quot; (&quot;The Christ of Velázquez&quot;) (1920) – a religious work, divided into four parts, where Unamuno analyzes the figure of Christ from different perspectives: as a symbol of sacrifice and redemption, as a reflection on his Biblical names (Christ the myth, Christ the man on the cross, Christ, God, Christ the Eucharist), as poetic meaning, as painted by Diego Velázquez, etc.
* &quot;Andanzas y visiones españolas&quot; (1922) – something of a travel book, in which Unamuno expresses profound emotion and experiments with landscape both evocative and realistic (a theme typical of his generation of writers)
* &quot;Rimas de dentro&quot; (&quot;Rhymes from Within&quot;) (1923)
* &quot;Rimas de un poeta desconocido&quot; (&quot;Rhymes from an Unknown Poet&quot;) (1924)
* &quot;De Fuerteventura a París&quot; (&quot;From Fuerteventura to Paris&quot;) (1925)
* &quot;Romancero del destierro&quot; (&quot;Ballads of Exile&quot;) (1928)
* &quot;Cancionero&quot; (&quot;Songbook&quot;) (1953, published posthumously)

===Drama===

Unamuno&#x27;s dramatic production presents a philosophical progression.

Questions such as individual spirituality, faith as a &quot;vital lie&quot;, and the problem of a double personality were at the center of &quot;La esfinge&quot; (&quot;The Sphinx&quot;) (1898), and &quot;La verdad&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;), (1899).

In 1934, he wrote &quot;El hermano Juan o El mundo es teatro&quot; (&quot;Brother Juan or The World is a Theatre&quot;).

Unamuno&#x27;s theatre is schematic; he did away with artifice and focused only on the conflicts and passions that affect the characters. This austerity was influenced by classical Greek theatre. What mattered to him was the presentation of the drama going on inside of the characters, because he understood the novel as a way of gaining knowledge about life.

By symbolizing passion and creating a theatre austere both in word and presentation, Unamuno&#x27;s theatre opened the way for the renaissance of Spanish theatre undertaken by Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Azorín, and Federico García Lorca.

==In popular culture==
* A sculpture of Unamuno&#x27;s head by Victorio Macho was installed in the City Hall of Bilbao, Spain. It was withdrawn in 1936 when Unamuno showed temporary support for the Nationalist side. During the Spanish Civil War, it was thrown into the estuary. It was later recovered. In 1984 the head was installed in Plaza Unamuno near his birthplace. In 1999, it was again thrown into the estuary after a political meeting of . It was substituted by a copy in 2000 after the original was located in the water. The original was installed in the mayor&#x27;s office.
* In 2021, United States–based jazz pianist and composer Dave Meder published an album of original music inspired by Unamuno&#x27;s life and writing, entitled &quot;Unamuno Songs and Stories&quot;.
*In the 2015 documentary &quot;&quot;, directed by Manuel Menchón, Unamuno is played by José Luis Gómez and his 1924 exile in Fuerteventura due to his critics to Primo de Rivera is depicted.
* The 2019 film &quot;While at War&quot; shows Unamuno (played by Karra Elejalde) between 18 July 1936 and his death.
* In the TV series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, the pilot Chris Rios has a book copy of &quot;The Tragic Sense of Life&quot; on the ship&#x27;s dashboard.
* The climax of the fiction (and meta-fiction) &quot;The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis&quot; (Editorial Caminho, Lisboa, Portugal, 1984; English translation, HarcourtISBN 978-0-15-199735-0, 1991) by José Saramago features a report of the famous Salamanca argument with Milan d&#x27;Astray, but seen from a Portuguese perspective.

<text>Preikestolen or Prekestolen () is a tourist attraction in the municipality of Strand in Rogaland county, Norway. Preikestolen is a steep cliff which rises above Lysefjorden. Atop the cliff, there is an almost flat top of approximately . Preikestolen is located near the western part of the fjord, and on its north side.

Tourism at the site has been increasing in the early 21st century, with 300,000 visitors in 2024, making it one of the most-visited natural tourist attractions in Norway. BASE jumpers often leap from the cliff. Due to its increased popularity, the most used path to the site (a long hike) was improved by Nepalese Sherpas in 2013.

==Name==
The old local name of the site is ; . The name &quot;Prekestolen&quot; (without the &quot;i&quot;) was coined around the year 1900 when the local tourist organisation, , wanted to promote the site for trekking. The &quot;i&quot; was added later to concord with Nynorsk, the official local form of Norwegian, and the site is now known both locally and officially as &quot;Preikestolen.&quot;
==Access==
Preikestolen is located in the southern part of the Ryfylke district in Rogaland county in Western Norway. The city of Stavanger, the fourth largest in Norway, with a number of direct flights to/from European cities, is located from the site. The parking facility for Preikestolen is located, thanks to the April 2020 opening of underwater tunnel Ryfylketunnelen, about 40 minutes from Stavanger by car.

Access to Preikestolen from Stavanger is via the Norwegian National Road 13 (Rv13). From the south, it is possible to drive to the Preikestolen parking facility via the ferry from Lauvvika to Oanes. Ferries run year-round, but have limited hours, so plan ahead if opting for ferry over tunnel.

The road to the site ends in the municipality of Strand, just south of the town of Jørpeland at a parking facility at the Preikestolen Fjellstue, with a trail extending from the parking facility to the site. A round-trip hike to Preikestolen from the closest car park takes about 3–4 hours for someone of average fitness.

The walk to Preikestolen is very steep in places. The path starts at the Preikestolhytta, at an elevation of approximately above sea level, and climbs to . The walk takes 2–3 hours depending on traffic along the trail, experience, and fitness level. Even though the elevation differential is only and the walk is not particularly long, about each way, the total elevation gain and loss over the course of the hike is more than one might initially expect, as the path climbs and descends various ridges. The walk is more difficult in winter and spring when there is snow and ice. Due to snow, it is not always possible to do the hike to the top in the winter.

Alternative access is available via a path from Bratteli – a stop for the tourist ferry from to Lysebotn that passes beneath the Pulpit Rock. This walk is more demanding, and takes 4–5 hours each way.

An alternative is to sail through the Lysefjorden, with trips running year-round. Outside of summer, the weather may be wet and cold, and clouds may obstruct views of the cliff. The ship stops at several small docks on the way in and out, including a layover at the end of the Lysefjorden at the village of Lysebotn.

===Improvement project===
In early April 2013, a project started to improve the path up to Preikestolen as the old one was so small that it often caused &quot;delays&quot;, and at some points on the path it was sometimes impossible to get through. By 2016 the path was completed. 

In 2019 a new project started to further improve paths, new website and improvement of signs.

===Safety===
The authorities have opted not to install fencing or other safety devices as they felt it would detract from the site and the fact that fatalities at the site are extremely rare, despite having hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Furthermore, there were concerns that fences or other devices might encourage dangerous behavior such as climbing onto the fences. Norwegian authorities have stated that &quot;we cannot fence in all nature in this country&quot;.

According to local press the first accidental death occurred in 2020. There have been incidents of suicide and attempted suicide.

==Nature==

===Geology===
The cliff was formed during the Last Glacial Period, approximately 10,000 years ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later carried away with the glacier. This is the cause of the angular shape of the plateau. Along the plateau itself there continues to be a deep crack. Due to these cracks, the plateau will at some point fall down, but all the geological investigations have revealed that this will not happen in the foreseeable future, and geologists have confirmed the safety of the plateau.

===Climate===
Along the fjord there is a mild and humid coastal climate.

===Surrounding landscape===
The cliff overlooks the valleys of the Ryfylke region. The mountains surrounding the cliff reach heights of up to . Some of the hilltops have plains which are interspersed with lakes.

Nearby, close to the end of the Lysefjord, is the tall mountain Kjerag which is also a hiking destination. Some tourists elect to forgo trips to Preikestolen and go to Kjerag instead.

== In popular culture ==
*A granite sculpture of the cliff was erected in the town Langeskov in Denmark to commemorate its twin town of Forsand.
*In the final scene of the final episode of the second season of &quot;Vikings&quot; the main character, Ragnar Lothbrok, is seen sitting atop Preikestolen.
*Compressed air from Lysefjorden/Preikestolen is being sold in cans, mostly to China.
*The final fight scene (from 2h:10m to 2h:15m) in &quot;&quot; features Tom Cruise climbing the face of the cliff at Preikestolen, although in the movie it is supposed to be in Indian-administered Kashmir, now administered by India as Laddakh union territory.

<doc id="173330" wikidata="Q92572" url="?curid=173330" title="FLCL">
<text>is an anime anthology series created and directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, written by Yōji Enokido, and produced by the FLCL Production Committee, which consisted of Gainax, Production I.G, and King Records. The series tells the adventures of the eccentric, hyperactive alien Haruko Haruhara and her various conflicts on Earth against the intergalactic megalomaniacal corporation Medical Mechanica, often wreaking mass destruction in the process and disrupting the lives of the people she encounters. 

The original &quot;FLCL&quot; series was released as an original video animation (OVA) series, and follows Naota Nandaba, a taciturn twelve-year-old boy whose suburban life and obsession with seeming adult is disturbed by Haruko&#x27;s appearance. The six-episode series was released in Japan from April 2000 to March 2001 alongside a manga and novel adaptation.

In 2016, two new seasons totaling 12 episodes were announced as a co-production between Production I.G, Toho, and Adult Swim. The second season, &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot;, premiered on June 3, 2018, on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block, while the third season, &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot;, premiered on September 8, 2018. In Japan, &quot;Alternative&quot; and &quot;Progressive&quot; had theatrical screenings as compilation films with &quot;Alternative&quot; opening on September 7, 2018, and &quot;Progressive&quot; opening on September 28, 2018. The first episode of &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; premiered unannounced on April Fools&#x27; Day 2018 at 12 a.m. ET on Toonami in Japanese with English subtitles as part of Adult Swim&#x27;s annual stunt. Two additional seasons were ordered by Adult Swim in 2022, titled &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, respectively. Both seasons premiered in Northern America in 2023.

== Plot ==

The first season of &quot;FLCL&quot; is a coming-of-age story and revolves around Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old, working-class boy living with his widower father and grandfather. His life in the Japanese city of Mabase is interrupted by the arrival of a Vespa-riding maniac named Haruko Haruhara. She runs over Naota then revives him with CPR before hitting him on the head with her left-handed, electric bass guitar (a blue, vintage Rickenbacker 4001) and proceeds to stalk him. Finding Haruko weaseling her way into his life as a live-in maid, Naota discovers that the head injury she caused created an &quot;N.O.&quot; portal, which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge from periodically. The first of these robots is hit on the head by Haruko and becomes a friendly service robot later named Canti. Canti ingests Naota to assume the reddened form he first had when fighting the robots sent after him.

Haruko claims she is an alien investigator from the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood, and her presence places Naota and those around him in danger. The Interstellar Immigration Bureau&#x27;s Commander Amarao, whom Haruko has a history with, asserts rather that she is an apathetic seductress seeking a space-manipulating being called Atomsk who was partially contained within Canti. Every time Naota is absorbed by Canti, Atomsk is gradually brought to Earth. As Atomsk is held in Medical Mechanica&#x27;s custody and Haruko ultimately places Earth under threat, the company eventually turns their factory stationed on the planet into a doomsday terraforming device, attempting to have Naota and Canti absorbed by the doomsday device&#x27;s Terminal Core. Haruko&#x27;s plan fails as Naota ends up becoming Atomsk&#x27;s host and then releases him into the universe after a brief battle that ends Medical Mechanica&#x27;s attack on Earth. Haruko follows after Atomsk, and Mabase returns to some normalcy.

In the second season, &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot;, Haruko returns to Mabase many years after her failed attempt to contain Atomsk in the first season, although she did manage to absorb him sometime in between these events. Placing herself as a middle school homeroom teacher, Haruko targets a 14-year-old girl named Hidomi Hibajiri through her classmate and eventual love interest Ko Ide. Haruko finds opposition in both the headphones Hidomi wears and Julia Jinyu, a more stoic offshoot of Haruko that splintered from her during her initial attempt to control Atomsk&#x27;s power. Haruko eventually eats Julia to restore herself, and uses Ide to get to Hidomi. Like before, this causes conflict between Medical Mechanica and the Interstellar Immigration Bureau, as the latter was reverse-engineering Canti&#x27;s technology to utilize the N.O. channel&#x27;s energies for their own use. Atomsk appears on Earth as planned, but Haruko ends up failing again with a freed Julia taking her leave. Haruko regains her composure and is finally convinced to give up her obsession over Atomsk as completely unrequited, as Hidomi and Ide begin their relationship while Mabase rebuilds after much of it was destroyed by Medical Mechanica.

In the third season, &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot;, Haruko enters the life of high school student Kana Koumoto and her friends as she became a mentor of sorts to Kana in helping the teen&#x27;s transition into adulthood as Medical Mechanica begins its assault on Earth. While helping Kana resolve some issues as one of her friends leaves for Mars, Haruko ends up on another planet as a direct result of Kana&#x27;s reverse N.O. portal that they used to transport Medical Mechanica&#x27;s plants off the planet. The season takes place before the events of all the other seasons currently present.

In the fourth season, &quot;FLCL: Grunge&quot;, Haruko manipulates the mob-run town of Okura in a scheme to infect Medical Mechanica with a virus and steal Atomsk from them. In the process, she influences the lives of three working kids: Shinpachi, Shonari and Orinoko, before taking off after Atomsk on top of Medical Mechanica&#x27;s plant. The season takes place between the events of &quot;Shoegaze&quot; and the first season.

In the fifth season, &quot;FLCL: Shoegaze&quot;, Masaki is a teenager who sees ghosts that nobody else can see, including a large ghost bird perched atop a tower. Harumi joins him in exploring the tower after it is locked down by the Bureau of Interstellar Immigration. Kana Koumoto (from the third season) is now a 27-year-old adult working for the bureau and is called in to assist in getting the teenagers out. After setting off an explosion, the teenagers find that the tower extends into N.O. space. The bureau chief admits that the purpose of the tower is to reconnect the dimension they are currently in with a separate one that split away 10 years ago and he hopes that with enough emotional turmoil he can get Masaki to trigger the N.O. device and merge them back together. After Harumi is shot and Masaki realizes that he loves her, his N.O. field begins the merger in which Harumi realizes that she is actually from the other dimension, a colony on Mars. As Masaki calms, the merger fails, and a large snake-like entity appears. In the closing credits, Masaki is able to jump dimensions through N.O. space to visit the Mars colony. He explains that the worm-creature helps him do so and its name is Atomsk.

== Production ==
The first season of &quot;FLCL&quot; was directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the &quot;FLCL&quot; Production Committee, which included Gainax, Production I.G, and Starchild Records.

Tsurumaki has said that he tried to &quot;break the rules&quot; of anime when making &quot;FLCL&quot;, for example, by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack, and patterning the style more after &quot;a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video&quot;, creating a work that is &quot;short, but dense-packed&quot;.

&quot;FLCL&quot;″s localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show. The in-jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences. One example was a reference to Cheerio, a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time, Crystal Pepsi. Director Kazuya Tsurumaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating &quot;comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL&quot;.

The Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron. The character Amarao describes Medical Mechanica&#x27;s goal as the destruction of all thought. &quot;FLCL&quot; uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of &quot;thought&quot; by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brain&#x27;s wrinkles. For English localization, the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideology.

== Media ==
=== Original video animation ===

The six-episode series was released in Japan from April 26, 2000 – March 16, 2001. It originally debuted in the United States on Adult Swim in August 2003, where it managed to gain a significant cult following and was widely acclaimed, despite its short length. The series would continue to air on the network in the following years, including reruns on the network&#x27;s Toonami programming block from October 2013 to January 2014, and in April 2018 (to promote the then-upcoming release of &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;). The series is also available via iTunes, adultswim.com and Funimation&#x27;s website.

Six DVD compilations, each containing one episode, have been released in Japan by Gainax. In addition, a DVD collection box, containing all six DVD compilations, was released in Japan on August 13, 2005. Three DVD compilations were released by Synch-Point in North America. A DVD collection box, containing all the DVD compilations of the English episodes, was released on January 23, 2007, but have since gone out of print. In January 2010, Funimation announced that they had acquired the license for the series and would be releasing it on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in February 2011. Shortly after, it has been released in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment on a 3-disc DVD set and on Blu-ray Disc. It is also licensed in the United Kingdom by MVM Films. The series also aired in the United States on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming block from August 4 to August 13, 2003.

=== Novels ===
A three-volume novel series adaptation was written by the anime&#x27;s screenwriter, Yoji Enokido, illustrated by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Hiroyuki Imaishi, and published by Kadokawa Shoten. The novels were released in Japan in June 2000, October 2000, and March 2001 respectively. The English-language versions were published by Tokyopop and were released in North America on March 11, 2008; September 9, 2008; and March 10, 2009, respectively. The novels cover all 6 episodes of the anime, introducing elements that were not present in the original production.


=== Manga ===
A two-volume manga adaptation was created by artist Hajime Ueda. The manga interprets the series with certain elements altered and removed, and tells the events of the anime using a reductive art style and unsteady pacing. Jack Kotin defended the unique artstyle of the manga, saying &quot;It can be crudely drawn at times, but this style fits in well with the overall story and atmosphere...&quot;.

The manga was published by Kodansha and serialized in monthly &quot;Magazine Z&quot; from December 25, 1999, to March 26, 2001. The two volumes were released on October 23, 2000, and August 23, 2001, respectively. The manga was re-released in &quot;bunkoban&quot; format with the two volumes labeled and in two individual box sets titled &quot;Kodansha Box&quot;. Jō volume was on May 7, 2007, and the Ge volume was released on June 4, 2007. An edited tankōbon version of the manga that was released in box sets, were released on January 10, 2012, and February 9, 2012, respectively.

The English-language editions of the manga was released by Tokyopop on September 16, 2003, and on November 4, 2003, respectively. In March 2011, Dark Horse Comics announced to re-release the manga in omnibus edition. The omnibus edition was released on May 16, 2012, and includes remastered story pages, a remastered script, and bonus color pages.

=== Soundtracks ===

Six tracks of theme music are used for the episodes; five insert songs and one closing theme, all by Japanese rock band the Pillows. The battle themes are &quot;Advice&quot;, &quot;Little Busters&quot; and &quot;I Think I Can&quot;; the opening themes are: &quot;One Life&quot;, used in episode one, &quot;Instant Music&quot; in episodes two and three, &quot;Happy Bivouac&quot; in episode four, &quot;Runners High&quot;, in episode five, and &quot;Carnival&quot; in episode six. The closing theme of each episode is &quot;Ride on Shooting Star&quot;, the series&#x27; main theme song, used during ending sequences in which appears Yukiko Motoya and a Vespa.

Geneon Entertainment has released three original soundtracks encompassing the songs by the Pillows, and the score by composer Shinkichi Mitsumune. The first soundtrack, titled , contains tracks featured in the first three episodes of FLCL. The soundtrack was released on October 4, 2000, in Japan and January 20, 2004, in the US. The second soundtrack, titled , contains tracks featured in the last three episodes of FLCL. The soundtrack was released on July 25, 2001, in Japan and September 7, 2004, in the US. This volume features several audio dramas, with the cast of &quot;FLCL&quot; playing the various parts. Due to the dramas included, this album acts as a sequel of sorts to the anime. The third soundtrack, titled , is a compilation of the first two soundtracks, featuring only music by the Pillows. The released on June 8, 2005, and June 7, 2005, in the US. Unlike the previous two soundtracks, the songs are the original vocal versions from the band&#x27;s LPs. A fourth album title was released in September 2018 with music used in &quot;Progressive&quot; and &quot;Alternative&quot;.



== Reception and legacy ==

&quot;FLCL&quot; has received a mostly positive reception. The series has been described as &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;surreal&quot;, and has been noted for its symbolic content, unusual plot, and its soundtrack composed by the Pillows. Its experimental nature has also been noted, which includes an entire scene made in the cutout animation style of animated American series &quot;South Park&quot;, or &quot;The Matrix&quot;-like camera rotation tricks.

Christopher McDonald of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; called it &quot;downright hilarious&quot; and &quot;visually superb&quot; with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD as the only weakness of Synch-Point&#x27;s original release. Robert Nelson of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars, stating &quot;&quot;FLCL&quot; may not have a straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But &quot;FLCL&quot; does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!&quot; Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A−, stating &quot;&quot;FLCL&quot; is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life.&quot; Brian Ruh praised the series, stating &quot;It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation.&quot;

&quot;IGN&quot; columnist Davis Smith reviewed the anime shortly after its English premiere. In the article, Smith praised the series&#x27; unusual story telling, extremely high quality animation and the soundtrack provided by the Pillows; rewarding the series a score of 9 out of 10 concluding, &quot;Logic dictates that &quot;FLCL&quot; should be an undisciplined and unaffecting mess, given all the insanity that its creators are attempting to weld into a functioning whole. Yet while it&#x27;s hard to explain exactly why, it works. It entertains me. At times, it makes me laugh; at times, it makes me a little misty-eyed; at times, it makes me want to scream and howl and light things on fire and break windows with baseball bats and yes, maybe even buy a Vespa. That&#x27;s the kind of success that you just can&#x27;t argue with.&quot;

From January 3 to February 7, 2012, Hayden Childs, of the online magazine &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, composed a six-part weekly analysis and review of each &quot;FLCL&quot; episode in celebration of &quot;The Legend of Korra&#x27;s&quot; then upcoming third season, a series that was heavily influenced by &quot;FLCL&quot;″s animation style. In the article, Childs gave an extremely positive review of the series, understanding it as a surrealist inspired coming of age story, stating &quot;For all of its wild and initially bewildering aspects, the major purpose of FLCL is the impressionistic and often naturalistic documentation of Naota&#x27;s passage into maturity.&quot;

&quot;&quot; director Giancarlo Volpe has stated members of his staff &quot;were all ordered to buy &quot;FLCL&quot; and watch every single episode of it.&quot;

&quot;Chainsaw Man&quot; creator Tatsuki Fujimoto has stated in his 3 million copies sold thank you letter to fans that &quot;Chainsaw Man&quot; is a &quot;wicked version of &quot;FLCL&quot;&quot;.

=== Awards and acclaims ===
On August 12, 2003, a Time Warner press release noted the success of Cartoon Network: &quot;FLCL&quot; &quot;ranked No. 42 among all shows on ad-supported cable among adults 18–34&quot;. Also in 2003, &quot;FLCL&quot; won third place for Best Animation Film at the Fantasia Festival. On February 24, 2007, &quot;FLCL&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Cast&quot;, and won &quot;Best Comedy Series&quot; and &quot;Best Short Series&quot; at the first American Anime Awards show. &quot;Anime Insider&quot; ranked &quot;FLCL&quot; 4th in their list of the best English-licensed anime of all time in November 2007.

== Sequel seasons ==

On August 31, 2015, Anime News Network reported that Production I.G may have been planning a continuation or remake of the OVA series after announcing their acquisition of the rights to &quot;FLCL&quot; from production studio Gainax. According to Hideaki Anno, his animation studio Khara was originally set to buy the rights to &quot;FLCL&quot; from Gainax before Production I.G. However, before the deal was finalized Gainax suddenly raised the asking price causing the deal with Khara to fall though.

On March 24, 2016, via Toonami&#x27;s official Facebook and Tumblr pages, it was announced that 12 new episodes of &quot;FLCL&quot; would be produced in cooperation with Production I.G. The episodes were split into two individual seasons: and which served as sequels to the popular series, which was initially broadcast on Adult Swim in August 2003.

The synopsis of the first sequel season was published by Adult Swim:

&quot;FLCL Progressive&quot;, the sequel series, featured the return of original character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamato (as his respective role) and original series creator Kazuya Tsurumaki, who supervised the project. Hideto Iwai wrote the scripts, and Katsuyuki Motohiro served as chief director on the project, with each episode featuring a different director: Kazuto Arai, Toshihisa Kaiya, Yuki Ogawa, Yoshihide Ibata, Kei Suezawa, and Hiroshi Ikehata. The animation was produced mostly by Production I.G, but studios Production GoodBook and Signal.MD handled episodes 2 and 5, respectively. The Pillows contributed to the series soundtrack, although the score was primarily composed by R・O・N from music production company VERYGOO.

&quot;FLCL Alternative&quot;, the third season, once again saw the return of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, composer R・O・N (with tracks by the Pillows), scriptwriter Hideto Iwai, and supervisor Kazuya Tsurumaki. Katsuyuki Motohiro, as well, returned as chief director, although Yutaka Uemara was the only director, and Kiyotaka Suzuki served as assistant director. Production I.G, Revoroot, and NUT produced the animation for the series.

&quot;FLCL Progressive&quot; premiered on June 3, 2018, on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block and concluded on July 7, 2018; &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; premiered on September 8, 2018, and concluded on October 13, 2018. In Japan, &quot;Alternative&quot; and &quot;Progressive&quot; had theatrical screenings on September 7, 2018, and September 28, 2018, respectively. The first episode of &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; unexpectedly premiered early at midnight on April Fools&#x27; Day on Toonami, airing entirely in Japanese with English subtitles. The day of the second season&#x27;s US premiere, Toonami simultaneously announced via its Facebook page that they would be delaying the English subtitled versions of both new seasons until November 2018, in respect for the Japanese film format releases. Warner Bros. released &quot;FLCL Progressive&quot; on DVD on October 1, 2019. It later released &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot; on DVD along with a Blu-ray combo pack of both sequels on February 4, 2020.

Two additional seasons were ordered by Adult Swim in 2022, which were announced on Toonami&#x27;s 25th anniversary, titled &quot;FLCL: Grunge&quot; and &quot;FLCL: Shoegaze&quot;. Both seasons premiered in 2023. On October 7, 2023, it was announced there are no plans for further &quot;FLCL&quot; seasons.

<text>In mathematical modeling, overfitting is &quot;the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit to additional data or predict future observations reliably&quot;. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. In a mathematical sense, these parameters represent the degree of a polynomial. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (i.e., the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure.

Underfitting occurs when a mathematical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. An under-fitted model is a model where some parameters or terms that would appear in a correctly specified model are missing. Underfitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to nonlinear data. Such a model will tend to have poor predictive performance.

The possibility of over-fitting exists because the criterion used for selecting the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the suitability of a model. For example, a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set of training data, and yet its suitability might be determined by its ability to perform well on unseen data; overfitting occurs when a model begins to &quot;memorize&quot; training data rather than &quot;learning&quot; to generalize from a trend. 

As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, then a model can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the data in its entirety. (For an illustration, see Figure 2.) Such a model, though, will typically fail severely when making predictions. 

Overfitting is directly related to approximation error of the selected function class and the optimization error of the optimization procedure. A function class that is too large, in a suitable sense, relative to the dataset size is likely to overfit. Even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters, it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new dataset than on the dataset used for fitting (a phenomenon sometimes known as &quot;shrinkage&quot;). In particular, the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original data.

To lessen the chance or amount of overfitting, several techniques are available (e.g., model comparison, cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, pruning, Bayesian priors, or dropout). The basis of some techniques is to either (1) explicitly penalize overly complex models or (2) test the model&#x27;s ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training, which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter.

==Statistical inference==

In statistics, an inference is drawn from a statistical model, which has been selected via some procedure. Burnham &amp; Anderson, in their much-cited text on model selection, argue that to avoid overfitting, we should adhere to the &quot;Principle of Parsimony&quot;. The authors also state the following.
Overfitting is more likely to be a serious concern when there is little theory available to guide the analysis, in part because then there tend to be a large number of models to select from. The book &quot;Model Selection and Model Averaging&quot; (2008) puts it this way.
===Regression===
In regression analysis, overfitting occurs frequently. As an extreme example, if there are &quot;p&quot; variables in a linear regression with &quot;p&quot; data points, the fitted line can go exactly through every point. For logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models, there are a variety of rules of thumb (e.g. 5–9, 10 and 10–15 — the guideline of 10 observations per independent variable is known as the &quot;one in ten rule&quot;). In the process of regression model selection, the mean squared error of the random regression function can be split into random noise, approximation bias, and variance in the estimate of the regression function. The bias–variance tradeoff is often used to overcome overfit models.

With a large set of explanatory variables that actually have no relation to the dependent variable being predicted, some variables will in general be falsely found to be statistically significant and the researcher may thus retain them in the model, thereby overfitting the model. This is known as Freedman&#x27;s paradox.

==Machine learning==
Usually, a learning algorithm is trained using some set of &quot;training data&quot;: exemplary situations for which the desired output is known. The goal is that the algorithm will also perform well on predicting the output when fed &quot;validation data&quot; that was not encountered during its training.

Overfitting is the use of models or procedures that violate Occam&#x27;s razor, for example by including more adjustable parameters than are ultimately optimal, or by using a more complicated approach than is ultimately optimal. For an example where there are too many adjustable parameters, consider a dataset where training data for can be adequately predicted by a linear function of two independent variables. Such a function requires only three parameters (the intercept and two slopes). Replacing this simple function with a new, more complex quadratic function, or with a new, more complex linear function on more than two independent variables, carries a risk: Occam&#x27;s razor implies that any given complex function is &quot;a priori&quot; less probable than any given simple function. If the new, more complicated function is selected instead of the simple function, and if there was not a large enough gain in training data fit to offset the complexity increase, then the new complex function &quot;overfits&quot; the data and the complex overfitted function will likely perform worse than the simpler function on validation data outside the training dataset, even though the complex function performed as well, or perhaps even better, on the training dataset.

When comparing different types of models, complexity cannot be measured solely by counting how many parameters exist in each model; the expressivity of each parameter must be considered as well. For example, it is nontrivial to directly compare the complexity of a neural net (which can track curvilinear relationships) with parameters to a regression model with parameters.

Overfitting is especially likely in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, causing the learner to adjust to very specific random features of the training data that have no causal relation to the target function. In this process of overfitting, the performance on the training examples still increases while the performance on unseen data becomes worse.

As a simple example, consider a database of retail purchases that includes the item bought, the purchaser, and the date and time of purchase. It&#x27;s easy to construct a model that will fit the training set perfectly by using the date and time of purchase to predict the other attributes, but this model will not generalize at all to new data because those past times will never occur again.

Generally, a learning algorithm is said to overfit relative to a simpler one if it is more accurate in fitting known data (hindsight) but less accurate in predicting new data (foresight). One can intuitively understand overfitting from the fact that information from all past experience can be divided into two groups: information that is relevant for the future, and irrelevant information (&quot;noise&quot;). Everything else being equal, the more difficult a criterion is to predict (i.e., the higher its uncertainty), the more noise exists in past information that needs to be ignored. The problem is determining which part to ignore. A learning algorithm that can reduce the risk of fitting noise is called &quot;robust.&quot;

===Consequences===

The most obvious consequence of overfitting is poor performance on the validation dataset. Other negative consequences include:

* A function that is overfitted is likely to request more information about each item in the validation dataset than does the optimal function; gathering this additional unneeded data can be expensive or error-prone, especially if each individual piece of information must be gathered by human observation and manual data entry.
* A more complex, overfitted function is likely to be less portable than a simple one. At one extreme, a one-variable linear regression is so portable that, if necessary, it could even be done by hand. At the other extreme are models that can be reproduced only by exactly duplicating the original modeler&#x27;s entire setup, making reuse or scientific reproduction difficult.
* It may be possible to reconstruct details of individual training instances from an overfitted machine learning model&#x27;s training set. This may be undesirable if, for example, the training data includes sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). This phenomenon also presents problems in the area of artificial intelligence and copyright, with the developers of some generative deep learning models such as Stable Diffusion and GitHub Copilot being sued for copyright infringement because these models have been found to be capable of reproducing certain copyrighted items from their training data.

===Remedy===
The optimal function usually needs verification on bigger or completely new datasets. There are, however, methods like minimum spanning tree or life-time of correlation that applies the dependence between correlation coefficients and time-series (window width). Whenever the window width is big enough, the correlation coefficients are stable and don&#x27;t depend on the window width size anymore. Therefore, a correlation matrix can be created by calculating a coefficient of correlation between investigated variables. This matrix can be represented topologically as a complex network where direct and indirect influences between variables are visualized. 

Dropout regularisation (random removal of training set data) can also improve robustness and therefore reduce over-fitting by probabilistically removing inputs to a layer.

==Underfitting==

Underfitting is the inverse of overfitting, meaning that the statistical model or machine learning algorithm is too simplistic to accurately capture the patterns in the data. A sign of underfitting is that there is a high bias and low variance detected in the current model or algorithm used (the inverse of overfitting: low bias and high variance). This can be gathered from the Bias-variance tradeoff, which is the method of analyzing a model or algorithm for bias error, variance error, and irreducible error. With a high bias and low variance, the result of the model is that it will inaccurately represent the data points and thus insufficiently be able to predict future data results (see Generalization error). As shown in Figure 5, the linear line could not represent all the given data points due to the line not resembling the curvature of the points. We would expect to see a parabola-shaped line as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 1. If we were to use Figure 5 for analysis, we would get false predictive results contrary to the results if we analyzed Figure 6.

Burnham &amp; Anderson state the following.
===Resolving underfitting===
There are multiple ways to deal with underfitting:

# Increase the complexity of the model: If the model is too simple, it may be necessary to increase its complexity by adding more features, increasing the number of parameters, or using a more flexible model. However, this should be done carefully to avoid overfitting.
# Use a different algorithm: If the current algorithm is not able to capture the patterns in the data, it may be necessary to try a different one. For example, a neural network may be more effective than a linear regression model for some types of data.
# Increase the amount of training data: If the model is underfitting due to a lack of data, increasing the amount of training data may help. This will allow the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.
# Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large parameter values. It can also be used to prevent underfitting by controlling the complexity of the model.
# Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine multiple models to create a more accurate prediction. This can help reduce underfitting by allowing multiple models to work together to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
# Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new model features from the existing ones that may be more relevant to the problem at hand. This can help improve the accuracy of the model and prevent underfitting.

== Benign overfitting ==
Benign overfitting describes the phenomenon of a statistical model that seems to generalize well to unseen data, even when it has been fit perfectly on noisy training data (i.e., obtains perfect predictive accuracy on the training set). The phenomenon is of particular interest in deep neural networks, but is studied from a theoretical perspective in the context of much simpler models, such as linear regression. In particular, it has been shown that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in this setting. In other words, the number of directions in parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed the sample size.

<text>Stoke-on-Trent (often abbreviated to Stoke) is a city and unitary authority area in Staffordshire, England. It has an estimated population of 259,965 (as of 2022), making it the largest settlement in Staffordshire and one of the largest cities of the Midlands. Stoke is surrounded by the towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Alsager, Kidsgrove and Biddulph, which form a conurbation around the city.

The city is , formed from the federation of six towns in 1910. It took its name from the town of Stoke-upon-Trent where the main centre of government and the principal railway station in the district were located. Hanley is the primary commercial centre. The other four towns which form the city are Burslem, Tunstall, Longton and Fenton.

The home of the pottery industry in England, it is known as The Potteries. It is a centre for service industries and distribution centres. It formerly had a primarily heavy industry sector.

==History==

===Toponymy and etymology===
The name &quot;Stoke&quot; is taken from the town of Stoke-upon-Trent, the original ancient parish, with other settlements being chapelries. &quot;Stoke&quot; derives from the Old English &quot;stoc&quot;, a word that at first meant little more than &quot;place&quot;, but which subsequently gained more specific – but divergent – connotations. These variant meanings included &quot;dairy farm&quot;, &quot;secondary or dependent place or farm&quot;, &quot;summer pasture&quot;, &quot;crossing place&quot;, &quot;meeting place&quot; and &quot;place of worship&quot;. It is unknown which of these was intended here, and all are plausible. 

The most frequently suggested interpretations derive from a crossing point on the Roman road that ran from present-day Derby to Chesterton or the early presence of a church, said to have been founded in 670 AD. Because &quot;Stoke&quot; was such a common name for a settlement, some kind of distinguishing affix was usually added later, in this case, the name of the river.

The motto of Stoke-on-Trent is &quot;Vis Unita Fortior&quot; which can be translated as: United Strength is Stronger, or Strength United is the More Powerful, or A United Force is Stronger.

===Administration===

An early proposal for a federation took place in 1888 when an amendment was raised to the Local Government Bill which would have made the six towns into districts within a county of &quot;Staffordshire Potteries&quot;. On 1 April 1910 the &quot;Six Towns&quot; were brought together. The county borough of Hanley, the municipal boroughs of Burslem, Longton, and Stoke, together with the urban districts of Tunstall and Fenton now formed a single county borough of Stoke-on-Trent.

In 1919, the borough proposed to expand further and annex the neighbouring borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Wolstanton United Urban District, both to the west of Stoke. This never took place, due to strong objections from Newcastle Corporation. A further attempt was made in 1930, with the promotion of the Stoke-on-Trent Extension Bill. Ultimately, Wolstanton was instead added to Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1932. Although attempts to merge Newcastle, Wolstanton and Kidsgrove (north of Tunstall) were never successful, the borough expanded in 1922, taking in Smallthorne Urban District and parts of other parishes from Stoke upon Trent Rural District.

The borough was granted city status in 1925, with a lord mayor from 1928. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent initially applied for city status in 1925, citing its importance as the centre of the pottery industry, it was refused by the Home Office as it had fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, when a direct approach was made to King George V, who agreed that the borough ought to be a city. The public announcement of the elevation to city status was made by the king during a visit to Stoke in June 1925.

The county borough was abolished in 1974. Stoke became a non-metropolitan district of Staffordshire. Its status as a unitary authority was restored in April 1997. It remains part of the ceremonial county of Staffordshire. For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG23).

===Industry===

====Pottery====

Since the 17th century, the area has been almost exclusively known for its industrial-scale pottery manufacturing. Companies such as Royal Doulton, Dudson, Spode (founded by Josiah Spode), Wedgwood (founded by Josiah Wedgwood), Minton (founded by Thomas Minton) and Baker &amp; Co. (founded by William Baker) were established and based there. The local abundance of coal and clay suitable for earthenware production led to the early (initially limited) development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal (completed in 1777) enabled the import of china clay from Cornwall together with other materials and facilitated the production of creamware and bone china.

Other production centres in Britain, Europe and worldwide had a considerable lead in the production of high-quality wares. Methodical and highly detailed research and experimentation, carried out over many years, nurtured the development of artistic talent throughout the local community and raised the profile of Staffordshire Potteries. This was spearheaded by one man, Josiah Wedgwood, who cut the first sod for the canal in 1766 and erected his Etruria Works that year. 

Wedgwood built upon the successes of earlier local potters such as his mentor Thomas Whieldon and along with scientists and engineers, raised the pottery business to a new level. Josiah Spode introduced bone china at Trent in 1796, and Thomas Minton opened his manufactory. With the industry came a large number of notable 20th-century ceramic artists including Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, Charlotte Rhead, Frederick Hurten Rhead and Jabez Vodrey.

====Coal mining====

North Staffordshire was a centre for coal mining. The first reports of coal mining in the area come from the 13th century. The Potteries Coalfield (part of the North Staffordshire Coalfield) covers .

Striking coal miners in the Hanley and Longton area ignited the nationwide 1842 General Strike and its associated Pottery Riots.

When coal mining was nationalised in 1947, about 20,000 men worked in the industry in Stoke-on-Trent. Notable Collieries included Hanley Deep Pit, Trentham Superpit (formerly Hem Heath, Stafford and Florence Collieries), Fenton Glebe, Silverdale, Victoria, Mossfield, Parkhall, Norton, Chatterley Whitfield and Wolstanton. The industry developed greatly, and new investments in mining projects were planned within the City boundaries as recently as the 1990s. However, 1994 saw the last pit to close as the Trentham Superpit was shut.

The Stoke mining industry set several national and international records. Wolstanton Colliery, when modernised, had the deepest mining shafts in Europe at 3,197 ft. In 1933, Chatterley Whitfield Colliery became the first Colliery in the country to mine one million tons of coal. In the 1980s Florence Colliery in Longton repeatedly set regional and national production records; in 1992 the combined Trentham Superpit (Hem Heath and Florence) was the first mine in Europe to produce 2.5 million saleable tonnes of coal.

Today the mines are all closed, though the scars of mining remain on the landscape. Slag heaps are still visible on the skyline, now covered with flora and fauna. The Chatterley Whitfield site reopened as a museum two years after its closure in 1976. The museum closed in 1991 and the site became a local nature reserve. It was declared a scheduled monument by English Heritage in 1993. The abandoned subterranean mines are inaccessible, though they still add complications to many building projects and occasionally cause minor tremors, detectable only by specialised equipment.

====Steel====
The iron and steel industries occupied important roles in the development of the city, both before and after the federation. Especially notable were those mills located in the valley at Goldendale and Shelton below the hill towns of Tunstall, Burslem and Hanley. Shelton Steelworks&#x27; production of steel ended in 1978—instead of producing crude steel, they concentrated on rolling steel billet which was transported from Scunthorpe by rail. The rolling plant finally closed in 2002. From 1864 to 1927 Stoke housed the repair shops of the North Staffordshire Railway and was the home of independent railway locomotive manufacturers Kerr, Stuart and Company from 1881 to 1930.

Shelton Steel Works and the mining operations were heavily involved in the World War II industrial effort. Central to the RAF&#x27;s success was the Supermarine Spitfire designed by Reginald Mitchell who, whilst born at 115 Congleton Road in the nearby village of Butt Lane, had his apprenticeship at Kerr, Stuart and Company&#x27;s railway works.

====Other====
The Michelin tyre company has a presence in Stoke-on-Trent, and in the 1920s built their first UK plant in the city. In the 1980s nearly 9,000 workers were employed at the plant. In 2006 about 1,200 worked there. RAF Meir was located on the outskirts of the city.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Stoke-on-Trent has an area of . It is located between Manchester, Wolverhampton and Birmingham on the M6 corridor in the West Midlands region. It lies on the upper valley of the River Trent at the south-west foothills of the Pennines, near the uplands of the Peak District to the north-east and the lowlands of the Midlands and Cheshire Plain to the south and west. The city ranges from 96 to 250 metres (315 to 820 ft) above sea level.

As well as Newcastle-under-Lyme, which adjoins it to the west, other nearby towns include Crewe, Nantwich, Alsager, Congleton, Biddulph, Kidsgrove, Stafford, Uttoxeter, Eccleshall, Cheadle, Stone and Leek.

=== The Five Towns conurbation ===
Stoke-on-Trent is often known as &quot;the city of five towns&quot;, the name given to it by local novelist Arnold Bennett, and is the only in the UK. In his novels, Bennett used mostly recognisable aliases for five of the six towns, although he called Stoke &quot;Knype&quot;. Bennett said that he believed &quot;Five Towns&quot; was more euphonious than &quot;Six Towns&quot;, so he omitted Fenton, now sometimes referred to as &quot;the forgotten town&quot;. As it is a city made up of multiple towns, the city forms a conurbation. In this case, the conurbation is bigger than Stoke itself, because the urban area of Stoke is contiguous with that of administratively separate Newcastle.

The six towns run in a rough line from north to south along the A50 road – Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. Although the city is named after the original town of Stoke, and the City Council offices are located there, the city centre is usually regarded as being in Hanley, which had earlier developed into a major commercial centre.

For Eurostat purposes, it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG23); it is also one of four counties or unitary districts that compose the Shropshire and Staffordshire NUTS 2 region.

===Suburbs===
As well as the Six Towns, there are numerous suburbs. These include Abbey Hulton, Stockton Brook, Adderley Green, Ball Green, Baddeley Green, Bentilee, Birches Head, Blurton, Bucknall, Bradeley, Chell, Cliffe Vale, Cobridge, Dresden, Etruria, Fegg Hayes, Florence, Goldenhill, Hartshill, Heron Cross, Meir, Meir Park, Meir Hay, Middleport, Milton,Newstead,Normacot, Northwood, Norton le Moors, Oakhill, Packmoor, Penkhull, Sandyford, Shelton, Smallthorne, Sneyd Green, Trentham, Trent Vale and Weston Coyney. Blythe Bridge, Werrington and Endon, although outside the city&#x27;s boundaries, are part of the built-up area.

===Climate===
Stoke-on-Trent, as with all of the United Kingdom, experiences a temperate maritime climate, lacking in weather extremes. The local area is a little more elevated than much of Staffordshire and Cheshire, resulting in cooler temperatures year-round compared to the nearby Cheshire Plain. On calm, clear nights this is often reversed as cold air drainage causes a temperature inversion to occur. As such, the Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle areas are generally not susceptible to severe frosts. The nearest Met Office weather station is Keele University, about four miles west of the city centre.

The absolute high temperature is , recorded in July 2022. More typically the average warmest day of the year should be . Just under fourteen days per year have a temperature of 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or above.

The absolute minimum temperature stands at −13.3 °C (8.1 °F), recorded in January 1963. In an average year, 48.3 air frosts are registered.

Rainfall averages around 806 mm a year.

=== Green belt ===

Stoke is at the centre of the Stoke-on-Trent Green Belt, which is an environment and planning policy that regulates the rural space in Staffordshire surrounding the city and Newcastle-under-Lyme, and extending into Cheshire. It is in place to prevent urban sprawl and minimise further convergence with outlying settlements such as Kidsgrove and Biddulph. First defined in 1967, the vast majority of area covered is outside the city. 

There are some landscape features and places of interest that are covered by the designation, mainly along its fringes. These include the Trentham and Goldenhill golf courses, Hem Heath Wood Nature Reserve, Meir Heath, Barlaston Common, Caverswall Cricket Club, Park Hall Nature Reserve, Chatterley Whitfield Country Park and Enterprise Centre, the villages of Baddeley Edge and Ravenscliffe, Bucknall Reservoir, Caldon Canal, the River Blythe, and the Head of Trent, Wedgwood Museum and estate, Strongford Treatment Works and Trent Vale Pumping Station.

==Demographics==
In the 2011 census, the population of the city was 249,008. This was a modest increase from the 240,636 recorded in the 2001 census. 50.2% of the population is female. 91.68% of the population of Stoke-on-Trent were born in the UK. 

86.43% of the population identified themselves as White British, 4.19% identified as British Pakistani, and 1.88% identified as Other White. 1.35% identified as Other Asian and 1.36% as Black. Regarding religion, 60.89% described themselves as Christian, 6.02% as Muslim and 25.19% had no religion. 14.28% of the population was retired and 5.61% were students.

The city&#x27;s ceramics collection is housed in the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery in Hanley. Etruria Industrial Museum on the Caldon Canal, and Gladstone Pottery Museum in a former potbank in Longton are dedicated to the city&#x27;s industrial heritage. There is Stoke Minster which is located in the Stoke-upon-Trent area and is the only official church with Minster status.

Most of the major pottery companies based in Stoke-on-Trent have factory shops and visitor centres. The £10 million Wedgwood Museum visitor centre opened in the firm&#x27;s factory in Barlaston in October 2008. The Dudson Centre in Hanley is a museum of the family ceramics business, which is partly housed in a Grade II listed bottle kiln. It is a volunteer centre. 

Burleigh in Middleport is the world&#x27;s oldest working Victorian pottery. There are smaller factory shops, such as Royal Stafford in Burslem, Moorcroft in Cobridge and Emma Bridgewater in Hanley. There are ambitious plans to open the huge Chatterley Whitfield Colliery as a mining museum since it has been given scheduled monument status.

The Elizabethan Ford Green Hall is a 17th-century farmhouse which is now a historic house museum in Smallthorne.
Although Trentham Gardens is in the Borough of Stafford, it is just south of the city and is considered by many locals to be part of Stoke-on-Trent. Next door is Trentham Monkey Forest, which houses 140 Barbary macaques in a enclosure that visitors can walk through.

The Alton Towers Resort is east of Stoke-on-Trent and is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s best-known attractions. The Waterworld indoor swimming complex on Festival Park near Hanley is also a significant children&#x27;s attraction.

Each of the six towns in Stoke-on-Trent has at least one park. At nine hectares, Burslem Park is one of the largest registered Victorian parks in the UK. Park Hall Country Park in Weston Coyney is a national nature reserve, and its sandstone canyons are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Hartshill Park in Stoke is a nature reserve. Bucknall Park is home to the City Farm. Westport Lake in Longport is the largest body of water in Stoke-on-Trent and has a nature reserve. Queens Park or Longton Park in Dresden is one of the city&#x27;s heritage parks and is famous for its horticulture and lakes. It houses several buildings including a clock tower and three bowling pavilions.

==Economy==

Stoke-on-Trent was a world centre for fine ceramics—a skilled design trade has existed in the area since at least the 12th century. In the late 1980s and 1990s Stoke-on-Trent was hit hard by the general decline in the British manufacturing sector. Numerous factories, steelworks, collieries, and potteries were closed, including the renowned Shelton Bar steelworks. This resulted in a sharp rise in unemployment in the &#x27;high-skilled but low-paid&#x27; workforce.

The pottery firm Wedgwood and its subsidiary Royal Doulton are based nearby Barlaston, although much production now takes place in the firm&#x27;s Indonesian factory. Portmeirion is based in Stoke town, and now owns the Spode and Royal Worcester ceramics brands. Ceramics firm Emma Bridgewater is based in Hanley. Burleigh Pottery is in Middleport. Wade Ceramics is in Etruria. 

Moorcroft and Royal Stafford are based in Burslem. Aynsley China is in Longton, and is one of the last remaining manufacturers of bone china in the city. Fine china manufacturer Dudson have premises in Hanley and Burslem. Churchill China have their main factory in Tunstall. Hotelware manufacturer Steelite is based in Middleport at the former Dunn Bennett site.

About 9,000 firms are based in the city. Amongst the more notable are Bet365, founded by local businessman and Stoke City chairman Peter Coates, and formerly Phones4U, a large retailer of mobile phones started by John Caudwell, until it ceased trading in September 2014.

Stoke City Football Club has been a major symbol of the city since the early 20th century, having spent most of its history in the highest two divisions of the English league, constantly attracting large crowds and signing or launching the careers of many high-profile players – most notably Stanley Matthews and Gordon Banks. The club was based at the Victoria Ground in Stoke-upon-Trent from 1878 until 1997 when it moved to the Britannia Stadium (now the Bet365 Stadium) at Trentham Lakes. This was one of the early stages of regeneration in the Trentham area of the city, which included the regeneration of Trentham Gardens several years later when retail and food outlets were added to the visitor attraction. Trentham Monkey Forest opened nearby in 2005.

The Michelin tyre company has a complex in the city which houses its commercial head office, training centre and a truck tyre re-treading facility. Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket and The Co-operative Pharmacy have large warehouses in the city. Vodafone has a large call centre on Festival Park and the UK subsidiary of the lubricant manufacturer Fuchs Petrolub has its head office at its factory in Hanley. There is a steel foundry owned by Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd in Joiner&#x27;s Square. Premier Foods make Mr Kipling slices and Cherry Bakewells in Trent Vale. The Co-operative Travel had its head office in Burslem, before it merged with Thomas Cook in 2010.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council is the city&#x27;s largest single employer. Another major employer is the Royal Stoke University Hospital, with over 7,000 staff.

KPMG&#x27;s &quot;Competitive Alternatives 2004&quot; report declared Stoke-on-Trent to be the most cost-effective place to set up a new UK business. The city currently has the advantage of offering affordable business property, while being surrounded by a belt of affluent areas such as the Peak District, Stone, south Cheshire, and has excellent road links via the A500 and nearby M6 and rail links.

Tourism to the city was kick-started by the National Garden Festival in 1986 and is now sustained by the many pottery factory shops and tours and by the improved canal network.

The main shopping centre is the Potteries Shopping Centre in Hanley, which has of retail space with 87 units including major stores for New Look, Monsoon, HMV, River Island, H. Samuel and Superdrug. Marks &amp; Spencer and T.K. Maxx also have stores in Hanley. A new shopping centre on the site of Hanley&#x27;s former bus station was due to open in 2016, but development has been delayed and the project is now in doubt. 

The other five towns of the city all have their own smaller town centres. Festival Park is a large retail and business park located in Etruria, built on the former Garden Festival site. There are retail parks in Tunstall, Fenton and Longton. A new retail park in Longton opened and has Currys, Smyths, Pets at Home and Matalan. A pub, McDonald&#x27;s and Pizza Hut are on the site.

Other notable business people from the city include Reginald H. Jones (Chairman of General Electric), venture capitalist Jon Moulton, and John Madejski (chairman of Reading F.C. and former owner of &quot;Auto Trader&quot;).

The Night-time industry has boomed in recent years, with Hanley becoming increasingly popular for its theatres and restaurants.

In 2016, Stoke-on-Trent was ranked the second-best city to start a business by Quality Formations, based on several factors including commercial property, energy, virtual offices, public transport and financial access.

==Government==

The city is covered by three House of Commons constituencies: Stoke-on-Trent North, Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent South. Until 2019 the northern and central seats had returned Labour MPs since their creation in 1950. However, in the 2019 general election, all 3 Stoke-on-Trent constituencies returned a Conservative MP. The former Labour heartland is highly eurosceptic leading to a 69.4% vote to leave the European Union in 2016. The city was within the West Midlands European Parliament constituency.

===Mayoral system===
The position of Lord Mayor is largely ceremonial. The title of Lord Mayor was first conferred on the City of Stoke-on-Trent by King George V who visited Stoke-upon-Trent Town Hall to award the town city status on 5 June 1925. The role of Lord Mayor is decided upon by a vote amongst the elected councillors. The candidates are also selected from the councillors.

Between 1910 and 1928 the Borough, and later, the City of Stoke-on-Trent had a Mayor rather than a Lord Mayor. The first Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent was Cecil Wedgwood of the Wedgwood pottery dynasty.

The city was one of a limited number of English districts with an elected mayor and the only council to use the &#x27;mayor and council-manager&#x27; executive arrangements. It was removed following a local referendum in October 2008.

A local referendum approved a directly elected mayor system in May 2002, by 28,601 votes to 20,578 (turnout of 27.8%).

Mike Wolfe, an independent candidate, became the first directly elected mayor after an election on 17 October 2002, narrowly beating Labour Party candidate George Stevenson by just 300 votes. The elected Mayor from 5 May 2005 to 5 June 2009 was Mark Meredith (Labour Party). The 2005 election was notable because about 10% of the ballot papers were either spoiled or ineligible. Meredith&#x27;s election platform included a pledge to have another referendum on the post of an elected mayor. This was scheduled for May 2007 and resulted in the abolition of the mayoral system.

In October 2008, voters returned to the polls to choose between modifying the system, to Mayor and Cabinet, or abolishing the position of elected Mayor. Votes were 21,231 for abolition and 14,592 for modification on a turnout of 19.23%.

===Council Leader and Cabinet system===
Following a citywide referendum abolishing the position of elected mayor, a Leader and Cabinet system was adopted in June 2009. The Leader of the council is elected by councillors. Each cabinet member makes the decisions on their portfolio area and explains the decisions at the monthly cabinet meetings. The current leader of the council is Cllr Jane Ashworth.

===Councillor representation===
Since the 2023 local elections the council has been controlled by the Labour Party. Between 2015 and 2023 no party had overall control of the city council.

===Members of Parliament===

==Public services==
The city&#x27;s acute hospital is the Royal Stoke University Hospital run by the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust it is the third biggest hospital in the UK. It formerly comprised two sites: the Royal Infirmary and the City General. The hospital was rebuilt on the City General site on the A34, London Road.

Community health services are run by Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Partnership NHS Trust with mental health services provided by North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust.

Policing in Stoke-on-Trent is provided by Staffordshire Police, which has police stations in Hanley, Bucknall, Burslem, Longton, Stoke and Tunstall. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court and Stoke-on-Trent County Court share Stoke-on-Trent Combined Court Centre in Hanley. There is no magistrates&#x27; court. Hearings were held in Fenton Town Hall until it closed in 2012. All magistrates proceedings now take place in Newcastle.
Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, which has fire stations in Hanley, Longton, Burslem and Sandyford.

Severn Trent manages Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s drinking and waste water.

Since the 1970s, the city&#x27;s main library had been the former Hanley Library, later known as the City Central Library &amp; Archives in Bethesda Street, which was home to the city&#x27;s archives. During this period, the City Council operated eight smaller libraries throughout the city. In July 2022, it was announced that the Hanley Library building, along with others in the city, would be closed to be sold. The city archives would be moved to the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, an adjacent building with frontages to Bethesda Street and Broad Street.

==Religion==

Stoke-on-Trent does not have a cathedral. The city&#x27;s main, Church of England, civic church, is Stoke Minster. The city is within the Anglican Diocese of Lichfield. The city is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham and the immediate area has six Catholic parishes. They are dedicated to: the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Our Lady of the Angels, Saint George, Saint Gregory the Great, Saint Maria Goretti and Saint Teresa.

Primitive Methodism was founded by Hugh Bourne, a native of Stoke-on-Trent, at a public gathering in the nearby village of Mow Cop. He originally followed the Wesleyan form of Methodism, but in 1801 he reformed the Methodist service by conducting it outside. He founded the first chapel in Tunstall with his brother in 1811. He promoted Sunday schools as a method of improving children&#x27;s education, advocated the equal treatment of women and men, and was involved in the temperance movement. It was from the Primitive Methodists that many early trade unions found their early leaders. Also of note is John Lightfoot, a 17th-century churchman and rabbinical scholar.

The city&#x27;s first purpose-built mosque was completed in 2012. The city&#x27;s only synagogue closed in 2006 and was replaced with a smaller one in nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme.

==Transport==

===Major roads===

Stoke-on-Trent is linked to the nearby M6 motorway at junctions 15 and 16 by the A500. Locally the A500 is known as the &quot;D road&quot;, as its loop between the two motorway junctions, along with the straight section of the M6 between the junctions, resembles the shape of a capital letter D. Coincidentally, the number 500 expressed in Roman numerals is &quot;D&quot;.

The A50 provides an east–west link between the M6 and the M1 motorway; it joins up with the A500 close to the Bet365 Stadium. Improvements to the road network have led to the construction of product distribution centres in the area.

===Rail===

Stoke-on-Trent railway station is located on the Stafford-Manchester line. The other railway stations in the city are Longport and Longton both on the Crewe-Derby line. Etruria station was closed in September 2005. Avanti West Coast &quot;Pendolino&quot; 390029 is named after Stoke-on-Trent.
===Bus===
Local public transport is provided almost exclusively by bus. Bus services are mainly operated by First Potteries. There are also several smaller companies operating bus services in the city, like D&amp;G Bus. There are central bus stations in Hanley and Longton. National Express operate long-distance coach services from Hanley bus station. As part of the city&#x27;s regeneration, a new bus station has been constructed in Hanley, allowing the old one to be demolished, making room for further redevelopment. As of January 2015 there are no local authority supported bus services in the city. Between 2013/14 and 2023, bus service provision shrank by 50%.

===Canals===

The city is served by the Trent and Mersey Canal, which sees traffic of some 10,000 boats a year. The Caldon Canal branches off from the Trent and Mersey Canal at Etruria, within the city boundaries, going to Froghall with one branch going to Leek.

===Cycling===
As of November 2009, there are of new National Cycle Network off-road bicycle paths through the city, connecting to the national long-distance paths which were completed in 2005. Together with those in Newcastle-under-Lyme, there are now over of cycle paths in the urban conurbation. A further £10  million of funding has now been secured for the city&#x27;s cycling network, to be spent in 2009–2011 through Cycling England&#x27;s support for Stoke as a Cycling City.

==Education==

===Higher education===
There are four further and higher education institutions in the local area, the two further education colleges being City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and Stoke-on-Trent College. Formerly of Fenton, now located in a newly built structure on Leek Road, the Sixth Form College provides A Level teaching for around 1,800 students. Stoke-on-Trent College is much larger and less specialised, offering apprenticeships and adult education, and has a main campus (Cauldon Campus) in Shelton, and a secondary campus in Burslem.

The city is home to Staffordshire University, formerly North Staffordshire Polytechnic, with its main site in Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent railway station. It gained its university status in 1992 as one of the post-1992 universities. Keele University School of Medicine uses facilities at the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill. Keele University was founded as the University College of North Staffordshire in 1949 with major involvement by Stoke-on-Trent City Council. It is located in the nearby village of Keele.

===Secondary education===

The city currently has 15 secondary schools: Sir Thomas Boughey Academy, Birches Head Academy, Co-op Academy Stoke-on-Trent, Discovery Academy, Excel Academy, Haywood Academy, Ormiston Horizon Academy, Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy, St Joseph&#x27;s College, St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, Ormiston Meridian Academy, St Peter&#x27;s Academy, St Thomas More Catholic Academy, Stoke Studio College (with sites in Longton and Burslem), Thistley Hough Academy and Trentham High School.

A major re-structure of Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s high school system was proposed in 2007. As part of these plans several established secondary schools closed or merged including Longton High School (closed 2010), Mitchell High and Edensor High (merged to form The Discovery Academy), St Peter&#x27;s CE High School and Berry Hill High (merged to form St Peter&#x27;s Academy).

===Potters&#x27; Holidays===
One of the legacies of the pottery industry was Stoke&#x27;s version of the wakes week. Although better known in industrial Lancashire, the Stoke week is known locally as the Potters&#x27; Holidays or Potters&#x27; Fortnight and occurred the last week in June, the first week in July and another week in August. This gave what appeared to be strange school holidays—with the summer term having a two-week break at the end of June, then children returning to school for three weeks before taking a five-week summer holiday. This observance has disappeared from the local schools, due to decreased emphasis on traditional industries.

==Sport==
===Football===

Stoke-on-Trent is the smallest city to boast two professional clubs in the English Football League. The club bearing the area&#x27;s name is Stoke City, formed in 1863 and is the second-oldest professional football club in England. They currently play at the Bet365 Stadium at Stanley Matthews Way, Stoke-on-Trent, which has been their home since 1997 when they relocated from the Victoria Ground in Stoke after 119 years. They were among the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888. They won their first and, to date, only major trophy in 1972, when they lifted the League Cup.

In 1985, Stoke City were relegated from the First Division and began a 23-year exile from the top flight of English football which did not end until they won promotion in 2008, by which time the First Division had become the Premier League. Stoke City reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time in 2011, but were defeated by Manchester City. Stoke City were relegated from the Premier League in 2018. 

The club and the city&#x27;s most famous player is the late Sir Stanley Matthews, who began and ended his playing career with Stoke City, sandwiching 14 years at Blackpool where he played in what became known as the Matthews Final. He also managed Port Vale from 1965 to 1968. He was the first active footballer to receive a Knighthood. Matthews made 54 appearances for his country, scoring 11 times. There are two statues of Matthews in the city: one in Hanley and one at the Bet365 Stadium.
The city&#x27;s other professional football club is Port Vale, who were formed in 1876 and play at Vale Park in the Burslem area. Previous stadiums include the Athletic Ground in Cobridge (1886–1913) and The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley (1913–1950). They joined the Football League in 1892 but were forced to resign in 1907 due to financial problems, only to return in 1919. Their highest league position came in 1931 when they finished fifth in the Second Division.

In 1954, while in the Third Division North, Port Vale progressed to the FA Cup semi-final when they were knocked out by First Division West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park. This remains the furthest they have progressed in the competition. Unlike Stoke City, their local rivals in the Potteries derby, they have never played top division football and hold the record for most years spent in the second tier without ever playing in the first. Individuals of note include John Rudge (who managed the club for 16 years from 1983 to 1999) and Roy Sproson (who made a club record 842 appearances for the club from 1950 until 1972 and was later their manager).

Previous clubs from the city include Dresden United, a club which was disestablished before the city was federated; as well as amateur clubs Meir KA (1972–2010) and Norton United (1989–2015). Currently, the city is represented at amateur level by Eastwood Hanley (1946–1997; re-established in 2014) and Hanley Town (established 1966).

===Other sports teams===
The city has several amateur sports clubs, including rugby union, with clubs such as Stoke-on-Trent RUFC, and cricket with cricket clubs in Stoke competing in the North Staffs and South Cheshire Cricket League. The cricket ground in Longton is one of the venues used by Staffordshire County Cricket Club. As well as the Longton club, Meir Heath Cricket Club are also active, though the County Ground and the Michelin Ground are no longer used for cricket.

There are a number of field hockey clubs based in the area that compete in the Midlands Hockey League and the BUCS leagues. These are North Stafford Hockey Club, University of Staffordshire hockey club and Keele University hockey club.

The city speedway team is the Stoke Potters. Speedway was staged at the Greyhound Stadium in Sun Street, Hanley intermittently between 1929 and 1939. In 1947, the Potters were part of the post-war boom rising from Division Three of the National League to Division Two before closing in the early 1950s. The Potters were revived in 1960 and they raced in the Provincial League until the end of 1963, when the stadium was closed and the site redeveloped. Speedway was revived at Loomer Road Stadium in Newcastle-under-Lyme, initially as Chesterton, before it reverted to the Stoke name. The stadium is also used for BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars and BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars during the summer.

Cycle Speedway was popular in the city from the 1940s. Boys would travel all over the city to race against rival teams. The most famous team in the 1960s was the Shelton Tigers; they travelled across England and Wales to race against other teams. The Tigers won the Midland League and the British &quot;Champion of Champions&quot; Trophy, against Southampton. 

The ski race team based at the artificial ski slope in Festival Park competes in national Snowsport England and international FIS Fédération Internationale de Ski events.
Stoke Spitfires was the name of the city&#x27;s American football team. The team eventually folded in 1992 after a record of 35–34–1. In 1994, the Staffordshire Surge was formed and played their matches in and around Stoke-on-Trent. Currently, the team play at Longton Rugby Club in Division One North of the British American Football League.

===Individual sports persons===

The city has a sporting Hall of Fame, opened in 2011 to honour sporting legends from the city. Former Stoke City and England footballer Stanley Matthews and former darts world champion Phil Taylor were the first names to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. They were followed by former Port Vale footballer Roy Sproson and England&#x27;s World Cup winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks (who spent five years with Stoke City).

The World Professional Darts Championship was hosted in the Jollees venue in the south of the city from 1979 to 1985. Phil Taylor has won the World Championship a record 16 times, winning the championship in both the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) and British Darts Organisation (BDO). Two-time PDC World Champion Adrian Lewis and two-time BDO World Champion Ted Hankey are also from the Stoke area. Other well-known players from or based in Stoke include Chris Mason, Andy Hamilton and Ian White.

World champion squash player, Great Britain and England international Angela Smith, was born in the city and was largely responsible for the ladies&#x27; game going open. She is regarded as one of the most famous players of British squash. Wicket-keeper Bob Taylor, who played for Derbyshire and England was born and still lives in the area. He represented England 58 times and still holds the world record for the most dismissals in the first-class game (1649). In golf, Trenthams&#x27; David Lynn, the golfer, (born 1973) was the KLM Open Champion of 2004.

Other notable sports people from the area include footballer Aaron Ramsdale and former players turned pundits Mark Bright, Garth Crooks and Robbie Earle; tennis player Andrew Foster; snooker players Ray Reardon, Dave Harold and Jamie Cope; field hockey player Imran Sherwani; cycling world-record holder Tommy Godwin, wrestler Peter Thornley (better known as Kendo Nagasaki), professional strongman Eddie Hall and European taekwondo champion Charlie Maddock.

==Culture, art, science and architecture==
===Architecture===

From the half-timbered farmhouse vernacular of Ford Green Hall, through the 18th-century canal-side Wedgwood estate of Etruria one of the hubs of the Industrial Revolution, to 19th-century country house estates e.g. Trentham Hall and railway buildings such as Stoke Station and more lately in the 20th century, the expansion and renewal of industrial, civic and amenity buildings including Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, the architecture of North Staffordshire has a history expressive of locally acquired or manufactured building materials: quarried stone, coal and clay for brick and tile-making, ash, sand gravel and cement for concrete, and also cast iron steel and timber.

Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s architecture is tied closely to the industrial heritage of the city. Bottle ovens (used for early pottery manufacture), canal-side and railway-related mill, factory, or warehouse buildings evolved – within the tightly knit street pattern of each of the six townships – from transport links and adjacency to local generationally skilled labour. Post-WWII pottery factories developed a style typified by open-plan manufacturing areas, surrounded by wide expanses of window-walling from floor to ceiling, allowing good daylighting for intricate tasks such as lithography, fettling and decoration.
In 1966, Stone (Staffordshire) born Cedric Price had proposed a Potteries Thinkbelt design which sought to make use of decommissioned railway routes following the Beeching Cuts and the scarred landscape of coal mining to provide linked learning centres for a technical industry-based curriculum. The Staffordshire University Architecture course has introduced an annual Cedric Price Day celebrating this and other projects of his.

===Science===

Oliver Lodge (1851–1940) was a British physicist and writer involved in the development of, and holder of key patents for, radio. He was born in Penkhull.
William Astbury (1898–1962) was an English physicist and molecular biologist who made pioneering X-ray diffraction studies of biological molecules. He was born in Longton. Jessie MacWilliams (1917–1990) was a mathematician who worked on coding theory and is known for the MacWilliams identities. John L. Jinks (1929–1987) was a geneticist who worked on cytoplasmic inheritance and quantitative genetics. David J. C. MacKay (1967–2016) was a physicist and mathematician known for his work on Bayesian inference and popular writings on climate change.

===Visual art===
The major art gallery is The Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery, located in Hanley. It contains a collection of fine ceramics, a rotating programme of exhibitions and a permanent collection. In 2010, it became one of the permanent homes of the Staffordshire Hoard, the most important collection of Anglo-Saxon gold yet found.

The city&#x27;s Cultural Quarter in Hanley contains the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery, the Regent Theatre and the Victoria Hall. There are also smaller elements, including the independent Dazed Gallery and AirSpace, the city&#x27;s only contemporary art gallery, artist-led and artist run. The Artbay Gallery in Fenton has a contemporary range of original works as well as limited editions.

Edwardian School of Art in Burslem has been refurbished with £1.2 million, and is now run without a public subsidy. The Hothouse Centre for Ceramic Design and the Roslyn Works complex of craft studios operate in Longton. Also based in Burslem is the Barewall Gallery, which has a large collection of work by local artists including original art by Arthur Berry (The Lowry of The Potteries), Jack Simcock, and by new emerging Potteries artists.

Stoke-on-Trent is the birthplace of several artists including Arthur Berry (also a novelist, playwright &amp; poet), Glenys Barton (sculptor), Arnold Machin (sculptor, coin &amp; stamp designer) and Sidney Tushingham, A.R.E.

===Public art===
The Grade II* listed statue of &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;, which stands adjacent to the lake at Trentham Gardens, a part of Trentham Estate, is a copy of an original work by Benvenuto Cellini, which was sculpted for Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany from 1545 to 1554. In the early 19th century, the then Duke of Tuscany, allowed a cast of Cellini&#x27;s statue to be taken for his friend, the 2nd Duke of Sutherland; it is the only bronze cast of the statue The bronze sculpture was installed at Trentham in 1840 during Charles Barry&#x27;s remodelling of the estate and the statue forms a focal point for his Italianate gardens located by the lake at the south end of the central axis of the parterre. Barry designed the circular platform on which the statue is set.
Welcoming visitors to the city as they alight from their train at Stoke-on-Trent station is a statue of Josiah Wedgwood, the centrepiece to the Grade II listed Winton Square area. The statue by Edward Davis was cast in bronze in 1860 and first displayed at the 1862 London Exhibition (also known as the International Exhibition of 1862) which was the successor to the 1851 Great Exhibition. Funded by public subscription, the Stoke-on-Trent unveiling took place on 24 February 1863. A replica of the statue was cast in the 1950s for the Wedgwood Barlaston factory site, where it now stands – outside the Wedgwood Museum. In Josiah&#x27;s hand is an example of his pre-eminent work, the Portland Vase.
&quot;The Spirit of Fire&quot; also known as &quot;The Man of Fire&quot; or sometimes locally as &quot;Jack Frost&quot; or even &quot;The Spiky Man&quot;, a 1964 sculpture by David Wynne, is mounted upon the façade of what was the Lewis&#x27;s Department Sore (designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership). The inscription below the sculpture reads: &quot;Fire is at the root of all things visible and invisible&quot; – a reference to the industrial heart of The Potteries: ceramics, railways, steelmaking and mining.
&quot;CAPO&quot;, a modern interpretation depicting the head of Josiah Wedgwood by Vincent Woropay was originally commissioned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council for the 1986 National Garden Festival. It was moved in 2009 to an appropriate site in Festival Way close to Wedgwood&#x27;s Etruria Hall home. In February 2023, the statue was demolished by council contractors during works to widen the road. A subsequent investigation led to the resignation of the deputy council leader as the work had not been correctly planned or authorised by the council. The leader of the council has pledged to have the statue restored
&quot;A Man Can&#x27;t Fly&quot;, commissioned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council in 1989, is a statue of &quot;a figure of a man balancing horizontally upon one leg (arabesque, a ballet pose), by Cheshire sculptor Ondre Nowakowski (b.1954). The pose appears as a reference to Superman in flight. It stands atop a column with the words &#x27;A MAN CAN&#x27;T FLY&#x27; repeated vertically around its circumference&quot;. The location is at the Leek Road/ Glebe Street junction close to Stoke Station.

The outskirts of Tunstall became home to a new public art statue called &quot; Golden&quot; in 2015. The 69 ft (21m) steel work of art by Wolfgang Buttress was privately funded with £180,000 Section 106 monies and is made from COR-TEN Steel, the same material as the &quot;Angel of the North&quot;. The tapered lozenge design features powerful LED lights that will illuminate 1,500 glass prisms containing the written wishes or memories of local residents. Each prism will be suspended from the main body of the sculpture by a short arm, giving the artwork a bristly appearance. It is located on the former site of the Potteries Pyramid, which was to have been moved to a nearby roundabout.

In October 2013 a sculpture, &quot;Unearthed (Lidice)&quot; designed by Sarah Nadin (b.1983) and Nicola Winstanley (b.1984) also known as Dashyline studios, commemorating the efforts of miners to rebuild the Czech village of Lidice devastated during the Second World War was unveiled. The steel sculpture cost £100,000 to build and features 3,000 tags bearing the initials of people who promise to share the story of the 1942 Lidice Shall Live movement. North Staffordshire-based Dashyline was commissioned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to create the artwork, which has been installed near Hanley bus station. The sculpture was manufactured and installed by local Company, Patera Engineering Ltd based in Fenton. In 2018 a pear tree, grafted from the protected pear tree which survived the destruction of Lidice, was planted in Stoke-on-Trent to commemorate the &quot;Lidice Shall Live&quot; campaign.

&quot;Arnold Bennett Statue&quot;
This statue celebrates the city&#x27;s most famous literary son, Arnold Bennett. It was unveiled on 27 May 2017, on what would have been his 150th birthday. Located on Bethesda Street on the approach to the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Hanley, the work was commissioned by the Arnold Bennett Society, and funded by the Denise Coates Foundation – then, gifted to the city. The seated figure was created by local sculptors Michael Talbot and Carl Payne.
===Theatre and Performing Arts===
The city&#x27;s main theatre is the 1,603-person capacity Regent Theatre, which is in Hanley. Nearby is the main concert hall, the Victoria Hall. The purpose-built theatre in the round New Vic Theatre is just outside the city&#x27;s boundary in Newcastle-under-Lyme. The Victorian Kings Hall in Stoke-on-Trent Town Hall is used for smaller events. In Burslem, the Queen&#x27;s Theatre has been refurbished and restored at private expense.

The Stoke-on-Trent Repertory Theatre is based in Stoke and puts on amateur productions. The previously city council-run Mitchell Memorial Youth Theatre, based in Hanley, completed its £4.3m refurbishment in 2011 and is now known as the Mitchell Arts Centre. It is named in honour of one of the city&#x27;s most famous sons, Reginald Mitchell, designer of the World War II fighter plane, the Spitfire.

The city also has been the home to some long-running cultural organisations, including B arts, founded in the 80s as an all-female-led, participatory arts organisation. The founders were street theatre directors Hilary Hughes, Gill Gill and Yvonne Male.

===Cinema===
In December 2015 a new nine-screen Cineworld Cinema opened in Hanley. It is situated at The Hive which is an extension to the Intu Potteries shopping centre.
There is an Odeon multiplex cinema located in Festival Park. The independent volunteer-run art-house cinema, The Stoke-on-Trent Film Theatre, is located very near the railway station and shows art-house and subtitled films, as well as films that have finished their run in larger cinemas.

===Literature===
Through the works of Arnold Bennett, described by some as the greatest realist writer of the 20th century, the &quot;Six Towns&quot; were sometimes known as the &quot;Five Towns&quot;. In his novels, Bennett wrote about local events in the 19th century and consistently changed all proper names and associations, thus Hanley became Hanbridge and Burslem became Bursley. The &quot;Six Towns&quot; were not federated until 1910 when Fenton was still relatively new. It was the smallest in terms of population and area. Bennett also changed the name of the local newspaper from &quot;The Sentinel&quot; to &quot;The Signal&quot;, an identity that was subsequently adopted by the city&#x27;s commercial radio station.

Other notable contributors to literature include Elijah Fenton (poet), Peter Whelan (playwright), John Wain (poet, critic and scholar), Pauline Stainer (poet) and Charles Tomlinson (poet, graphic artist, translator, editor and critic).

In Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; novel &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, Dr. Yu Tsun goes to a suburb of Fenton to meet Stephen Albert.

===Young Poet Laureate===
Since 2010, the council&#x27;s library service has run a competition to appoint a Young Poet Laureate for the city. This is a competition for local poets aged between 11 and 19. The first winner was Daniel Tatton, and he was succeeded in 2011 by Bethanie Hardie.

===Music===
Stoke has a vibrant music scene. The Golden Torch, a local nightclub, became the centre of the Northern soul scene in the early 1970s. Shelley&#x27;s Laserdome nightclub in Longton played a pivotal role in the house and rave scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, helping launch the career of Sasha and featuring regular appearances from Carl Cox, until it was eventually shut down by Staffordshire Police. The Void, a Hanley nightclub, developed a sister relationship with Sankey&#x27;s Soap in Manchester, helping the latter to revive its fortunes during the late 1990s via the promotion of a club night called &quot;Golden&quot;.
Robbie Williams is the most famous pop star to hail from the city. Many of his songs refer to Stoke-on-Trent, either directly or indirectly. These include &quot;It&#x27;s Only Us&quot;, &quot;Burslem Normals&quot;, &quot;The 80&#x27;s&quot; and the spoken introduction to his duet with Jonathan Wilkes of the song &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;. The song &quot;Angels&quot; was partly inspired by the golden angel at Burslem Town Hall. In 2015, three streets in a new housing estate in Middleport were named after Williams&#x27; hit songs: Supreme Street, Candy Lane and Angels Way.

Saul Hudson, the lead guitarist for Guns N&#x27; Roses better known by his stage name &quot;Slash&quot;, was raised in Stoke-on-Trent. His father, Anthony Hudson, was from the area, and he spent a few of his early childhood years living in the city before moving to his mother&#x27;s native United States in 1970. He did not meet many of the British side of his family until 1992 when Guns N&#x27; Roses played Wembley Stadium as part of the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Slash has recalled in interviews and his autobiography that his Stoke relatives drank all of the band&#x27;s considerable rider:
&quot;I witnessed one of my uncles, my cousin, and my grandfather, on his very first trip to London from Stoke, down every drop of liquor in our dressing room. Consumed in full, our booze rider in those days would have killed anyone but us.&quot;

Lonnie Cook is a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guitarist and local celebrity who played with Screaming Lord Sutch in the 1970s. He is remembered in the area for his Radio Stoke show &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, and for standing as a Monster Raving Loony Party candidate. In 2010 he started getting airplay on a New York radio station for his 1994 song &quot;Knock Me Down, Pick Me Up&quot;. This led to the song being released for mp3 download in the US and the UK.

Other notable individuals and groups from the area include Andy Moor who is a DJ and producer, Gertie Gitana (music hall star and singer), Lemmy, the founder of the rock band Motörhead, Patricia Leonard (singer/contralto), Jem Finer (banjoist, The Pogues), Broken Bones and Discharge (punk band), who invented the D-beat style. Experimental musician Phil Todd, best known for his Ashtray Navigations project, grew up in Madeley. Other bands to hail from the city include: &quot;This Is Seb Clarke&quot; (soul-punk), &quot;Agent Blue&quot; (alternative rock), &quot;All the Young&quot; and &quot;The Title&quot; (indie).

In October 2007, Stoke-on-Trent City Council introduced a new theme tune – &quot;Moving Forwards Together&quot;. It was described by the council as &quot;part of our drive to help us move the city forward and create a better Stoke-on-Trent for people to live, learn, work and enjoy&quot;.

Murdoc Niccals, a fictional member of the group Gorillaz with the role of bass guitarist is (in his constructed biography) said to have been born in Stoke-on-Trent.

Havergal Brian (1876–1972), the classical composer and music writer, who composed 32 symphonies and five operas, was born in Stoke (in Dresden). The large scale and unfashionable style of his compositions led to them being neglected for most of his lifetime and not a note of his music was commercially issued on record during his lifetime. He died without having heard many of his finest works.

===Food===

Staffordshire oatcakes (very different from the Scottish version and traditionally made in corner-shop style oatcake bakeries) is a much-loved local culinary speciality. They remain popular although are no longer the cheap alternative to bread. Oatcakes can be eaten cold or hot with any sweet or savoury fillings. Lobby, a stew not unlike Lancashire hotpot, is still made by local people.

===Stoke Pride===
Stoke Pride is the city&#x27;s annual pride march that has been running since 2005, although it was not officially called Stoke Pride until 2008. It is a celebration of the city&#x27;s LGBT community and attracts visitors from many different areas across the country. Originally held in Hanley, the event was held at Northwood Park until 2016 and has since moved to Hanley Park in 2017 attracting over 7,000 attendants, six times the amount of the previous year. It continued in 2018 with increased attendance, and in 2019. It was due to continue in 2020, on 20 June, but was postponed because of COVID-19.

==Dialect==

The Potteries has a distinctive local dialect. It contains many non-standard words, e.g. &quot;nesh&quot; meaning &quot;soft, tender, or to easily get cold&quot;, and &quot;slat&quot; meaning &quot;to throw&quot;. The best-known word is &quot;duck&quot;, which is used as a greeting to either men or women. It is believed to be derived from the Saxon word &quot;ducas&quot;, used to indicate respect. In Middle English this became &quot;duc&quot; or &quot;duk&quot;, which denotes a leader. It became the title &quot;Duke&quot; and the Old French word &quot;duché&quot;, which indicates the territory ruled by a Duke.

Another common variation on the standard English dialect is the use of the word &quot;shug&quot; for sugar. This is usually used as a term of endearment when closing a sentence, as in &quot;Ta Shug&quot; (thank you, sugar).

A local cartoon strip called &quot;May un Mar Lady (Me and my Wife)&quot;, published in the newspaper &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and written in Potteries dialect, first appeared on 8 July 1986 and ran for over 20 years. Since the death of cartoonist Dave Follows in 2003, the full twenty-year run (7,000) of &quot;May un Mar Lady&quot; strips are being republished in &quot;The Sentinel&quot; as &quot;May un Mar Lady Revisited&quot;, keeping the dialect alive for another twenty years.

Alan Povey&#x27;s &quot;Owd Grandad Piggott&quot; stories, which have aired on BBC Radio Stoke for several years, are recited in the Potteries dialect by the author.

<doc id="173334" wikidata="Q699819" url="?curid=173334" title="El-Hazard">
<text>is a Japanese anime franchise written by Ryoe Tsukimura and directed by Hiroki Hayashi. The series was animated by AIC and produced by Pioneer LDC.

There is also a manga adaptation, which is published in English by Viz Media. The series was formerly distributed in the U.S. by Geneon. The distribution rights to the &quot;Wanderers&quot; TV series were acquired from Geneon by Right Stuf entertainment, announced during a Right Stuf press release on May 18, 2010. The anime was distributed by Right Stuf&#x27;s publishing label Nozomi Entertainment. Later, during their panel at Anime Expo 2019, they also rescued &quot;The Magnificent World&quot; and &quot;The Alternative World&quot; OVAs.

==Plot==

The story focuses on three high school students, Makoto Mizuhara, Katsuhiko Jinnai and Nanami Jinnai, and the History teacher Masamichi Fujisawa, who are mysteriously transported to the fantastical world of El-Hazard. When they arrive they find themselves in the middle of a war between the human nations and the insectoid Bugrom tribe.

===&quot;The Magnificent World&quot;===
The central conflict in focuses on Makoto, who along with Nanami, Mr. Fujisawa and human residents of El-Hazard fight against Jinnai who is made leader of the Bugrom armies by Queen Diva, but meanwhile, other, more sinister machinations lie below the surface.

===&quot;The Wanderers&quot;===
El-Hazard: The Wanderers, known in Japan as simply , takes place in an alternative timeline from the original OVA. It is a simplified version of the original OVA plot, stretched to twenty-six episodes and eliminates or alters several of the OVA&#x27;s major characters.

===&quot;The Magnificent World 2&quot;===
 is a sequel to the original OVA and features Makoto and the others continuing on in their lives in El-Hazard after the war with the Bugrom has ended. When Mr. Fujisawa suddenly runs off, getting cold feet the night before his wedding with Miz Mishtal, Makoto and the others race off to find him.

===&quot;The Alternative World&quot;===
 follows up after the actual wedding of Mr. Fujisawa and Miz Mishtal, but the cast is then thrust into another world for a second time; the militant world of Creteria.

===Characters===
===El-Hazard&#x27;s causal loop===
&quot;El-Hazard&quot;&#x27;s plot is made up of a causal loop, an example of the predestination paradox. The first OVA begins with Makoto meeting Ifurita for the first time on Earth. After giving him a warm greeting, revealing that she somehow knows him, she sends him to El-Hazard. Later on in the series, Makoto discovers Ifurita entombed in a labyrinth, where she had been kept since ancient times. Upon this second meeting with Ifurita, Makoto is puzzled by the fact that she does not recognize him, nor does she treat him with the same demeanor she evoked in their first encounter.

Over the course of the series, Makoto manages to free Ifurita from her enslavement to Jinnai (the &quot;master&quot; of the Power Key Staff, and therefore her master). In response, Ifurita comes to love Makoto, but events involving the Eye of God (see below) force her to drift through time and space for ten thousand years until she is eventually entombed under what would later become the site of Shinonome High School. The series then returns to the beginning, this time from Ifurita&#x27;s perspective. After warmly greeting Makoto, she sends him to El-Hazard in order to trigger all of the events that, from Makoto&#x27;s perspective, had yet to take place. In the final episode, Ifurita is reunited with an older Makoto who has transported back to her with her key, enabling them both to return to El-Hazard together. An ending montage shows various El Hazard characters apparently now living on Earth.

===The Eye of God===

The Eye of God plays a prominent role in both the OVA and &quot;The Wanderers&quot;. In both continuities, it is the ultimate superweapon, created by an ancient civilization. Its basic design is that of a giant metallic orb that floats in a geosynchronous orbit within the world&#x27;s atmosphere.

The Eye of God is a dimensional weapon that sends all it destroys into a vortex leading to an unknown destination. In the first OVA series, its use in ancient times is responsible for pulling the Phantom Tribe from their own world into El-Hazard.

In the OVA continuity, the Eye of God first needed to be unsealed by the Muldoon priestesses before it could be operated via the Stairway to the Sky, a tall metal tower that almost reaches the height of the Eye&#x27;s orbit. Two female members of the royal house were required in order to activate the weapon, but the Phantom Tribe attempted to get around this barrier by creating a machine that would require the use of only one. The Phantom Tribe also sabotage the Eye, causing it to go out of control when the Princesses Rune Venus and Fatora use it to destroy the Bugrom. It&#x27;s stopped by Ifurita, who synchronizes with the device and is ultimately lost in time and space for ten thousand years as a result.

In &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, the Eye is controlled from within rather than from the Stairway to the Sky, and the character Ifurita acts as a key to controlling the weapon. Jinnai attempts to use Ifurita to control the Eye, but once connected, Ifurita&#x27;s true purpose as the Demon God is revealed, and she attempts to destroy El-Hazard. Makoto stops the Eye from going out of control and is temporarily lost, but finds his way back to El-Hazard at the end of the series.

In &quot;The Alternative World,&quot; another Eye of God appears, but this one is a shattered version of the original and does not seem to need a princess and three priestesses to unseal it. Its origin is not explained.

==Media==

The series began as a seven episode OVA produced by the animation studio AIC and Pioneer LDC, and it was entitled as, &quot;El-Hazard: The Magnificent World&quot;. It was popular enough to be remade into a twenty-six episode TV series, &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, set in an alternate time-line.

A second four-episode OVA series, &quot;El-Hazard: The Magnificent World 2&quot;, followed. &quot;El-Hazard: The Alternative World&quot; is a thirteen-episode TV series with a follow-up special later released on laserdisc called &quot;A Night of Captivation, Temptation, and Purification&quot;.

&quot;El Hazard: The Magnificent World 2&quot;, and &quot;El Hazard: The Alternative World&quot; are continuations of the original OVA (&quot;El-Hazard: The Magnificent World&quot;) whereas the TV series &quot;El Hazard: The Wanderers&quot; is a standalone series.

There is also a Sega Saturn visual novel video game inspired from the TV series, with several possible endings.

Guardians of Order released the &quot;El-Hazard Role-Playing Game&quot; role-playing game based on the first OVA series in 2001 and with rules based on the company&#x27;s Tri-Stat system.

On August 13, 2018, AIC announced that they were planning to crowdfund a short five minute pilot for a new &quot;El Hazard&quot; series titled &quot;The Dual World&quot;. The campaign launched on September 6 of that year but was not successful, raising ¥841,000 out of its ¥5,000,000 goal before closing on October 30.

==List of &quot;The Magnificent World&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent World 2&quot; episodes==
==Reception==

===Anime reviews===
Theron Martin argued that the series doesn&#x27;t &quot;come close to representing the cream of the crop of &#x27;90s anime,&quot; and neither did it &quot;establish any new trends or have a marked influence on the course of anime. He also criticized Alielle Relryle for being presented as a &quot;midget flaming lesbian&quot; who sees Princess Fatora Venus as the &quot;only object&quot; of her affection. Chris Beveridge further said, in &quot;Mania&quot; that he still finds himself &quot;grinning stupidly at many parts of this series.&quot; Raphael See said that the series is &quot;remarkable when it counts,&quot; referring to the scenery and backgrounds.

===Soundtrack reviews===
&quot;As nice as the opening piece and Ifurita&#x27;s theme may be, the rest of the album doesn&#x27;t quite succeed at reaching out and grabbing your attention.&quot; – Keith Rhee, about &quot;Best of El Hazard&quot; in &quot;EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga&quot;.
