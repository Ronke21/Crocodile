<text>Ricin ( ) is a lectin (a carbohydrate-binding protein) and a highly potent toxin produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant, &quot;Ricinus communis&quot;. The median lethal dose (LD50) of ricin for mice is around 22 micrograms per kilogram of body weight via intraperitoneal injection. Oral exposure to ricin is far less toxic. An estimated lethal oral dose in humans is approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight.

Ricin is a toxalbumin and was first described by Peter Hermann Stillmark, the founder of lectinology. Ricin is chemically similar to robin.

== Biochemistry ==
Ricin is classified as a type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP). Whereas type 1 RIPs are composed of a single protein chain that possesses catalytic activity, type 2 RIPs, also known as holotoxins, are composed of two different protein chains that form a heterodimeric complex. Type 2 RIPs consist of an A chain that is functionally equivalent to a type 1 RIP, covalently connected by a single disulfide bond to a B chain that is catalytically inactive, but serves to mediate transport of the A-B protein complex from the cell surface, via vesicle carriers, to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both type 1 and type 2 RIPs are functionally active against ribosomes &quot;in vitro&quot;; however, only type 2 RIPs display cytotoxicity due to the lectin-like properties of the B chain. To display its ribosome-inactivating function, the ricin disulfide bond must be reductively cleaved.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Ricin is synthesized in the endosperm of castor oil plant seeds. The ricin precursor protein is 576 amino acid residues in length and contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.

=== Structure ===
In terms of structure, ricin closely resembles abrin-a, an isomer of abrin. The quaternary structure of ricin is a globular, glycosylated heterodimer of approximately 60–65 kDa. Ricin toxin A chain and ricin toxin B chain are of similar molecular weights, approximately 32 kDa and 34 kDa, respectively.
* Ricin toxin A chain (RTA) is an &quot;N&quot;-glycoside hydrolase composed of 267 amino acids. It has three structural domains with approximately 50% of the polypeptide arranged into alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The three domains form a pronounced cleft that is the active site of RTA.
* Ricin toxin B chain (RTB) is a lectin composed of 262 amino acids that is able to bind terminal galactose residues on cell surfaces. RTB forms a bilobal, barbell-like structure lacking alpha-helices or beta-sheets where individual lobes contain three subdomains. At least one of these three subdomains in each homologous lobe possesses a sugar-binding pocket that gives RTB its functional character.
While other plants contain the protein chains found in ricin, both protein chains must be present to produce toxic effects. For example, plants that contain only protein chain A, such as barley, are not toxic because without the link to protein chain B, protein chain A cannot enter the cell and do damage to ribosomes.

=== Entry into the cytoplasm ===
Ricin B chain binds complex carbohydrates on the surface of eukaryotic cells containing either terminal &quot;N&quot;-acetylgalactosamine or beta-1,4-linked galactose residues. In addition, the mannose-type glycans of ricin are able to bind to cells that express mannose receptors. RTB has been shown to bind to the cell surface on the order of 106–108 ricin molecules per cell surface.

The profuse binding of ricin to surface membranes allows internalization with all types of membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, as well as by clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against ricin. Ricin molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

For ricin to function cytotoxically, RTA must be reductively cleaved from RTB to release a steric block of the RTA active site. This process is catalysed by the protein PDI (protein disulphide isomerase) that resides in the lumen of the ER. Free RTA in the ER lumen then partially unfolds and partially buries into the ER membrane, where it is thought to mimic a misfolded membrane-associated protein. Roles for the ER chaperones GRP94, EDEM and BiP have been proposed prior to the &#x27;dislocation&#x27; of RTA from the ER lumen to the cytosol in a manner that uses components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD normally removes misfolded ER proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. Dislocation of RTA requires ER membrane-integral E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, but RTA avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with ERAD substrates because of its low content of lysine residues, which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin. Thus, RTA avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins (destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes). In the mammalian cell cytosol, RTA then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and their co-chaperones, as well as by one subunit (RPT5) of the proteasome itself, that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation, which de-purinates ribosomes, thus halting protein synthesis.

=== Ribosome inactivation ===
RTA has rRNA &quot;N&quot;-glycosylase activity that is responsible for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the &quot;N&quot;-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5&#x27;-AGUACGAGAGGA-3&#x27;, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.

=== Depurination reaction ===
Within the active site of RTA, there exist several invariant amino acid residues involved in the depurination of ribosomal RNA. Although the exact mechanism of the event is unknown, key amino acid residues identified include tyrosine at positions 80 and 123, glutamic acid at position 177, and arginine at position 180. In particular, Arg180 and Glu177 have been shown to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, and not substrate binding, with enzyme kinetic studies involving RTA mutants. The model proposed by Mozingo and Robertus, based on X-ray structures, is as follows:
# Sarcin-ricin loop substrate binds RTA active site with target adenine stacking against tyr80 and tyr123.
# Arg180 is positioned such that it can protonate &quot;N&quot;-3 of adenine and break the bond between &quot;N&quot;-9 of the adenine ring and &quot;C&quot;-1&#x27; of the ribose.
# Bond cleavage results in an oxycarbonium ion on the ribose, stabilized by Glu177.
# &quot;N&quot;-3 protonation of adenine by Arg180 allows deprotonation of a nearby water molecule.
# Resulting hydroxyl attacks ribose carbonium ion.
# Depurination of adenine results in a neutral ribose on an intact phosphodiester RNA backbone.

==Toxicity==

Ricin is very toxic if inhaled, injected, or ingested. It can also be toxic if dust contacts the eyes or if it is absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a good recovery.

=== Symptoms ===
Because the symptoms are caused by failure to make protein, they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear, depending on the route of exposure and the dose. When ingested, gastrointestinal symptoms can manifest within six hours; these symptoms do not always become apparent. Within two to five days of exposure to ricin, its effects on the central nervous system, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver appear.

Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and hemorrhage in the mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly progress to severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Haemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss can lead to organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).

Symptoms of ricin inhalation are different from those caused by ingestion. Early symptoms include a cough and fever.

When skin or inhalation exposure occur, ricin can cause an allergic reaction to develop. This is indicated by swelling (edema) of the eyes and lips; asthma; bronchial irritation; dry, sore throat; congestion; skin redness (erythema); skin blisters (vesication); wheezing; itchy, watery eyes; chest tightness; and skin irritation.

=== Treatment ===
An antidote has been developed by the UK military, although as of 2006 it has not yet been tested on humans. As of 2005 another antidote developed by the US military has been shown to be safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with ricin, and has had some human testing. Monoclonal antibodies are under scientific investigation as a possible treatment for ricin poisoning.

Symptomatic and supportive treatments are available for ricin poisoning. Existing treatments emphasize minimizing the effects of the poison. Possible treatments include intravenous fluids or electrolytes, airway management, assisted ventilation, or giving medications to remedy seizures and low blood pressure. If the ricin has been ingested recently, the stomach can be flushed by ingesting activated charcoal or by performing gastric lavage. Survivors often develop long-term organ damage. Ricin causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, and victims can die of circulatory shock or organ failure; inhaled ricin can cause fatal pulmonary edema or respiratory failure. Death typically occurs within 3–5 days after oral ingestion.

=== Prevention ===
Vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain A. This vaccination is effective for several months due to the body&#x27;s production of antibodies to the foreign protein. In 1978 Bulgarian defector Vladimir Kostov survived a ricin attack similar to the one on Georgi Markov, probably due to his body&#x27;s production of antibodies. When a ricin-laced pellet was removed from the small of his back it was found that some of the original wax coating was still attached. For this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet, producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning.

=== Sources ===
The seeds of &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; are commonly crushed to extract castor oil. As ricin is not oil-soluble, little is found in the extracted castor oil. The extracted oil is also heated to more than to denature any ricin that may be present. The remaining spent crushed seeds, called variously the &quot;cake&quot;, &quot;oil cake&quot;, and &quot;press cake&quot;, can contain up to 5% ricin. While the oil cake from coconut, peanuts, and sometimes cotton seeds can be used as cattle feed or fertilizer, the toxic nature of castor beans precludes their oil cake from being used as feed unless the ricin is first deactivated by autoclaving. Accidental ingestion of &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; cake intended for fertilizer has been reported to be responsible for fatal ricin poisoning in animals.

Deaths from ingesting castor plant seeds are rare, partly because of their indigestible seed coat, and because some of the ricin is deactivated in the stomach. The pulp from eight beans is considered dangerous to an adult. Rauber and Heard have written that close examination of early 20th century case reports indicates that public and professional perceptions of ricin toxicity &quot;do not accurately reflect the capabilities of modern medical management&quot;.

Most acute poisoning episodes in humans are the result of oral ingestion of castor beans, 5–20 of which could prove fatal to an adult. Swallowing castor beans rarely proves to be fatal unless the bean is thoroughly chewed. The survival rate of castor bean ingestion is 98%. In 2013 a 37-year-old woman in the United States survived after ingesting 30 beans. In another case, a man ingested 200 castor beans mixed with juice in a blender and survived. Victims often manifest nausea, diarrhea, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and seizures persisting for up to a week. Blood, plasma, or urine ricin or ricinine concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis. The laboratory testing usually involves immunoassay or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

== Therapeutic applications ==

Although no approved therapeutics are currently based on ricin, it does have the potential to be used in the treatment of tumors, as a &quot;magic bullet&quot; to destroy targeted cells. Because ricin is a protein, it can be linked to a monoclonal antibody to target cancerous cells recognized by the antibody. The major problem with ricin is that its native internalization sequences are distributed throughout the protein. If any of these native internalization sequences are present in a therapeutic agent, the drug will be internalized by, and kill, untargeted non-tumorous cells as well as targeted cancerous cells.

Modifying ricin may sufficiently lessen the likelihood that the ricin component of these immunotoxins will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells. However, bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, which is used in denileukin diftitox, an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells, thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity. Use of ricin as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines.

== Regulation ==
In the US, ricin appears on the select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services, and scientists must register with HHS to use ricin in their research. However, investigators under the control of less than 1000 mg are exempt from regulation.

Ricin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the US Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

== Chemical or biological warfare agent ==
===History===

The United States investigated ricin for its military potential during World War I. At that time it was being considered for use either as a toxic dust or as a coating for bullets and shrapnel. The dust cloud concept could not be adequately developed, and the coated bullet/shrapnel concept would violate the Hague Convention of 1899 (adopted in U.S. law at 32 Stat. 1903), specifically Annex §2, Ch.1, Article 23, stating &quot;... it is especially prohibited ... [t]o employ poison or poisoned arms&quot;.

During World War II the United States and Canada studied ricin in cluster bombs. Though there were plans for mass production and several field trials with different bomblet concepts, the end conclusion was that it was no more economical than using phosgene. This conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons, rather than ricin&#x27;s toxicity (LCt50 ~10 mg/min·m3). Ricin was given the military symbol W or later WA. Interest in it continued for a short period after World War II, but soon subsided when the US Army Chemical Corps began a program to weaponize sarin.

The Soviet Union possessed weaponized ricin. The KGB developed weapons using ricin which were used outside the Soviet bloc, most famously in the Markov assassination.

===Control===
In spite of ricin&#x27;s extreme toxicity and utility as an agent of chemical/biological warfare, production of the toxin is difficult to limit. The castor bean plant from which ricin is derived is a common ornamental and can be grown at home without any special care.

Under both the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, ricin is listed as a schedule 1 controlled substance. Despite this, more than of castor beans are processed each year, and approximately 5% of the total is rendered into a waste containing negligible concentrations of undenatured ricin toxin.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/ricin.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricin is several orders of magnitude less toxic than botulinum or tetanus toxin, but the latter are harder to come by. Compared to botulinum or anthrax as biological weapons or chemical weapons, the quantity of ricin required to achieve LD50 over a large geographic area is significantly more than an agent such as anthrax (tons of ricin vs. only kilogram quantities of anthrax). Ricin is easy to produce, but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents. Ricin is easily denatured by temperatures over meaning many methods of deploying ricin would generate enough heat to denature it. Once deployed, an area contaminated with ricin remains dangerous until the bonds between chain A or B have been broken, a process that takes two or three days. In contrast, anthrax spores may remain lethal for decades. Jan van Aken, a German expert on biological weapons, explained in a report for The Sunshine Project that Al Qaeda&#x27;s experiments with ricin suggest their inability to produce botulinum or anthrax.

== Vaccination ==

Ricin toxin vaccines have emerged as a focus in biodefense research. Two recombinant A subunit (RTA)-based vaccines, RiVax and RVEc (also known as RTA1-33/44-198), have completed Phase I clinical trials, and were found to be safe. These vaccines are based on modified versions of the ricin toxin A-chain, designed to reduce toxicity while maintaining immunogenicity.

==Developments==
A biopharmaceutical company called Soligenix, Inc. licensed an anti-ricin vaccine called RiVax from Vitetta et al. at UT Southwestern. The vaccine was found safe and immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and humans. Two successful clinical trials were completed. Soligenix was issued a US patent for Rivax. The ricin vaccine candidate was granted orphan drug status in the US and the EEC and, as of 2019, was in clinical trials in the US. Grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the US Food and Drug Administration supported development of the vaccine candidate.

== Synthesis ==
The first isolation of ricin is attributed to the Baltic-German microbiologist Peter Hermann Stillmark (1860–1923) in 1888.

==Terrorist use==

Ricin has been involved in a number of actual or planned attacks on individuals. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov was assassinated by Bulgarian secret police who surreptitiously shot him on a London street with what was later found to have been a modified umbrella using compressed gas to fire a tiny pellet containing ricin into his leg. He died in a hospital a few days later; his body was passed to a special poison branch of the British Ministry of Defence that discovered the pellet during an autopsy. The prime suspects were the Bulgarian secret police: Georgi Markov had defected from Bulgaria some years previously and had subsequently written books and made radio broadcasts that were highly critical of the Bulgarian communist regime. However, it was believed at the time that Bulgaria would not have been able to produce the pellet, and it was also believed that the KGB had supplied it. The KGB denied any involvement, although high-profile KGB defectors Oleg Kalugin and Oleg Gordievsky later confirmed the KGB&#x27;s involvement. Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn developed (but survived) ricin-like symptoms after an encounter in 1971 with KGB agents.

Ten days before the attack on Georgi Markov another Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov, survived a similar attack. Kostov was standing on an escalator of the Paris metro when he felt a sting in his lower back above the belt of his trousers. He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov&#x27;s death the wound on Kostov&#x27;s back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.

Several terrorist individuals and groups have experimented with ricin or planned to use it. There have been incidents of the poison being mailed to US politicians. For example, on 29 May 2013 two anonymous letters sent to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg contained traces of it. Another was sent to the offices of Mayors Against Illegal Guns in Washington, D.C. A letter containing ricin was also reported to have been sent to American President Barack Obama at the same time. Shannon Richardson, an actress, was later charged with the crime, and pleaded guilty that December; she was sentenced to 18 years in prison plus a restitution fine of US$367,000. On 2 October 2018, two letters suspected of containing ricin were sent to The Pentagon, one addressed to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and the other to Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson. A letter was received on 23 July 2019 at Pelican Bay State Prison in California which claimed to contain a suspicious substance. Authorities later confirmed it contained ricin; no detrimental exposures were identified.

In 2020, some media in the Czech Republic reported, based on intelligence information, that a person carrying a Russian diplomatic passport and ricin had arrived in Prague with the intention of assassinating three politicians. Russian president Vladimir Putin denied the reports. The targets were said to have been Zdeněk Hřib, the mayor of Prague (capital of the Czech Republic), who was involved in renaming a square in Prague, &quot;Pod Kaštany&quot;, where the Russian embassy is situated, to the Square of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician assassinated in the Kremlin in 2015; Ondřej Kolář, the mayor of Prague 6 municipal district, who was involved in removing the controversial statue to the Soviet-era Marshal Konev; and Pavel Novotný, the mayor of Prague&#x27;s southwestern Řeporyje district. They all received police protection. Czech president Miloš Zeman later described the police protection of Zdeněk Hřib as an attempt by an insignificant politician to gain attention. Zeman also confused ricin with non-poisonous laxative castor oil.

In 2018 and 2023 German police thwarted attempted ricin attacks, after tip-offs believed to have come from the US FBI.

==In popular culture==
Ricin has been used as a plot device, such as in the television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

The popularity of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; inspired several real-life criminal cases involving ricin or similar substances. Kuntal Patel from London attempted to poison her mother with abrin after the latter interfered with her marriage plans. Daniel Milzman, a 19-year-old former Georgetown University student, was charged with manufacturing ricin in his dorm room, as well as the intent of &quot;[using] the ricin on another undergraduate student with whom he had a relationship&quot;. Mohammed Ali from Liverpool, England, was convicted after attempting to purchase 500 mg of ricin over the dark web from an undercover FBI agent. He was sentenced on 18 September 2015 to eight years imprisonment.

In Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, ricin was used as a plot device.

<text>The Yarrow Water is a river in the Borders in the south east of Scotland. It is a tributary of the Ettrick Water (itself a tributary of the Tweed) and renowned for its high quality trout and salmon fishing. The name &quot;Yarrow&quot; may derive from the Celtic word &quot;garw&quot; meaning &quot;rough&quot; or possibly share a derivation with the English name &quot;Jarrow&quot;.

The valley was the birthplace of Mungo Park and has inspired several well-known songs and poems. Its traditions and folk tales were well documented by Walter Scott, who spent part of his childhood nearby, and in adult life returned to live in the vicinity at Abbotsford House, near Melrose.

==Geography and history==

Its source is St. Mary&#x27;s Loch and from there the Yarrow Water flows in an easterly direction with a fall of passing the settlements of Yarrow Feus, Yarrow and Yarrowford before joining the Ettrick near to the site of the 1645 Battle of Philiphaugh just west of Selkirk. This confluence, which occurs at the eastern edge of the Duke of Buccleuch&#x27;s Bowhill Estate, is known as the Meetings Pool. The valley is traversed by the A708 that runs from Selkirk to Moffat.

The explorer Mungo Park was born at Foulshiels on the left bank of the river in 1771. In May 1804 Walter Scott came upon Park throwing stones into a deep pool in the river and remarked that &quot;This appears but an idle amusement for one who has seen so much adventure&quot;. Park replied that this was &quot;Not so idle perhaps, as you suppose. This was the way I used to ascertain the depth of a river in Africa&quot;. Although he had not yet told anyone, Park was considering his second and fateful expedition at the time. At about the same time, James Hogg (&quot;The Ettrick Shepherd&quot;) had come to the attention of Scott whilst the former was working at Blackhouse Farm in the Yarrow valley.

The impressive ruins of Newark Castle, held by the Earls of Douglas in the 15th century, lie on the right bank of the river opposite Foulshiels.

==In literature==
===The Dowie Dens===
The folk song &quot;The Dowie Dens o Yarrow&quot; (English: &quot;the dismal, narrow wooded valleys of Yarrow&quot;) refers to an ambush and murder that takes place in the locality. According to Walter Scott the song is based on a real incident that took place in the seventeenth century, although some modern scholars are sceptical about this story as one of the origins of the song. These include a poem by William Hamilton of Bangour called &quot;The Braes of Yarrow&quot; first published in Edinburgh in 1724 and said to be &quot;written in imitation of an old Scottish ballad on a similar subject&quot;.

===Outlaw Murray===
&quot;The Sang of the Outlaw Murray&quot; is a lay that may have been composed in the reign of James V and which was collected by Walter Scott. Local tradition held that the events took place in the vicinity of Newark Castle, although Scott himself believed that the old tower at Hangingshaw, a seat of the Philiphaugh family near Yarrowford, was the correct location. He was assured by &quot;the late excellent antiquarian Mr. Plummer, sheriff-depute of Selkirkshire... that he remembered the insignia of the unicorns, &amp;c. so often mentioned in the ballad, in existence&quot; there.

===William Wordsworth===

In his 1803 publication &quot;Yarrow Unvisited&quot; William Wordsworth wrote:
:&quot;What&#x27;s Yarrow but a river bare,
:That glides the dark hills under?
:There are a thousand such elsewhere
:As worthy of your wonder.&quot;
although this deprecation did not deter a further visit to the area when he journeyed down the length of the Yarrow in the company of James Hogg and the subsequent publication of &quot;Yarrow Visited&quot; in 1814 and &quot;Yarrow Revisited&quot; in 1838.

Wordsworth&#x27;s 1835 &quot;Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg&quot; includes the lines:
:&quot;The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,
:&#x27;Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
:And death upon the braes of Yarrow,
:Has closed the Shepherd-poet&#x27;s eyes.&quot;

===Tam Lin===
The wood of Carterhaugh near the confluence of the Yarrow and Ettrick, is the setting for the ballad &quot;Tam Lin&quot;. This song, collected in 1729, tells the story of a maiden and her relationship to the faery world. It begins:
:&quot;O I forbid you, maidens a&#x27;,
:That wear gowd on your hair,
:To come or gae by Carterhaugh,
:For young Tam Lin is there.

:There&#x27;s nane that gaes by Carterhaugh
:But they leave him a wad,
:Either their rings, or green mantles,
:Or else their maidenhead.&quot;
It is possible that this tale is derived from the 13th century ballad, &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, that concerns Thomas Learmonth of nearby Erceldoune.

==Folk tales==

The subject matter of Tam Lin is referred to in various other local traditions. Scott recorded that:

The peasants point out upon the plain [of Caterhaugh], those electrical rings which vulgar credulity supposes to be traces of the Fairy revels. Here, they say, were placed the stands of milk, and of water, in which Tamlane was dipped in order to effect the disenchantment; and upon these spots, according to their mode of expressing themselves, the grass will never grow.
He went on to complain that &quot;in no part of Scotland, indeed, has the belief in Fairies maintained its ground with more pertinacity than in Selkirkshire&quot; and describes a story &quot;implicitly believed by all&quot; said to have occurred in the seventeenth century on Peat Law, to the east of Foulshiels Hill:

The victim of elfin sport was a poor man, who, being employed in pulling heather upon Peatlaw, a hill not far from Carterhaugh, had tired of his labour and laid him down to sleep upon a Fairy ring. When he awakened he was amazed to find himself in the midst of a populous city, to which, as well as to the means of his transportation, he was an utter stranger. His coat was left upon the Peatlaw; and his bonnet, which had fallen off in the course of his aerial journey, was afterwards found hanging upon the steeple of the church of Lanark.

<doc id="166475" wikidata="Q604279" url="?curid=166475" title="Dirac (video compression format)">
<text>Dirac (and Dirac Pro, a subset standardised as SMPTE VC-2) is an open and royalty-free video compression format, specification and software video codec developed by BBC Research &amp; Development. Dirac aimed to provide high-quality video compression for Ultra HDTV and competed with existing formats such as H.264.

The specification was finalised in January 2008, and further developments were only bug fixes and constraints. In September of that year, version 1.0.0 of an I-frame only subset known as Dirac Pro was released and was standardised by the SMPTE as VC-2. Version 2.2.3 of the full Dirac specification, including motion compensation and inter-frame coding, was issued a few days later. Dirac Pro was used internally by the BBC to transmit HDTV pictures at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.

Two open source and royalty-free video codec software implementations, libschrodinger and dirac-research, were developed. The format implementations were named in honour of the theoretical physicists Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrödinger, who shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Technology==

Dirac supports resolutions of HDTV (1920×1080) and greater, and is claimed to provide significant savings in data rate and improvements in quality over video compression formats such as MPEG-2 Part 2, MPEG-4 Part 2 and its competitors such as Theora and WMV. Dirac&#x27;s implementers made a preliminary claim of &quot;a two-fold reduction in bit rate over MPEG-2 for high definition video&quot;, which makes it comparable to VC-1 and simpler profiles of H.264.

Dirac supports both constant bit rate and variable bit rate operation. When the low delay syntax is used, the bit rate will be constant for each area (Dirac slice) in a picture to ensure constant latency. Dirac supports lossy and lossless compression modes.

Dirac employs wavelet compression, like the JPEG 2000 and PGF image formats and the Cineform professional video codec, instead of the discrete cosine transforms used in MPEG compression formats. Two of the specific wavelets Dirac can use are nearly identical to JPEG 2000&#x27;s (known as the 5/3 and 9/7 wavelets), as well as two more derived from them.

Dirac can be used in Ogg and Matroska container formats and is also registered for use in the ISO base media (MP4) file format and MPEG transport streams.

===Patents===

The BBC does not own any patents on Dirac. They previously had some patent applications with plans to irrevocably grant a royalty-free licence for their Dirac-related patents to everyone, but they let the applications lapse. In addition, the developers have said they will try to ensure that Dirac does not infringe on any third party patents, enabling the public to use Dirac for any purpose.

==VC-2==

Dirac Pro, an I-frame only subset of the Dirac specification, was proposed to the SMPTE for standardisation. Dirac Pro is designed for professional and studio use of high definition video in high bitrate applications. In 2010, the SMPTE standardised Dirac Pro as VC-2.

Although work on the original Dirac codec has largely stopped, the VC-2 codec has continued to be adapted and updated for HD and UHD post-production environments. The SMPTE standards (ST) and recommended practices (RP) are as follows:

* SMPTE ST 2042-1:2022 – VC-2 Video Compression
* SMPTE ST 2042-2:2017 – VC-2 Level Definitions
* SMPTE RP 2042-3:2022 – VC-2 Conformance Specification
* SMPTE ST 2042-4:2018 — Mapping a VC-2 Stream into the MXF Generic Container
* SMPTE RP 2047-1:2023 – VC-2 Mezzanine Level Compression of 1080P High Definition Video Sources
* SMPTE ST 2047-2:2010 — Carriage of VC-2 Compressed Video over HD-SDI
* SMPTE RP 2047-3:2023 — VC-2 Level 65 Compression of High Definition Video Sources for Use with a Standard Definition Infrastructure
* SMPTE ST 2047-4:2011 — Carriage of Level 65 VC-2 Compressed Video Over the SDTV SDI
* SMPTE RP 2047-5:2022 — VC-2 Level 66 Compression of Ultra-High Definition Video Sources for Use with a High Definition Infrastructure
* IETF — RTP Payload Format for VC-2 High Quality (HQ) Profile

==Software implementations==

Two software implementations were initially developed. The BBC&#x27;s reference implementation, initially called &quot;Dirac&quot; but renamed &quot;dirac-research&quot; to avoid confusion, was written in C++ and released under the Mozilla Public License, GNU GPL 2 and GNU LGPL free software licenses. Version 1.0.0 of this implementation was released on 17 September 2008 and defines the Dirac bitstream format.

A second implementation called &quot;Schrödinger&quot; was funded by the BBC and aimed to provide a high-performance, portable version of the codec whilst remaining 100% bitstream compatible. Schrödinger was written in ANSI C and released under the same licenses as dirac-research, as well as the highly-permissive MIT License. GStreamer plugins were included to enable the library to be used with that framework. On 22 February 2008, Schrödinger 1.0.0 was released, and was able to decode HD720/25p in real-time on a Core Duo laptop.

By the March 2010 release of Schrödinger version 1.0.9, it was outperforming dirac-research &quot;in most encoding situations, both in terms of encoding speed and visual quality&quot;. With that release, most of the encoding tools in dirac-research were ported over to Schrödinger, giving Schrödinger the same as or better compression efficiency than dirac-research. Development of Schrödinger ceased after the 1.0.11 release in 2012. 

After the standardisation of Dirac Pro as SMPTE VC-2, development began on an open source reference VC-2 encoder. The code is provided in a git repository by the BBC and is available on GitHub.

An encoder quality testing system has been put in place at BBC to check how well new encoding tools work and to make sure bugs that affect quality are quickly fixed.

===Desktop playback and encoding===

Dirac video playback is supported by VLC media player since version 0.9.2 (2008), and by applications using the GStreamer framework. Support has also been added to FFmpeg. Applications which can encode to Dirac include FFmpeg, MediaCoder, LiVES and OggConvert.

==Performance==

The algorithms in the original Dirac specification were intended to provide compression performance comparable to mainstream video compression standards of the time. A 2009 comparison of the Dirac and H.264 codecs, which used implementations from the second quarter of 2008, showed x264 scoring slightly higher than Dirac. Another 2009 comparison found similar results for standard definition content, but did not compare high definition (HD) video content.
These studies show that Dirac compression performance is close to that of MPEG-4 Part 2 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP, popularised as DivX). While also approaching low complexity H.264 encodes, a High Profile H.264 encoded video will have better compression for the same perceived quality.

Since 2010, royalty-free, open source video codecs such as VP8, VP9, and AV1 have been developed with better compression performance and more widespread adoption, including dominant streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix.

<text>Derwent Reservoir is the middle of three reservoirs in the Upper Derwent Valley in the north of Derbyshire, England. It lies approximately from Glossop and from Sheffield. The River Derwent flows first through Howden Reservoir, then Derwent Reservoir and finally through Ladybower Reservoir. Between them they provide practically all of Derbyshire&#x27;s water, as well as to a large part of South Yorkshire and as far afield as Nottingham and Leicester.

Derwent Reservoir is around in length, running broadly north–south, with Howden Dam at the northern end and Derwent Dam at the south. A small island lies near the Howden Dam. The Abbey Brook flows into the reservoir from the east.

At its full capacity the reservoir covers an area of and at its deepest point is deep.

== History ==

The Industrial Revolution and urbanisation of the 19th century created huge demand for water in the industrial cities of the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. The proximity of Sheffield and its neighbours to the Upper Derwent valley were thus factors in the decision to dam the valley to create the Howden and Derwent reservoirs.

Construction of the neo-Gothic solid masonry dam began in 1902, a year after the building of Howden commenced, and proved a mammoth task. The chief engineer was Edward Sandeman. He was also in charge of building nearby Howden dam and he was awarded the Telford Medal in 1918 for his work ‘Derwent Valley Waterworks’. The huge stones that formed the walls of the dam were carried along a specially created railway from the quarries at Bole Hill near Grindleford. Over 1,000 workers lived in a specially constructed self-contained town called Birchinlee or &quot;Tin Town&quot;. One of the metal huts was preserved and moved to the village of Hope, where it is now a hairdressing salon. The workers who died during the building of the dam were buried in Bamford Church.

The filling of the reservoir began in November 1914, and overflowed for the first time in January 1916, with the water almost immediately passing into supply. The dam can support a total of of water.

Only two years after the dam&#x27;s completion in 1916, it was decided that the flow from the reservoir was insufficient to support the surrounding population. As a result, between 1920 and 1931 the rivers Alport and Ashop were also diverted from the Ashop valley into the reservoir using tunnels and a Venturi flume.

The diversion helped hold back water during the construction of the Ladybower Reservoir to the south, which was constructed between 1935 and 1945.

== Bamford and Howden Railway ==

Between 1901 and 1903 a standard-gauge railway of over was built from the village of Bamford to the south of the reservoir to Howden, to carry the thousands of tons of stone required for the construction of the two dams. Near the southern end lay the newly opened quarry at Bole Hill near Grindleford.

Remains of the railway can still be seen alongside Derwent Reservoir as well as at the western end of the Ladybower dam where over of cutting and trackway remain, and are known locally as &#x27;The Route&#x27;. Between the Howden and Derwent dams the present road was built over the top of the railway.

After supplying well over a million tons of stone the Bole Hill quarry was closed in September 1914, with the end of the railway following soon after. The section between the mainline railway at Hope and Yorkshire Bridge was relaid in 1935 to aid the construction of the Ladybower dam, but closed again in 1946.

== Countryside ==

The majority of the land around the reservoir is owned by Severn Trent Water, and of that around half is woodland. The woods consist predominantly of larch, pine, and spruce conifers, with the remaining third mainly sycamore, beech and oak.

The hills of the Peak District are given over to the pasture of sheep, leased to local farmers. The moorlands and gritstone edges are criss-crossed by footpaths open year-round other than during selected shooting periods.

A stone memorial to Tip, a sheepdog, stands on the bank of the reservoir. Tip remained with the body of local shepherd, Joseph Tagg, for 105 days after he died on Howden Moor in the winter of 1953-54. Tip was awarded the Bronze Medal of the Canine Defence League.

==Dambusters==
During the Second World War, the reservoir was used by pilots of the 617 Squadron for practising the low-level flights needed for Operation Chastise (commonly known as the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raids), due to its similarity to the German dams. Today there is a commemorative plaque to 617 Squadron on the dam, and one of the towers on the dam housed the Derwent Valley Museum. The exhibition now closed, was owned and run by the late Vic Hallam, and covered stories of 617 Squadron and its training for Operation Chastise. It also had a display on the history of the Derwent valley and the lost villages of Derwent and Ashopton. 

Occasional flypasts of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight at the reservoir are also staged to commemorate the events during the war. In September 2014, a unique flypast took place with the two remaining airworthy Lancasters, one from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and one from Canada, flying three passes in formation.

<text>The Howden Reservoir is a Y-shaped reservoir, the uppermost of the three in the Upper Derwent Valley, England. The western half of the reservoir lies in Derbyshire and the eastern half is in Sheffield, South Yorkshire; the county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the River Derwent. The longest arm is around in length. The reservoir is bounded at the southern end by Howden Dam; below this, the Derwent flows immediately into Derwent Reservoir and subsequently the Ladybower Reservoir. Other tributaries include the River Westend, Howden Clough and Linch Clough.

Work commenced on the dam&#x27;s construction on 16 July 1901 and completed in July 1912. The chief engineer was Edward Sandeman. He was also in charge of building nearby Derwent dam and was awarded the Telford Medal in 1918 for his work &quot;Derwent Valley Waterworks&quot;. The works involved constructing a temporary village at Birchinlee, or &quot;Tin Town&quot;, for the workers, a temporary railway line from the main line at Bamford, construction of a link aqueduct to the Derwent Dam. The dam is of solid masonry construction, and tall, long, and impounds of water, from a catchment area of . The workers who died during the construction of the dam were buried in St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Bamford.

To the east of the reservoir stands Featherbed Moss, one of the highest tops in the area at , and one of several tops of that name in the area. This is not to be confused with the more well-known Featherbed Moss on the Pennine Way between Kinder Scout and Bleaklow.</text><links>

<text>Frédéric-Louis Sauser (1 September 1887 – 21 January 1961), better known as Blaise Cendrars (), was a Swiss-born novelist and poet who became a naturalized French citizen in 1916. He was a writer of considerable influence in the European modernist movement.

==Early years and education==
He was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Neuchâtel, Switzerland, rue de la Paix 27, into a bourgeois francophone family, to a Swiss father and a Scottish mother. They sent young Frédéric to a German boarding school, but he ran away. At the Realschule in Basel in 1902 he met his lifelong friend the sculptor August Suter. Next they enrolled him in a school in Neuchâtel, but he had little enthusiasm for his studies. Finally, in 1904, he left school due to poor performance and began an apprenticeship with a Swiss watchmaker in Russia.

While living in St. Petersburg, he began to write, thanks to the encouragement of R.R., a librarian at the National Library of Russia. There he wrote the poem, &quot;La Légende de Novgorode&quot;, which R.R. translated into Russian. Supposedly fourteen copies were made, but Cendrars claimed to have no copies of it, and none could be located during his lifetime. In 1995, the Bulgarian poet Kiril Kadiiski claimed to have found one of the Russian translations in Sofia, but the authenticity of the document remains contested on the grounds of factual, typographic, orthographic, and stylistic analysis.

In 1907, Sauser returned to Switzerland, where he studied medicine at the University of Berne. During this period, he wrote his first verified poems, &quot;Séquences&quot;, influenced by Remy de Gourmont&#x27;s &quot;Le Latin mystique&quot;.

==Literary career==
Cendrars was an early exponent of Modernism in European poetry with his works: &quot;The Legend of Novgorode&quot; (1907), &quot;Les Pâques à New York&quot; (1912), &quot;La Prose du Transsibérien et la Petite Jehanne de France&quot; (1913), &quot;Séquences&quot; (1913), &quot;La Guerre au Luxembourg&quot; (1916), &quot;Le Panama ou les aventures de mes sept oncles&quot; (1918), &quot;J&#x27;ai tué&quot; (1918), and &quot;Dix-neuf poèmes élastiques&quot; (1919).

In many ways, he was a direct heir of Rimbaud, a visionary rather than what the French call &quot;un homme de lettres&quot; (&quot;a man of letters&quot;), a term that for him was predicated on a separation of intellect and life. Like Rimbaud, who writes in &quot;The Alchemy of the Word&quot; in &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;, &quot;I liked absurd paintings over door panels, stage sets, backdrops for acrobats, signs, popular engravings, old-fashioned literature, church Latin, erotic books full of misspellings,&quot; Cendrars similarly says of himself in &quot;Der Sturm&quot; (1913), &quot;I like legends, dialects, mistakes of language, detective novels, the flesh of girls, the sun, the Eiffel Tower.&quot;

Spontaneity, boundless curiosity, a craving for travel, and immersion in actualities were his hallmarks both in life and art. He was drawn to this same immersion in Balzac&#x27;s flood of novels on 19th-century French society and in Casanova&#x27;s travels and adventures through 18th-century Europe, which he set down in dozens of volumes of memoirs that Cendrars considered &quot;the true Encyclopedia of the eighteenth century, filled with &quot;life&quot; as they are, unlike Diderot&#x27;s, and the work of a single man, who was neither an ideologue nor a theoretician&quot;. Cendrars regarded the early modernist movement from roughly 1910 to the mid-1920s as a period of genuine discovery in the arts and in 1919 contrasted &quot;theoretical cubism&quot; with &quot;the group&#x27;s three antitheoreticians,&quot; Picasso, Braque, and Léger, whom he described as &quot;three strongly personal painters who represent the three successive phases of cubism.&quot;

After a short stay in Paris, he traveled to New York, arriving on 11 December 1911. Between 6–8 April 1912, he wrote his long poem, &quot;Les Pâques à New York&quot; (Easter in New York), his first important contribution to modern literature. He signed it for the first time with the name Blaise Cendrars.

In the summer of 1912, Cendrars returned to Paris, convinced that poetry was his vocation. With Emil Szittya, an anarchist writer, he started the journal &quot;Les hommes nouveaux&quot;, also the name of the press where he published &quot;Les Pâques à New York&quot; and &quot;Séquences&quot;. He became acquainted with the international array of artists and writers in Paris, such as Chagall, Léger, Survage, Suter, Modigliani, Csaky, Archipenko, Jean Hugo and Robert Delaunay.

Most notably, he encountered Guillaume Apollinaire. The two poets influenced each other&#x27;s work. Cendrars&#x27;s poem &quot;Les Pâques à New York&quot; influenced Apollinaire&#x27;s poem &quot;Zone&quot;. Cendrars&#x27;s style was based on photographic impressions, cinematic effects of montage and rapid changes of imagery, and scenes of great emotional force, often with the power of a hallucination. These qualities, which also inform his prose, are already evident in &quot;Easter in New York&quot; and in his best known and even longer poem &quot;The Transsiberian,&quot; with its scenes of revolution and the Far East in flames in the Russo-Japanese war (&quot;The earth stretches elongated and snaps back like an accordion / tortured by a sadic hand / In the rips in the sky insane locomotives / Take flight / In the gaps / Whirling wheels mouths voices / And the dogs of disaster howling at our heels&quot;). The published work was printed within washes of color by the painter Sonia Delaunay-Terk as a fold-out two meters in length, together with her design of brilliant colors down the left-hand side, a small map of the Transsiberian railway in the upper right corner, and a painted silhouette in orange of the Eiffel Tower in the lower left. Cendrars called the work the first &quot;simultaneous poem&quot;. Soon after, it was exhibited as a work of art in its own right and continues to be shown at exhibitions to this day.

This intertwining of poetry and painting was related to Robert Delaunay&#x27;s and other artists&#x27; experiments in proto-expressionism. At the same time Gertrude Stein was beginning to write prose in the manner of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s paintings. Cendrars liked to claim that his poem&#x27;s first printing of one hundred fifty copies would, when unfolded, reach the height of the Eiffel Tower.

Cendrars&#x27;s relationship with painters such as Chagall and Léger led him to write a series of revolutionary abstract short poems, published in a collection in 1919 under the title &quot;Dix-neuf poèmes élastiques&quot; (Nineteen Elastic Poems). Some were tributes to his fellow artists. In 1954, a collaboration between Cendrars and Léger resulted in &quot;Paris, ma ville&quot; (Paris, My City), in which the poet and illustrator together expressed their love of the French capital. As Léger died in 1955, the book was not published until 1987.

===The Left-Handed Poet===
His writing career was interrupted by World War I. When it began, he and the Italian writer Ricciotto Canudo appealed to other foreign artists to join the French army. He joined the French Foreign Legion. He was sent to the front line in the Somme where from mid-December 1914 until February 1915, he was in the line at Frise (La Grenouillère and Bois de la Vache). He described this war experience in the books &quot;La Main coupée&quot; (The severed hand) and &quot;J&#x27;ai tué&quot; (I have killed), and it is the subject of his poem &quot;Orion&quot; in &quot;Travel Notes&quot;: &quot;It is my star / It is in the shape of a hand / It is my hand gone up to the sky ...&quot;. It was during the attacks in Champagne in September 1915 that Cendrars lost his right arm and was discharged from the army.

Jean Cocteau introduced him to Eugenia Errázuriz, who proved a supportive, if at times possessive, patron. Around 1918 he visited her house and was so taken with the simplicity of the décor that he was inspired to write the poems published as &quot;De Outremer à indigo&quot; (From ultramarine to indigo). He stayed with Eugenia in her house in Biarritz, in a room decorated with murals by Picasso. At this time, he drove an old Alfa Romeo which had been colour-coordinated by Georges Braque.

Cendrars became an important part of the artistic community in Montparnasse; his writings were considered a literary epic of the modern adventurer. He was a friend of the American writer Henry Miller, who called him his &quot;great idol&quot;, a man he &quot;really venerated as a writer&quot;. He knew many of the writers, painters, and sculptors living in Paris. In 1918, his friend Amedeo Modigliani painted his portrait. He was acquainted with Ernest Hemingway, who mentions having seen him &quot;with his broken boxer&#x27;s nose and his pinned-up empty sleeve, rolling a cigarette with his one good hand&quot;, at the Closerie des Lilas in Paris. He was also befriended by John Dos Passos, who was his closest American counterpart both as a world traveler (even more than Hemingway) and in his adaptation of Cendrars&#x27;s cinematic uses of montage in writing, most notably in his great trilogy of the 1930s, &quot;U.S.A.&quot; One of the most gifted observers of the times, Dos Passos brought Cendrars to American readers in the 1920s and 30s by translating Cendrars&#x27;s major long poems &quot;The Transsiberian&quot; and &quot;Panama&quot; and in his 1926 prose-poetic essay &quot;Homer of the Transsiberian,&quot; which was reprinted from &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; one year later in &quot;Orient Express.&quot;

After the war, Cendrars became involved in the movie industry in Italy, France, and the United States. Cendrars&#x27;s departure from poetry in the 1920s roughly coincided with his break from the world of the French intellectuals, summed up in his &quot;Farewell to Painters&quot; (1926) and the last section of &quot;L&#x27;homme foudroyé&quot; (1944), after which he began to make numerous trips to South America (&quot;while others were going to Moscow&quot;, as he writes in that chapter). It was during this second half of his career that he began to concentrate on novels, short stories, and, near the end and just after World War II, on his magnificent poetic-autobiographical tetralogy, beginning with &quot;L&#x27;homme foudroyé&quot;.

===Later years===
Cendrars continued to be active in the Paris artistic community, encouraging younger artists and writing about them. For instance, he described the Hungarian photographer Ervin Marton as an &quot;ace of white and black photography&quot; in a preface to his exhibition catalogue. He was with the British Expeditionary Force in northern France at the beginning of the German invasion in 1940, and his book that immediately followed, &quot;Chez l&#x27;armée anglaise&quot; (&quot;With the English Army&quot;), was seized before publication by the Gestapo, which sought him out and sacked his library in his country home, while he fled into hiding in Aix-en-Provence. He comments on the trampling of his library and temporary &quot;extinction of my personality&quot; at the beginning of &quot;L&#x27;homme foudroyé&quot; (in the double sense of &quot;the man who was blown away&quot;). In Occupied France, the Gestapo listed Cendrars as a Jewish writer of &quot;French expression&quot;, but he managed to survive. His youngest son was killed in an accident while escorting American planes in Morocco. Details of his time with the BEF and last meeting with his son appear in his work of 1949 &quot;Le lotissement du ciel&quot; (translated simply as &quot;Sky&quot;).

In 1950, Cendrars settled down in the rue Jean-Dolent in Paris, across from the La Santé Prison. There he collaborated frequently with Radiodiffusion Française. He finally published again in 1956. The novel, &quot;Emmène-moi au bout du monde !…&quot;, was his last work before he suffered a stroke in 1957. He died in 1961. His ashes are held at Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre.

=== Personal life ===
In New York in 1911, Cendrars married his first wife, Féla Poznańska, who was Jewish and of Russo-Polish extraction. They had three children: Rémy (an airman killed in WW2), Odilon and Miriam Gilou-Cendrars who was active with the Free French in London during World War II. She was her father&#x27;s first biographer and helped set up the Cendrars Archive in Berne. Cendrars converted to Catholicism on May 1, 1959, and married Raymone Duchâteau, a French actress.

<doc id="166482" wikidata="Q1800100" url="?curid=166482" title="Ladybower Reservoir">
<text>Ladybower Reservoir is a large Y-shaped, artificial reservoir, the lowest of three in the Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire, England. The River Ashop flows into the reservoir from the west; the River Derwent flows south, initially through Howden Reservoir, then Derwent Reservoir, and finally through Ladybower Reservoir. The reservoir is owned by the water company Severn Trent.

The area is now a tourist attraction, with the Fairholmes visitors&#x27; centre located at the northern tip of Ladybower. The east arm of the reservoir, fed by the Ladybower Brook, is overlooked by Hordron Edge stone circle.

==Design and construction==

Ladybower was built between 1935 and 1943 by the Derwent Valley Water Board to supplement the other two reservoirs in supplying the water needs of the East Midlands. It took a further two years to fill, which was done by 1945. The dam differs from the Howden Reservoir and Derwent Reservoir in that it is a clay-cored earth embankment and not a solid masonry dam. Below the dam is a cut-off trench deep and wide filled with concrete, stretching into the hills each side, to stop water leaking around the dam. The dam wall was built by Richard Baillie and Sons, a Scottish company. The two viaducts, Ashopton and Ladybower, needed to carry the trunk roads over the reservoir, were built by the London firm of Holloways, using a steel frame clad in concrete. The project was delayed when the Second World War broke out in 1939, making labour and raw materials scarce, but construction was continued due to the strategic importance of maintaining supplies. King George VI, accompanied by his wife, Queen Elizabeth, formally opened the reservoir on 25 September 1945.

During the 1990s, the wall was raised and strengthened to reduce the risk of over-topping in a major flood. The original dam wall contains 100,000 tons of concrete, over one million tons of earth, and 100,000 tons of clay for the core. The upstream face is stone-faced. Materials were brought to the site on the Derwent Valley Water Board&#x27;s own branch line and their sidings off the mainline in the Hope Valley.

The dam&#x27;s design is unusual in having two totally enclosed bellmouth spillway overflows (locally named the &quot;plugholes&quot;) at the side of the wall. These are stone and of diameter with a drop of . The plugholes regulate water levels in the reservoir by draining away excess water when they overflow. The water is then carried to the River Derwent through tunnels. The overflows originally had walkways around them, but they were dismantled many years ago. The plugholes typically overflow in winter months if there has been wet or snowy weather in the nearby hills. According to Severn Trent, the reservoir’s operating company, the overflowing plug holes attract many visitors each year.

==Water usage==

The water is used for river control and to compensate for the water retained by all three dams, along with supply into the drinking water system and hydroelectricity generation. Drinking water must be pumped to treatment works rather than using gravity flow as in the other two reservoirs, increasing costs. The drinking water is treated at Bamford water treatment works by Severn Trent Water. Treated water flows south down the long Derwent Valley Aqueduct to a covered service reservoir at Ambergate to supply clean water to the cities of Nottingham, Derby and Leicester in the East Midlands of England. The aqueduct passes through the park of Chatsworth House. The path of the aqueduct is marked by a series of valve houses built of stone and domed steel access chambers. A tunnel carries some of the water from the Derwent Valley eastwards through the hill and into the lower of the two Rivelin Dams to supply Sheffield.

==Flooded villages==

The building of the reservoir resulted in the submergence of the villages of Ashopton and Derwent, including Derwent Woodlands church and Derwent Hall. Ashopton stood roughly where the road to the Snake Pass met the Snake valley. The buildings in Ashopton were demolished before the reservoir was filled, but much of the structure of Derwent village was still visible during a dry summer some 14 years later. Derwent Bridge, a narrow stone packhorse bridge, over the Derwent was removed and rebuilt at the head of the Howden reservoir. The clock tower of the church had been left standing and the upper part of it was visible above the water level until 1947, when it was seen as a hazard and demolished with explosives on 15 December.

In 1976, 1995, 2018, and 2022 dry conditions caused the water level to drop and the village of Derwent to once again be exposed.In 2018, this caused unprecedented crowds to visit the rarely visible site. On 3 November 2018, a man had to be rescued by a mountain rescue team after getting stuck in extremely thick mud around the ruins of the village. On 17 November 2018 it was reported that the site had been vandalised by some of those visiting, with park rangers forced to stop visitors removing items from the site and with graffiti scrawled on some buildings.

==Potential expansion==
In Autumn 2022 Severn Trent Water announced that it was considering expanding the Ladybower, Howden, and Derwent reservoirs, or building a new reservoir in the area. There was immediate opposition to these plans, due to the potential for environmental damage to the landscape, including the loss of ancient forests.

In June 2023, the water company announced that the potential expansion would not be going ahead. They said that in response to consultation feedback the Upper Derwent Valley Reservoir Expansion scheme had been removed from their preferred plan. The scheme would be replaced by a &#x27;combination of leakage, customer demand management and accelerated supply options&#x27;.

<doc id="166487" wikidata="Q202166" url="?curid=166487" title="Ons Heemecht">
<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (formerly &quot;&#x27;&quot;, ; ) is the national anthem of Luxembourg. Written by Michel Lentz in 1859 and set to music by Jean Antoine Zinnen in 1864, it is performed at national celebrations, while the grand ducal anthem &quot;De Wilhelmus&quot; is performed at entrances or exits of members of the Grand Ducal Family.

== History ==
Luxembourgish poet Michel Lentz wrote the poem &quot;Ons Heemecht&quot; in 1859, and it was set to music by Luxembourgish composer Jean Antoine Zinnen in 1864. The song was first performed in public in Ettelbruck, a town at the confluence of the Alzette and Sauer rivers (both of which are mentioned in the song), on 5 June 1864.

&quot;Ons Heemecht&quot; competed for a while with , a song based on another poem by Lentz, for the status of the national anthem. The last line of the chorus of &quot;De Feierwon&quot; became the origin of Luxembourg&#x27;s national motto.

The first and last stanzas of &quot;Ons Heemecht&quot; were adopted as Luxembourg&#x27;s national anthem on 17 June 1993, when it was added as one of the official national emblems, alongside the national flag, the national coat of arms and the Grand Duke&#x27;s Official Birthday.

== Lyrics ==
The official version is only composed of the first and last stanzas.

<text>Vilnius International Airport () is the airport of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. It is located south of the city center. It is the largest of the three commercial airports in Lithuania by passenger traffic, with one runway and 5 million passengers a year. Vilnius International Airport serves as a base for airBaltic, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. The airport is managed by Joint Stock Company Lithuanian Airports under the Ministry of Transport and Communications. It is the 96th busiest airport in Europe.

==History==
===Early years===

The airport began operations in Second Polish Republic on 17 August 1932 as Wilno–Porubanek, Porubanek was the name of the neighbouring village which today is part of the Kirtimai district of Vilnius. Before World War II, it operated the then-domestic route between Wilno (Vilnius) and Warsaw as well as international route to Riga. Since 15 April 1939, it inaugurated a new route to Kaunas. The airport was used as a military airfield during the war. The airport resumed its activity as a civil airport as of 17 July 1944.

===Recent developments===
Lithuanian Airlines (branded later as FlyLAL) was established as the Lithuanian flag carrier following independence in 1991 and inherited the Vilnius-based Aeroflot fleet of Tupolev Tu-134, Yakovlev Yak-40, Yak-42 and Antonov An-24, An-26 aircraft, but rapidly replaced these Soviet-era aircraft types with modern Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 jets and Saab 340, Saab 2000 turboprops. Operations were suspended effective 17 January 2009 as a result of growing financial difficulties. With the collapse of flyLAL, the airport lost its scheduled services to Amsterdam, Budapest, Istanbul, Madrid and Tbilisi. flyLAL used to operate to Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Milan and Paris in competition with Aer Lingus, airBaltic or Lufthansa.

AirBaltic, the national airline of Latvia and under Scandinavian Airlines part-ownership, opened up a second base at Vilnius in 2004 to complement its Riga operation and became the largest carrier at Vilnius, using Boeing 737 jets and Fokker 50 turboprops. At one point, airBaltic operated to 19 destinations from Vilnius but, in 2009, the network covered only three destinations served by two aircraft based at Vilnius.

Vilnius Airport is the main hub for Grand Cru Airlines and a base for Wizz Air. It used to be a main hub for Star1 Airlines until their end of operations in September 2010 and Aurela until Aurela had lost its flight license. It was the hub for Small Planet Airlines and Aviavilsa until both airlines folded. The airport was a secondary hub for airBaltic, Estonian Air and Skyways Express until they closed the bases in Vilnius.

On 30 June 2013, Air Lituanica also began its flights from the Vilnius Airport and established its base there serving several European cities. However, by 22 May 2015, the airline shut down all operations as well.

The airport was closed for 35 days from 14 July 2017 to 17 August 2017 (inclusive) for runway reconstruction work, with all flights diverted to Kaunas Airport.

==Terminal==
The original terminal was built in 1934-1936 to a design by Józefa Mrówkowa-Ochmańska; Stanisław Połujan was the construction manager. The three-story building was designed in modernist style, and had a restaurant with a terrace, a hotel for passengers, a newspaper kiosk, a customs post, a police station and a post office. The building was criticized for its overly luxurious interior design and size, which was unsuitable for the small, nascent civilian air traffic in Vilnius.

The construction of the current airport building started in 1949 and completed in 1954. It features a standard 1950s Soviet airport terminal design, originally intended for an airport with up to 20 aircraft movements per day. On the outside, it is decorated with sculptures of soldiers, workers and aviators, while inside walls and ceilings feature wreaths, bay leaves and stars, and until the early 1990s, the Soviet hammer and sickle, typical decor for Soviet public buildings of early post-war years.

A new departure terminal, connected with the old building, was built in 1993. Since then, the old building has been used as the arrival terminal only.

In November 2007, the new terminal building was opened for operations which improved the capacity and facilities of the airport and complies with the requirements of the Schengen agreement. The passenger throughput of the terminal increased, passenger service quality was improved and more stringent aviation security measures were implemented. The new area of the renovated passenger terminal now reaches . It is equipped with 6 passenger boarding bridges, modern passenger check-in equipment, new travel value and duty-free shops were opened as well as business lounge and VIP Lounge.

== New departure terminal ==
Construction of a new departure terminal at Vilnius Airport started in January 2023. After the completion of this terminal, the total area of Vilnius Airport passenger terminals will increase by one third, and passenger throughput will double – from 1,200 passengers per hour to 2,400. Together with the construction of the new terminal, a redevelopment of road infrastructure is planned, including upgrades of engineering networks and a new transport scheme. The terminal was opened on February 4, 2025. with projected cost of 50.2 million euros.

==Incidents and accidents==
* Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2748, operated with Dash-8-400 (LN-RDS) with 48 passengers and 4 crew members, took off from Copenhagen Airport on 12 September 2007. It was heading to Palanga, Lithuania, but was diverted to Vilnius Airport (better suited for an emergency landing) when landing gear problems were discovered before landing. Upon touchdown, the right landing gear collapsed. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely. The local officials at the Vilnius International Airport noted that this was the most serious incident in recent years. This accident, along with the Aalborg accident just days earlier, caused all SAS Dash 8 Q400 planes to be grounded until the beginning of October of that year.
* On 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978, operated using a Boeing 737-8AS with 171 passengers on board, traveling in Belarusian airspace en route from Athens to Vilnius, was intercepted by a Belarusian MiG-29 before it could reach Lithuanian airspace. It was then forced to land at Minsk National Airport. Upon landing, the Belarusian KGB arrested two of the passengers, opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. The other passengers were allowed to reboard the plane to depart for Vilnius after seven hours.
* On 21 June 2023, the runway was closed after Brussels Airlines Flight 2372, set to fly to Brussels Airport could not take off as a landing gear tire popped while taxiing.
* On 3 February 2024, the airport was closed after Avion Express Flight 8242, landing from Milan Bergamo Airport slid off the runway upon touchdown.
* On 25 November 2024, Swiftair Flight 5960 (operated by a Boeing 737-476SF) crashed on approach to the airport, killing at least one person and injuring three.

<doc id="166492" wikidata="Q2001476" url="?curid=166492" title="Grand ducal family of Luxembourg">
<text>The grand ducal family of Luxembourg constitutes the House of Luxembourg-Nassau, headed by the sovereign grand duke, and in which the throne of the grand duchy is hereditary. It consists of heirs and descendants of the House of Nassau-Weilburg, whose sovereign territories passed cognatically from the House of Nassau to the House of Bourbon-Parma, itself a branch of the Spanish royal house which is agnatically a cadet branch of the House of Capet that originated in France, itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians and the Karlings and the founding house of the Capetian dynasty.

==History==
In 1443 the last member of the senior branch of the House of Luxemburg, Duchess Elisabeth, sold the Duchy of Luxembourg to Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, a prince of the French House of Valois. In 1477 the duchy passed by marriage of Philip&#x27;s granddaughter, Mary of Burgundy, to Archduke Maximilian I of Austria of the House of Habsburg. Luxembourg was one of the fiefdoms in the former Burgundian Netherlands which Maximilian and Mary&#x27;s grandson, Emperor Charles V, combined into an integral union, the Seventeen Provinces, by issuing the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549. The southern Netherlands remained part of the Habsburg Empire, first held by the Spanish branch and then by the Austrian line, until 1794 when French revolutionaries replaced Habsburg rule with French hegemony until the defeat of Napoleon.

Luxembourg&#x27;s territories, centering on the ancestral castle, were captured from occupying French forces in the first stages of the fall of Napoleon. Some were eventually ceded to William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange, who had been declared Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands in 1813, by his cousin King Frederick William III of Prussia who annexed other territories which had been held by princes of the various branches of the House of Nassau. The Great Powers agreed at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to re-constitute and elevate Luxembourg into a grand duchy, to be hereditary in the male line of the entire House of Nassau, beginning with the Prince of Orange, who was simultaneously but separately recognised as King of the Netherlands.

Thus William I of the Netherlands ascended the grand ducal throne as the first grand duke of Luxemburg. When the male line of the House of Orange-Nassau became extinct in 1890, the crown of the Netherlands went to his descendant, Wilhelmina of Orange-Nassau, but the crown of Luxembourg continued in the male line, devolving upon the head of the only surviving branch of the House of Nassau, ex-Duke Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg. His son, Guillaume IV (reigned 1905–1912), left no sons and was succeeded by his daughters, Marie-Adélaïde and then by Charlotte (reigned 1919–1964). Her descendants (from her marriage to Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma) comprise the Grand Ducal House in the 21st century.

==Titulature==
The monarch bears the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (subsumed in the higher style of &quot;Majesty&quot; that was borne by its sovereigns during the personal union of the grand duchy with the Kingdom of the Netherlands until 1890), to which the heir apparent is also entitled. The other male-line descendants of Grand Duke Adolphe held the titles &quot;Prince/Princess of Luxembourg&quot; and &quot;Prince/Princess of Nassau&quot;, with the style of &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot;. Until 1995, the daughters and male-line issue of Grand Duchess Charlotte also bore the title of &quot;Prince/Princess of Bourbon-Parma&quot; and were addressed as &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, in right of their descent from her consort, Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma.

On 28 July 1987, by grand ducal decree, members of the dynasty assumed the surname &quot;de Nassau&quot; and discontinued use of the princely title and inescutcheon of the House of Bourbon-Parma (the dukes of which had not consented to the marriages to commoners of the dynasts of their Luxembourg cadet branch, Prince Charles in 1967 and Hereditary Grand Duke Henri in 1981), while retaining the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

Since the grand ducal decree of 21 September 1995, dynasts who are the children of a grand duke or hereditary grand duke hold the titles &quot;Prince/Princess of Luxembourg&quot; and &quot;Prince/Princess of Nassau&quot; with the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Shortly after his accession to the throne in October 2000, Grand Duke Henri issued a grand ducal decree conferring upon his eldest son and heir, Prince Guillaume, the title of &quot;Hereditary Grand Duke&quot; and restoring to him the title &quot;Prince of Bourbon-Parma&quot;. Male line descendants of Grand Duchess Charlotte who are not the children of a grand duke or hereditary grand duke are &quot;Prince/Princess of Nassau&quot; with the style of &quot;His/Her Royal Highness&quot;.

A grand ducal decree in 2012, concerning the &quot;family pact&quot;, further defined the rules of titles borne.

The wives, children and male-line descendants of a prince of the dynasty whose marriage has not received grand ducal consent are &quot;Count/Countess de Nassau&quot;.

To date, the title of &quot;His/Her Royal Highness Prince/Princess of Bourbon-Parma&quot; has been returned to all legitimate members of the grand ducal family. Indeed, the members of the grand ducal family have never ceased to actually be members of the Royal House of Bourbon-Parma.

==Religion==
Grand Dukes Adolphe (1817–1905) and William IV (1852–1912) were Evangelical Christians. William married the Roman Catholic Marie Anne of Portugal, believing that a country in which the great majority of people were Roman Catholic should also have a Roman Catholic monarch. In 1907, William declared the Evangelical Counts of Merenberg to be non-dynastic and named his own Roman Catholic daughter, Marie-Adélaïde (1894–1924), heiress to the grand ducal throne; she in 1919 abdicated in favour of her sister, Charlotte (1896–1985), who was also Roman Catholic, and Charlotte&#x27;s Roman Catholic descendants have reigned in Luxembourg ever since.

However, although Roman Catholicism is the claimed faith of the overwhelming majority of the Luxembourgish people (ca. 90–93%), it does not have the status of a state religion, nor is there any legal or constitutional obligation for the grand duke (as head of state) to be Roman Catholic.

==Succession to the throne==

The preference for men over women in succession to Luxembourg&#x27;s throne was abandoned in favour of absolute primogeniture on 20 June 2011 by decree of Grand Duke Henri. Henceforth, any legitimate female descendant of the House of Luxembourg-Nassau born of authorized marriage shall inherit the throne by order of seniority of line of descent and of birth as stipulated in Article 3 of the Constitution and the Nassau Family Pact without regard to gender, applicable first to succession by the descendants of Grand Duke Henri. The Grand Duke&#x27;s marshal issued an addendum to the decree explaining the context of the change: pursuant to the United Nations&#x27; 1979 call for nations to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, in 2008 the grand duchy dropped the exception to gender non-discrimination it had declared in the matter of the grand ducal succession.

<text>A dividend tax is a tax imposed by a jurisdiction on dividends paid by a corporation to its shareholders (stockholders). The primary tax liability is that of the shareholder, though a tax obligation may also be imposed on the corporation in the form of a withholding tax. In some cases the withholding tax may be the extent of the tax liability in relation to the dividend. A dividend tax is in addition to any tax imposed directly on the corporation on its profits. Some jurisdictions do not tax dividends.

To avoid a dividend tax being levied, a corporation may distribute surplus funds to shareholders by way of a share buy-back. These, however, are normally treated as capital gains, but may offer tax benefits when the tax rate on capital gains is lower than the tax rate on dividends. Another potential strategy is for a corporation not to distribute surplus funds to shareholders, who benefit from an increase in the value of their shareholding. These may also be subject to capital gain rules. Some private companies may transfer funds to controlling shareholders by way of loans, whether interest-bearing or not, instead of by way of a formal dividend, but many jurisdictions have rules that tax the practice as a dividend for tax purposes, called a &quot;deemed dividend&quot;.

==History==

In the beginning of income tax history, dividends paid to shareholders were exempt from taxation, as such tax was considered a form or double taxation on money earned by companies and subject to corporate tax. 

Currently, in most jurisdictions, dividends from corporations are treated as a type of income and taxed accordingly at the individual level. Many jurisdictions have adopted special treatment of dividends, imposing a separate rate on dividends to wage income or capital gains.

Here is a brief history of dividend taxation:

* 17th century: The first dividend taxes were imposed in the 17th century in the Netherlands and England.
* 19th century: Dividend taxes became more common in the 19th century, as more countries adopted income taxes.
* United States: Dividend taxes were first imposed in the United States in 1913, with the passage of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
* 1936–1939: During the Great Depression, dividends were taxed at an individual&#x27;s income tax rate.
* 1954: The Tax Reform Act of 1954 created a separate rate for dividends, which was lower than the individual income tax rate.
* 1981: The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 further reduced the tax rate on dividends.
* 2003: The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 reduced the tax rate on dividends to 15% for most investors.
* 2013: The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) increased the tax rate on dividends to 20% for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket.

In the United States, the Revenue Act of 1913, authorized via the 16th Amendment, created a federal personal income tax of 1% with additional surtaxes of 1–5%, and exempted dividends from the general income tax but not the surtaxes which applied above the $20,000 level. This was to avoid the double taxation of income as there was a 1% corporate tax as well. After 1936, dividends were again subject to the ordinary income tax, but from 1954–1983 there were various exemptions and credits, taxing dividends at a lower rate. Following this, there was an eighteen-year period (1985-2003) in which dividends were fully taxed at an individual&#x27;s income tax bracket. During this period, the top tax bracket ranged between 28% and 50%. However, in 2003 former president George W. Bush enacted the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which changed tax rates significantly. These 2003 tax cuts created a new category of qualified dividend that was taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate instead of the ordinary income rate.

The current tax rate on dividends in the United States is 20% for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket, and 15% for taxpayers in the lower income tax brackets. There are also special rules for qualified dividends, which are dividends that are paid by companies that have met certain requirements. Qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the taxpayer&#x27;s income.

The history of dividend taxation outside the US is just as varied as it is in the US. Here is a brief overview of dividend taxation in some major countries:

* United Kingdom: In the financial year beginning 6 April 2024, dividends in the UK are taxed at a rate of 8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate taxpayers, and 39.35% for additional rate taxpayers. There is also a dividend allowance of £500 per year, which means that dividends up to £500 are tax-free. The rates have increased and the allowance reduced since 2022.
* Canada: Dividends in Canada are taxed at a rate of 50% for non-residents, and 15% for residents. There is also a dividend tax credit that can be used to reduce the amount of tax that is owed on dividends.
* Australia: Dividends in Australia are taxed at a rate of 30% for non-residents, and 15% for residents. There is also a dividend imputation system that allows shareholders to claim a credit for the taxes that the company has already paid on its profits.
* Japan: Dividends in Japan are taxed at a rate of 20% for non-residents, and 15% for residents. There is also a dividend exemption system that allows shareholders to exempt dividends from tax if they meet certain conditions.
* Germany: Dividends in Germany are taxed at a rate of 25% for non-residents, and 26.375% for residents. There is also a dividend tax credit that can be used to reduce the amount of tax that is owed on dividends.

===Collection===

In many jurisdictions, companies are subject to withhold obligations of a prescribed rate, paying this to the national revenue authorities and paying to shareholders only the balance of the dividend.

==Debate==

Taxation of dividends is controversial, based on the issues of double taxation. Depending on the jurisdiction, dividends may be treated as &quot;unearned income&quot; (like interest and collected rents) and thus liable for income tax.

===Arguments in favor===
A corporation is a legal entity separate from its shareholders with a &quot;life&quot; of its own. As a separate entity, a corporation has the right to use public goods as an individual does, and is therefore obligated to help pay for the public goods through taxes.

Professor Confidence W. Amadi of West Georgia University has argued:

Once it is established that a corporation is, for all important purposes, a separate legal entity, the issue becomes how transfers from one legal entity (corporations) to another legal entity (shareholders) should be taxed, not whether the money should be taxed. It can be argued that it is unfair and economically unproductive, to tax income generated through active work at a higher rate than income generated through less active means.

A 2022 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that a substantial increase in dividend tax rates in France led to reduced dividend payments by firms and greater re-investment of profits back into the firms. The study also found that the dividend taxes did not contribute to a misallocation of capital, but may instead have reduced a capital misallocation. The study was retracted after several inconsistencies in the data were pointed out by other researchers, some arguing that the alterations affected the results of the paper. The authors disputed that the results would have been altered.

===Arguments against===
Critics, such as the Cato Institute, argue that a dividend tax is an unfair &quot;double taxation&quot;. Cato&#x27;s position is:

Besides discussed above issues of whether taxing dividends is right and fair, a major issue is tax-induced distortions of economic incentives. For instance, quoting from: &quot;Efforts to avoid the double tax on corporate earnings have created a misallocation of investment between the corporate and non-corporate sectors and rapid growth in the use of S corporations, partnerships, and other entities that do not pay corporate income tax.&quot;

The taxpayers retain the post-tax income, while the whole pre-tax income, tax including, forms the national resources. A mismatch between the actual income as perceived by taxpayers and the taxable income distorts economic incentives by providing tempting ways to boost their difference. It promotes tax planning to maximize the post-tax income to the detriment of the pre-tax one: &quot;We have seen how preferences in the tax code cause taxpayers to devote more resources to tax-advantaged investments and activities at the expense of other more productive alternatives.&quot;

Shareholders control corporations and bear their tax burdens: &quot;Economists at both the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office assume that the burden of the corporate income tax is borne entirely by owners of capital.&quot; Both corporate tax and personal taxes on dividends and capital gains in combination reduce shareholders comprehensive income which includes the change in their stock portfolio value.

Changes of stock value are hard to legally define and timely tax. Parts of these changes have a legally recognizable source. E.g., cash earned by corporations can be taxed at the corporate level. But there are other &quot;hidden&quot; parts, e.g., when corporations gain valuable patents or see favorable markets shifts. They increase stock values but cannot be legally measured and timely taxed at the corporate level.

These parts can be realized and taxed at the shareholders level when dividends are paid or stock trade yields capital gains. However, when owners take dividends from their shares (or gains from selling them) their cash portfolio grows but the value of their stock portfolio shrinks by the same amount, resulting in no net comprehensive income. Instead, the earlier growth of stock values gets legally recognized and (belatedly) taxed. However, this also includes growth that reflects previously taxed corporate income, resulting in double taxation.

Many remedies have been discussed to reduce misallocation of investment, disincentive for trading shares and taking dividends that chills capital movement, and other distortions mentioned above. Some propose lower rates of taxes on dividends, capital gains, and corporate income or complete elimination of some of them. Others aim at a better match between undertaxed and overtaxed parts of income: &quot;Dividends and capital gains taxes have low rates but apply largely to income already taxed at the corporate level. This is widely criticized. Making dividends paid from taxed income tax-free and allowing companies to deduct capital losses (up to per-share taxed income) on share repurchase would be more consistent than lower tax rates on dividends, capital gains, and corporate income.&quot;. Broadly accepted solutions to the problem are yet to be found; the issue remains highly controversial.

==Dividend tax policy==

===OECD tax rates===
Source:

Share buy-backs are more tax-efficient than dividends when the tax rate on capital gains is lower than the tax rate on dividends.

===United States===
In 2003, President George W. Bush proposed the elimination of the U.S. dividend tax saying that &quot;double taxation is bad for our economy and falls especially hard on retired people&quot;. He also argued that while &quot;it&#x27;s fair to tax a company&#x27;s profits, it&#x27;s not fair to double-tax by taxing the shareholder on the same profits.&quot;

Soon after, Congress passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA), which included some of the cuts Bush requested and which he signed into law on May 28, 2003. Under the new law, qualified dividends are taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains, which is 15 percent for most individual taxpayers. Qualified dividends received by individuals in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets were taxed at 5% from 2003 to 2007. The qualified dividend tax rate was set to expire December 31, 2008; however, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA) extended the lower tax rate through 2010 and further cut the tax rate on qualified dividends to 0% for individuals in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets. On December 17, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010. The legislation extends for two additional years the changes enacted to the taxation of dividends in the JGTRRA and TIPRA.

In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created a new Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) of 3.8% that applies to dividends, capital gains, and several other forms of passive investment income, effective January 1, 2013. The NIIT applies to married taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $250,000, and single taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $200,000. Unlike the thresholds for ordinary income tax rates and the qualified dividend rates, the NIIT threshold is not inflation-adjusted.

Had the Bush-era federal income tax rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent brackets been allowed to expire for tax year 2012, the rates would have increased to the Clinton-era rate schedule of 15, 28, 31, 36, and 39.6 percent. In that scenario, qualified dividends would no longer be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, but would revert to being taxed at the taxpayer&#x27;s regular income tax rate. However, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (H.R. 8) was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in the first days of 2013. This legislation extended the 0 and 15 percent capital gains and dividends tax rates for taxpayers whose income does not exceed the thresholds set for the highest income tax rate (39.6 percent). Those who exceed those thresholds ($400,000 for single filers; $425,000 for heads of households; $450,000 for joint filers; $11,950 for estates and trusts) became subject to a top rate of 20 percent for capital gains and dividends.

===Canada===
In Canada, there is taxation of dividends, which is compensated by a dividend tax credit (DTC) for personal income in dividends from Canadian corporations. An increase to the DTC was announced in the fall of 2005 in conjunction with the announcement that Canadian income trusts would not become subject to dividend taxation as had been feared. Effective tax rates on dividends will now range from negative to over 30% depending on income level and different provincial tax rates and credits. Starting 2006, the Government introduced the concept of eligible dividends. Income not eligible for the Small Business Deduction and therefore taxed at higher corporate tax rates, can be distributed to the shareholders and taxed at a lower personal tax rate.

===India===
In India, earlier dividends were taxed in the hands of the recipient as any other income. However, since 1 June 1997, all domestic companies were liable to pay a &quot;dividend distribution tax&quot; on the profits distributed as dividends resulting in a smaller net dividend to the recipients. The rate of taxation alternated between 10% and 20% until the tax was abolished with effect from 31 March 2002. The dividend distribution tax was also extended to dividends distributed since 1 June 1999 by domestic mutual funds, with the rate alternating between 10% and 20% in line with the rate for companies, up to 31 March 2002. However, dividends from open-ended equity oriented funds distributed between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2002 were not taxed. Hence the dividends received from domestic companies since 1 June 1997, and domestic mutual funds since 1 June 1999, were made non-taxable in the hands of the recipients to avoid double-taxation, until 31 March 2002.

The budget for the financial year 2002–2003 proposed the removal of dividend distribution tax bringing back the regime of dividends being taxed in the hands of the recipients and the Finance Act 2002 implemented the proposal for dividends distributed since 1 April 2002. This fueled negative sentiments in the Indian stock markets causing stock prices to go down. However the next year there were wide expectations for the budget to be friendlier to the markets and the dividend distribution tax was reintroduced.

Hence the dividends received from domestic companies and mutual funds since 1 April 2003 were again made non-taxable at the hands of the recipients. However the new dividend distribution tax rate for companies was higher at 12.5%, and was increased with effect from 1 April 2007 to 15%. The Unit Trust of India converted some units to tax-free bonds. The taxation rate for mutual funds was originally 12.5% but was increased to 20% for dividends distributed to entities other than individuals with effect from 9 July 2004. With effect from 1 June 2006 all equity oriented funds were kept out of the tax net but the tax rate was increased to 25% for money market and liquid funds with effect from 1 April 2007.

Dividend income received by domestic companies until 31 March 1997 carried a deduction in computing the taxable income but the provision was removed with the advent of the dividend distribution tax. A deduction to the extent of received dividends redistributed in turn to their shareholders resurfaced briefly from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 during the time the dividend distribution tax was removed to avoid double taxation of the dividends both in the hands of the company and its shareholders but there has been no similar provision for dividend distribution tax. However the budget for 2008–2009 proposes to remove the double taxation for the specific case of dividends received by a domestic holding company (with no parent company) from a subsidiary that is in turn distributed to its shareholders. Budget 2020-2021 saw abolishment of DDT(d&quot;ividend distribution tax)&quot; and the d&quot;ividend&quot; income being taxed in the hands of investor according to income tax slab rates.

===Korea===
Korea regulates the amount of possible dividends, payment time of dividends, and how to make decisions on dividends in the commercial law, since dividends are considered an outflow of profits from the company. Currently, 15.4 percent of dividend tax is collected as soon as the dividend is paid (private : 14% of the dividend income tax, residence tax : 1.4% of the dividend income tax). Separate taxation is possible below ₩20 million(€15 thousand) of dividend income, and if it is exceed, they become subject to total taxation. In addition, if the financial income (interest, dividend income) exceeds ₩20 million, a report of total income tax must be made. In the relationship between shareholders and creditors, the main principle of the commercial law is that the rights of company creditors should take precedence over those of shareholders who have limited liability to the property of the company. Stockholders always want to receive more money, but from the firm point of view, if they allocate too much money, the reduction of equity capital could lead to the failure of the company. That&#x27;s why government regulates the possible amount of dividends.

===Other countries===
Australia, Chile and New Zealand have a dividend imputation system, which entitles shareholders to claim a tax credit for the franking credits attached to dividends, being a share of the corporate tax paid by the corporation. A recipient of a fully franked dividend on the top marginal tax rate will effectively pay only about 15% tax on the cash amount of the dividend. In effect, when distributed as dividends, the profits of a corporation are taxed at the average of the shareholders&#x27; marginal tax rates; otherwise they are taxed at the corporate tax rate.
In Armenia there hasn&#x27;t been a dividend tax until the recently adapted tax law upon which citizens of Armenia pay 5% and non-citizens 10% of the annual income.

In Finland, there is a tax of 25,5% or 27,2% on dividends (85% of dividend is taxable capital income and capital gain tax rate is 30% for capital gains lower than 30 000 and 34% for the part that exceeds 30 000). However, effective tax rates are 45.5% or 47.2% for private person. That&#x27;s because corporate earnings have already been taxed, which means that dividends are taxed twice. Corporate income tax is 20%.

There is a tax of 20% on dividends from Non-listed stocks (20% for Nation, 0% for Region).

In Luxembourg, only 50% of dividends paid out by corporations is subject to tax in the hands of an individual tax payer at the applicable marginal tax rate.

In the Netherlands there&#x27;s a tax on the assumed return on assets in general (except bank savings, for which a separate rate applies), regardless of the actual dividend, as part of the tax on savings and investments.

In Norway dividends are taxed as capital gains, at a flat 31.7% tax rate. However a &quot;shelter deduction&quot; is applied to the dividend income to compensate for the lost interest income. The size of the shelter deduction is based on the interest rate on short term government bonds and was 1.1% in 2013. For example, if NOK 100,000 has been invested in a company stock that gave a dividend of NOK 4,000, the shelter deduction is NOK 1,100 (1.1% of NOK 100,000) and the remaining NOK 2,900 is taxed at 27%.

This applies to dividends from profits relating to the calendar year 2004 onwards (regardless of when the dividends were actually paid out). Before that, dividends were taxed as normal income. The stated justification is that tax at 19 percent has already been paid by the company as part of its corporation tax (in Slovak &quot;Income Tax for a Legal Entity&quot;). However, there is no provision for residents to reclaim tax on dividends withheld in other jurisdictions with which Slovakia has a double-taxation treaty. Foreign resident owners of shares in Slovak companies may have to declare and pay tax in their local jurisdiction. Shares of profits made by investment funds are taxable as income at 19 percent.

<doc id="166497" wikidata="Q45321045" url="?curid=166497" title="Tejanos">
<text>Tejanos ( , ) are descendants of Texas Creoles and Mestizos who settled in Texas before its admission as an American state. The term is also sometimes applied to Texans of Mexican descent.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Tejano&quot;, with a &quot;J&quot; instead of &quot;X&quot;, comes from the Spanish interpretation of the original Caddo indigenous word &quot;Tayshas&quot;, which means &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;ally&quot;.

===Texas Creoles===
In colonial Texas, the term &quot;Creole&quot; (&quot;criollo&quot;) distinguished Old World Africans and Europeans from their descendants born in the New world, Creoles, who were the citizens of New Spain&#x27;s Tejas province.

Texas Creole culture revolved around &quot;ranchos&quot; (Tejano ranches), attended mostly by &quot;vaqueros&quot; (cowboys) of African, Spaniard, or Mestizo descent who established a number of settlements in southeastern Texas and western Louisiana (e.g. Los Adaes).

Black Texas Creoles have been present in Texas since the 17th century and served as soldiers in Spanish garrisons of eastern Texas. Generations of Black Texas Creoles, also known as &quot;Black Tejanos,&quot; played a role in later phases of Texas history during Mexican Texas, the Republic of Texas, and American Texas.

==History==

===Spanish government and Mexican Texas===

As early as 1519, Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed the area that is now Texas for Spain. The Spanish monarchy paid little attention to the province until 1685. That year, the Crown learned of a French colony in the region and worried that it might threaten Spanish colonial mines and shipping routes. King Charles II sent ten expeditions to find the French colony, but they were unsuccessful. Between 1690 and 1693, expeditions were made to the Texas region and acquired better knowledge of it for the provincial government and the settlers, who came later.

Tejano settlements developed in three distinct regions: the northern Nacogdoches region, the Bexar–Goliad region along the San Antonio River, and the frontier between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, an area used largely for ranching. Those populations shared certain characteristics, yet they were independent of one another. The main unifying factor was their shared responsibility for defending the northern frontier of New Spain. Some of the first settlers were Isleños from the Canary Islands. Their families were among the first to reside at the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar in 1731, which is modern-day San Antonio, Texas.

Ranching was a major activity in the Bexar-Goliad area, which consisted of a belt of ranches that extended along the San Antonio River between Bexar (San Antonio area) and Goliad. The Nacogdoches settlement was located farther north and east. Tejanos from Nacogdoches traded with the French and Anglo residents of Louisiana and were culturally influenced by them. The third settlement was located north of the Rio Grande, toward the Nueces River. Its ranchers were citizens of Spanish origin from Tamaulipas, in what is now northern Mexico, and they identified with Spanish Criollo culture.

On September 16, 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest, launched the Mexican War of Independence with the issuing of his Grito de Dolores, or “Cry of Delores.” He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and civilians. The troops ran up into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops; most of Hidalgo&#x27;s troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calderón Bridge.

Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara, a supporter in independence from Spain, organized a revolutionary army with José Menchaca, who was from the Villa de San Fernando de Bejar. After Hidalgo&#x27;s defeat and execution, Gutiérrez traveled to Washington, DC, to request help from the United States. He requested an audience with President James Madison but was refused. He met with Secretary of State James Monroe, who was busy planning the invasion of Canada in the War of 1812. On December 10, 1810, Gutiérrez addressed the US House of Representatives. There was no official help by the US government to the revolution. However, Gutiérrez returned with financial help, weapons, and almost 700 US Army veterans.

Gutiérrez&#x27;s army would defeat the Spanish Army and the first independent Republic of Texas, &quot;the Green Republic&quot; was born with the Declaration of Independence. Spain had reinforced its armies in the colonies, and a well-equipped army led by General Juaquin de Arredondo known as the &quot;El Carnicero,&quot; invaded the Green Republic of Tejas. During the time of the Republic, the Spaniard José Álvarez de Toledo y Dubois had been undermining Gutiérrez de Lara&#x27;s government. Toledo was successful, and Gutiérrez was ousted. Toledo then led the Republican Army of the North (the Green Army) into a trap against the Spanish Army, and no prisoners were taken by the Spanish at the Battle of Medina. The Spanish Army marched into San Antonio, rounded up everyone it could find from Nacogdoches to El Espiritu de Santo (Goliad), and brought them to San Antonio. The Spanish killed four males a day for 270 days, eradicated the Tejano population, and left the women when they left in 1814. Toledo returned to Spain, a Spanish hero.

In January 1840, the northern Mexican states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas seceded from Mexico to establish the Republic of the Rio Grande, with its capital in what is now Laredo, Texas, but they became part of Mexico again in November 1840.

===Republic of Texas===
By 1821, at the end of the Mexican War of Independence, about 4,000 Tejanos lived in Mexican Texas, alongside a lesser number of foreign settlers. In addition, several thousand New Mexicans lived in the areas of Paso del Norte (now El Paso, Texas) and Nuevo Santander, incorporating Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley.

During the 1820s, many settlers from the United States and other nations moved to Mexican Texas, mostly in the eastern area. The passage of the General Colonization Law, encouraged immigration by granting the immigrants citizenship if they declared loyalty to Mexico. By 1830, the 30,000 recent settlers in Texas, who were primarily Englishspeakers from the United States, outnumbered the Hispanos Tejano six to one.

The Texians and Tejano alike rebelled against attempts by the government to centralize authority in Mexico City and other measures implemented by President Antonio López de Santa Anna. Tensions between the central Mexican government and the settlers eventually resulted in the Texas Revolution.

===20th century===
In 1915, insurgents in South Texas wrote a manifesto that was circulated in the town of San Diego and all across the region. The manifesto &quot;Plan de San Diego&quot; called on Mexicans, American Indians, Blacks, Germans, and Japanese to liberate south Texas and kill their racist white American oppressors. Numerous cross-border raids, murders, and sabotage took place. Some Tejanos strongly repudiated the plan. According to Benjamin H. Johnson, middle-class Mexicans who were born in the United States and desired affirming their loyalty to the country founded the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). It was headed by professionals, business leaders, and progressives and became the main Tejano organization promoting civic pride and civil rights.

Other sources attribute the founding of the organization in 1929 largely to Tejano veterans of World War I, who wanted to improve civil rights for Mexican-American citizens of the United States. They were socially discriminated against in Texas. Only American citizens were admitted as members to LULAC, and there was an emphasis on people becoming educated and assimilated to advance in society.

In 1963, Tejanos in Crystal City organized politically and won elections; their candidates dominated the city government and the school board. Their activism signaled the emergence of modern Tejano politics. In 1969–70, a different Tejano coalition, the La Raza Unida Party, came to office in Crystal City. The new leader was José Ángel Gutiérrez, a radical nationalist who worked to form a Chicano nationalist movement across the Southwest in 1969 to 1979. He promoted cultural terminology (&quot;Chicano, Aztlan&quot;) designed to unite the militants; but his movement split into competing factions in the late 1970s.

==Demographics==
Most Tejanos are concentrated in southern Texas, in historic areas of Spanish colonial settlement and closer to the border that developed. The city of San Antonio is the historic center of Tejano culture. During the Spanish colonial period of Texas, most colonial settlers of northern New Spain – including Texas, northern Mexico, and the American Southwest – were descendants of Spaniards.

Although the number of Tejanos whose families have lived in Texas since before 1836 is unknown, it was estimated that 5,000 Tejano descendants of San Antonio&#x27;s Canarian founders lived in the city in 2008. The community of Canarian descent still maintains the culture of their ancestors.

Tejanos may identify as being of Mexican, Chicano, Mexican American, Spanish, Hispano, American and/or Indigenous ancestry. In urban areas, as well as some rural communities, Tejanos tend to be well integrated into both the Hispanic and mainstream American cultures. Especially among younger generations, a number identify more with the mainstream and may understand little or no Spanish.

Most of the people whose ancestors colonized Texas and the northern Mexican states during the Spanish colonial period identified with the Spaniards, Criollos, or Mestizos who were born in the colony. Many of the latter find their history and identity in the history of Spain, Mesoamerica and the history of the United States. Spain&#x27;s colonial provinces (Spanish Texas and Spanish Louisiana) participated on the side of the rebels in the American Revolutionary War.

===Ethnic and national origins===

In the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS) data,
 Tejanos are defined as those Texans descended from colonists of the Spanish colonial period (before 1821), or descended from Indigenous Spanish Mexicans, and indigenous Mexicans.

==Culture==

===Music===

Genuine Tejano music is descended from a mixture of German and Czechoslovak polka and oom papa sounds and Mexican Spanish strings, and is similar to the French folk music of Louisiana, known as &quot;Cajun music&quot;, blended with the sounds of rock and roll, R&amp;B, pop, and country, and with Mexican influences such as conjunto music. Narciso Martinez is the father of Conjunto Music, followed by the legendary Santiago Jimenez (Father of Flaco Jimenez).

Sunny and the Sunglows lead the rock and roll era in the 1950s along with Little Joe, and Rudy Guerra, who were originators of the rock and roll portion of genre. Today, Tejano music is a wide array of multicultural genres including rockteno and Tejano rap. The American cowboy culture and music was born from the meeting of the European-American Texians, Indigenous people, colonists mostly from the American South, and the original Tejano pioneers and their &quot;vaquero,&quot; or &quot;cowboy&quot; culture.

===Food===
The cuisine that would come to be known as &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; originated with the Tejanos. It developed from Spanish and North American indigenous commodities with influences from Mexican cuisine.

Tex-Mex cuisine is characterized by its widespread use of melted cheese, meat (particularly beef), peppers, beans, and spices, in addition to corn or flour tortillas. Chili con carne, burritos, carne asada, chalupa, chili con queso, enchiladas, and fajitas are all Tex-Mex specialties. A common feature of Tex-Mex is the combination plate, with several of the above on one large platter. Serving tortilla chips and a hot sauce or salsa as an appetizer is also a Tex-Mex development. &quot;Cabrito&quot;, &quot;barbacoa&quot;, &quot;carne seca&quot;, and other products of cattle culture have been common in the ranching cultures of South Texas and northern Mexico. In the 20th century, Tex-Mex took on Americanized elements such as yellow cheese, as goods from the rest of the United States became cheap and readily available. Tex-Mex has imported flavors from other spicy cuisines, such as the use of cumin. Cumin is often referred to by its Spanish name, &quot;comino.&quot;

A common Tex-Mex breakfast dish served is a &quot;breakfast taco&quot; and usually consists of a flour tortilla or corn tortilla served using a single fold. That is in contrast to the burrito-style method of completely encasing the ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients used are a combination of eggs, potatoes, cheese, peppers, bacon, sausage, and barbacoa. Breakfast tacos are traditionally served with an optional red or green salsa.

== Politics ==
Historically, the majority of the Tejano population in South Texas had voted for Democrats since the first half of the 20th century. The 2020 United States presidential election was considered a turning point in their political support, as part of a &quot;red tide&quot; for South Texas, where Republican candidate Donald Trump performed better in areas associated with Tejano population than during former elections. Zapata was the only county that turned majority Republican from Democratic in South Texas, while Starr County saw the strongest pro-Trump swing of any county in the U.S., a 55% increase compared to the 2016 election.

Tejanos are noted to be more supportive of the Republican Party than other Latino populations in Texas. Politically, Tejanos have been compared to Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans, who also disproportionately vote for Republican candidates among Latino voters. &quot;The New York Times&quot; attributed the relative success of Donald Trump among the Tejano community to concerns about regional economy, which is based on gas and oil. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described concerns about possible unemployment caused by COVID-19 lockdowns as another source of Republican Tejano support. Reporter Jack Herrera argues that Tejanos are culturally conservative and identify with Republican positions on gun rights, Christianity, and abortion. Also Tejanos are more likely to be Evangelical Protestants than Roman Catholics, the latter denomination in which most Latinos across the US identify as being part of.

<text>Robert Joseph Shea (February 14, 1933 – March 10, 1994) was an American novelist and former journalist best known as co-author with Robert Anton Wilson of the science fantasy trilogy &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; It became a cult success and was later turned into a marathon-length stage show put on at the British National Theatre and elsewhere. In 1986 it won the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award. Shea went on to write several action novels based in exotic historical settings.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Joseph Shea was born in New York City. He attended high school at Manhattan Prep (Manhattan College High School) in Riverdale, the Bronx. After graduation, he attended Manhattan College and Rutgers University.

== Career and other works==
Apart from co-authoring &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; with Wilson, Shea wrote several historical action novels, including &quot;Shike&quot; (1981), a two-volume novel set in Ancient Japan about the warrior monk Jebu and his love Lady Shima Taniko, &quot;All Things Are Lights&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Saracen&quot;, a novel published in two volumes in 1989 depicting the struggle between a blond Muslim warrior called Daoud ibn Abdullah and his French crusader adversary, Simon de Gobignon. His last published book was the Native American tale &quot;Shaman&quot; (1991).

&quot;All Things Are Lights&quot; and the outline for the unfinished novel &quot;Children of Earthmaker&quot; have been released under a Creative Commons license and are available to read and copy at Robert Shea&#x27;s website. &quot;Lady Yang&quot; was finished but never published; a Creative Commons online version is in the works by Shea&#x27;s son Michael.

Three of his lectures and two panel discussions he participated in were recorded when he was a featured speaker at both the Starwood Festival and the WinterStar Symposium (both with and without Robert Anton Wilson) and produced by the Association for Consciousness Exploration.

For several years, Shea edited the anarchist zine &quot;No Governor&quot;. The title comes from a quote attributed to Zhuangzi, &quot;There is no governor anywhere.&quot; The zine was mentioned in, and read by, one of the characters in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;.

== Tributes ==
&quot;Clipped from the Robert J. Shea Tribute page:&quot;

<text>The Khanty (), also known in older literature as Ostyaks (), are a Ugric Indigenous people, living in Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug, a region historically known as &quot;Yugra&quot; in Russia, together with the Mansi. In the autonomous okrug, the Khanty and Mansi languages are given co-official status with Russian. In the 2021 Census, 31,467 persons identified themselves as Khanty. Of those, 30,242 were resident in Tyumen Oblast, of whom 19,568 were living in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and 9,985—in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. 495 were residents of neighbouring Tomsk Oblast, and 109 lived in Sverdlovsk Oblast.

== Ethnonym ==
Since the Khanty language has about 10 dialects which can be united in 3 main branches, there are several slightly different words used by these people to describe themselves:
*&quot;Khanti, Khante&quot; (in North)
*&quot;Khande&quot; (in South)
*&quot;Kantek, Kantakh&quot; (in East)
All these words mean &#x27;human&#x27;. They also call themselves &quot;As Khoyat&quot; which means &#x27;Obian people&#x27; or &#x27;people from Ob&#x27;.

== History ==
In the second millennium BC, the territories between the Kama and the Irtysh Rivers were the home of a Proto-Uralic-speaking population that had contacts with Proto-Indo-European speakers from the south. The woodland population is the ancestor of the modern Ugrian inhabitants of Trans-Uralia. Other researchers say that the Khanty people originated in the south Ural steppe and moved northwards into their current location about 500 AD.

Khanty probably appear in Russian records under the name Yugra (ca. 11th century), when they had contact with Novgorodian hunters and merchants. The name of Yugra derives from Komi-Zyrian word &quot;jögra&quot; (&#x27;Khanty&#x27;). The older Russian name Ostyak is from Khanty &quot;as-kho&quot; &#x27;person from the Ob (&quot;as&quot;) River,&#x27; with -&quot;yak&quot; after other ethnic terms like &quot;Permyak&quot;.

Some Khanty princedoms were partially included in the Siberia Khanate from the 1440s–1570s.

In the 11th century, Yugra was actually a term for numerous tribes, each having its own centre and its own chief. Every tribe had two exogamic phratries, termed &quot;mon&#x27;t″&quot; and &quot;por&quot;, and all members were considered to be blood relatives. This structure was later replaced with clans, where each clan leader (&quot;knyazets&quot;) negotiated with the Russian realm. They also participated in Russian campaigns, and received the right to collect &quot;yasaq&quot; (tribute) from two Khanty &quot;volosts&quot; (districts) respectively. When this structure was no longer needed, Russia deprived them of their privileges.

After the Russian conquest of Siberia, Russians attempted to Christianize the Khanty. Russian missionaries and officials instructed that idols be destroyed, mass baptisms be performed, and harsh punishment for those that disobeyed the church. Russian officials also took Khanty children as hostages and converted them to Christianity. Conversions were generally superficial in nature and motivated by economic incentives. As a consequence, the Khanty continued to incorporate native practices and beliefs into their spirituality.

During the Soviet period the Khanty were one of the few indigenous minorities of Siberia to be granted an autonomy in the form of an okrug (autonomous district). The establishment of autonomy has played a considerable role in consolidation of the ethnos (the Western Khants called their eastern neighbours &quot;Kantõk&quot; [the Other People]). However, in the 1930s concerted efforts were made by the Soviet state to collectivise them. The initial stages of this meant the execution of tribal chiefs, who were labelled &quot;kulaks&quot;, followed by the execution of shamans. The abduction by the state of the children who were sent to Russian-speaking boarding schools provoked a national revolt in 1933 called the Kazym rebellion.

After the end of the Stalin period this process was relaxed and efforts were intensified in the 1980s and 1990s to protect their common territory from industrial expansion of various ministries and agencies. The autonomy has also played a major role in preserving the traditional culture and language.

== Organisation ==
The Khanty are one of the indigenous minorities in Siberia with an autonomy in the form of an okrug (autonomous area).

== Culture ==
The Khanty share many cultural similarities with the Mansi people. Together they are called Ob-Ugric peoples.

=== Economy and livelihood ===
The Khantys&#x27; traditional occupations were fishery, taiga hunting and reindeer herding. They lived as trappers, thus gathering was of major importance.

During the winter, the Khanty lived in stationary huts made out of dirt and branches at permanent villages. During the spring, the Khanty moved towards hunting and fishing grounds, where they constructed temporary rectangular-shaped shelters out of birch-bark and poles.

Weapons utilized by the Khanty were advanced for the period and included longbows, arrows, spears, and the use of iron helmets and chain mail.

=== Religion ===

Most Khanty are today Orthodox Christians, mixed with traditional beliefs (shamans, reincarnation). Their historical shaman wore no special clothes except a cap. Traditional Khanty cults are closely related to nature. The Crow spring celebration is being celebrated in April, nowadays it is April 7, the same day as the Annunciation day. The Bear Celebration is being celebrated occasionally after a successful hunting of a bear. The Bear Celebration continues 5 or 6 days (the duration depends on the sex of the animal). Over 300 songs and performances occur during a Bear Celebration. The most important parts of the celebration are:
* Nukh Kiltatty Ar (The Awakening Song) 
* Ily Vukhalty Ar (The Coming Down From The Sky Song) - The story about the son of Torum (the sky god). The son was sent by Torum to rule the Earth. He has forgotten father&#x27;s advice, lost his immortality, turned into a beast and has been killed by the hunters. 
* Il Veltatty Ar (The Lullaby)

=== Oral and written literature ===
In addition to bear songs, fairy tales and other stories, Khanty folklore includes epic poetry. It shares similar themes with the mythical and heroic stories told by the Mansi people.

The Khanty&#x27;s written literature had its beginnings in the first half of the 20th century. The first notable Khanty writer was , best known for his novel &quot;Sorneng tow&quot;.

=== Media ===
&#x27; is a Khanty-language newspaper that was founded in 1957. Another Khanty-language newspaper is &#x27;, founded in 2001.

== Language ==

The Khanty language is part of the Ugric branch of the Uralic languages, and thus most closely related to Mansi and Hungarian.

The Khanty language and people are studied through .

== Genetics ==

80 percent of Khanty men carry the haplogroup N. 48.8 percent of them belong to its subgroup N1c and 31.4 percent belong to the subclade N-P43. Other haplotypes include R1b (10.5 %) and R1a (5.8 %).

The most common mtDNA haplogroup among the Khantys is U (28.3 %). 16.5 percent of Khanty women belong to its subgroup U4, 5.7 percent to subgroup U7, 5.4 percent to subgroup U5, and the subclades U2 and U1 are found with frequencies of less than one percent. Other maternal haplogroups include H (17.3 %), J (13.1 %), D (11.6 %) and C (10.4 %).

An estimated 61 percent of the Khanty&#x27;s autosomal DNA is Nganasan-like Siberian and the rest is West Eurasian.

<doc id="166501" wikidata="Q332385" url="?curid=166501" title="Geoff Hoon">
<text>Geoffrey William Hoon (born 6 December 1953) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire from 1992 to 2010. He is a former Defence Secretary, Transport Secretary, Leader of the House of Commons and Government Chief Whip.

He had previously been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Derbyshire from 1984 to 1994.

==Early life==
Hoon was born in Derby, England, and is the son of railwayman Ernest Hoon and June Collett. He was privately educated at Nottingham High School, an independent school. He then read law at Jesus College, Cambridge from which he graduated in 1976. He was a lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of Leeds from 1976 to 1982 and was a sub-warden at Devonshire Hall. He was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1978, and was also a visiting Law Professor at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, from 1979 to 1980. In 1982, Hoon became a practising barrister in Nottingham.

==Member of Parliament==
Hoon was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Derbyshire in 1984 and served in Brussels and Strasbourg for ten years. In 1988, he drafted a report for the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Legal Affairs in favour of prohibiting dual membership of the European Parliament and national parliaments, subsequently approved by the Parliament and enacted as of the 2004 European elections. Ironically, Hoon himself became a dual-mandate member for two years, after being elected to the House of Commons in 1992 and only standing down from the European Parliament at the 1994 elections.

He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election for Ashfield, making his maiden speech on 20 May 1992, following the retirement of the sitting Labour MP, Frank Haynes. He held the seat with a majority of 12,987 and remained as the MP until the 2010 general election.

Towards the end of his political career, Hoon acquired the irreverent nickname Buff (&quot;Buffoon&quot;) as the result of a joke told by fellow Labour Party colleague Peter Kilfoyle.

==Shadow Cabinet and early government posts==
In Parliament, Hoon was promoted by Tony Blair in 1994 when he was appointed as an opposition whip, and in 1995 he joined the frontbench team as a spokesman on Trade and Industry. Following the 1997 general election he became a member of the government of Tony Blair as the Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, being promoted to the rank of Minister of State in the same department in 1998.

In 1999, Hoon was briefly a minister at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for Asia, the Pacific, Middle East and North Africa. He entered the cabinet later in the year as the Secretary of State for Defence, at which time he became a member of the Privy Council. He served as the Lord Privy Seal and the Leader of the House of Commons from the 2005 general election until 5 May 2006, when he was appointed as Minister for Europe.

==Secretary of State for Defence==

On 11 October 1999 Hoon was appointed Secretary of State for Defence. His term took him through the 2000 British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War and the NATO intervention in the 2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia. The rest of his term was dominated by the start of the War on terror in 2001, including British participation in both the War in Afghanistan, Operation Herrick, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Operation Telic.

Asserting the importance of deterrence, in a 2003 interview on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot;, Hoon asserted that the UK was willing to use nuclear weapons against Iraqi forces &quot;in the right circumstances, namely in extreme self defence.&quot;

On 23 June 2003, Hoon, following a detailed briefing given to the United Nations by US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, continued to claim that two trailers found in Iraq were mobile weapons laboratories. This was in spite of the fact that it had been leaked to the press by David Kelly and other weapons inspectors that they were nothing of the sort. The trailers were for filling hydrogen balloons for artillery ranging and were sold to Iraq by a British company, Marconi.

In an April 2004 interview, Hoon said that more could have been done to help Kelly, who committed suicide on 17 July 2003 after being named as the source of Andrew Gilligan&#x27;s disputed &quot;Today&quot; programme contribution.

Hoon gave evidence about the Iraq war both to the 2003 Hutton Inquiry during his term, and later on 19 January 2010 gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry about his time as Defence Secretary.

===Comments on cluster bombs===
Shortly after the US/UK led invasion of Iraq began in 2003, following an admission by the Ministry of Defence that Britain had dropped 50 airborne cluster bombs in the south of Iraq and left behind up to 800 unexploded bomblets, it was put to Hoon in a Radio 4 interview that an Iraqi mother of a child killed by these cluster bombs would not thank the British Army. He replied &quot;One day they might.&quot; Hoon continued, &quot;I accept that in the short term the consequences are terrible. No one minimises those and I&#x27;m not seeking to do so,&quot; he said. &quot;But what I am saying is that this is a country that has been brutalised for decades by this appalling regime and that the restoration of that country to its own people, the possibility of their deciding for themselves their future ... and indeed the way in which they go about their lives, ultimately, yes, that will be a better place for people in Iraq.&quot;

===HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; comments===
In 1998, Canada purchased four &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarines and a suite of trainers from the Royal Navy to replace their decommissioned &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines. The &quot;Upholder&quot; class entered Royal Navy service from 1990 to 1993 at the end of the Cold War, and were deemed surplus as part of the Peace Dividend and refocus on a nuclear submarine fleet. They were placed into storage until Canada purchased them.

On 5 October 2004 HMCS &quot;Chicoutimi&quot;, sailing from Faslane Naval Base to Nova Scotia, declared an emergency northwest of Ireland following a fire on board. The fire was caused by seawater entering through open hatches in rough seas; an inquiry established later that this was an &quot;incorrect operating procedure&quot;. It soaked electrical insulation (which had not been sufficiently waterproofed since it conformed to an older specification than the three other submarines), starting a fire. The &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; lost power and wallowed in the seas NW of Ireland. An Irish Naval vessel was damaged by the heavy seas when trying to get to the &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; but another the LÉ &quot;Aoife&quot; was able to reach her and took over from British Royal Navy frigates HMS &quot;Montrose&quot; and &quot;Marlborough&quot; as the scene coordinator on the 6th of October. Three crewmen were airlifted to Sligo General Hospital in Ireland where Lt(N) Chris Saunders died subsequently from the effects of smoke inhalation.

Following claims made in the Canadian media about the cause of the fire, blaming the UK for supplying an unsafe vessel, Hoon accompanied his condolences for Saunders by stating that Canada would be charged for the rescue and stating that Canada as the buyer had to beware. In Canada, many World War II veterans were outraged by his comments, considering Canada&#x27;s sacrifice for Britain during both World Wars.

===Comments on Extraordinary Rendition===
Hoon was criticised by an international delegation of European MPs for evading questions about Britain&#x27;s co-operation with the CIA&#x27;s so-called &#x27;extraordinary rendition&#x27; programme, even though he knew nothing about the programme. Hoon, then Minister for Europe, was being quizzed in the wake of Dick Marty&#x27;s Council of Europe report which found extensive involvement of European countries, including Britain, in the US kidnapping and torture programme.

==Secretary of State for Transport==
In the reshuffle after the sudden resignation of the Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, during the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Hoon became the Secretary of State for Transport on 3 October 2008. His former role as Labour Chief Whip was given to Nick Brown.

In January 2009, Hoon gave the official go-ahead for the controversial expansion of Heathrow Airport. Later that same year, Transport Secretary Hoon oversaw the launch of the vehicle scrappage scheme; which was intended to encourage motorists to scrap their older, more polluting vehicles for a discount off a more modern, more environmentally friendly newer car from participating companies.

==Backbench MP==
Hoon resigned from his post as Transport Secretary on 5 June 2009 during a Cabinet reshuffle, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family.
On 6 January 2010, he and fellow ex-minister Patricia Hewitt jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of the leadership of Gordon Brown. The following day, he said that it appeared to have failed and was &quot;over&quot;. Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a &quot;form of silliness&quot;. After the failed coup there was a backlash against Hoon which flowed over into his Ashfield constituency in Nottinghamshire where some Labour party members wanted to deselect him.

During the Iraq Inquiry, Hoon said that the first he knew of the 45-minute Iraq weapon claim was when he read it in the dossier on Iraq&#x27;s weapons in September 2002.

Hoon had said that he would defend his seat at the 2010 general election but according to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; he had &quot;finally bowed to pressure&quot; and on 11 February 2010, he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election.
After his retirement from politics he helped to set up a consultancy firm &quot;TaylorHoon Strategy&quot;. He is now Managing Director of International Business at helicopter-maker AgustaWestland.

==Expense claims==
In April 2009, it emerged that Hoon had rented out his London home and claimed expenses on his constituency house, as approved by the Fees Office of the House of Commons. For security reasons he was required to live in state-owned accommodation at Admiralty House. Whilst this was rent free it involved significant costs. He made clear that he had only claimed what he was entitled to under the rules of the House of Commons.

==Dispatches lobbyist investigation==
 Hoon was one of the MPs named in the 2010 sting operation on political lobbying by the Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme. Hoon told an undercover reporter that he wanted to translate his knowledge and contacts into something that &quot;frankly makes money&quot;. On 22 March 2010 it was announced he had been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party, alongside Patricia Hewitt and Stephen Byers.

On 9 December 2010, Hoon, along with Stephen Byers and Richard Caborn were banned from having an ex-members pass. The Standards and Privileges Committee banned Hoon for a minimum five years as his was the most serious breach, whilst Byers received two years and Caborn six months.

<text>The Phi Beta Kappa Society () is the oldest academic honor society in the United States. It was founded at the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia, in December 1776. Phi Beta Kappa aims to promote and advocate excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and to induct outstanding students of arts and sciences at select American colleges and universities. Since its inception, its inducted members include 17 United States presidents, 42 United States Supreme Court justices, and 136 Nobel laureates. 

==History==
===Origins===

The Phi Beta Kappa Society had its first meeting on December 5, 1776, at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia by five students, with John Heath as its first President. The society established the precedent for naming American college societies after the initial letters of a secret Greek motto.

The group consisted of students who frequented the Raleigh Tavern as a common meeting area off the college campus. A persistent story maintains that a Masonic lodge also met at this tavern, but the Freemasons gathered at a different building in Williamsburg. (Some of the original members of Phi Beta Kappa did become Freemasons, but later in life).

Whether the students organized to meet more freely and discuss non-academic topics, or to discuss politics in a Revolutionary society is unknown. The earliest records indicate only that the students met to debate and engage in oratory, and on topics that would have been not far removed from the curriculum. In the Phi Beta Kappa Initiation of 1779, the new member was informed,
: &quot;here then you may for a while disengage yourself from scholastic cares and communicate without reserve whatever reflections you have made upon various objects; remembering that everything transacted within this room is transacted &quot;sub rosa&quot;, ... here, too, you are to indulge in matters of speculation that freedom of inquiry which ever dispels the clouds of falsehood by the radiant sunshine of truth...&quot;.

===Latin letter fraternal societies===
Older fraternal societies existed at College of William &amp; Mary. The F.H.C. Society (nicknamed &quot;the Flat Hat Club&quot;), founded in 1750, is the first collegiate secret society recorded in North America; unlike the newer Phi Beta Kappa, the F.H.C. was a Latin-letter society, its name taken from the initial letters of a Latin motto (perhaps ).

A second Latin-letter fraternity at William &amp; Mary, the P.D.A. Society, was publicly known as &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. John Heath, chief organizer of the Phi Beta Kappa, according to tradition earlier sought but was refused admission to the P.D.A., though he may instead have disdained to join it (much later, his friend and fellow student William Short wrote that the P.D.A. &quot;had lost all reputation for letters, and was noted only for the dissipation &amp; conviviality of its members&quot;).

===Secret fraternal society===
The new society was intended to be &quot;purely of domestic manufacture, without any connection whatever with anything European, either English or German.&quot; The founders of Phi Beta Kappa declared that the society was formed for congeniality and to promote good fellowship, with &quot;friendship as its basis and benevolence and literature as its pillars.&quot; Before the British attempt at reclamation of the sovereign American colonies, including Virginia, there was a temporary closure of the College of William &amp; Mary and disbandment of Phi Beta Kappa in early 1781. Elisha Parmelee, an alumnus of Yale College and Harvard College, passed through Williamsburg and took charters from the Phi Beta Kappa to establish branches of the society at these schools. A second chapter was founded at Yale College in late 1780; a third, at Harvard College in 1781; and a fourth, at Dartmouth College in 1787.

Phi Beta Kappa was a secret society to protect its members and to instil a sense of solidarity. The new society was given the motto, or in Latin letters &quot;&quot;, which loosely translated to English means &quot;Love of learning is the guide of life&quot;. Greek was chosen because it was the language of science in Roman times. Later, in May 1777, a new sign of recognition was devised: &quot;A salutation of the clasp of the hands, together with an immediate stroke across the mouth with the back of the same hand, and a return with the hand used by the saluted&quot;. This new complex of gestures was created to allow the mutual recognition of members &quot;in any foreign country or place.&quot;

===Transition to academic honor society===
Further chapters appeared at Union College in 1817, Bowdoin College in 1825, and Brown University in 1830. The original chapter at William &amp; Mary was re-established. In 1831, the Harvard chapter publicly disclosed the fraternity&#x27;s secrets during a period of strong anti-Masonic sentiment. The first chapter established after Phi Beta Kappa became an &quot;open&quot; society was that at Trinity College in Connecticut, in 1845. University of Alabama established in 1851. In the pre-Civil War period, Society chapters frequently sponsored addresses by distinguished speakers. Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s 1837 address at Harvard, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, is the best-known of those addresses, but there were dozens of others at schools such as Bowdoin, Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, Union, and Yale.

As the first collegiate organization of its type to adopt a Greek-letter name, the Phi Beta Kappa is generally considered a forerunner of modern college fraternities as well as the model for later collegiate honorary societies. Ironically, it was partly the rise of true &quot;social&quot; fraternities modeled after Phi Beta Kappa later in the nineteenth century which obviated the social aspects of membership in the organization, transforming it into the honorary society it is today. By 1883, when the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa were established, there were 25 chapters. The first women were elected to the Society at the University of Vermont in 1875, and the first African-American member, George Washington Henderson, was elected at the same institution two years later. In 1885, however, Phi Beta Kappa eliminated those majoring in engineering from eligibility. This practice continues today. 

Each chapter is designated by its state and a Greek letter indicating its position in the order in which that state&#x27;s chapters were founded. For example, Alpha of Pennsylvania refers to the chapter at Dickinson College, founded in 1887; Beta of Pennsylvania, the chapter at Lehigh University (founded later that same year); Gamma of Pennsylvania, the chapter at Lafayette College (1890); and Delta of Pennsylvania, the chapter at the University of Pennsylvania (1892). By 1920, a total of 89 chapters existed at a variety of schools. Phi Beta Kappa was one of six honor societies that co-founded the ACHS on . Its participation was short-lived, with the decision to withdraw and operate again as an independent society made just over a decade later, effective .

=== Post-war era ===
In the 1960s, Vanderbilt University professor Donald Davidson claimed that Phi Beta Kappa was under the influence of Communists. In 1988, the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa officially changed its name to &quot;The Phi Beta Kappa Society&quot;, recalling the name under which the organization had been established in 1776. 

In 1996, Emily Bernstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported declining rates of Phi Beta Kappa membership acceptances at the University of Connecticut due to a decrease in social prestige. Citing an article by &quot;The Key Reporter&quot;, Bernstein claims that this is due in part to increasing numbers of &#x27;first-generation college students, students who do not consult their parents on such matters, and students who have gone to public schools, all of whom are less likely to have heard of the society. Earlier, in 1970, Robert Reinhold similarly reported for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that recipient students at the University of California at Berkeley expressed a mix of distaste and shame about the degree. Other members expressed a lack of satisfaction with the society for its significance.

A 1997 article from The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education critiqued the society for under-representation at historically black colleges and universities. The authors wrote that &quot;Only 3 of the nation&#x27;s 100 black colleges and universities are members of &quot;Phi&quot; &quot;Beta&quot; &quot;Kappa&quot;&quot; due to a rule that 10 faculty members at a university must be existing members, for which Black faculty would be socially disadvantaged due to a historic lack of admittance into relevant universities. Additionally, they created a list of &quot;Predominantly White But Second- or Third-Tier Colleges and Universities That Have Been Awarded &quot;Phi&quot; &quot;Beta&quot; &quot;Kappa&quot; Chapters,&quot; which included Allegheny College and Millsaps College.

Today, Phi Beta Kappa participates in a more loosely coordinated lobbying association of four of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious honor societies, called the Honor Society Caucus. Its members include Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi, and Omicron Delta Kappa.

==Symbols==

The symbol of the Phi Beta Kappa Society is a golden key engraved on the obverse with the image of a pointing finger, three stars, and the Greek letters from which the society takes its name. On the reverse are found the initials &quot;SP&quot; in the script. One official historian of the society, William T. Hastings, and some others believe that the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;P&quot;, which stood for &quot;Societas Philosophiae&quot;, &quot;Philosophical Society&quot;, were the original name of the Society and that &quot;Phi Beta Kappa&quot; came only over time to be taken as the name of the society. The heading on the original list of members states, &quot;A List of the members, who have been initiated into the S.P. alias Phi Beta Kappa Society.&quot;

The &quot;key&quot; of Phi Beta Kappa did not begin as a copy of a watch key. The first insignia was a larger, cut-and-engraved silver medallion, essentially a square of metal with a loop cut integrally with the body of the square from the same sheet of silver, to allow for suspension from one or two ribbons worn around the member&#x27;s neck in the manner in which the older fraternities (and the Masonic bodies on which the collegiate societies were in part patterned) wore their insignia. Later, the size of the medallion was reduced and men took to wearing the insignia on their watch chains as fobs.

Though several stylistic details have survived since the earliest days—the use of the stars, pointing hand, and Greek letters on the obverse, for example—notable differences exist between older keys and current examples. The name of the recipient was not engraved on the earliest fobs or keys and was not until the first decade of the nineteenth century. The name of the school from which the fob or key came was also not routinely included on the earliest models, and sometimes the only way to trace a key to a particular school&#x27;s chapter is by researching the name of the recipient against surviving class records. 

The number of stars on the obverse has also changed over the years, with never fewer than three, but on some known examples with as many as a dozen (the explanation as to the meaning of the stars in these early cases varies from chapter to chapter). Also, the date of the awarding of the honor is only seen on keys from the second quarter of the nineteenth century onward (some people mistake the date that appears on the fob or key—December 5, 1776—as the date that a particular fob or key was awarded, when in fact it is merely the date of the founding of the society). Only in 1912 was the key made to a uniform standard of size, golden appearance (some are plated), and engraving with the school&#x27;s name, recipient&#x27;s name, and date of the award.

== Activities ==

=== Publications ===
The Phi Beta Kappa Society publishes &quot;The Key Reporter&quot;, a newsletter distributed quarterly to all contributing members and biannually to all other members, and &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, a quarterly subscription-based journal that accepts essays on literature, history, science, public affairs, and culture.

=== Awards and fellowships ===
The Phi Beta Kappa Book Awards are the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award, the Christian Gauss Award (named for Christian Gauss), and the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science. The Book Awards are given annually to outstanding scholarly books published in the United States. Winning works, which are drawn from the fields of the humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and mathematics, must be of broad interest and accessible to the general reader. Each award carries a $10,000 prize. The winners were selected from five short-listed titles in each category.

The Dr. Martin R. Lebowitz and Eve Lewellis Lebowitz Prize for Philosophical Achievement and Contribution is awarded by the Phi Beta Kappa Society in conjunction with the American Philosophical Association. The associated Lebowitz Symposium is presented annually at a divisional meeting of the American Philosophical Association. The prize was established in 2013 by Eve Lewellis Lebowitz in honor of her late husband, Martin R. Lebowitz, to provide significant, tangible recognition for excellence in philosophical thought. The Symposium program consists of a pair of lectures to be delivered at an annual APA division meeting and a Phi Beta Kappa event. The topic of the lectures should be an important philosophical issue of current interest, and the lectures should offer contrasting (not necessarily opposing) views on that topic. Honoraria for the symposiasts are funded at an adjusted rate based on the current size of the endowment. Previous winners have won as much as $25,000 each.

The Mary Isabel Sibley Fellowship is awarded annually, alternating in the fields of Greek and French. The award may be used for the study of Greek language, literature, history, or archaeology, or the study of French language or literature. Established in 1934 by Isabelle Stone (ΦΒΚ, Wellesley College) in honor of her mother, Mary Isabel Sibley, the fellowship was designed to reward the women in these two fields of study with the experience of studying and living abroad, which Miss Stone did in Greece during her studies. The fellowship carries a stipend of $20,000.

The Walter J. Jensen Fellowship for French Language, Literature, and Culture aims to help educators and researchers improve education in standard French language, literature, and culture and in the study of standard French in the United States. Established in 2001 by Professor Walter J. Jensen (ΦΒΚ, UCLA), the fellowship is awarded for at least six continuous months of study in France and carries a stipend originally set in 1995 at $10,000, to be adjusted for inflation. The stipend for 2016 was $15,500. The Romanell-Phi Beta Kappa Professorship is awarded annually to scholars in the field of philosophy, without restriction to any one school of philosophical thought. The professorship recognizes not only distinguished achievement but also the recipient&#x27;s contribution or potential contribution to public understanding of philosophy.

=== Programs ===
Since 1956, the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program has offered undergraduates the opportunity to spend time with some of America&#x27;s most distinguished scholars. The purpose of the program is to contribute to the intellectual life of the campus by making possible an exchange of ideas between the Visiting Scholars and the resident faculty and students. Phi Beta Kappa also sponsors a National Arts &amp; Sciences Initiative, which taps into its cross-country network of members, chapters, and associations to connect with leaders, shares the value of the arts and sciences through all of life, and advocate for policies that strengthen an arts and sciences education.

== Membership ==
Phi Beta Kappa has chapters in only about 10% of American higher learning institutions, and only about 10% of these schools&#x27; Arts and Sciences graduates are invited to join. Although most students are elected in their senior year, many colleges elect a limited number of extremely select students in their junior year, generally less than 2% of the class. Some chapters also elect graduate students graduating with Master&#x27;s or Doctoral degrees who have exceptional academic records. Each chapter sets its academic standards, but all inductees must have studied the liberal arts and sciences, demonstrated &quot;good moral character&quot;, and, usually, earned grades placing them in the top tenth of their class. However, at least one school, Princeton University, includes Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) students in Phi Beta Kappa. There is a mandatory initiation fee (between $50 and $95, as of 2005), which is sometimes covered by the inductee&#x27;s university. Membership in Phi Beta Kappa is typically limited to students with very high grade point averages (GPAs), at least 3.8 out of a 4.0 scale. In 2001, a quorum of PBK alumni voted to raise the GPA cutoff: though all chapters set their standards for induction, they were now instructed to be much more selective in terms of GPA. Since its inception, 17 U.S. Presidents, 42 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and more than 136 Nobel Laureates have been inducted members.

== Chapters ==

Phi Beta Kappa has 293 chapters. Chapters are approved at the Triennial Conventions.

==Honors==
In 2008, the Phi Beta Kappa Society was awarded the Arts and Sciences Advocacy Award from the Council of Colleges of Arts and Sciences (CCAS). CCAS bestows this award upon an individual or organization demonstrating exemplary advocacy for the arts and sciences, flowing from a deep commitment to the intrinsic worth of liberal arts education.

<text>A string trio is a group of three string instruments or a piece written for such a group. From at least the 19th century on, the term &quot;string trio&quot; with otherwise unspecified instrumentation normally refers to the combination violin, viola and cello. The classical string trio emerged during the mid-18th century and later expanded into four subgenres: the grand trio, the concertant trio, the brilliant trio, and the Hausmusik trio.

==Early history==
The earliest string trio, found during the mid 18th century, consisted of two violins and a cello, a grouping which had grown out of the Baroque trio sonata. Over the course of the late 18th century, the string trio scored for violin, viola, and cello came to be the predominant type. String trios scored for two violins and viola were also used, although much less frequently. The term &quot;string trio&quot; was not used until the late 19th century. The genre was previously referred to as &quot;divertimento a tre&quot;, &quot;sonate a tre&quot;, and &quot;terzetto&quot;. French composers sometimes used &quot;Trietti&quot; or &quot;Conversazioni a tré&quot; to name their trios. The early classical string trio generally consisted of three movements, although four, five and six movement trios were later written. Most movements were in binary form, although some of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s trios were written as theme and variations. The violins shared the important thematic material, while the cello maintained an accompanimental role.

== Later history ==
During the mid to late 18th century, a couple of developments occurred in the genre. The changes included the absence of a figured bass, the equal treatment of all voices (as opposed to the top voice dominating the musical texture), and the use of sonata form in the first movement. These early developments paved the way for the genre to further expand into four specific types: the grand trio, the concertant trio, the brilliant trio, and the Hausmusik trio.

=== Grand trio ===
The grand trio was a product of South Germany and Austria. It was modeled after the mid to late 18th century serenade and nocturne. One of the best-known examples that legitimized the grand trio is Mozart’s Divertimento in E-flat, K. 563. Inspired by the piece, Beethoven set out to write String Trio in E-flat, Op. 3.

=== Concertant trio ===
The concertant trio was created in France, consists of two movements, and all three voices are used equally in the texture. The first movement is usually in binary or sonata form. Giuseppe Cambini was the leading composer of the genre. Some of his works include &quot;3 trios concertants pour violon alto et violoncelle&quot;, Op. 2 and &quot;6 trios concertants pour Deux Violons et Basse&quot;, Op. 18.

=== Brilliant trio ===
The brilliant trio became the most popular string trio in France in the 19th century due to its virtuosic passages featured in the first violin part. The trio consists of three movements, organized in a fast-slow-fast pattern, and the first movement is written in sonata form. The first composer to use &quot;brilliant&quot; in the genre was Rudolph Kreutzer in his pieces &quot;3 Trios brillants&quot;, Op. 15 and Op. 16.

=== Hausmusik trio ===
The Hausmusik trio was intended for amateurs and student musicians. It was regarded as a pedagogical tool intended as preparation for the grand trio, the brilliant trio, and the string quartet. Some examples of the Hausmusik trio include &quot;6 Trios progressives&quot;, Op. 28 by Franz Anton Hoffmeister and &quot;3 Trios faciles et progressives&quot;, Op. 43 by Franz Alexander Pössinger.

<doc id="166510" wikidata="Q219910" url="?curid=166510" title="Pierre Boulle">
<text>Pierre François Marie Louis Boulle (20 February 1912 – 30 January 1994) was a French author. He is best known for two works, &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; (1952) and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1963), that were both made into award-winning films.

Boulle was an engineer serving as a secret agent with the Free French in Singapore, when he was captured and subjected to two years&#x27; forced labour. He used these experiences in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, about the notorious Death Railway, which became an international bestseller. The film, named &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, by David Lean won seven Academy Awards (including Best Adapted Screenplay), and Boulle was credited with writing the screenplay, because its two actual screenwriters had been blacklisted.

His science-fiction novel &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, in which intelligent apes gain mastery over humans, developed into a media franchise spanning over 55 years that includes ten films, two television series, comic books and popular themed merchandise.

==Life and career==
Born in Avignon, France, Pierre Boulle was baptised and raised as a Catholic, although later in life he became an agnostic. He studied at the prestigious &quot;École supérieure d&#x27;électricité&quot; (Supélec) where he received an degree in engineering in 1933. From 1936 to 1939, he worked as a technician at SOCFIN rubber plantations in Malaya. Boulle met a Frenchwoman at a dinner held at his supervisor&#x27;s residence, The White Palace, who was separated from her husband. She was soon to become the love of his life, to whom he would write tender love letters. She later chose to return to her husband, an official in French Indochina. During World War II she and her husband escaped into Malaya, but one of her children died in the process. Boulle would later meet her after the war, and they enjoyed a platonic friendship.

At the outbreak of World War II, Boulle enlisted with the French army in Indochina. After German troops occupied France, he became a supporter of Charles de Gaulle and joined the Free French Mission in Singapore. Boulle served as a secret agent under the name Peter John Rule and was sent on a mission to help resistance movements in China, Burma, and French Indochina. In 1943, he was captured by Vichy France loyalists on the Mekong River and was subjected to forced labour. Two years later, Boulle managed to escape from Saigon, and joined Force 136 of the Special Operations Executive in Calcutta.

Boulle was later made a &quot;chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur and decorated with the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance. He described his war experiences in the non-fiction &quot;My Own River Kwai&quot;. After the war he kept in touch with his war comrades for the rest of his life.

After the war, Boulle returned to work for a while in the plantations of SOCFIN in Malaya, in 1949 he moved back to Paris and began to write, drawing from his memories of Malaya and Indochina. While in Paris, too poor to afford his own flat, he lived in a hotel until his recently widowed sister, Madeleine Perrusset, allowed him to move into her large apartment. She had a daughter, Françoise, whom Pierre helped raise, but plans for him to officially adopt the girl never materialized.

==&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;==

While in Paris, Boulle used his war experiences in writing &quot;Le Pont de la rivière Kwaï&quot; (1952; &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;), which became a multi-million-copy worldwide bestseller, winning the French &quot;Prix Sainte-Beuve&quot;. The book was a semi-fictional story based on the real plight of Allied POWs forced to build a railway that passed over the bridge, and which became known as the &quot;Death Railway&quot;. 16,000 prisoners and 100,000 Asian conscripts died during construction of the line. His character of Lt-Col. Nicholson was not based on the real Allied senior officer at the Kwai bridges, Philip Toosey, but was reportedly an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers. Both the book and film outraged former prisoners because Toosey did not collaborate with the enemy, unlike the fictional Colonel Nicholson. Boulle outlined the reasoning which led him to conceive the character of Nicholson in an interview which forms part of the 1969 BBC2 documentary &quot;Return to the River Kwai&quot; made by former POW John Coast. A transcript of the interview and the documentary as a whole can be found in the new edition of John Coast&#x27;s book &quot;Railroad of Death&quot;.

David Lean made the book into a motion picture that won seven 1957 Academy Awards, including the Best Picture, and Best Actor for Alec Guinness. Boulle himself won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay despite not having written the screenplay and, by his own admission, not even speaking English. Boulle had been credited with the screenplay because the film&#x27;s actual screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, had been blacklisted as communist sympathizers. Boulle was neither a socialist nor a communist. The Motion Picture Academy added Foreman&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s names to the award in 1984.

Kim Novak accepted the Oscar on behalf of Pierre Boulle.

==&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;==

In 1963, following several other reasonably successful novels, Boulle published his other famous novel, &quot;La planète des singes&quot;, translated in 1964 as &quot;Monkey Planet&quot; by Xan Fielding, and later re-issued as &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. With inspiration drawn from observing the wildlife from his years in the plantations in Malaya, the book was highly praised and given such reviews as this example from England&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper: &quot;Classic science fiction ... full of suspense and satirical intelligence.&quot; In the year 2500, a group of astronauts, including journalist Ulysse Mérou, voyage to a planet in the star system of Betelgeuse. They land to discover a bizarre world where intelligent apes are the Master Race and humans are reduced to savages: caged in zoos, used in laboratory experiments and hunted for sport. The story focuses on Ulysse&#x27;s capture, his struggle to survive, and the shattering climax as he returns to Earth and a horrific final discovery. The novel is also a wry parable on science, evolution, and the relationship between man and animal.

In 1968, the book was made into an Oscar-winning film, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starring Charlton Heston. The screenplay, originally written by Rod Serling, focused more on action and deviated in many ways from the novel, including the addition of its own classic twist ending that was different from the novel&#x27;s. It inspired four sequels, a television series, an animated series, a 2001 remake of the original title by Tim Burton, and a 2011 reboot, &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, directed by Rupert Wyatt.

The five films of the original series (1968–1973) have become cult classics. Boulle, who had thought his novel to be unfilmable, was taken by surprise at the worldwide success and impact of the film. He wrote a script for a sequel titled &quot;Planet of the Men&quot;, but the producers of the original film turned it down. The second film, &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, which came out in 1970, was also very successful. It was followed by &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1971, &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1972, and &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 1973.

In September 1973, the original film was first aired on network television. The marketing of toys and other products relating to the film series skyrocketed at this time, creating an &#x27;Apemania&#x27; craze. In June 1974, Marvel Comics also released a magazine based on the novel and film called &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. By September 1974, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; had become a television series. In 1975, an animated &quot;Return to the Planet of the Apes&quot; series was shown on television.

==Other adaptations==
The French film &quot;Le Point de mire&quot;, based on Boulle&#x27;s novel &quot;Le Photographe&quot;, was released in 1977. There have also been TV films based on Boulle&#x27;s novels &quot;William Conrad&quot; in 1958 (US) and 1973 (France), &quot;La Face&quot; in 1959 (US) and 1966 (West Germany), and &quot;Un Métier de Seigneur&quot; in 1986 (France), as well as the short story &quot;Le Miracle&quot; (from &quot;E=mc2&quot;) in 1985 (US).

Another film adaptation is in production for Boulle&#x27;s &quot;A Noble Profession&quot; (&quot;Un Métier de Seigneur&quot;), a spy thriller partly based on Boulle&#x27;s real-life experience working as a secret agent during the Second World War. The movie is being produced by Tessa Bell and Andrea Chung.

==Death==
Boulle died in Paris, on 30 January 1994, at the age of 81.

<doc id="166514" wikidata="Q11156" url="?curid=166514" title="Antonin Scalia">
<text>Antonin Gregory Scalia (March 11, 1936 – February 13, 2016) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 until his death in 2016. He was described as the intellectual anchor for the originalist and textualist position in the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s conservative wing. For catalyzing an originalist and textualist movement in American law, he has been described as one of the most influential jurists of the twentieth century, and one of the most important justices in the history of the Supreme Court. Scalia was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018, and the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University was named in his honor.

Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey. A devout Catholic, he attended the Jesuit Xavier High School before receiving his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University. Scalia went on to graduate from Harvard Law School and spent six years at Jones Day before becoming a law professor at the University of Virginia. In the early 1970s, he served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, eventually becoming an assistant attorney general under President Gerald Ford. He spent most of the Carter years teaching at the University of Chicago, where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling Federalist Society. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Scalia as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Four years later, Reagan appointed him to the Supreme Court, where Scalia became its first Italian-American justice following a unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate 98–0.

Scalia espoused a conservative jurisprudence and ideology, advocating textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation. He peppered his colleagues with &quot;Ninograms&quot; (memos named for his nickname, &quot;Nino&quot;) intending to persuade them to his point of view. He was a strong defender of the powers of the executive branch and believed that the U.S. Constitution permitted the death penalty and did not guarantee the right to either abortion or same-sex marriage. Furthermore, Scalia viewed affirmative action and other policies that afforded special protected status to minority groups as unconstitutional. Such positions would earn him a reputation as one of the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court&#x27;s majority—sometimes scathingly so.

Scalia&#x27;s most significant opinions include his lone dissent in &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot; (arguing against the constitutionality of an Independent-Counsel law), and his majority opinions in &quot;Crawford v. Washington&quot; (defining a criminal defendant&#x27;s confrontation right under the Sixth Amendment) and &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; (holding that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees an individual right to handgun ownership).
==Early life and education==
Scalia was born on March 11, 1936, in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the only child of Salvatore Eugenio &quot;Eugene&quot; Scalia (1903–1986), an Italian immigrant from Sommatino, Sicily. Salvatore graduated from Rutgers University and was a graduate student at Columbia University and clerk at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. The elder Scalia would become a professor of Romance languages at Brooklyn College, where he was an adherent to the formalist New Criticism school of literary theory. Scalia&#x27;s mother, Catherine Louise (; 1905–1985), was born in Trenton to Italian immigrant parents and worked as an elementary school teacher.

In 1939, Scalia and his family moved to Elmhurst, Queens, where he attended P.S. 13 Clement C. Moore School. After completing eighth grade, he obtained an academic scholarship to Xavier High School, a Jesuit military school in Manhattan, from which he graduated ranked first in his class in 1953. Scalia achieved a 97.5 average at Xavier, earning decorations in Latin, Greek, and debate, among other subjects, in addition to being a distinguished member of its Glee club. He later reflected that he spent much of his time on schoolwork and admitted, &quot;I was never cool.&quot;

While a youth, Scalia was also active as a Boy Scout and was part of the Scouts&#x27; national honor society, the Order of the Arrow. Classmate and future New York State official William Stern remembered Scalia in his high school days: &quot;This kid was a conservative when he was 17 years old. An archconservative Catholic. He could have been a member of the Curia. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above everybody else.&quot;

In 1953, Scalia enrolled at Georgetown University, where he majored in history. He became a champion collegiate debater in Georgetown&#x27;s Philodemic Society and a critically praised thespian. He took his junior year abroad in Switzerland at the University of Fribourg. Scalia graduated from Georgetown in 1957 as class valedictorian with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. Scalia then went to Harvard Law School, where he was a notes editor for the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. He graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Laws, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, among the top of the class. During his time at Harvard, Scalia was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship, which allowed him to travel abroad in Europe during 1960 and 1961.

==Early legal career (1961–1982)==

Scalia began his legal career at the law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis (now Jones Day) in Cleveland, Ohio, where he worked from 1961 to 1967. He was highly regarded at the law firm and would most likely have been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He left Jones Day in 1967 to become a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, moving his family to Charlottesville.

After four years in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President Richard Nixon appointed him general counsel for the Office of Telecommunications Policy, where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon&#x27;s resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.

In the aftermath of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged in a number of conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act&#x27;s scope. Scalia&#x27;s view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, &quot;Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba&quot;. Scalia, on behalf of the U.S. government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.
Following Ford&#x27;s defeat by President Jimmy Carter, Scalia worked for several months at the American Enterprise Institute.

He then returned to academia, taking up residence at the University of Chicago Law School from 1977 to 1982, though he spent one year as a visiting professor at Stanford Law School. During Scalia&#x27;s time at Chicago, Peter H. Russell hired him on behalf of the Canadian government to write a report on how the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for the McDonald Commission, which was investigating abuses by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report—finished in 1979—encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP. In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago&#x27;s chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society.

==U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1982–1986)==
When Ronald Reagan was elected president in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of solicitor general of the United States, but the position went to Rex E. Lee, to Scalia&#x27;s great disappointment. Scalia was offered a judgeship on the Chicago-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the more influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which he accepted. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.

On the D.C. Circuit, Scalia built a conservative record while winning applause in legal circles for powerful, witty legal writing which was often critical of the Supreme Court precedents he felt bound as a lower-court judge to follow. Scalia&#x27;s opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials, who, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;liked virtually everything they saw and ... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect&quot;.

==Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States (1986)==
In 1986, Chief Justice Warren Burger informed the White House of his intent to retire. Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice William Rehnquist to become Chief Justice. That choice meant that Reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist&#x27;s seat as associate justice. Attorney General Edwin Meese, who advised Reagan on the choice, seriously considered only Scalia and Robert Bork, a fellow judge on the DC Circuit. Feeling that this might well be Reagan&#x27;s last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice, the president and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork. Many factors influenced the decision. Reagan wanted to appoint the first Italian-American justice. In addition, Scalia was nine years younger and would likely serve longer on the Court. Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork&#x27;s &quot;paper trail&quot;; the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights. Scalia was called to the White House and accepted Reagan&#x27;s nomination.

When Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Scalia&#x27;s nomination opened in August 1986, he faced a committee that had just argued divisively over the Rehnquist nomination. Witnesses and Democratic senators contended that before becoming a judge, Rehnquist had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting. Committee members had little taste for a second battle over Scalia and were in any event reluctant to oppose the first Italian-American Supreme Court nominee. The judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights. Scalia, who attended the hearing with his wife and nine children seated behind him, found time for a humorous exchange with Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), whom he had defeated in a tennis match in, as the nominee put it, &quot;a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment&quot;.

Scalia met no opposition from the committee. The Senate debated Scalia&#x27;s nomination only briefly, confirming him 98–0 on September 17, thereby making him the Court&#x27;s first Italian-American Justice. That vote followed Rehnquist&#x27;s confirmation as Chief Justice by a vote of 65–33 on the same day. Scalia took his seat on September 26, 1986. One committee member, Senator and future President Joe Biden (D-DE), later stated that he regretted not having opposed Scalia &quot;because he was so effective&quot;.

===Governmental structure and powers===

====Separation of powers====

It was Scalia&#x27;s view that clear lines of separation among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow directly from the Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch. In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful—and solitary—dissent in &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot; (1988), in which the Court&#x27;s majority upheld the Independent Counsel law. Scalia&#x27;s thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content; Blackmun felt &quot;it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming&quot;. Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, &quot;Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep&#x27;s clothing ... But this wolf comes as a wolf&quot;.

The 1989 case of &quot;Mistretta v. United States&quot; challenged the United States Sentencing Commission, an independent body within the judicial branch whose members (some of whom were federal judges) were removable only for good cause. The petitioner argued that the arrangement violated the separation of powers and that the United States Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the commission were invalid. Eight justices joined in the majority opinion written by Blackmun, upholding the Guidelines as constitutional. Scalia dissented, stating that the issuance of the Guidelines was a lawmaking function that Congress could not delegate and dubbed the Commission &quot;a sort of junior-varsity Congress&quot;.

In 1996, Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the president to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs what the president is permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate the separation of powers. He argued that authorizing the president to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.

====Detainee cases====

In 2004, in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;, the Court held that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions brought by detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. Scalia accused the majority of &quot;spring[ing] a trap on the Executive&quot; by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at Guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had the authority to hear cases involving people there.

Scalia, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, also dissented in the 2004 case of &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;, involving Yaser Hamdi, an American citizen detained in the United States on the allegation he was an enemy combatant. The Court held that although Congress had authorized Hamdi&#x27;s detention, Fifth Amendment due process guarantees giving a citizen such as Hamdi held in the United States as an enemy combatant the right to contest that detention before a neutral decision maker. Scalia opined that the AUMF (Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) could not be read to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and that the Court, faced with legislation by Congress that did not grant the president power to detain Hamdi, was trying to &quot;Make Everything Come Out Right&quot;.

In March 2006, Scalia gave a talk at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. When asked about detainee rights, he responded: &quot;Give me a break ... I had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son, and I&#x27;m not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it&#x27;s crazy&quot;. Although Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, supposed driver to Osama bin Laden, who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan&#x27;s position asked Scalia to recuse himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan&#x27;s claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan&#x27;s petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction-stripping Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.

====Federalism====

In federalism cases pitting the powers of the federal government against those of the states, Scalia often took the states&#x27; positions. In 1997, the Supreme Court considered the case of &quot;Printz v. United States&quot;, a challenge to certain provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties. In &quot;Printz&quot;, Scalia wrote the Court&#x27;s majority decision. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provision that imposed those duties as violating the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the states and to the people those powers not granted to the federal government. In 2005, Scalia concurred in &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, which read the Commerce Clause to hold that Congress could ban the use of marijuana even when states approve its use for medicinal purposes. Scalia opined that the Commerce Clause, together with the Necessary and Proper Clause, permitted the regulation. In addition, Scalia felt that Congress may regulate intrastate activities if doing so is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. He based that decision on &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot;, which he now wrote &quot;expanded the Commerce Clause beyond all reason&quot;.

Scalia rejected the existence of the negative Commerce Clause doctrine, calling it &quot;a judicial fraud&quot;.

Scalia took a broad view of the Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain lawsuits against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in &quot;Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.&quot;, Scalia stated that there was no intent on the part of the framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot;, came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia&#x27;s constitutional views, suggests that the justice&#x27;s view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.

===Individual rights===

====Abortion====
Scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion and that if the people desire legalized abortion, a law should be passed to accomplish it. In his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, Scalia wrote:
Scalia repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down &quot;Roe&quot; in the 1989 case of &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; but was not successful in doing so. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor cast the deciding vote, allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand but not overruling &quot;Roe&quot;. Scalia concurred only in part, writing, &quot;Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s assertion, that a &#x27;fundamental rule of judicial restraint&#x27; requires us to avoid reconsidering &quot;Roe&quot; cannot be taken seriously&quot;. He noted, &quot;We can now look forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public, and the streets full of demonstrators&quot;.

The Court returned to the issue of abortion in the 2000 case of &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the &quot;Stenberg&quot; case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: &quot;I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court&#x27;s jurisprudence beside &quot;Korematsu&quot; and &quot;Dred Scott&quot;. The method of killing a human child ... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion&quot;.

In 2007, the Court upheld a federal statute banning partial-birth abortion in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia&#x27;s, criticized &quot;Gonzales&quot;, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices in the majority were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to such an extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.

====Race, gender, and sexual orientation====
Scalia generally voted to strike down laws that make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court&#x27;s judgment in &quot;City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.&quot;, in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion for the Court, holding that states and localities could institute race-based programs if they identified past discrimination and if the programs were designed to remedy the past racism. Five years later, in &quot;Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña&quot;, he concurred in the Court&#x27;s judgment and in part with the opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences:

In the 2003 case of &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, involving racial preferences in the University of Michigan&#x27;s law school, Scalia mocked the Court majority&#x27;s finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions to promote diversity and to increase &quot;cross-racial understanding&quot;. Scalia noted:
Scalia argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to intermediate scrutiny, requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives. When, in 1996, the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the Virginia Military Institute in the case of &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;, Scalia filed a lone, lengthy dissent. Scalia said that the Court, in requiring Virginia to show an &quot;extremely persuasive justification&quot; for the single-sex admission policy, had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way &quot;that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny&quot;.

In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; that &quot;homosexual sodomy&quot; was not protected by the right of privacy and could be criminally prosecuted by the states. In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, that forbade antidiscrimination laws&#x27; being extended to sexual orientation. Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that &quot;Bowers&quot; had protected the right of the states to pass such measures and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law. Scalia later said of &quot;Romer&quot;, &quot;And the Supreme Court said, &#x27;Yes, it is unconstitutional.&#x27; On the basis of—I don&#x27;t know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably. And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Bowers&quot; was formally overruled by &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his survey of the Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state&#x27;s argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia &quot;ridiculed&quot; the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside &quot;Bowers&quot; when many of the same justices had refused to overturn &quot;Roe&quot; in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;. In March 2009, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a &quot;homophobe&quot;. Maureen Dowd described Scalia in a 2003 column as &quot;Archie Bunker in a high-backed chair&quot;. In an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall called Scalia&#x27;s positions on homosexuality radical and characterized Scalia&#x27;s &quot;political ideal as verg[ing] on majoritarian theocracy&quot;. Former Scalia clerk Ed Whelan called this &quot;a smear and a distraction.&quot; Professor John O. McGinnis responded as well, leading to further exchanges.

In the 2013 case of &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;, which involved a California ballot initiative known as Proposition 8 that amended the California State Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, Scalia voted with the majority to uphold a lower court decision overturning the ban. The decision was based on the appellants&#x27; lack of standing to appeal and not on the substantive issue of the constitutionality of Proposition 8.

Also in 2013, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;. In &quot;Windsor&quot;, the Court held Section Three of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (which—for federal government purposes—defined the terms &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot; as applicable only to opposite-sex unions) unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Scalia&#x27;s dissent, which was joined in full by Justice Thomas and in part by Chief Justice Roberts, opened:
Scalia argued that the judgment effectively characterized opponents of same-sex marriage as &quot;enemies of the human race&quot;: He argued that the Court&#x27;s ruling would affect state bans on same-sex marriage as well:
Scalia concluded by saying that the Supreme Court &quot;has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat.&quot;In 2015, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, in which the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry was guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissent, Scalia stated that the Court&#x27;s decision effectively robbed the people of &quot;the freedom to govern themselves&quot;, noting that a rigorous debate on same-sex marriage had been taking place and that—by deciding the issue nationwide—the democratic process had been halted. Addressing the claimed Fourteenth Amendment violation, Scalia asserted that because a same-sex marriage ban would not have been considered unconstitutional at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s adoption, such bans are not unconstitutional in 2015. He claimed there was &quot;no basis&quot; for the Court to strike down legislation that the Fourteenth Amendment did not expressly forbid, and directly attacked the majority opinion for &quot;lacking even a thin veneer of law&quot;. Lastly, Scalia faulted the actual writing in the opinion for &quot;diminish[ing] this Court&#x27;s reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis&quot; and for &quot;descend[ing] from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.&quot;

====Criminal law====

Scalia believed the death penalty to be constitutional. He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense. In &quot;Thompson v. Oklahoma&quot; (1988), he dissented from the Court&#x27;s ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at the time of the offense, and the following year authored the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Stanford v. Kentucky&quot;, sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16. However, in 2005, the Court overturned &quot;Stanford&quot; in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot;, and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority&#x27;s claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while underage, noting that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers. He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was &quot;rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car. Of course they don&#x27;t like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue&quot;. In 2002, in &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot;, the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to mentally retarded people. Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute mildly mentally retarded people at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice.

Scalia strongly disfavored the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been advised of their rights was inadmissible in court, and he voted to overrule &quot;Miranda&quot; in the 2000 case of &quot;Dickerson v. United States&quot; but was in a minority of two with Justice Clarence Thomas. Calling the &quot;Miranda&quot; decision a &quot;milestone of judicial overreaching&quot;, Scalia stated that the Court should not fear to correct its mistakes.

Although, in many areas, Scalia&#x27;s approach was unfavorable to criminal defendants, he took the side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts&quot;, holding that defendants must have the opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.

Scalia maintained that every element of an offense that helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment&#x27;s jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of &quot;Apprendi v. New Jersey&quot;, Scalia wrote a concurrence to the Court&#x27;s majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot;, striking down Washington state&#x27;s sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in &quot;Blakely&quot; foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in &quot;Mistretta&quot;), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in &quot;United States v. Booker&quot;, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).

In the 2001 case of &quot;Kyllo v. United States&quot;, Scalia wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion in a 5–4 decision that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court&#x27;s 1991 decision in &quot;County of Riverside v. McLaughlin&quot;, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, &quot;R.A.V. v. St. Paul&quot;, Scalia wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, &quot;Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone&#x27;s front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire&quot;.

====Second Amendment====
In 2008, the Court considered a challenge to the gun laws in the District of Columbia. Scalia wrote the majority opinion in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, which found an individual right to own a firearm under the Second Amendment. Scalia traced the word &quot;militia&quot;, found in the Second Amendment, as it would have been understood at the time of its ratification, stating that it then meant &quot;the body of all citizens&quot;. The Court upheld Heller&#x27;s claim to own a firearm in the District.

Scalia&#x27;s opinion for the &quot;Heller&quot; Court was criticized by liberals and applauded by conservatives. Seventh Circuit judge Richard Posner disagreed with Scalia&#x27;s opinion, stating that the Second Amendment &quot;creates no right to the private possession of guns&quot;. Posner called Scalia&#x27;s opinion &quot;faux originalism&quot; and a &quot;historicizing glaze on personal values and policy preferences&quot;. In October 2008, Scalia stated that the court&#x27;s originalists needed to show only that at the time the Second Amendment was ratified, the right to bear arms did not have an exclusively military context and that they were successful in so showing.

====Litigation and standing====
Following the death of Scalia, Paul Barrett, writing for &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, reported that: &quot;Translating into liberal argot: Scalia changed the rules for who could sue&quot;. The issue elevated the recognition of Scalia as a notable influence on establishing and determining the conditions under which cases could be brought to trial and for litigation—and by whom such litigation could take place. David Rivkin, from the conservative standpoint, said, &quot;He (Scalia) did more to clarify and limit the bounds and scope of judicial power than any Supreme Court Justice in history, particularly in the area of standing and class actions&quot;. Scalia indicated his long-held position from the time of his 1983 law review article titled &quot;The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers&quot;. As summarized by Barrett, &quot;He (Scalia) wrote that courts had misappropriated authority from other branches of government by allowing too many people to sue corporations and government agencies, especially in environmental cases&quot;. In a practical sense, Scalia brought to the attention of the Court the authority to restrict &quot;standing&quot; in class action suits in which the litigants may be defined in descriptive terms rather than as well-defined and unambiguous litigants.

===Other cases===
Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of &quot;Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health&quot;, in which the family of a woman in a vegetative state sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die, believing that to have been her wish. The Court found for the State of Missouri, requiring clear and convincing evidence of such a desire. Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute and that the issues &quot;are [not] better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory&quot;.

Scalia joined the majority &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion in the 2000 case of &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, which effectively ended recounts of ballots in Florida following the 2000 US presidential election, and also both concurred separately and joined Rehnquist&#x27;s concurrence. In 2007, he said of the case, &quot;I and my court owe no apology whatever for &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;. We did the right thing. So there! ... get over it. It&#x27;s so old by now&quot;. During an interview on the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; show, he defended the Court&#x27;s action:
==Legal philosophy and approach==
===Judicial performance===
During oral argument before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments than any other justice. A 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any of his colleagues did. His goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to the other justices. University of Kansas social psychologist Lawrence Wrightsman wrote that Scalia communicated &quot;a sense of urgency on the bench&quot; and had a style that was &quot;forever forceful&quot;. After Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Court in 2005, he took to quizzing lawyers in a manner similar to Scalia&#x27;s; sometimes the two questioned counsel in seeming coordination. Dahlia Lithwick of &quot;Slate&quot; described Scalia&#x27;s technique as follows:
Scalia wrote numerous opinions from the start of his career on the Supreme Court. During his tenure, he wrote more concurring opinions than any other justice. Only two other justices have written more dissents. According to Kevin Ring, who compiled a book of Scalia&#x27;s dissenting and concurring opinions: &quot;His opinions are ... highly readable. His entertaining writing style can make even the most mundane areas of the law interesting&quot;. Conor Clarke of &quot;Slate&quot; comments on Scalia&#x27;s written opinions, especially his dissents:

At the Supreme Court, justices meet after the case is briefed and argued and vote on the result. The task of writing the opinion is assigned by the Chief Justice or—if the Chief Justice is in the minority or is not participating—by the senior justice in the majority. After the assignment, the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to each other&#x27;s chambers. In the give-and-take of opinion-writing, Scalia did not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority (unlike the late Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., who would accept less than what he wanted in order to gain a partial victory). Scalia attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them &quot;Ninograms&quot;—short memoranda aimed at persuading them of the correctness of his views.

In an October 2013 issue of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Scalia revealed that he scanned &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times,&quot; obtained most of his news from talk radio, and did not read &quot;The New York Times&quot; or &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; He described &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;&quot;shrilly&quot; liberal&quot;.

=== Textualism ===
Scalia was a textualist in statutory interpretation, believing that the ordinary meaning of a statute should govern. In interpreting statutes, Scalia did not look to legislative history. In the 2006 case of &quot;Zedner v. United States&quot;, he joined the majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito—all except one paragraph of the opinion, in which Alito cited legislative history. In a concurring opinion in that case, Scalia noted, &quot;The use of legislative history is illegitimate and ill advised in the interpretation of any statute&quot;.
His dislike of legislative history may have been a reason that other justices have become more cautious in its use. Gregory Maggs wrote in the &quot;Public Interest Law Review&quot; in 1995 that by the early 1990s, legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of Supreme Court cases involving the interpretation of statutes and that no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome. Maggs suggested:

=== Originalism ===

In 1998, Scalia vociferously opposed the idea of a living constitution, or the power of the judiciary to modify the meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times. Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, &quot;the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one&#x27;s own views&quot;. He compared the Constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time. Scalia described himself as an originalist, meaning that he interpreted the United States Constitution as it would have been understood when it was adopted. According to Scalia in 2008, &quot;It&#x27;s what did the words mean to the people who ratified the Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution&quot;.

Constitutional amendments, such as the 1868 Fourteenth Amendment, according to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning at the time of ratification. Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result. Scalia responded to this argument in two ways. He noted research by Michael McConell that &quot;persuasively establishes that this was the original understanding of the post Civil War Amendments.&quot; However, Scalia continues by arguing that even if non-originalist methods occasionally produce better results than originalism, &quot;It is in no way remarkable... that taking power from the people and placing it instead with a judicial aristocracy can produce some creditable results that democracy might not achieve. The same can be said of monarchy and totalitarianism. But once a nation has decided that democracy... is the best system of government, the crucial question becomes which theory of textual interpretation is compatible with democracy. Originalism unquestionably is. Non-originalism, by contrast, imposes on society statutory prescriptions that were never democratically adopted. When applied to the Constitution, nonoriginalism limits the democratic process itself, prohibiting... acts... that &#x27;We The People&#x27; never, ever, voted to outlaw&quot;. In a 2009 public conversation, Justice Stephen Breyer questioned Scalia, indicating that those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to end school segregation. Scalia called this argument &quot;waving the bloody shirt of &quot;Brown&quot;&quot; and indicated that he would have joined the first Justice Harlan&#x27;s solitary dissent in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, the 1896 case that &quot;Brown&quot; overruled.

Scalia&#x27;s originalist approach came under attack from critics, who viewed it as &quot;a cover for what they see as Scalia&#x27;s real intention: to turn back some pivotal court decisions of the 1960s and 70s&quot; reached by the Warren and Burger Courts. Ralph Nader argued in 2008 that Scalia&#x27;s originalist philosophy was inconsistent with the justice&#x27;s acceptance of the extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations when at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s ratification, corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights. Nader&#x27;s view preceded the Court&#x27;s 2010 decision in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;. Scalia, in his concurrence in that case, traced his understanding of the rights of groups of individuals at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. His argument was based on the lack of an exception for groups such as corporations in the free speech guarantee in the Bill of Rights and on several examples of corporate political speech from the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Professor Thomas Colby of George Washington University National Law Center argued that Scalia&#x27;s votes in Establishment Clause cases do not stem from originalist views but simply from conservative political convictions. Scalia responded to his critics that his originalism &quot;has occasionally led him to decisions he deplores, like his upholding the constitutionality of flag burning&quot;, which according to Scalia was protected by the First Amendment.

In 2006, before George W. Bush appointees Roberts and Alito had had time to make an impact, Rossum wrote that Scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism, whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in. Following the appointments of Roberts and Alito, subsequent appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh are identified in their judicial temperament as being originalists with Kavanuagh referred to as &quot;a stalwart originalist&quot; in the tradition of Scalia.

== Public attention ==
===Requests for recusals===

Scalia recused himself from &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot; (2004), a case brought by atheist Michael Newdow alleging that recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance (including the words &quot;under God&quot;) in school classrooms violated the rights of his daughter, who he said was also an atheist. Shortly after the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Newdow&#x27;s favor but before the case came before the Supreme Court, Scalia spoke at a Knights of Columbus event in Fredericksburg, Virginia, stating that the Ninth Circuit decision was an example of how the courts were trying to excise God from public life. The school district requested that the Supreme Court review the case, and Newdow asked that Scalia recuse himself because of this prior statement, which he did without comment.

Scalia declined to recuse himself from &quot;Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia&quot; (2005), a case concerning whether Vice President Dick Cheney could keep secret the membership of an advisory task force on energy policy. Scalia was asked to recuse himself because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney, during which he traveled one way on Air Force Two. Scalia issued a lengthy in-chambers opinion refusing to recuse himself, stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend, he was being sued merely in his official capacity and that were justices to step aside in the cases of officials who are parties because of official capacity, the Supreme Court would cease to function. Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials, recalling that the late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson played poker with President Harry Truman and that Justice Byron White went skiing with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip, the two had not discussed the case, and the justice had saved no money because he had bought round-trip tickets, the cheapest available. Scalia was part of the 7–2 majority once the case was heard, a decision that generally upheld Cheney&#x27;s position. Scalia later described his refusal to recuse himself as his &quot;most heroic opinion&quot; because it had exposed him to a great deal of criticism.

Judge Gilbert S. Merritt Jr. of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals called for Scalia&#x27;s recusal in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; at the time. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, writing in &quot;Law and Philosophy&quot;, later chronicled such calls and contended that &quot;There were many ways for Justice Scalia&#x27;s sons to benefit from a decision in favor of Bush. Together these benefits could be substantial. Hence, [the law] required recusal&quot;. Republicans dismissed such calls as partisan, noting that Merritt was a close friend of the Gores and a rumored Gore Supreme Court nominee.

===Religious views===

Scalia was a devout traditionalist Catholic, and his son Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following Vatican II, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, including parishes that celebrated the Tridentine Latin Mass in Chicago and Washington, and one celebrating the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Virginia. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for &quot;New York&quot;, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, &quot;Of course! Yeah, he&#x27;s a real person. Hey, c&#x27;mon, that&#x27;s standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that.&quot; When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: &quot;You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He&#x27;s making pigs run off cliffs, he&#x27;s possessing people and whatnot ... What he&#x27;s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He&#x27;s much more successful that way.&quot; In another 2013 interview to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Scalia said, &quot;In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential.&quot;

In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia was asked by a reporter whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, &quot;You know what I say to those people?&quot; and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough, go away&quot; and noted, &quot;It&#x27;s a fairly strong gesture&quot;. The gesture was parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance; cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert&#x27;s jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.

===1996 presidential election===
According to John Boehner, as chairman of the House Republican Conference, he sought to persuade Scalia to run for election as vice president with Bob Dole in 1996. As related by Boehner, Scalia listened to the proposal and dictated the same reply Justice Charles Evans Hughes had once given to a similar query: &quot;The possibility is too remote to comment upon, given my position&quot;. Dole did put Scalia on his list of potential running mates but eventually decided upon Jack Kemp.

==Personal life==
On September 10, 1960, Scalia married Maureen McCarthy at St. Pius X church in Yarmouth, Massachusetts. The two had met on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School. Maureen was an undergraduate student at Radcliffe College when they met; she subsequently obtained a degree in English from the school.

The Scalias had five sons and four daughters. Two of their sons, Eugene Scalia and John Scalia, became attorneys, with Eugene later becoming Secretary of Labor in the Trump administration. Paul Scalia became a Catholic priest, Matthew Scalia had a military career, and Christopher Scalia became a writer. All four Scalia daughters—Catherine, Ann, Margaret, and Mary—have families. According to Scalia, Maureen raised all nine children &quot;with very little assistance from me&quot;. The family resided in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

Scalia enjoyed a warm friendship with fellow justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, considered a member of the court&#x27;s liberal wing, with the two attending the opera together and appearing together onstage as supernumeraries in Washington National Opera&#x27;s 1994 production of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. Ginsburg was a colleague of Scalia on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and Ginsburgs had dinner together every New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Scalia also enjoyed a friendship with fellow Justice Elena Kagan, also considered a member of the court&#x27;s liberal wing. When Justice David Souter retired, Scalia told David Axelrod, an adviser to then-President Barack Obama, that he hoped that Obama would nominate Kagan to replace him. While Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor instead, a year later when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, Obama nominated Kagan. An avid hunter, Scalia taught Justice Kagan how to hunt; the two hunted ducks, birds, deer and antelope together.

===Death and funeral===

Scalia died in his sleep at age 79. His body was discovered on the morning of February 13, 2016, in his room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, near Shafter, Texas in Presidio County, Texas. He had gone quail hunting the afternoon before, and then dined as the guest of John B. Poindexter, owner of the ranch. After Poindexter discovered the body, he called the Presidio County sheriff&#x27;s department to ask for the number of the U.S. Marshals Service to report a death. Poindexter was reluctant to say who had died to Sheriff Danny Dominguez. Dominguez had the Marshal&#x27;s Service call the ranch owner, and both the marshals and the sheriff went to the ranch, where they were shown Scalia&#x27;s body. Dominguez instructed his office to call local justice of the peace Juanita Bishop, but she was out of town.

County judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes. She did not see the body, which under Texas law is not required, nor did she order an autopsy. Bishop, as well as David Beebe, another justice of the peace, later disagreed with the decision not to order an autopsy for Scalia. Guevara, who conferred by telephone with Scalia&#x27;s physician, stated that she made the determination to pronounce Scalia dead from natural causes after being told by county sheriff Dominguez on the scene that &quot;there were no signs of foul play&quot; and that Scalia &quot;was having health issues&quot;. Scalia&#x27;s physician, Rear Admiral Brian P. Monahan, told her Scalia had a history of heart trouble, including high blood pressure, and was recently deemed too weak to undergo surgery for a torn rotator cuff. According to Sunset Funeral Home director Chris Lujan, Scalia&#x27;s family also declined to have an autopsy performed after his body was transferred to his El Paso funeral home, prior to its return to Fairfax, Virginia.

&quot;Kansas v. Carr&quot; (2016) was the last majority opinion written by Justice Scalia before his death in February 2016, though his last dissenting opinion was in &quot;FERC v. Electric Power Supply Association&quot; (2016). Following his death, Scalia lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building on February 19, 2016. Scalia&#x27;s son, Father Paul Scalia, celebrated a Catholic funeral Mass and delivered the homily on February 20, 2016, at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The Obama administration was represented at the funeral by Vice President Joe Biden; President Barack Obama did not attend. Scalia&#x27;s remains were interred at a private ceremony at Fairfax Memorial Park in Fairfax, Virginia.

==== Conspiracy theories ====
The circumstances surrounding Scalia&#x27;s death prompted conspiracy theories alleging that he may have been murdered. These conspiracy theories were stimulated by Guevara&#x27;s decision not to conduct an autopsy and her pronouncement of Scalia&#x27;s death by a phone call, as well as by Scalia&#x27;s refusal of a United States Marshals Service security detail, uncertainty over the precise cause of Scalia&#x27;s death, and Poindexter&#x27;s initial assertion that he found Scalia in bed with a pillow over his head. Poindexter later clarified that the pillow was in between Scalia&#x27;s head and the bed&#x27;s headboard, not over his face. The conspiracy theory was promoted by William Ritchie, a former head of criminal investigations for the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and by Alex Jones, a far-right talk show host. Donald Trump, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, referenced the homicide allegations on Michael Savage&#x27;s radio show &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;, saying that &quot;they say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow.&quot; Eugene Scalia rejected the theories, saying that &quot;our family just has no doubt that he was taken from us by natural causes.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Writing in &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; in 2009, J. J. Goldberg described Scalia as &quot;the intellectual anchor of the court&#x27;s conservative majority&quot;. Scalia traveled to the nation&#x27;s law schools, giving talks on law and democracy. His appearances on college campuses were often standing room only. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg indicated that Scalia was &quot;very much in tune with the current generation of law students ... Students now put &#x27;Federalist Society&#x27; on their resumes&quot;. John Paul Stevens, who served throughout Scalia&#x27;s tenure until his 2010 retirement, said of Scalia&#x27;s influence, &quot;He&#x27;s made a huge difference. Some of it constructive, some of it unfortunate&quot;. Of the nine sitting justices, Scalia was most often the subject of law review articles.

In 2009, after nearly a quarter century on the Court, Scalia characterized his victories as &quot;damn few&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;American Spectator&quot;, Adam Carrington noted that: 
Scalia&#x27;s promotion of textualism and originalism on the high court led to a shift in the American judiciary&#x27;s approach to textual interpretation, with greater attention paid to the text itself. The liberal political philosopher Ronald Dworkin said that because of Scalia, &quot;we are all originalists now.&quot; For this reason, he is often described as one of the most influential jurists of the twentieth century. The statement by Ronald Dorker was made earlier by Elena Kagan, for Elena Kagan said during her 2010 Senate confirmation hearings that &quot;we are all originalists.&quot; Kagan declared in a 2015 interview at Harvard Law School honoring her then-colleague Scalia that &quot;we are all textualists now.&quot; In 2017, Harvard University established an endowed professorship at its law school dedicated in honor of Scalia; as of July 1, 2021, it is occupied by Stephen E. Sachs.

=== In popular culture ===
Derrick Wang&#x27;s opera &quot;Scalia/Ginsburg&quot; depicts the friendship of Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, both known for their shared love of opera. The opera was introduced before Scalia and Ginsburg at the Supreme Court in 2013, premiered at the Castleton Festival in 2015, and was revised after Scalia&#x27;s death, with the revised version broadcast on national radio on November 7, 2020. Scalia and Ginsburg both wrote forewords to the libretto, and Ginsburg cited the opera in her statement on Scalia&#x27;s death and in her foreword to the book &quot;Scalia Speaks&quot;.

John Strand&#x27;s play &quot;The Originalist&quot; was performed in Washington, DC in 2015; it received a positive review from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The play depicted Justice Scalia&#x27;s interaction with a (fictional) liberal court clerk and their mutual criticism and eventual support of each other. The play had a cross-country tour from Washington, D.C. to the Pasadena Playhouse. The play aired on PBS in 2017.

=== Posthumous tributes ===
According to NBC News, tributes to &quot;larger-than-life Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia poured in [from] both sides of the political aisle&quot; following his death. President Barack Obama called Scalia &quot;one of the towering legal figures of our time&quot; and former president George W. Bush described Scalia as &quot;a brilliant jurist&quot;. U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch called Scalia &quot;one of the most influential and eloquent justices to ever serve on the U.S. Supreme Court&quot;.

In May 2016, George Mason University renamed its law school the &quot;Antonin Scalia Law School&quot; after an anonymous donor pledged $20 million to the school, with an additional $10 million donated by the Charles Koch Foundation, contingent upon the name change in Scalia&#x27;s honor. The dedication ceremony occurred on October 6, 2016, and was attended by Supreme Court justices. At the ceremony, Justice Elena Kagan called Scalia &quot;one of the most important Supreme Court justices ever, and also one of the greatest&quot;.

In October 2016, the Italy–USA Foundation posthumously awarded Scalia its America Award. The ceremony was conducted in front of the Italian parliament in Rome.

In 2018, President Donald Trump posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Scalia.

Writing for the plurality in &quot;Borden v. United States&quot;, Justice Kagan referenced Scalia, writing &quot;Indeed, the Court has made a similar point before, in an opinion by one of its great wordsmiths.&quot;

In a concurring opinion in &quot;Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo&quot;, Justice Neil Gorsuch praised Scalia for his willingness to reconsider his earlier views, writing that &quot;rather than cling to the pride of personal precedent, the Justice began to express doubts over the very project that he had worked to build... If Chevron&#x27;s ascent is a testament to the Justice&#x27;s ingenuity, its demise is an even greater tribute to his humility&quot;

== Succession ==
Scalia&#x27;s death—only the second death of a serving justice in a span of sixty years—left eight justices remaining on the Supreme Court, split 4–4 between fairly conservative and fairly liberal, during a presidential election year. Cases that were pending before the Court at Scalia&#x27;s death were decided by the remaining eight members. A 4–4 deadlock would result in the ruling of the lower court being upheld, but no precedent being set, and the justices would not publish written opinions on the merits of the case.

In a 2012 interview, Scalia had said he would prefer Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals as his successor. On March 16, 2016, President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill Scalia&#x27;s seat, but the Republican-controlled Senate declined to take any action on the nomination; the nomination expired with the end of the 114th Congress on January 3, 2017. On January 31, 2017, Republican President Donald Trump announced the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to succeed Scalia. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on April 7, 2017.

<text>Pizzelle (; : &quot;pizzella&quot;) are Italian waffle cookies made with flour, eggs, sugar, butter or vegetable oil, and flavoring (usually anise or anisette, or vanilla or lemon zest). Pizzelle are also known as &quot;ferratelle&quot;, &quot;nevole&quot; or &quot;catarrette&quot; in some parts of Abruzzo, as &quot;ferratelle&quot; in Lazio, and as &quot;ferratelle&quot;, &quot;cancelle&quot; or &quot;pizzelle&quot; in Molise.

Pizzelle are named &quot;prodotti agroalimentari tradizionali abruzzesi&quot; (traditional agri-food product of Abruzzo) by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Sovereignty and Forests.

==History==
Pizzelle are known to be one of the oldest cookies and are thought to have originated from the ancient Roman &quot;crustulum&quot;. Pizzelle were originally made in the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Ortona, in the Abruzzo region of Italy, and spread to nearby regions of Molise and Lazio. Many other cultures have developed a pizzelle-type cookie as part of their culture (for example, the Norwegian &quot;krumkake&quot;).

==Production==

The cookie dough or batter is put into a pizzelle iron, which resembles a small variant of the popular waffle iron. Originally, the long-handled pizzelle iron was held by hand over a hot burner on the stovetop, although today most pizzelle are made using electric models and require no stove. Typically, the iron stamps a snowflake pattern onto both sides of the thin golden-brown cookie, which has a crisp texture once cooled, although some pizzelle irons feature family crests, special dates, or other decorative designs. Store-bought pizzelle are now commonly available in Italy, and other areas with a large Italian population.

It is also common to sandwich two pizzelle with cannoli cream (ricotta blended with sugar) or hazelnut spread. Pizzelle, while still warm, can also be rolled into a tubular shape using a wooden dowel to create cannoli shells.

Pizzelle are popular during Christmas and Easter. They are often found at Italian weddings, alongside other traditional pastries such as cannoli and traditional Italian cookies.

<doc id="166518" wikidata="Q1431891" url="?curid=166518" title="Pub quiz">
<text>A pub quiz is a quiz held in a pub or bar. These events are also called quiz nights, trivia nights, or bar trivia and may be held in other settings. The pub quiz is a modern example of a pub game, and often attempts to lure customers to the establishment on quieter days. The pub quiz has become part of British culture since its popularization in the UK in the 1970s by Burns and Porter, although the first mentions in print can be traced to 1959. It then became a staple in Irish pub culture, and its popularity has continued to spread internationally. Although different pub quizzes can cover a range of formats and topics, they have many features in common. Most quizzes have a limited number of team members, offer prizes for winning teams, and distinguish rounds by category or theme.

== History ==
The origins of the pub quiz are relatively unknown. 

In 1946, a night in Yorkshire is mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records.

In the late-1950s in Merseyside and Lancashire, &quot;about 4,000 people became involved in the organised quiz leagues that sprang up from Bootle to Southport&quot;.

On 30 October 1963, The Liverpool Echo carried an interview with Jack Robinson, &quot;on the Merseyside quiz scene since it started&quot;.

In 1976, Sharon Burns and Tom Porter founded and organised 32 pub quiz teams in three leagues in southern England. The goal was to attract people to pubs on quieter, “off” nights. From the time Burns and Porter began their weekly quiz in the 1970s, popularity grew over the next few years from just 30 teams to 10,000 teams in their weekly events.

== Format ==
Pub quizzes (also known as live trivia, or table quizzes) are often weekly events and will have an advertised start time, most often in the evening.

While specific formats vary, most pub quizzes involve written answers to questions which are distributed in written form or announced by a quizmaster.

One format for quizzing is called &quot;infinite bounce&quot; or “infinite rebounds”. Infinite bounce is often used to accommodate large numbers of teams. One question is addressed to each team in subsequent order. If one team fails to answer, the question passed along to the following team. Quizzes may also employ the “pounce” strategy. Here, a time limit is introduced and if the team under questioning fails to answer, any team may “pounce” and offer the answer.

Generally someone (either one of the bar staff or the person running the quiz) will come around with pens and quiz papers, which may contain questions or may just be blank sheets for writing the answers. A mixture of both is common, in which case often only the blank sheet is to be handed in. Usually a team hands their answers in for marking to the quizmaster or to the next team along.

=== Teams ===
It is up to the quizzers to form teams, which are generally based on tables, though if one table has a large group around it they may decide to split up. Some pubs insist on a maximum team size (usually between six and ten). The team members decide on a team name, often a supposedly humorous phrase or pun, which must be written on all papers handed in.

There is often a small buy-in for the quiz that contributes to the winning pot at the end of the night. Many pub quizzes require no payment at all, as the event is simply a way to get paying customers into the venue, typically on less busy nights of the week.

=== Questions ===
The person asking the questions is known as the quizmaster or quiz host. Quiz hosts often also mark and score answers submitted by teams, although sometimes teams will mark each other&#x27;s answer sheets.

The questions can be set by the bar staff or landlord, by a third-party who may also supply the host, or by volunteers from amongst the contestants. In the latter case, the quiz setter may be remunerated with drinks or a small amount of money.

Often questions may be drawn from the realm of &#x27;everybody knows&#x27; trivia, sometimes leading to controversies when the answers are false or unverifiable. Generally, specialist companies will have proof read and verified answers prior to supply, avoiding such issues. In addition, as the quizzes are not formal affairs, slight errors in wording may lead to confusion and have led to a 2005 court case in the UK.

=== Rounds ===
There are typically between 1-6 rounds of questions, ranging from 10 to upwards of 80 questions. Rounds may include the following themes (in order of popularity):

* Factual rounds – these are usually spoken, either over a public address system or just called out. Common topics include:
** General knowledge – covering topics such as history, geography and science and nature. There may well be more than one of these rounds.
** Sport – comprising the statistics and minutiae of both well-known and obscure sports.
** Entertainment – general pop culture, including movies, TV shows and music (see also below).
** True or False – questions to which the answer is True or False.
* Picture round – these use printed hand-outs or televised images consisting of pictures to be identified. These rounds may use photos of famous people (possibly snapped out of context or else partially obscured), logos of companies (without tell-tale lettering), famous places or objects captured from a strange angle. Usually these rounds are completed across the duration of the quiz with a hive of activity at the start, to keep guests entertained during breaks between rounds; and are marked halfway through.
* Who Am I? – A series of clues to the identity of a famous person (or thing). Clues are given in order of descending difficulty. The earlier a team can identify the correct answer, the more points they are awarded.
* Music round – these consist of excerpts (often only the intro or other non-vocal segment) of songs played over the PA system. Usually the teams must identify the song, artist, and/or the year the song was released. Variations include the use of film and TV soundtracks, or classical music rounds (requiring the composer, title, and/or style). This round may be dependent on proper licensing from performers rights organizations.
* Audio round – similar to music rounds, but sound clips are played from movies, television shows, YouTube videos, etc. 
* Year rounds — these rounds list important, historic events and offer points for correctly identifying the year in which they took place.
* Puzzle rounds – generally on a hand-out sheet. These may consist of crossword puzzles, anagrams, Ditloids, Dingbats and basic mathematics problems.
* Novelty rounds – themed round a specific word or name (e.g. all the questions relate to a famous Norman); &#x27;connections&#x27;, where the last answer in the round provides a link to all the previous answers; true or false; and various others to break up the general stream of questions.
Beyond these standard rounds, themes and variety are only limited by the quizmaster’s creativity. Rounds can involve any number of bizarre and random topics, varying in difficulty and subject matter.

=== Bonus rounds ===
In some quizzes, teams can select one or two rounds as &quot;jokers&quot;, in which their points will be doubled (or otherwise multiplied). Teams usually select their joker rounds before the start of the quiz, although some rounds may be excluded. Teams who consider themselves to be particularly strong on certain subjects can improve their chances with a good joker round, but risk wasting the joker if the questions are unexpectedly difficult. The idea of using a joker in a game may come from the BBC television programme &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot;.

Some quizzes include a bonus question, in which a single answer is required with one or more clues given each round making the answer progressively easier to solve. In some variants, the first team to hand in the correct answer wins either a spot prize or additional points to their total score. In others, the questions continue until all teams have the correct answer with each team being given progressively fewer additional points the longer it takes them to submit the correct answer.

=== Jackpots ===
Some quizzes add a small, separate round of questions to the end of a regular quiz, with the chance to win a jackpot. Each week an amount of money is added to the jackpot, and if no team answers the questions correctly, the money rolls over to the next quiz. The maximum amount of the jackpot may be limited by local gaming regulations.

Cash jackpots may be won by a variety of methods including one-off questions and dance-offs.

=== Marking ===

In many cases, the papers are marked by the quiz host. An alternative method is to have teams swap papers before marking, though this is typically employed for larger numbers of teams. Generally, teams will not mark their own answers to avoid accusations of cheating.

Typically, each correct answer awards one point, though some questions may offer multiple points for their respective answers. Certain quizzes allow half marks for &quot;nearly right&quot; answers (such as a celebrity&#x27;s surname when their full name was required), or there may be additional points for particularly difficult questions.

=== Cheating ===

With the mass use of mobile phones and mobile internet access, cheating has become a problem for some pub quizzes — covert calls, texts and internet use in the toilets or outside smoking area, recent newspapers and magazines brought along especially for the event, ringers and so on. Another form of cheating is seen in large groups posing as multiple teams. Most quizzes set a limit on team members to prevent large numbers of people collaborating but this problem is difficult to regulate. A lot of quizzes now ban the use of mobiles and nullify the score of any team found to be cheating. While this issue is more prevalent where large sums of money are concerned, cheating can still be observed for relatively low stakes. 

A modern solution to prevent the use of mobile phones is to host the quiz on a mobile quiz app that can detect when the user has left the app. Apps such as Speedquizzing gives bonus points to the quiz team which answers the question fastest and sets a time limit in which you can answer the question, thereby negatively impacting those who attempt to search it online.

=== Prizes ===

Prizes are awarded to the highest-scoring team, and often to runners-up. Prizes are usually one of the following:

* Alcoholic drinks: a case of beer or some money on a bar tab to spend at that pub are common.
* Cash: if there is an entry fee for the quiz, this is often pooled to form prize money. This may all go to the winning team or contribute toward the ‘jackpot’ (see above). 
* Vouchers: such as cinema discount coupons, food discounts, or drink vouchers for use at the bar holding the quiz.
* Promotional items from a brewery: merchandise such as t-shirts or beer glasses advertising the establishment.
* Miscellaneous or novelty prizes: possibilities include chocolate or cheap toys. The winning team may get first choice to pick a prize from a range on offer.
Occasionally after the main rounds a low-stakes raffle is brought around, for which players pay a small additional fee, to fill time whilst scores are totted up.

== Technology ==
In a digital pub quiz, wireless handsets replace the more usual pen and paper. A computer receives and records the answers from each team&#x27;s handset and the results are exported to a spreadsheet at the end of the quiz. A time limit can be set for each question (e.g. 60 seconds) and it is possible to determine which team answers in the fastest time for spot prizes and tiebreaks. The visual rounds may also use TV screens around the bar to broadcast the clues.

Founded in 1984. NTN Buzztime was the first company to create and distribute pub quiz software systems to bars and restaurants in 1987.

== Commercial projects ==
As the pub quiz concept spread to the US in the 1990s, several companies formed to provide services to bars and restaurants organizing quizzes. Different from the quiz league in the UK, US commercial pub quizzes typically involve more than just two teams and can have as many as 25–35 teams playing in a single location, with up to 6 people per team. Quiz companies charge bars a fee for hosting the quiz, which may range from $80 per week to $175 or more depending on attendance. At least 20 different pub quiz companies currently exist in the US, with most operating events concentrated in major metropolitan areas.

== Leagues and competitions ==

A quiz league is an organization that runs quizzes—typically in pubs—though with several distinctions from the standard pub quiz. They often involve only two teams and include a number of individual questions. Prizes are uncommon at a league match, aside from congratulatory kudos to the quiz team winning a league or a competition. 

There are additionally non-pub-based leagues, where teams from throughout a region, county, state or country meet annually for more prestigious competitions, with greater prizes. Representative teams may either be the best team from each pub or a team selected from the best individuals.

Internationally, Believe it or Not Quiz Events in New Zealand have held an annual Champion of Champions quiz in Auckland since 1998 [SOURCE]. Initially open to teams from pubs within the greater Auckland region, it is now open to teams from throughout New Zealand. In practice, travel costs prevent most teams from the lower North Island and the South Island participating, although Christchurch, Nelson and Wellington have all provided teams.

The Australasian Pub Quiz Championships has taken place annually since 2018. Open to teams from pubs and clubs from across Australia and New Zealand, the 2018 Championships is simultaneously run in Sydney, Canberra, and Wellington in late April.

The United States National Trivia Association presents &quot;The Riddle&quot;, a finals event open to eligible teams who play the official NTA &quot;Quizzo!&quot; live trivia game. Approximately a thousand players attended the 2008 event in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Sporcle runs the Pub Champions Trivia League, which hosts regional, state, and national tournaments. Their league championships are primarily based in the midwest United States. [18]

== World record ==
The Guinness World Records recently awarded the title of “Largest Pub Quiz” to host Jay Flynn of the UK. On April 30, 2022, his Virtual Pub Quiz had over 182,000 participating households, a number credited to the Covid-19 lockdown. [19]

== In popular culture ==
*Pub quizzes have appeared in the British sitcoms &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot; and &quot;Early Doors&quot;, amongst others. 
*A January 2013 episode of &quot;Anger Management&quot; features Charlie Sheen&#x27;s character involved in a game of bar trivia. 
*The New Zealand television drama &quot;Nothing Trivial&quot; centres around five characters who meet regularly at a pub quiz.
*The ITV game show &quot;Quiz Night&quot; with Stuart Hall was based on this concept. The set on which the show took place had a bar theme to it; contestants and the host even drank beer while doing the show.
*The Irish television drama &quot;Trivia&quot; from 2011 to 2012 focuses on the captain of a pub quiz team.

== Regional ==
===United States===

In Philadelphia, many bars, specifically those owned by Irish-Americans, will have &quot;Quizzo&quot; nights.

Trivia nights are sometimes used as fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, and these are very common in the Greater St. Louis area. A trivia radio show was popular in the 1970s and trivia night as fundraiser became popular after introduction by an Australian immigrant couple in the early 1980s.

<doc id="166519" wikidata="Q206466" url="?curid=166519" title="Mahalia Jackson">
<text>Mahalia Jackson ( ; born Mahala Jackson; October 26, 1911 – January 27, 1972) was an American gospel singer, widely considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century. With a career spanning 40 years, Jackson was integral to the development and spread of gospel blues in black churches throughout the U.S. During a time when racial segregation was pervasive in American society, she met considerable and unexpected success in a recording career, selling an estimated 22 million records and performing in front of integrated and secular audiences in concert halls around the world, making her one of the best-selling gospel music artists.

The granddaughter of enslaved people, Jackson was born and raised in poverty in New Orleans. She found a home in her church, leading to a lifelong dedication and singular purpose to deliver God&#x27;s word through song. She moved to Chicago as an adolescent and joined the Johnson Singers, one of the earliest gospel groups. Jackson was heavily influenced by musician-composer Thomas Dorsey and blues singer Bessie Smith, adapting Smith&#x27;s style to traditional Protestant hymns and contemporary songs. After making an impression in Chicago churches, she was hired to sing at funerals, political rallies, and revivals. For 15 years, she functioned as what she termed a &quot;fish and bread singer&quot;, working odd jobs between performances to make a living.

Nationwide recognition came for Jackson in 1947 with the release of &quot;Move On Up a Little Higher&quot;, selling two million copies and hitting the number-two spot on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, both firsts for gospel music. Jackson&#x27;s recordings captured the attention of jazz fans in the U.S. and France, and she became the first gospel recording artist to tour Europe. She regularly appeared on television and radio, and performed for many presidents and heads of state, including singing the national anthem at John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Inaugural Ball in 1961. Motivated by her experiences living and touring in the South and integrating a Chicago neighborhood, she participated in the civil rights movement, singing for fundraisers and at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. She was a vocal and loyal supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and a personal friend of his family.

Throughout her career, Jackson faced intense pressure to record secular music, but she turned down high-paying opportunities to concentrate on gospel. Completely self-taught, Jackson had a keen instinct for music, her delivery marked by extensive improvisation with melody and rhythm. She was renowned for her powerful contralto voice, range, an enormous stage presence, and her ability to relate to her audiences, conveying and evoking intense emotion during performances. Passionate and at times frenetic, she wept and demonstrated physical expressions of joy while singing. Her success brought about international interest in gospel music, initiating the &quot;Golden Age of Gospel&quot; making it possible for many soloists and vocal groups to tour and record. Popular music as a whole felt her influence and she is credited with inspiring rhythm and blues, soul, and rock and roll singing styles. A Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient, she won three competitive Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the National Recording Registry, and the Rock &amp; Roll, Gospel, and R&amp;B Halls of Fame, as well as the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. She was also named one of NPR&#x27;s 50 Great Voices, and ranked among Rolling Stone&#x27;s 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Early life (1911 – )==

Mahalia Jackson was born to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, a stevedore and weekend barber. Clark and Jackson were unmarried, a common arrangement among black women in New Orleans at the time. He lived elsewhere, never joining Charity as a parent. Both sets of Mahalia&#x27;s grandparents were born into slavery, her paternal grandparents on a rice plantation and her maternal grandparents on a cotton plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish about north of New Orleans. Charity&#x27;s older sister, Mahala &quot;Duke&quot; Paul, was her daughter&#x27;s namesake, sharing the spelling without the &quot;I&quot;. Duke hosted Charity and their five other sisters and children in her leaky three-room shotgun house on Water Street in New Orleans&#x27; Sixteenth Ward. The family called Charity&#x27;s daughter &quot;Halie&quot;; she counted as the 13th person living in Aunt Duke&#x27;s house. As Charity&#x27;s sisters found employment as maids and cooks, they left Duke&#x27;s, though Charity remained with her daughter, Mahalia&#x27;s half-brother Peter, and Duke&#x27;s son Fred. Mahalia was born with bowed legs and infections in both eyes. Her eyes healed quickly but her Aunt Bell treated her legs with grease water massages with little result. For her first few years, Mahalia was nicknamed &quot;Fishhooks&quot; for the curvature of her legs.

The Clarks were devout Baptists attending nearby Plymouth Rock Baptist Church. Sabbath was strictly followed, the entire house shut down on Friday evenings and did not open again until Monday morning. As members of the church, they were expected to attend services, participate in activities there, and follow a code of conduct: no jazz, no card games, and no &quot;high life&quot;: drinking or visiting bars or juke joints. Dancing was only allowed in the church when one was moved by the spirit. The adult choir at Plymouth Rock sang traditional Protestant hymns, typically written by Isaac Watts and his contemporaries. Jackson enjoyed the music sung by the congregation more. These songs would be lined out: called out from the pulpit, with the congregation singing it back. They had a stronger rhythm, accentuated with clapping and foot-tapping, which Jackson later said gave her &quot;the bounce&quot; that carried with her decades later. She dutifully joined the children&#x27;s choir at age four. Next door to Duke&#x27;s house was a small Pentecostal church that Jackson never attended but stood outside during services and listened raptly. Music here was louder and more exuberant. The congregation included &quot;jubilees&quot; or uptempo spirituals in their singing. Shouting and stomping were regular occurrences, unlike at her own church. Jackson later remembered, &quot;These people had no choir or no organ. They used the drum, the cymbal, the tambourine, and the steel triangle. Everybody in there sang, and they clapped and stomped their feet, and sang with their whole bodies. They had a beat, a rhythm we held on to from slavery days, and their music was so strong and expressive. It used to bring tears to my eyes.&quot;

When Jackson was five, her mother became ill and died, the cause unknown. Aunt Duke took in Jackson and her half-brother at another house on Esther Street. Duke was severe and strict, with a notorious temper. Jackson split her time between working, usually scrubbing floors and making moss-filled mattresses and cane chairs, playing along the levees catching fish and crabs and singing with other children, and spending time at Mount Moriah Baptist Church where her grandfather sometimes preached. The full-time minister there gave sermons with a sad &quot;singing tone&quot; that Jackson later said would penetrate to her heart, crediting it with strongly influencing her singing style. Church became a home to Jackson where she found music and safety; she often fled there to escape her aunt&#x27;s moods. She attended McDonough School 24, but was required to fill in for her various aunts if they were ill, so she rarely attended a full week of school; when she was 10, the family needed her more at home. She dropped out and began taking in laundry.

Jackson worked, and she went to church on Wednesday evenings, Friday nights, and most of the day on Sundays. Already possessing a big voice at age 12, she joined the junior choir. She was surrounded by music in New Orleans, more often blues pouring out of her neighbors&#x27; houses, although she was fascinated with second line funeral processions returning from cemeteries when the musicians played brisk jazz. Her older cousin Fred, not as intimidated by Duke, collected records of both kinds. The family had a phonograph and while Aunt Duke was at work, Jackson played records by Bessie Smith, Mamie Smith, and Ma Rainey, singing along while she scrubbed floors. Bessie Smith was Jackson&#x27;s favorite and the one she most-often mimicked.

Jackson&#x27;s legs began to straighten on their own when she was 14, but conflicts with Aunt Duke never abated. Whippings turned into being thrown out of the house for slights and manufactured infractions and spending many nights with one of her nearby aunts. The final confrontation caused her to move into her own rented house for a month, but she was lonely and unsure of how to support herself. After two aunts, Hannah and Alice, moved to Chicago, Jackson&#x27;s family, concerned for her, urged Hannah to take her back there with her after a Thanksgiving visit.

== Rise of gospel music in Chicago ()==

In a very cold December, Jackson arrived in Chicago. For a week she was miserably homesick, unable to move off the couch until Sunday when her aunts took her to Greater Salem Baptist Church, an environment she felt at home in immediately, later stating it was &quot;the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me&quot;. When the pastor called the congregation to witness, or declare one&#x27;s experience with God, Jackson was struck by the spirit and launched into a lively rendition of &quot;Hand Me Down My Silver Trumpet, Gabriel&quot;, to an impressed but somewhat bemused audience. The power of Jackson&#x27;s voice was readily apparent but the congregation was unused to such an animated delivery. She was nonetheless invited to join the 50-member choir, and a vocal group formed by the pastor&#x27;s sons, Prince, Wilbur, and Robert Johnson, and Louise Lemon. They performed as a quartet, the Johnson Singers, with Prince as the pianist: Chicago&#x27;s first black gospel group. Initially they hosted familiar programs singing at socials and Friday night musicals. They wrote and performed moral plays at Greater Salem with offerings going toward the church.

Jackson&#x27;s arrival in Chicago occurred during the Great Migration, a massive movement of black Southerners to Northern cities. Between 1910 and 1970, hundreds of thousands of rural Southern blacks moved to Chicago, transforming a neighborhood in the South Side into Bronzeville, a black city within a city which was mostly self sufficient, prosperous, and teeming in the 1920s. This movement caused white flight with whites moving to suburbs, leaving established white churches and synagogues with dwindling members. Their mortgages were taken over by black congregations in good position to settle in Bronzeville. Members of these churches were, in Jackson&#x27;s term, &quot;society Negroes&quot; who were well educated and eager to prove their successful assimilation into white American society. Musical services tended to be formal, presenting solemnly delivered hymns written by Isaac Watts and other European composers. Shouting and clapping were generally not allowed as they were viewed as undignified. Special programs and musicals tended to feature sophisticated choral arrangements to prove the quality of the choir.

This difference between the styles in Northern urban churches and the South was vividly illustrated when the Johnson Singers appeared at a church one evening and Jackson stood out to sing solo, scandalizing the pastor with her exuberant shouts. He accused her of blasphemy, bringing &quot;twisting jazz&quot; into the church. Jackson was momentarily shocked before retorting, &quot;This is the way we &quot;sing&quot; down South!&quot; The minister was not alone in his apprehension. She was often so involved in singing she was mostly unaware how she moved her body. To hide her movements, pastors urged her to wear loose fitting robes which she often lifted a few inches from the ground, and they accused her of employing &quot;snake hips&quot; while dancing when the spirit moved her. Enduring another indignity, Jackson scraped together four dollars () to pay a talented black operatic tenor for a professional assessment of her voice. She was dismayed when the professor chastised her: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to learn to stop hollering. It will take time to build up your voice. The way you sing is not a credit to the Negro race. You&#x27;ve got to learn to sing songs so that white people can understand them.&quot;

Soon Jackson found the mentor she was seeking. Thomas A. Dorsey, a seasoned blues musician trying to transition to gospel music, trained Jackson for two months, persuading her to sing slower songs to maximize their emotional effect. Dorsey had a motive: he needed a singer to help sell his sheet music. He recruited Jackson to stand on Chicago street corners with him and sing his songs, hoping to sell them for ten cents a page. It was not the financial success Dorsey hoped for, but their collaboration resulted in the unintentional conception of gospel blues solo singing in Chicago.

== Fish and bread singer ( – 1945) ==

Steadily, the Johnson Singers were asked to perform at other church services and revivals. When larger, more established black churches expressed little interest in the Johnson Singers, they were courted by smaller storefront churches and were happy to perform there, though less likely to be paid as much or at all. Newly arrived migrants attended these storefront churches; the services were less formal and reminiscent of what they had left behind. Jackson found an eager audience in new arrivals, one calling her &quot;a fresh wind from the down-home religion.&quot; Black Chicago was hit hard by the Great Depression, driving church attendance throughout the city, which Jackson credited with starting her career. Gradually and by necessity, larger churches became more open to Jackson&#x27;s singing style. As many of them were suddenly unable to meet their mortgage notes, adapting their musical programs became a viable way to attract and keep new members.

When she first arrived in Chicago, Jackson dreamed of being a nurse or a teacher, but before she could enroll in school she had to take over Aunt Hannah&#x27;s job when she became ill. Jackson became a laundress and took a series of domestic and factory jobs while the Johnson Singers began to make a meager living, earning from $1.50 to $8 (equivalent to $ to $ in ) a night. Steady work became a second priority to singing. Jackson began calling herself a &quot;fish and bread singer&quot;, working for herself and God. She made her first recordings in 1931, singles that she intended to sell at National Baptist Convention meetings, though she was mostly unsuccessful. But as her audiences grew each Sunday, she began to get hired as a soloist to sing at funerals and political rallies for Louis B. Anderson and William L. Dawson. In 1932, on Dawson&#x27;s request, she sang for Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential campaign. She had become the only professional gospel singer in Chicago. Sometimes she made $10 a week () in what historian Michael Harris calls &quot;an almost unheard-of professionalization of one&#x27;s sacred calling&quot;.

As opportunities came to her, an extraordinary moral code directed Jackson&#x27;s career choices. Her lone vice was frequenting movie and vaudeville theaters until her grandfather visited one summer and had a stroke while standing in the sun on a Chicago street. Jackson pleaded with God to spare him, swearing she would never go to a theater again. He survived and Jackson kept her promise, refusing to attend as a patron and rejecting opportunities to sing in theaters for her entire career. She furthermore vowed to sing gospel exclusively despite intense pressure. In 1935, Jackson met Isaac &quot;Ike&quot; Hockenhull, a chemist working as a postman during the Depression. Impressed with his attention and manners, Jackson married him after a year-long courtship. Hockenhull&#x27;s mother gave the couple 200 formulas for homemade hair and skincare products she had sold door to door. Hockenhull and Jackson made cosmetics in their kitchen and she sold jars when she traveled. It was not steady work, and the cosmetics did not sell well. At one point Hockenhull had been laid off and he and Jackson had less than a dollar between them. He saw that auditions for &quot;The Swing Mikado&quot;, a jazz-flavored retelling of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, were taking place. He demanded she go; the role would pay $60 a week (). Plus, he saw no value in singing gospel. He did not consider it artful. He had repeatedly urged her to get formal training and put her voice to better use. She refused and they argued about it often. Wracked by guilt, she attended the audition, later calling the experience &quot;miserable&quot; and &quot;painful&quot;. When she got home she learned that the role was offered to her, but when Hockenhull informed her he also secured a job she immediately rejected the role to his disbelief. She furthermore turned down Louis Armstrong and Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines when they offered her jobs singing with their bands.

In 1937, Jackson met Mayo &quot;Ink&quot; Williams, a music producer who arranged a session with Decca Records. She recorded four singles: &quot;God&#x27;s Gonna Separate the Wheat From the Tares&quot;, &quot;You Sing On, My Singer&quot;, &quot;God Shall Wipe Away All Tears&quot;, and &quot;Keep Me Every Day&quot;. Jackson told neither her husband or Aunt Hannah, who shared her house, of this session. The records&#x27; sales were weak, but were distributed to jukeboxes in New Orleans, one of which Jackson&#x27;s entire family huddled around in a bar, listening to her again and again. Decca said they would record her further if she sang blues, and once more Jackson refused.

The Johnson Singers folded in 1938, but as the Depression lightened Jackson saved some money, earned a beautician&#x27;s license from Madam C. J. Walker&#x27;s school, and bought a beauty salon in the heart of Bronzeville. It was almost immediately successful and the center of gospel activity. Singers, male and female, visited while Jackson cooked for large groups of friends and customers on a two-burner stove in the rear of the salon. It was located across the street from Pilgrim Baptist Church, where Thomas Dorsey had become music director. Dorsey proposed a series of performances to promote his music and her voice and she agreed. They toured off and on until 1951. It was regular and, they felt, necessary work. Dorsey accompanied Jackson on piano, often writing songs specifically for her. His background as a blues player gave him extensive experience improvising and he encouraged Jackson to develop her skills during their performances by handing her lyrics and playing chords while she created melodies, sometimes performing 20 or more songs this way. She was able to emote and relate to audiences profoundly well; her goal was to &quot;wreck&quot; a church, or cause a state of spiritual pandemonium among the audience which she did consistently. At one event, in an ecstatic moment Dorsey jumped up from the piano and proclaimed, &quot;Mahalia Jackson is the Empress of gospel singers! She&#x27;s the &quot;Empress&quot;! The Empress!!&quot;

A constant worker and a shrewd businesswoman, Jackson became the choir director at St. Luke Baptist Church. She bought a building as a landlord, then found the salon so successful she had to hire help to care for it when she traveled on weekends. On tour, she counted heads and tickets to ensure she was being paid fairly. What she was able to earn and save was done in spite of Hockenhull. A compulsive gambler, he took home a large payout asking Jackson to hide it so he would not gamble it. She laid the stash in flat bills under a rug assuming he would never look there, then went to a weekend performance in Detroit. When she returned, she realized he had found it and used it to buy a race horse. In 1943, he brought home a new Buick for her that he promptly stopped paying for. She paid for it entirely, then learned he had used it as collateral for a loan when she saw it being repossessed in the middle of the day on the busiest street in Bronzeville. They divorced amicably.

== Apollo Records and national recognition (1946–1953) ==

Each engagement Jackson took was farther from Chicago in a nonstop string of performances. In 1946 she appeared at the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem. In attendance was Art Freeman, a music scout for Apollo Records, a company catering to black artists and audiences concentrating mostly on jazz and blues. Apollo&#x27;s chief executive Bess Berman was looking to broaden their representation to other genres, including gospel. Berman signed Jackson to a four-record session, allowing Jackson to pick the songs. Her first release on Apollo, &quot;Wait &#x27;til My Change Comes&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell God All About it One of These Days&quot; did not sell well. Neither did her second, &quot;I Want to Rest&quot; with &quot;He Knows My Heart&quot;. Berman asked Jackson to record blues and she refused. Berman told Freeman to release Jackson from any more recordings but Freeman asked for one more session to record the song Jackson sang as a warmup at the Golden Gate Ballroom concert. &quot;Move On Up a Little Higher&quot; was recorded in two parts, one for each side of the 78 rpm record.

Meanwhile, Chicago radio host Louis &quot;Studs&quot; Terkel heard Jackson&#x27;s records in a music shop and was transfixed. He bought and played them repeatedly on his show. Terkel introduced his mostly white listeners to gospel music and Jackson herself, interviewing her and asking her to sing live. &quot;Move On Up a Little Higher&quot; was released in 1947, selling 50,000 copies in Chicago and two million nationwide. It landed at the number two spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for two weeks, another first for gospel music. The best any gospel artist could expect to sell was 100,000. Berman set Jackson up for another recording session, where she sang &quot;Even Me&quot; (one million sold), and &quot;Dig a Little Deeper&quot; (just under one million sold). Instantly Jackson was in high demand. A position as the official soloist of the National Baptist Convention was created for her, and her audiences multiplied to the tens of thousands. She participated in the Harry S. Truman 1948 presidential campaign, earning her first invitation to the White House. Time constraints forced her to give up the choir director position at St. Luke Baptist Church and sell the beauty shop. True to her own rule, she turned down lucrative appearances in New York City at the Apollo Theater and Village Vanguard, where she was promised $5,000 a week ().

The next year promoter Joe Bostic approached her to perform in a gospel music revue at Carnegie Hall, a venue most often reserved for classical and well established artists such as Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington. Jackson was intimidated by this offer and dreaded the approaching date. Gospel had never been performed at Carnegie. Jackson was the final artist to appear that evening. After a shaky start, she gave multiple encores and received voluminous praise: Nora Holt, a music critic with the black newspaper &quot;The New York Amsterdam News&quot;, wrote that Jackson&#x27;s rendition of &quot;City Called Heaven&quot; was filled with &quot;suffering ecstasy&quot; and that Jackson was a &quot;genius unspoiled&quot;. John Hammond, critic at the &quot;Daily Compass&quot;, praised Jackson&#x27;s powerful voice which &quot;she used ... with reckless abandon&quot;. The revue was so successful it was made an annual event with Jackson headlining for years. The show that took place in 1951 broke attendance records set by Goodman and Arturo Toscanini.

By chance, a French jazz fan named Hugues Panassié visited the Apollo Records office in New York and discovered Jackson&#x27;s music in the waiting room. He bought her records, took them home and played them on French public radio. The Académie Charles Cros awarded Jackson their Grand Prix du Disque for &quot;I Can Put My Trust in Jesus&quot;; Jackson was the first gospel singer to receive this award. During the same time, Jackson and blues guitarist John Lee Hooker were invited to a ten-day symposium hosted by jazz historian Marshall Stearns who gathered participants to discuss how to define jazz. Jackson was accompanied by her pianist Mildred Falls, together performing 21 songs with question and answer sessions from the audience, mostly filled with writers and intellectuals. As Jackson&#x27;s singing was often considered jazz or blues with religious lyrics, she fielded questions about the nature of gospel blues and how she developed her singing style. Toward the end, a participant asked Jackson what parts of gospel music come from jazz, and she replied, &quot;Baby, don&#x27;t you know the Devil stole the beat from the &quot;Lord?&quot;&quot; Those in the audience wrote about Jackson in several publications. Her records were sent to the UK, traded there among jazz fans, earning Jackson a cult following on both sides of the Atlantic, and she was invited to tour Europe.

Jackson had her first television appearance on &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; with Ed Sullivan in 1952. As she prepared to embark on her first tour of Europe, she began having difficulty breathing during and after performances and had severe abdominal cramping. She continued with her plans for the tour where she was very warmly received. In jazz magazine &quot;DownBeat&quot;, Mason Sargent called the tour &quot;one of the most remarkable, in terms of audience reaction, ever undertaken by an American artist&quot;. Her appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London made her the first gospel singer to perform there since the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1872, and she pre-sold 20,000 copies of &quot;Silent Night&quot; in Copenhagen. She played numerous shows while in pain, sometimes collapsing backstage. She lost a significant amount of weight during the tour, finally having to cancel. When she returned to the U.S., she had a hysterectomy and doctors found numerous granulomas in her abdomen. She was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory disease caused by immune cells forming lumps in organs throughout the body. Sarcoidosis is not curable, though it can be treated, and following the surgery, Jackson&#x27;s doctors were cautiously optimistic that with treatment she could carry on as normal.

== Columbia Records and civil rights activism (1954–1963) ==

In 1954, Jackson learned that Berman had been withholding royalties and had allowed her contract with Apollo to expire. Mitch Miller offered her a $50,000-a-year () four-year contract, and Jackson became the first gospel artist to sign with Columbia Records, a much larger company with the ability to promote her nationally. Miller attempted to make her repertoire more appealing to white listeners, asking her to record ballads and classical songs, but again she refused. &quot;Rusty Old Halo&quot; became her first Columbia single, and &quot;DownBeat&quot; declared Jackson &quot;the greatest spiritual singer now alive&quot;. Columbia worked with a local radio affiliate in Chicago to create a half hour radio program, &quot;The Mahalia Jackson Show&quot;. Although it got an overwhelmingly positive reception and producers were eager to syndicate it nationally, it was cut to ten minutes long, then canceled. She appeared on a local television program, also titled &quot;The Mahalia Jackson Show&quot;, which again got a positive reception but was canceled for lack of sponsors. Despite white people beginning to attend her shows and sending fan letters, executives at CBS were concerned they would lose advertisers from Southern states who objected to a program with a black person as the primary focus.

Jackson attracted the attention of the William Morris Agency, a firm that promoted her by booking her in large concert halls and television appearances with Arthur Godfrey, Dinah Shore, Bing Crosby, and Perry Como in the 1950s. Her reverence and upbeat, positive demeanor made her desirable to progressive producers and hosts eager to feature a black person on television. She appeared at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, silencing a rowdy hall of attendees with &quot;I See God&quot;. Miller, who was in attendance, was awed by it, noting &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a dry eye in the house when she got through&quot;. Jackson broke into films playing a missionary in &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1958), and a funeral singer in &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959). As demand for her rose, she traveled extensively, performing 200 dates a year for ten years. She and her entourage of singers and accompanists toured deeper into the South, encountering difficulty finding safe, clean places to sleep, eat, and buy gas due to Jim Crow laws. Sometimes they had to sleep in Jackson&#x27;s car, a Cadillac she had purchased to make long trips more comfortable. Jackson remembered, &quot;The looks of anger at the sight of us colored folks sitting in a nice car were frightening to see... It got so we were living on bags of fresh fruit during the day and driving half the night, and I was so exhausted by the time I was supposed to sing, I was almost dizzy.&quot; Jackson began to gain weight. She also developed peculiar habits regarding money. As a black woman, Jackson found it often impossible to cash checks when away from Chicago. Her contracts therefore demanded she be paid in cash, often forcing her to carry tens of thousands of dollars in suitcases and in her undergarments.

Each event in her career and personal life broke another racial barrier. She often asked ushers to allow white and black people to sit together, sometimes asking the audiences to integrate themselves by telling them that they were all Christian brothers and sisters. After years of receiving complaints about being loud when she practiced in her apartment, even in the building she owned, Jackson bought a house in the all-white Chatham Village neighborhood of Chicago. When this news spread, she began receiving death threats. The day she moved in her front window was shot. Jackson asked Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, for help and Daley ordered police presence outside her house for a year. A few months later, Jackson appeared live on the television special &quot;Wide Wide World&quot; singing Christmas carols from Mount Moriah, her childhood church in New Orleans. The broadcast earned excellent reviews, and Jackson received congratulatory telegrams from across the nation. Yet the next day she was unable to get a taxi or shop along Canal Street.

While attending the National Baptist Convention in 1956, Jackson met Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy, both ministers emerging as organizers protesting segregation. Jackson often sang to support worthy causes for no charge, such as raising money to buy a church an organ, robes for choirs, or sponsoring missionaries. She extended this to civil rights causes, becoming the most prominent gospel musician associated with King and the civil rights movement. She raised money for the United Negro College Fund and sang at the Prayer Pilgrimage Breakfast in 1957. She later stated she felt God had especially prepared King &quot;with the education and the warmth of spirit to do His work&quot;. Motivated by her sincere appreciation that civil rights protests were being organized within churches and its participants inspired by hymns, she traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to sing in support of the ongoing bus boycott. She and Mildred Falls stayed at Abernathy&#x27;s house in a room that was bombed four months later. After hearing that black children in Virginia were unable to attend school due to integration conflicts, she threw them an ice cream party from Chicago, singing to them over a telephone line attached to a public address system. She similarly supported a group of black sharecroppers in Tennessee facing eviction for voting.

As gospel music became more popular – primarily due to her influence – singers began appearing at non-religious venues as a way to spread a Christian message to nonbelievers. Jackson appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1957 and 1958, and in the latter&#x27;s concert film, &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; (1959). Her continued television appearances with Steve Allen, Red Skelton, Milton Berle, and Jimmy Durante kept her in high demand. She toured Europe again in 1961 with incredible success, mobbed in several cities and needing police escorts. All dates in Germany were sold out weeks in advance. In Essen, she was called to give so many encores that she eventually changed into her street clothes and the stage hands removed the microphone. Still she sang one more song. The highlight of her trip was visiting the Holy Land, where she knelt and prayed at Calvary.

When King was arrested and sentenced to four months hard labor, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy intervened, earning Jackson&#x27;s loyal support. She began campaigning for him, saying: &quot;I feel that I&#x27;m a part of this man&#x27;s hopes. He lifts my spirit and makes me feel a part of the land I live in.&quot; Her clout and loyalty to Kennedy earned her an invitation to sing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at his inaugural ball in 1961. Months later, she helped raise $50,000 for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Jackson lent her support to King and other ministers in 1963 after their successful campaign to end segregation in Birmingham by holding a fundraising rally to pay for protestors&#x27; bail. By this time she was a personal friend of King and his wife Coretta, often hosting them when they visited Chicago, and spending Thanksgiving with their family in Atlanta. King considered Jackson&#x27;s house a place that he could truly relax. She appeared at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom to sing &quot;I&#x27;ve Been &#x27;Buked and I&#x27;ve Been Scorned&quot; on King&#x27;s request, then &quot;How I Got Over&quot;. Three months later, while rehearsing for an appearance on Danny Kaye&#x27;s television show, Jackson was inconsolable upon learning that Kennedy had been assassinated, believing that he died fighting for the rights of black Americans.

== Later years (1964–1972) ==

Jackson toured Europe again in 1964, mobbed in several cities and proclaiming, &quot;I thought I was the Beatles!&quot; in Utrecht. She appeared in the film &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1964), and attended a ceremony acknowledging Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s inauguration at the White House, becoming friends with Lady Bird. When at home, she attempted to remain approachable and maintain her characteristic sincerity. Mostly in secret, Jackson had paid for the education of several young people as she felt poignant regret that her own schooling was cut short. Stories of her gifts and generosity spread. Her phone number continued to be listed in the Chicago public telephone book, and she received calls nonstop from friends, family, business associates, and strangers asking for money, advice on how to break into the music industry, or general life decisions they should make. Her house had a steady flow of traffic that she welcomed. Jackson had thoroughly enjoyed cooking since childhood, and took great pleasure in feeding all of her visitors, some of them staying days or weeks on her request.

Through friends, Jackson met Sigmond Galloway, a former musician in the construction business living in Gary, Indiana. Despite Jackson&#x27;s hectic schedule and the constant companions she had in her entourage of musicians, friends, and family, she expressed loneliness and began courting Galloway when she had free time. As a complete surprise to her closest friends and associates, Jackson married him in her living room in 1964. Only a few weeks later, while driving home from a concert in St. Louis, she found herself unable to stop coughing. She checked herself into a hospital in Chicago. Since the cancellation of her tour to Europe in 1952, Jackson experienced occasional bouts of fatigue and shortness of breath. As her schedule became fuller and more demands were placed on her, these episodes became more frequent. This time, the publicly disclosed diagnosis was heart strain and exhaustion, but in private Jackson&#x27;s doctors told her that she had had a heart attack and sarcoidosis was now in her heart.

Jackson&#x27;s recovery took a full year during which she was unable to tour or record, ultimately losing . From this point on she was plagued with near-constant fatigue, bouts of tachycardia, and high blood pressure as her condition advanced. Jackson was often depressed and frustrated at her own fragility, but she took the time to send Lyndon Johnson a telegram urging him to protect marchers in Selma, Alabama, when she saw news coverage of Bloody Sunday. Galloway proved to be unreliable, leaving for long periods during Jackson&#x27;s convalescence, then upon his return insisting she was imagining her symptoms. He tried taking over managerial duties from agents and promoters despite being inept. They argued over money; Galloway attempted to strike Jackson on two different occasions, the second one thwarted when Jackson ducked and he broke his hand hitting a piece of furniture behind her. The marriage dissolved and she announced her intention to divorce. He responded by requesting a jury trial, rare for divorces, in an attempt to embarrass her by publicizing the details of their marital problems. When Galloway&#x27;s infidelities were proven in testimony, the judge declined to award him any of Jackson&#x27;s assets or properties.

Her doctors cleared her to work and Jackson began recording and performing again, pushing her limitations by giving two- and three-hour concerts. She performed exceptionally well belying her personal woes and ongoing health problems. When not on tour, she concentrated her efforts on building two philanthropies: the Mahalia Jackson Foundation which eventually paid tuition for 50 college students, and the culmination of a dream she had for ten years: a nondenominational temple for young people in Chicago to learn gospel music. As she organized two large benefit concerts for these causes, she was once more heartbroken upon learning of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She attended the funeral in Atlanta where she gave one of her most memorable performances of &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot;. With this, Jackson retired from political work and personal endorsements.

Branching out into business, Jackson partnered with comedian Minnie Pearl in a chain of restaurants called Mahalia Jackson&#x27;s Chicken Dinners and lent her name to a line of canned foods. She purchased a lavish condominium in Chicago overlooking Lake Michigan and set up room for Galloway, whom she was considering remarrying. At 58 years old, she returned to New Orleans, finally allowed to stay as a guest in the upscale Royal Orleans hotel, receiving red carpet treatment. She embarked on a tour of Europe in 1968, which she cut short for health reasons, but she returned in 1969 to adoring audiences. Now experiencing inflammation in her eyes and painful cramps in her legs and hands, she undertook successful tours of the Caribbean, still counting the house to ensure she was being paid fairly, and Liberia in West Africa. In 1971, Jackson made television appearances with Johnny Cash and Flip Wilson. For three weeks she toured Japan, becoming the first Western singer since the end of World War II to give a private concert for the Imperial Family. The U.S. State Department sponsored a visit to India, where she played Kolkata, New Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai, all of them sold out within two hours. In New Delhi, she had an unexpected audience with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who declared, &quot;I will never hear a greater voice; I will never know a greater person.&quot; While touring Europe months later, Jackson became ill in Germany and flew home to Chicago where she was hospitalized. In January 1972, she received surgery to remove a bowel obstruction and died in recovery.

Although news outlets had reported on her health problems and concert postponements for years, her death came as a shock to many of her fans. She received a funeral service at Greater Salem Baptist Church in Chicago where she was still a member. Fifty thousand people paid their respects, many of them lining up in the snow the night before, and her peers in gospel singing performed in her memory the next morning. The day after, Mayor Richard Daley and other politicians and celebrities gave their eulogies at the Arie Crown Theater with 6,000 in attendance. Her body was returned to New Orleans where she lay in state at Rivergate Auditorium under a military and police guard, and 60,000 people viewed her casket. On the way to Providence Memorial Park in Metairie, Louisiana, the funeral procession passed Mount Moriah Baptist Church, where her music was played over loudspeakers.

==Style==
===Singing===

Though the gospel blues style Jackson employed was common among soloists in black churches, to many white jazz fans it was novel. As she was the most prominent — and sometimes the only gospel singer many white listeners knew — she often received requests to define the style and explain how and why she sang as she did. Jackson was mostly untrained, never learning to read or write musical notation, so her style was heavily marked by instinct. She answered questions to the best of her ability though often responded with lack of surety, saying: &quot;All I ever learned was just to sing the way I feel... off-beat, on the beat, between beats — however the Lord lets it come out.&quot; When pressed for clearer descriptions, she replied: &quot;Child, I don&#x27;t know how I do it myself.&quot;

Jackson&#x27;s voice is noted for being energetic and powerful, ranging from contralto to soprano, which she switched between rapidly. She resisted labeling her voice range instead calling it &quot;real strong and clear&quot;. She used bent or &quot;worried&quot; notes typical of blues, the sound of which jazz aficionado Bucklin Moon described as &quot;an almost solid wall of blue tonality&quot;. She moaned, hummed, and improvised extensively with rhythm and melody, often embellishing notes with a prodigious use of melisma, or singing several tones per syllable. Author Anthony Heilbut called it a &quot;weird ethereal sound, part moan, part failed operatics&quot;. Gospel historian Horace Boyer attributes Jackson&#x27;s &quot;aggressive style and rhythmic ascension&quot; to the Pentecostal congregation she heard as a child, saying Jackson was &quot;never a Baptist singer&quot;. He continues: &quot;bending a note here, chopping off a note there, singing through rest spots and ornamenting the melodic line at will, [Jackson] confused pianists but fascinated those who played by ear&quot;. Bucklin Moon was enamored with her singing, writing that the embellishments Jackson added &quot;take your breath away. As a member of a Sanctified Church in Mount Vernon once told me: &#x27;Mahalia, she add more flowers and feathers than anybody, and they all is exactly right.&#x27; She breaks every rule of concert singing, taking breaths in the middle of a word and sometimes garbling the words altogether, but the full-throated feeling and expression are seraphic.&quot; Writer Ralph Ellison noted how she blended precise diction with a thick New Orleans accent, describing the effect as &quot;almost of the academy one instant, and of the broadest cotton field dialect the next&quot;.

By her own admission and in the opinion of multiple critics and scholars, Bessie Smith&#x27;s singing style was clearly dominant in Jackson&#x27;s voice. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Max Jones contrasted the two: &quot;Whereas Bessie&#x27;s singing can sound harsh and unlovely, even to jazz students, on first acquaintance, Mahalia&#x27;s voice is obviously an instrument of uncommon beauty... Her bursts of power and sudden rhythmic drives build up to a pitch that leave you unprepared to listen afterwards to any but the greatest of musicians.&quot; Other singers made their mark. In her early days in Chicago, Jackson saved her money to buy records by classical singers Roland Hayes, Grace Moore, and Lawrence Tibbett, attributing her diction, breathing, and she said, &quot;what little I know of technique&quot; to these singers.

Improvisation was a significant part of Jackson&#x27;s live performances both in concert halls and churches. She often stretched what would be a five-minute recording to twenty-five minutes to achieve maximum emotional effect. In black churches, this was a regular practice among gospel soloists who sought to evoke an emotional purging in the audience during services. White and non-Christian audiences also felt this resonance. After one concert, critic Nat Hentoff wrote: &quot;The conviction and strength of her rendition had a strange effect on the secularists present, who were won over to Mahalia if not to her message. Most of them were amazed at the length of time after the concert during which the sound of her voice remained active in the mind.&quot; Jackson explained that as God worked through her she became more impassioned during a song, and that what she felt was right to do in the moment was what was necessary for the audience. As her career advanced, she found it difficult to adjust to the time constraints in recording and television appearances, saying: &quot;When I sing I don&#x27;t go by the score. I lose something when I do. I don&#x27;t want to be told I can sing just so long. I make it &#x27;til that passion is passed. When I become conscious, I can&#x27;t do it good.&quot;

===Recording===

Jackson estimated that she sold 22 million records in her career. Her four singles for Decca and seventy-one for Apollo are widely acclaimed by scholars as defining gospel blues. The earliest are marked by minimal accompaniment with piano and organ. Apollo added acoustic guitar, backup singers, bass, and drums in the 1950s. Her singing is lively, energetic, and emotional, using &quot;a voice in the prime of its power and command&quot;, according to author Bob Darden. Although hearing herself on Decca recordings years later prompted Jackson to declare they are &quot;not very good&quot;, Viv Broughton calls &quot;Keep Me Every Day&quot; a &quot;gospel masterpiece&quot;, and Anthony Heilbut praises its &quot;wonderful artless purity and conviction&quot;, saying that in her Decca records, her voice &quot;was at its loveliest, rich and resonant, with little of the vibrato and neo-operatic obbligatos of later years&quot;. Likewise, he calls Jackson&#x27;s Apollo records &quot;uniformly brilliant&quot;, choosing &quot;Even Me&quot;, &quot;Just As I Am&quot;, &quot;City Called Heaven&quot;, and &quot;I Do, Don&#x27;t You&quot; as perfect examples of her phrasing and contralto range, having an effect that is &quot;angelic but never saccharine&quot;. &quot;The New Grove Gospel, Blues, and Jazz&quot; cites the Apollo songs &quot;In the Upper Room&quot;, &quot;Let the Power of the Holy Ghost Fall on Me&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Glad Salvation is Free&quot; as prime examples of the &quot;majesty&quot; of Jackson&#x27;s voice. According to musicologist Wilfrid Mellers, Jackson&#x27;s early recordings demonstrate a &quot;sound that is all-embracing, as secure as the womb, from which singer and listener may be reborn. The breathtaking beauty of the voice and superbly controlled transitions from speech to prayer to song heal and anneal.&quot;

Columbia Records, then the largest recording company in the U.S., presented Jackson as the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Gospel Singer&quot; in the 28 albums they released. She was marketed to appeal to a wide audience of listeners who, despite all her accomplishments up to 1954, had never heard of her. In contrast to the series of singles from Apollo, Columbia released themed albums that included liner notes and photos. Compared to other artists at Columbia, Jackson was allowed considerable input in what she would record, but Mitch Miller and producer George Avakian persuaded her with varying success to broaden her appeal to listeners of different faiths. Though her early records at Columbia had a similar sound to her Apollo records, the music accompanying Jackson at Columbia later included orchestras, electric guitars, backup singers, and drums, the overall effect of which was more closely associated with light pop music. She was marketed similarly to jazz musicians, but her music at Columbia ultimately defied categorization. Her albums interspersed familiar compositions by Thomas Dorsey and other gospel songwriters with songs considered generally inspirational. These included &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; written by Rodgers and Hammerstein for the 1945 musical &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Trees&quot; based on the poem by Joyce Kilmer, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, and the patriotic songs &quot;My Country &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; and &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, among others. &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Music&quot; describes Jackson&#x27;s Columbia recordings as &quot;toned down and polished&quot; compared to the rawer, more minimalist sound at Apollo. Scholar Mark Burford praises &quot;When I Wake Up In Glory&quot; as &quot;one of the crowning achievements of her career as a recording artist&quot;, but Heilbut calls her Columbia recordings of &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; and &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, &quot;uneventful material&quot;. Jackson agreed somewhat, acknowledging that her sound was being commercialized, calling some of these recordings &quot;sweetened-water stuff&quot;. When the themes of her songs were outwardly religious, some critics felt the delivery was at times less lively. John Hammond, who helped secure Jackson&#x27;s contract with Columbia, told her if she signed with them many of her black fans would not relate well to the music. This turned out to be true and as a result, Jackson created a distinct performing style for Columbia recordings that was markedly different from her live performances, which remained animated and lively, both in churches and concert halls.

===Live performance===

In live performances, Jackson was renowned for her physicality and the extraordinary emotional connections she held with her audiences. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated she was a &quot;massive, stately, even majestic woman, [who] possessed an awesome presence that was apparent in whatever milieu she chose to perform.&quot; So caught up in the spirit was she while singing, she often wept, fell on her knees, bowed, skipped, danced, clapped spontaneously, patted her sides and stomach, and particularly in churches, roamed the aisles to sing directly to individuals. All of these were typical of the services in black churches though Jackson&#x27;s energy was remarkable. An experiment wearing a wig with her robes went awry during a show in the 1950s when she sang so frenetically she flung it off mid-performance. Anthony Heilbut writes that &quot;some of her gestures are dramatically jerky, suggesting instant spirit possession&quot;, and called her performances &quot;downright terrifying. At her best, Mahalia builds these songs to a frenzy of intensity almost demanding a release in holler and shout. When singing them she may descend to her knees, her combs scattering like so many cast-out demons.&quot; Jackson defended her idiosyncrasies, commenting: &quot;How can you sing of amazing grace, how can you sing prayerfully of heaven and earth and all God&#x27;s wonders without using your hands? My hands, my feet, I throw my whole body to say all that is within me. The mind and the voice by themselves are not sufficient.&quot;

In line with improvising music, Jackson did not like to prepare what she would sing before concerts, and would often change song preferences based on what she was feeling at the moment, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s something the public reaches into me for, and there seems to be something in each audience that I can feel. I can feel whether there&#x27;s a low spirit. Some places I go, up-tempo songs don&#x27;t go, and other places, sad songs aren&#x27;t right.&quot; She had an uncanny ability to elicit the same emotions from her audiences that she transmitted in her singing. &quot;People Today&quot; commented that &quot;When Mahalia sings, audiences do more than just listen—they undergo a profoundly moving emotional experience.&quot; Jackson used &quot;house wreckers&quot;, or songs that induced long tumultuous moments with audiences weeping, shouting, and moaning, especially in black churches. Gospel singer Evelyn Gaye recalled touring with her in 1938 when Jackson often sang &quot;If You See My Savior Tell Him That You Saw Me&quot;, saying: &quot;and the people, look like they were just awed by it, on a higher plane, gone. She had that type of rocking and that holy dance she&#x27;d get into—look like the people just submitted to it.&quot; White audiences also wept and responded emotionally. According to jazz writer Raymond Horricks, instead of preaching to listeners Jackson spoke about her personal faith and spiritual experiences &quot;immediately and directly... making it difficult for them to turn away&quot;. Promoter Joe Bostic was in the audience of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, an outdoor concert that occurred during a downpour, and stated: &quot;It was the most fantastic tribute to the hypnotic power of great artistry I have ever encountered. Nothing like it have I ever seen in my life. Those people sat... they forgot... they were completely entranced.&quot;

A significant part of Jackson&#x27;s appeal was her demonstrated earnestness in her religious conviction. Bostic spoke of her abiding faith: &quot;Mahalia never became so sophisticated that she lost her humility, her relationship with God as a divine being. She never got beyond that point; and many times, many times, you were amazed — at least I was, because she was such a tough business woman.&quot; During her tour of the Middle East, Jackson stood back in wonder while visiting Jericho, and road manager David Haber asked her if she truly thought trumpets brought down its walls. Jackson replied honestly: &quot;I believe Joshua did pray to God, and the sun stood still. I believe everything.&quot; Gospel singer Cleophus Robinson asserted: &quot;There never was any pretense, no sham about her. Wherever you met her it was like receiving a letter from home. She was a warm, carefree personality who gave you the feeling that you could relax and let your hair down whenever you were around her — backstage with her or in her home where she&#x27;d cook up some good gumbo for you whenever she had the time. A lot of people tried to make Mahalia act &#x27;proper&#x27;, and they&#x27;d tell her about her diction and such things but she paid them no mind. She never denied her background and she never lost her &#x27;down home&#x27; sincerity.&quot; Television host Ed Sullivan said, &quot;She was just so darned kind to everybody. When Mahalia sang, she took command. The band, the stage crew, the other performers, the ushers — they were all rooting for her. When she came out, she could be your mother or your sister. I mean, she wasn&#x27;t obsequious, you know; she was a star among other stars. Other people may not have wanted to be deferential, but they couldn&#x27;t help it. This woman was just great.&quot; Commenting on her personal intimacy, Neil Goodwin of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; wrote after attending her 1961 concert at the Royal Albert Hall: &quot;Mahalia Jackson sang to &quot;ME&quot; last night.&quot; Others wrote of her ability to give listeners goosebumps or make the hair on their neck tingle.

===Mildred Falls===

Until 1946, Jackson used an assortment of pianists for recording and touring, choosing anyone who was convenient and free to go with her. As her career progressed, she found it necessary to have a pianist available at a moment&#x27;s notice, someone talented enough to improvise with her yet steeped in religious music. Jackson found this in Mildred Falls (1921–1974), who accompanied her for 25 years. Falls is often acknowledged as a significant part of Jackson&#x27;s sound and therefore her success. She was born Mildred Carter in Magnolia, Mississippi, learning to play on her family&#x27;s upright piano, working with church choirs, and moving to California with a gospel singing group. A broken marriage resulted in her return to Chicago in 1947 when she was referred to Jackson who set up a brief training with Robert Anderson, a longtime member of Jackson&#x27;s entourage. Falls accompanied her in nearly every performance and recording thereafter.

Always on the lookout for new material, Jackson received 25 to 30 compositions a month for her consideration. Falls played these so Jackson could &quot;catch the message of the song&quot;. Once selections were made, Falls and Jackson memorized each composition, though while touring with Jackson, Falls was required to improvise as Jackson never sang a song the same way twice, even from rehearsal to a performance hours or minutes later. Falls found it necessary to watch Jackson&#x27;s mannerisms and mouth instead of looking at the piano keys to keep up with her. At the beginning of a song, Falls might start in one key and receive hand signals from Jackson to change until Jackson felt the right key for the song in that moment. Falls remembered, &quot;Mahalia waited until she heard exactly what was in her ear, and once she heard it, she went on about her business and she&#x27;d tear the house down.&quot;

Studs Terkel compared Falls to Paul Ulanowsky and Gerald Moore who played for classical singing stars Lotte Lehmann and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, respectively. Ralph Ellison called Falls and Jackson &quot;the dynamic duo&quot;, saying that their performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival created &quot;a rhythmical drive such as is expected of the entire Basie band. It is all joy and exultation and swing, but it is nonetheless religious music.&quot; Falls&#x27; right hand playing, according to Ellison, substituted for the horns in an orchestra which was in constant &quot;conversation&quot; with Jackson&#x27;s vocals. Her left hand provided a &quot;walking bass line that gave the music its &#x27;bounce, common in stride and ragtime playing. Similarly, television host Dinah Shore called Falls&#x27; left hand &quot;the strongest thing in the whole world&quot;, giving Jackson&#x27;s music a prominent beat usually missing from religious music. When Shore&#x27;s studio musicians attempted to pinpoint the cause of Jackson&#x27;s rousing sound, Shore admonished them with humor, saying: &quot;Mildred&#x27;s got a left hand, that&#x27;s what your problem is.&quot; Anthony Heilbut explained: &quot;By Chicago choir standards her chordings and tempos were old-fashioned, but they always induced a subtle rock exactly suited to Mahalia&#x27;s swing.&quot;

==Influence==
===On music===

Jackson&#x27;s influence was greatest in black gospel music. Beginning in the 1930s, Sallie Martin, Roberta Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Artelia Hutchins, and Jackson spread the gospel blues style by performing in churches around the U.S. For 15 years the genre developed in relative isolation with choirs and soloists performing in a circuit of churches, revivals, and National Baptist Convention (NBC) meetings where music was shared and sold among musicians, songwriters, and ministers. The NBC boasted a membership of four million, a network that provided the source material that Jackson learned in her early years and from which she drew during her recording career.

Though Jackson was not the first gospel blues soloist to record, historian Robert Marovich identifies her success with &quot;Move On Up a Little Higher&quot; as the event that launched gospel music from a niche movement in Chicago churches to a genre that became commercially viable nationwide. The &quot;Golden Age of Gospel&quot;, occurring between 1945 and 1965, presented dozens of gospel music acts on radio, records, and in concerts in secular venues. Jackson&#x27;s success was recognized by the NBC when she was named its official soloist, and uniquely, she was bestowed universal respect in a field of very competitive and sometimes territorial musicians. Marovich explains that she &quot;was the living embodiment of gospel music&#x27;s ecumenism and was welcomed everywhere&quot;.

&quot;The Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Music&quot; identifies Jackson and Sam Cooke, whose music career started when he joined the Soul Stirrers, as the most important figures in black gospel music in the 1950s. To the majority of new fans, however, &quot;Mahalia was the vocal, physical, spiritual symbol of gospel music&quot;, according to Heilbut. Raymond Horricks writes: &quot;People who hold different religious beliefs to her own, and even people who have no religious beliefs whatsoever, are impressed by and give their immediate attention to her singing. She has, almost singlehandedly, brought about a wide, and often non-religious interest in the gospel singing of the Negro.&quot; Because she was often asked by white jazz and blues fans to define what she sang, she became gospel&#x27;s most prominent defender, saying: &quot;Blues are the songs of despair. Gospel songs are the songs of hope. When you sing gospel you have a feeling there&#x27;s a cure for what&#x27;s wrong. When you&#x27;re through with the blues you&#x27;ve got nothing to rest on.&quot;

As gospel music became accessible to mainstream audiences, its stylistic elements became pervasive in popular music as a whole. Jackson, who enjoyed music of all kinds, noticed, attributing the emotional punch of rock and roll to Pentecostal singing. Her Decca records were the first to feature the sound of a Hammond organ, spawning many copycats and resulting in its use in popular music, especially those evoking a soulful sound, for decades after. The first R&amp;B and rock and roll singers employed the same devices that Jackson and her cohorts in gospel singing used, including ecstatic melisma, shouting, moaning, clapping, and stomping. Heilbut writes: &quot;With the exception of Chuck Berry and Fats Domino, there is scarcely a pioneer rock and roll singer who didn&#x27;t owe his stuff to the great gospel lead singers.&quot; Specifically, Little Richard, Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers, Donna Summer, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, Della Reese, and Aretha Franklin have all named Jackson as an inspiration. Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Early influence category in 1997. Mavis Staples justified her inclusion at the ceremony, saying: &quot;When she sang, you would just feel light as a feather. God, I couldn&#x27;t get enough of her.&quot; Franklin, who studied Jackson since she was a child and sang &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; at her funeral, was placed at &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; number one spot in their list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, compiled in 2010. Despite her influence, Jackson was mostly displeased that gospel music was being used for secular purposes, considering R&amp;B and soul music to be perversions, exploiting the music to make money.

===On black identity===

Jackson&#x27;s success had a profound effect on Black American identity, particularly for those who did not assimilate comfortably into white society. Though she and gospel blues were denigrated by members of the black upper class into the 1950s, for middle and lower class black Americans her life was a rags to riches story in which she remained relentlessly positive and unapologetically at ease with herself and her mannerisms in the company of white people. In &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, her portrayal as a funeral singer embodied sorrow for the character Annie, a maid who dies from heartbreak. Scholar Johari Jabir writes that in this role, &quot;Jackson conjures up the unspeakable fatigue and collective weariness of centuries of black women.&quot; Through her music, she promoted hope and celebrated resilience in the black American experience. Jackson was often compared to opera singer Marian Anderson, as they both toured Europe, included spirituals in their repertoires, and sang in similar settings. Jackson considered Anderson an inspiration, and earned an invitation to sing at Constitution Hall in 1960, 21 years after the Daughters of the American Revolution forbade Anderson from performing there in front of an integrated audience. But Jackson&#x27;s preference for the musical influence, casual language, and intonation of black Americans was a sharp contrast to Anderson&#x27;s refined manners and concentration on European music. In interviews, Jackson repeatedly credits aspects of black culture that played a significant part in the development of her style: remnants of slavery music she heard at churches, work songs from vendors on the streets of New Orleans, and blues and jazz bands. Her first national television appearance on Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; in 1952 showed her singing authentic gospel blues, prompting a large parade in her honor in Dayton, Ohio, with 50,000 black attendees – more than the integrated audience that showed up for a Harry Truman campaign stop around the same time. Known for her excited shouts, Jackson once called out &quot;Glory!&quot; on her CBS television show, following quickly with: &quot;Excuse me, CBS, I didn&#x27;t know where I was.&quot; By retaining her dialect and singing style, she challenged a sense of shame among many middle and lower class black Americans for their disparaged speech patterns and accents. Evelyn Cunningham of the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; attended a Jackson concert in 1954, writing that she expected to be embarrassed by Jackson, but &quot;when she sang, she made me choke up and feel wondrously proud of my people and my heritage. She made me drop my bonds and become really emancipated.&quot;

Malcolm X noted that Jackson was &quot;the first Negro that Negroes made famous&quot;. White radio host Studs Terkel was surprised to learn Jackson had a large black following before he found her records, saying: &quot;For a stupid moment, I had thought that &quot;I&quot; discovered Mahalia Jackson.&quot; Jazz composer Duke Ellington, counting himself as a fan of Jackson&#x27;s since 1952, asked her to appear on his album &quot;Black, Brown and Beige&quot; (1958), an homage to black American life and culture. Due to her decision to sing gospel exclusively she initially rejected the idea, but relented when Ellington asked her to improvise on the 23rd Psalm. She was featured on the album&#x27;s vocal rendition of Ellington&#x27;s composition &quot;Come Sunday&quot;, which subsequently became a jazz standard. As she became more famous, spending time in concert halls, she continued to attend and perform in black churches, often for free, to connect with congregations and other gospel singers. Believing that black wealth and capital should be reinvested into black people, Jackson designed her line of chicken restaurants to be black-owned and operated. She organized a 1969 concert called A Salute to Black Women, the proceeds of which were given to her foundation providing college scholarships to black youth. Upon her death, singer Harry Belafonte called her &quot;the most powerful black woman in the United States&quot; and there was &quot;not a single field hand, a single black worker, a single black intellectual who did not respond to her&quot;.

<doc id="166520" wikidata="Q842480" url="?curid=166520" title="'night, Mother">
<text>″night, Mother is a play by American playwright Marsha Norman. The play won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.

The play is about a daughter, Jessie, and her mother, Thelma. It begins with Jessie calmly telling her Mama that by morning she will be dead, as she plans to take her own life that very evening. The subsequent dialogue between Jessie and Mama slowly reveals her reasons for her decision, her life with Mama, and how thoroughly she has planned her own death, culminating in a disturbing, yet unavoidable, climax.

==Synopsis==
The play takes place over the course of a single evening in the living room/kitchen of an isolated house shared by Jessie and her elderly mother Thelma. This evening, Jessie has carefully organized the house and made other detailed preparations for the future while explaining the changes to Thelma, who does not immediately notice anything unusual. Finally Jessie asks where her late father&#x27;s pistol is stored; Thelma tells her. Only after Jessie retrieves the pistol does Thelma question Jessie&#x27;s strange behavior. Jessie explains that she intends to commit suicide at the end of the evening.

Thelma, horrified, at first assumes Jessie is unhappy with their life together. Jessie calmly assures her that she is simply tired of living and has been for some time. Thelma speculates that Jessie&#x27;s unhappy marriage, her divorce, her criminal son, the loss of her father, her epilepsy, or the pity and distaste other people feel toward her illness, are at the root of her depression; Jessie likewise dismisses these reasons, stating that her motives are purely her own and have nothing to do with other people, including Thelma. Gradually the two reveal long-hidden truths to one another: Thelma admits that Jessie&#x27;s seizures began in early childhood, but went untreated for decades with Jessie herself unaware of her symptoms, while Jessie confesses the true causes of her failed marriage. Throughout it all, Thelma occasionally bursts into hysterics in which she attempts to reason with Jessie. Jessie deflects her mother&#x27;s reasoning by continuing to calmly explain the mundane responsibilities that Thelma must assume once Jessie is dead including what to do in the immediate aftermath of her suicide. Thelma rejects all of it, believing that Jessie will give up her plans if Thelma refuses to cooperate, but Jessie says she will kill herself regardless.

By the end of the evening, Thelma concludes that she has never really known her daughter and realizes that their long conversation has altered the nature of their relationship, but Jessie, stating that it is now time for her to go, says night, Mother,&quot; before locking herself in her room. As Thelma begs and beats the door, the gunshot rings out, shocking Thelma to silence. After a moment to collect herself, she begins to carry out the instructions Jessie left for her.

==Characters==
Jessie Cates: A divorced woman who lives with her widowed mother. She has epilepsy and has experienced seizures most of her life. Nothing in life has worked out for this woman, including raising a son who turned out to be a disappointing loser. She has suffered with severe chronic depression that has never been treated. In the play, her long-standing despair has been temporarily relieved by a decision that has her uncharacteristically peaceful and talkative. The usual grayness and unsteady physical energy of this woman have given way to a new purpose that is expressed in productivity and detached humor.

Thelma &quot;Mama&quot; Cates: A widow, she is starting to feel her age and has easily allowed her depressed daughter to come and take care of all the details of her life. She sees life as she wants it to be, rather than how it is. She speaks quickly and enjoys talking. She is a simple country woman who never wanted much and could find a way to be happy with whatever she had, even if it meant lying to herself and others. She has no need for intimacy in relationships, but is energized by social situations.

==Production history==
Norman wrote the play in 1981, it was developed at the Circle Repertory Company, and it premiered at the American Repertory Theater with Robert Brustein in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This production transferred to Broadway at the John Golden Theatre with the same cast and was directed by Tom Moore. It opened on March 31, 1983, and closed on February 26, 1984, after 380 performances. It received 4 Tony Award nominations: Best Play, Best Actress in a Play (both Bates and Pitoniak) and Best Director (Tom Moore). The Broadway cast transferred to Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre in 1984 for 54 additional performances.

A US. National Tour was launched after the Broadway production closed. Phyllis Somerville, who was Kathy Bates&#x27; understudy on Broadway, played Jessie for the tour. Mercedes McCambridge was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award for her performance as Mama in the Washington D.C. production.

The first London production opened in 1985 at the Hampstead Theatre, directed by Michael Attenborough. Pitoniak and Bates again starred in a 1986 production at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

The first Chicago production opened in 1986 at the Wisdom Bridge Theatre, starring Sarajane Avidon and Elizabeth Moore.

A Broadway revival opened at the Royale Theatre on November 14, 2004, and closed on January 9, 2005, after 65 performances and 26 previews, starring Brenda Blethyn and Edie Falco, and directed by Michael Mayer.

A Philadelphia area production opened on September 14, 2017, at the Centre Theater in Norristown, Pennsylvania, starring Allison Deratzian and Susan Blair, and directed by David Deratzian.

==Film adaptation==

Sissy Spacek attended the Broadway production and liked the play so much she began work on a film version. Anne Bancroft was cast as Mama. Marsha Norman adapted her own play for the film&#x27;s screenplay. Tom Moore, who directed the play on Broadway, also directed the film. The film added more characters, whereas the play featured only two performers. The film received mixed reviews and was not nominated for any Academy Awards, although Bancroft was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Spacek was nominated for the Academy Award that year for &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;, another film adaptation of a play that was released the same year.

==Response==
Ben Brantley, in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the 2004 revival, wrote: &quot;...these two first-rate actresses are never quite at home in their roles... Ms. Norman&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ... is looking more artificial than it did two decades ago. Reviewing the 2004 revival, Elyse Sommers wrote in &quot;curtainup.com&quot; that Blethyn&#x27;s performance &quot;is superb&quot; and that &quot;Falco embodies a woman who has given up on life as anything remotely resembling fun and optimism.&quot; She expressed reservations about the &quot;play&#x27;s psychological authenticity&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1983 Marsha Norman won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize for &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot;.

<text>Proof is a 2000 play by the American playwright David Auburn. &quot;Proof&quot; was developed at George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey, during the 1999 Next Stage Series of new plays. The play premiered Off-Broadway in May 2000 and transferred to Broadway in October 2000. The play won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play.

==Plot==
The play focuses on Catherine, the daughter of Robert, a recently deceased mathematical genius in his fifties and professor at the University of Chicago, and her struggle with mathematical genius and mental illness. Catherine had cared for her father through a lengthy mental illness. Upon Robert&#x27;s death, his ex-graduate student Hal discovers a paradigm-shifting proof about prime numbers in Robert&#x27;s office. The title refers both to that proof and to the play&#x27;s central question: Can Catherine prove the proof&#x27;s authorship? Along with demonstrating the proof&#x27;s authenticity, Catherine also finds herself in a relationship with Hal. Throughout, the play explores Catherine&#x27;s fear of following in her father&#x27;s footsteps, both mathematically and mentally and her desperate attempts to stay in control.

===Act I===

The play opens with Catherine sitting in the backyard of her large, old house. Robert, her father, reveals a bottle of champagne to help celebrate her 25th birthday. Catherine complains that she hasn&#x27;t done any worthwhile work in the field of mathematics, at least not to the same level as her father, a well-known math genius. He reassures her that she can still do good work as long as she stops sleeping until noon and wasting time reading magazines. Catherine confesses she is worried about inheriting Robert&#x27;s inclination towards mental instability. He begins to comfort her but then alludes to a &quot;bad sign&quot; when he points out that he did, in fact, die a week ago. Robert disappears as Catherine dozes off. She awakens when Hal, one of Robert&#x27;s students, exits the house. He has been studying the hundreds of notebooks Robert left behind after his death, looking for any work that could be published. Catherine assures him that the notebooks are filled with scribbles and nonsense since her father wrote them when he was at his most delusional. Hal, attempting to flirt, invites her to go see his band later that night. Catherine becomes suspicious of him and demands to see what is in his backpack. She roots through it to find nothing but becomes infuriated when a notebook falls out of Hal&#x27;s jacket. She dials the police while accusing him of trying to steal her father&#x27;s work and pass it off as his own. He admits that he was sneaking it away but only to give it back to her later as a birthday present. He opens to a page that Robert wrote during a time when he was lucid. In it, Robert writes it is a &quot;good day&quot; and thanks to Catherine for taking care of him and expresses hope for the future. Hal leaves Catherine with the notebook. She begins to cry until she hears police sirens.

The next day Claire, Catherine&#x27;s sister who just flew in from New York, is setting up brunch for them in the backyard. Catherine enters and Claire tries to goad her into idle chitchat as Catherine quietly seethes. Claire declares she is getting married and invites Catherine to stay with her and her fiance in New York. Catherine assures her she will come in January for the wedding, but Claire keeps pressing her to go earlier. When Catherine demands to know why Claire is inundating her with questions, Claire tells her the police came over earlier to check in on Catherine. Catherine admits to calling the police the previous night and tries to explain her altercation with Hal but only ends up sounding unhinged to the dubious Claire. Hal appears and asks to continue his work sorting the notebooks. Catherine lets him inside and Claire drops a hint for Catherine to try flirting with Hal by offering a bagel. Catherine storms into the house.

Later that night, after the funeral, Claire holds a party in the house for her friends as well as Hal and Robert&#x27;s students. Catherine escapes to the porch where Hal finds her and offers her a beer. Hal confesses that he is not so sure about his own mathematical abilities since he considers math to be a &quot;young man&#x27;s game&quot;. Catherine tries to reassure him with a quote from Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hal responds by kissing her, much to Catherine&#x27;s surprise. He apologizes for trying to steal the notebook and she apologizes for calling the police. They kiss again and Hal asks Catherine if she remembers meeting him years earlier. She says she does and recalls she thought he was &quot;not boring&quot;. They continue to kiss.

The next morning Catherine sits outside. Hal exits the house and tells her he would like to spend the rest of the day with her. Catherine gives him a key to Robert&#x27;s desk and tells him to look inside. He goes into the house. A moment later, Claire comes into the backyard, extremely hungover. Catherine, now in a good mood, tries to make nice with Claire. Claire takes the opportunity to continue to push Catherine to moving to New York. Catherine asks why she should move to New York to which Claire confesses that she is selling the house. Catherine becomes enraged at the idea and she accuses Claire of abandoning her to take care of their sick father alone. Claire insists that the reason she did so was to keep working to pay for the house as well as Catherine&#x27;s education. Catherine reveals that she had to quit school to tend to Robert and then accuses Claire of trying to have her committed. Claire admits that she has researched doctors and facilities for Catherine but insists that she was not planning on having her committed. In the middle of the row, Hal appears clutching a notebook, barely containing his excitement. He tells Claire that Catherine is in possession of one of Robert&#x27;s notebooks which holds a very important proof. Claire asks Catherine where she found it and Catherine tells them she didn&#x27;t find it--she wrote it.

===Act II===
Four years earlier, Robert sits in the backyard. Catherine tells him she thinks he is getting better and he agrees. She blurts out that she has decided to go to college in a couple months, funded by Claire, but promises she will be only a short drive away if he were to need her again. Robert protests and demands to know why she waited so long to tell him. When she points out that he hadn&#x27;t been well until recently and was, at one point, trying to decode extraterrestrial messages in library books, he becomes upset. Hal interrupts, much to his embarrassment, to present his final dissertation to Robert. Robert assures him they will eventually work out the problem points together, then suddenly realizes he has forgotten Catherine&#x27;s birthday. He apologizes and offers to take her out to dinner. Catherine invites Hal along but he says he can&#x27;t go. Catherine shows Hal out and Robert sits down to write a notebook entry, declaring it to be the aforementioned &quot;good day&quot;.

Resuming the end of the first act, Catherine declares she was the one who wrote the proof and is met with incredulity by both Hal and her sister. The handwriting is very much like Robert&#x27;s and Hal questions Catherine&#x27;s mathematical abilities given that she only had a few months&#x27; education at Northwestern. Catherine tells him that her real education was living with Robert. When Hal offers to show it to other math experts to confirm the authenticity of the proof, Catherine refuses. She tells Hal she trusted him and then accuses him of having no talent and being past his prime. Hal storms off and Catherine begins to rip the notebook apart. Claire gets it away from her and Catherine runs into the house.

The next morning, Hal attempts to visit Catherine and apologize for his behavior. Claire stops him to say Catherine won&#x27;t talk to her, let alone Hal. Claire accuses him of sleeping with Catherine despite her being unstable. Hal argues that he had no bad intentions and insists Catherine is stronger than Claire thinks. He requests to have the notebook to verify its authenticity with fellow mathematicians. Claire gives it to him and tells him she is taking Catherine with her to New York the next day. She expresses concern for Catherine&#x27;s future mental stability.

Almost four years earlier, Robert sits in the backyard, in the cold and writing furiously. Catherine enters and reprimands him for sitting in the cold with no jacket. Robert tells her it is too hot in the house and that the cold is better for helping him work. Catherine is shocked that he is working again and he assures her that he is sharper than ever. She is ecstatic that his previous mental instability has passed and asks to see his work. He says he would love for her to take a look and asks if she&#x27;d like to take time off school to work with him. Before she decides, Robert insists she look at his latest idea and thrusts a notebook into her hands. Catherine glances at it and becomes quiet. She tells him they need to go inside and Robert explodes with fury. He yells at her to read what he has written. She reads aloud, a nonsensical, rambling paragraph mathematically equating winter, books, and the cold. It is obvious that Robert&#x27;s mind is deteriorating as it had been before. Catherine realizes Robert is descending into confusion and shivering uncontrollably. She tries to take him inside when he asks her not to leave. She promises she won&#x27;t.

Four years later, Claire is in the backyard. Catherine enters with her suitcase. She asks Claire about life in New York. Claire mentions potential schools or jobs for Catherine, who is quick to mock her by making ridiculous demands for a Freudian psychiatrist who will listen as she blames all her problems on Claire. Claire leaves Catherine&#x27;s plane ticket before storming off. Hal enters and tells Catherine that the proof checks out and apologizes for not believing her. Catherine tells him there is no proving that she wrote it and he can claim it as his own if he wants. Hal tells her he believes she is the one who wrote it and offers to read through it with her. Catherine admits she knows she is like her father but is terrified of becoming like her father. Hal reassures her that maybe she will be better. Catherine opens the proof and begins to talk through it with Hal.

==Characters==
*Catherine* – A young woman, 25 years old, who inherited much of her father&#x27;s mathematical genius and, she fears, his &quot;instability&quot; as well; she gave up her life and schooling to take care of her father until his recent death.

<doc id="166528" wikidata="Q311131" url="?curid=166528" title="Asclepias tuberosa">
<text>Asclepias tuberosa, commonly known as butterfly weed, is a species of milkweed native to eastern and southwestern North America. It is commonly known as butterfly weed because of the butterflies that are attracted to the plant by its color and its copious production of nectar.

==Description==
It is a perennial plant growing to tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, lanceolate, long, and broad.

From April to September, in the upper axils, –wide umbels of orange, yellow or red flowers wide appear. They each have five petals and five sepals. It is uncertain if reddish flowers are due to soil mineral content, ecotype genetic differentiation, or both. A cultivar named &#x27;Hello Yellow&#x27; typically has more yellowish flowers than ordinary examples of this plant.

The fruit pod is long, containing many long-haired seeds.

=== Similar species ===
The plant looks similar to the lanceolate milkweed (&quot;Asclepias lanceolata&quot;), but is uniquely identified by the larger number of flowers, and the hairy stems that are not milky when broken. It is most commonly found in fields with dry soil.
Tropical milkweed (&quot;Asclepias curassavica&quot;) can resemble &quot;Asclepias tuberosa&quot; in its red form but also lacks hairy stems.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Subspecies ===
*&quot;Asclepias tuberosa&quot; subsp. &quot;interior&quot; – (Central United States, Ontario and Quebec)
*&quot;Asclepias tuberosa&quot; subsp. &quot;rolfsii&quot; – Rolfs milkweed (Southeastern United States)
*&quot;Asclepias tuberosa&quot; subsp. &quot;tuberosa&quot; – (Eastern United States)

=== Common names ===
Common names include butterfly weed, Canada root, chieger flower, chiggerflower, fluxroot, Indian paintbrush, Indian posy, orange milkweed, orange root, orange Swallow-wort, pleurisy root, silky swallow-wort, tuber root, yellow milkweed, white-root, windroot, butterfly love, butterflyweed, and butterfly milkweed.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species can be found from South Dakota south to Texas and Mexico, west to Utah and Arizona, as well as many other areas further east.

This plant favors dry, sand or gravel soil, but has also been reported on stream margins. It requires full sun.

==Ecology==
Most easily propagated by seed. The primary pollinators are bees and wasps, rather than butterflies. Sown outdoors after frost, a plant will flower and produce seed in the third year. It is difficult to transplant once established, as it has a deep, woody taproot.

&quot;A. tuberosa&quot; is a larval food plant of the queen and monarch butterflies, as well as the dogbane tiger moth, milkweed tussock moth, and the unexpected cycnia. Because of its rough leaves and trichomes, it is not a preferred host plant of the monarch butterfly but caterpillars can be reared on it successfully. Further, it is one of the very lowest &quot;Asclepias&quot; species in cardenolide content, making it a poor source of protection from bird predation and parasite virulence and perhaps contributing to its lack of attractiveness to egg-laying monarchs.

== Cultivation ==
Butterfly weed is frequently grown in gardens for its showy orange flowers which are especially attractive to bees, though also visited by hummingbirds, moths, and butterflies. It is easily grown from seeds and is difficult to transplant due to the size of its roots. Grown from seed plants will take about two to three years to reach flowering size in average conditions. The seeds do not require stratification and can be immediately planted, though in commercial growing they are generally moist stratified at 5 °C for 30–60 days because this increases the germination rate. For other milkweeds a thin layer of mulch a layer 1–2 cm thick increases the germination rate, though specific research on butterfly weed is lacking.

Butterfly weed has few serious pest or disease problems. It is susceptible to crown rot if planted in poorly drained or too constantly moist locations. It is hardy in USDA zones 3–9.

==Toxicity==
The plant contains toxic glycosides, alkaloids and resinoids. These can cause weakness, seizures and corneal injuries. Use of the plant is contraindicated in pregnancy, during lactation or with infants due to its toxins, which include resinoids and pregnanes.

== Uses ==
Native Americans and European pioneers used the boiled roots to treat diarrhea and respiratory illnesses. The young seed pods were used as food after being boiled in several changes of water. The seed pod down was spun and used to make candle wicks.

The root was once used to treat pleurisy.

<doc id="166529" wikidata="Q706371" url="?curid=166529" title="Charles Brown (musician)">
<text>Tony Russell &quot;Charles&quot; Brown (September 13, 1922 – January 21, 1999) was an American singer and pianist whose soft-toned, slow-paced nightclub style influenced West Coast blues in the 1940s and 1950s. Between 1949 and 1952, Brown had seven Top 10 hits in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. His best-selling recordings included &quot;Driftin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Texas City, Texas. As a child he loved music and received classical music training on the piano. He graduated from Central High School in Galveston, Texas, in 1939 and Prairie View A&amp;M College in 1942 with a degree in chemistry. He then became a chemistry teacher at George Washington Carver High School in Baytown, Texas, a mustard gas worker at the Pine Bluff Arsenal at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and an apprentice electrician at a shipyard in Richmond, California, before settling in Los Angeles in 1943.

==Career==
===Early success with Johnny Moore===
In Los Angeles, an influx of African Americans from the South during World War II created an integrated nightclub scene in which black performers tended to minimize the rougher blues elements of their style. The blues-club style of a light rhythm bass and right-hand tinkling of the piano and smooth vocals became popular, epitomized by the jazz piano of Nat King Cole. When Cole left Los Angeles to perform nationally, his place was taken by Johnny Moore&#x27;s Three Blazers, featuring Brown&#x27;s gentle piano and vocals.

The Three Blazers signed with Exclusive Records, and their 1945 recording of &quot;Drifting Blues&quot;, with Brown on piano and vocals, stayed on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for six months, putting Brown at the forefront of a musical evolution that changed American musical performance. Brown led the group in a series of further hits for Aladdin over the next three years, including &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot; and the original version of &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; (both in 1947) and &quot;More Than You Know&quot; (1948). Brown&#x27;s style dominated the influential Southern California club scene on Central Avenue, in Los Angeles, during that period. He influenced such performers as Floyd Dixon, Cecil Gant, Ivory Joe Hunter, Percy Mayfield, Johnny Ace and Ray Charles.

===Solo success===
In the late 1940s, a rising demand for blues was driven by a growing audience among white teenagers in the South, which quickly spread north and west. Blues singers such as Louis Jordan, Wynonie Harris and Roy Brown were getting much of the attention, but what writer Charles Keil dubs &quot;the postwar Texas clean-up movement in blues&quot; was also beginning to have an influence, driven by blues artists such as T-Bone Walker, Amos Milburn and Brown. Their singing was lighter and more relaxed, and they worked with bands and combos that had saxophone sections and played from arrangements.

Brown left the Three Blazers in 1948 and formed his own trio with Eddie Williams (bass) and Charles Norris (guitar). He signed with Aladdin Records and had immediate success with &quot;Get Yourself Another Fool&quot; and then had one of his biggest hits, &quot;Trouble Blues&quot;, in 1949, which stayed at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for 15 weeks in the summer of that year. He followed with &quot;In the Evening When the Sun Goes Down&quot;, &quot;Homesick Blues&quot;, and &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Gone&quot;, before having another R&amp;B chart-topping hit with &quot;Black Night&quot;, which stayed at number one for 14 weeks from March to June 1951.

His final hit for several years was &quot;Hard Times&quot; in 1951. Brown&#x27;s approach was too mellow to survive the transition to the harsher rhythms of rock and roll, despite his recording in Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s New Orleans studio in 1956, and he faded from national attention. Though he was unable to compete with the more aggressive sound that was increasing in popularity, he had a small, devoted audience, and his songs were covered by the likes of John Lee Hooker and Lowell Fulson.

His &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot;, a hit for King Records in 1960, remained seasonally popular. &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot; had sold over one million copies by 1968 and was awarded a gold disc in that year.

In the 1960s Brown recorded two albums for Mainstream Records.

===Later career===
In the 1980s Brown made a series of appearances at the New York City nightclub Tramps. As a result of these appearances he signed a recording contract with Blue Side Records and recorded &quot;One More for the Road&quot; in three days. Blue Side Records closed soon after, but distribution of its records was picked up by Alligator Records. Soon after the success of &quot;One More for the Road&quot;, Bonnie Raitt helped usher in a comeback tour for Brown.

He began a recording and performing career again, under the musical direction of the guitarist Danny Caron, to greater success than he had achieved since the 1950s. Other members of Charles&#x27;s touring ensemble included Clifford Solomon on tenor saxophone, Ruth Davies on bass and Gaylord Birch on drums. Several records received Grammy Award nominations. In the 1980s Brown toured widely as the opening act for Raitt.

===Tributes and awards===
Brown was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1996 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. He was a recipient of a 1997 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts in the United States.

Brown was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album three times: in 1991 for &quot;All My Life&quot;, 1992 for &quot;Someone To Love&quot; and 1995 for &quot;Charles Brown&#x27;s Cool Christmas Blues&quot;. Between 1987 and 2005, he was nominated for seventeen Blues Music Awards (formerly known as the W. C. Handy Awards) in multiple categories, with a win in the Blues Instrumentalist: Piano/Keyboard category in 1991, and wins in the Male Blues Vocalist category in 1993 and 1995.

==Death==
Brown died of congestive heart failure in 1999 in Oakland, California, and was interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California.

<text>Saʿadia ben Yosef Gaon (892 – 942) was a prominent rabbi, gaon, Jewish philosopher, and exegete who was active in the Abbasid Caliphate.

Saadia is the first important rabbinic figure to write extensively in Judeo-Arabic. Known for his works on Hebrew linguistics, halakha, and Jewish philosophy, he was a practitioner of the philosophical school known as the &quot;Jewish Kalam&quot;. In this capacity, his philosophical work &quot;The Book of Beliefs and Opinions&quot; represents the first systematic attempt to integrate Jewish theology with components of ancient Greek philosophy. Saadia was also very active in opposition to Karaite Judaism in defense of Rabbinic Judaism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Saadia was born in Dilāẓ in the Faiyum in Middle Egypt in 892. He immigrated to ancient Israel (in the Abbasid province of Bilad Al-Sham) in 915 at the age of 23, where he studied in Tiberias under the scholar Abu Kathir Yaḥya al-Katib (known as Eli ben Yehudah ha-Nazir in Hebrew), a Jewish mutakallim or theologian also mentioned by ibn Ḥazm. In 926, Saadia settled permanently in Lower Mesopotamia, known to Jews as &quot;Babylonia&quot;, where he became a member of Sura Academy.

Saadia, in &quot;Sefer ha-Galui&quot;, stresses his Jewish lineage, claiming to belong to the noble family of Shelah, son of Judah, and counting among his ancestors Hanina ben Dosa, the famous ascetic of the first century. Saadia expressed this claim by calling his son Dosa; this son later served as gaon of Sura Academy from 1012–1018. Regarding Joseph, Saadia&#x27;s father, a statement of the Palestinian gaon Aaron ben Meïr has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave Egypt and died in Jaffa, probably during Saadia&#x27;s prolonged residence in the Holy Land.

The usual nisba &quot;al-Fayyumi&quot; refers to Saadia&#x27;s native place, the Fayyum, which is located in Middle Egypt; in Hebrew, it is often given as &quot;Pitomi&quot;, derived from a contemporary identification of Fayum with the Biblical Pithom, an identification found in Saadia&#x27;s works.

At the age of 20, Saadia began composing his first great work, the Hebrew dictionary called the &quot;Agron&quot;. At 23, he composed a polemic against the followers of Anan ben David, particularly Solomon ben Yeruham, thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to Karaite Judaism in defense of Rabbinic Judaism. In the same year, he left Egypt and moved to Palestine.

In 921, Saadia triumphed over Gaon Aaron ben Meïr over the latter&#x27;s introduction of a new triennial cycle of Torah reading that also changed the dates of Passover and Rosh Hashanah. Later, one of Saadia&#x27;s chief disputants was the Karaite by the name of Abu al-Surri ben Zuṭa, who is referred to by Abraham ibn Ezra, in his commentary on Exodus 21:24 and Leviticus 23:15).

In the year 928, at the age of thirty-six (variant: forty-six), David ben Zakkai, the Exilarch or head of Babylonian Jewry, petitioned Saadia to assume the honorary title of gaon, where he was appointed that same year the Gaon of Sura Academy at Mata Mehasya, a position which he held for 14 years until his death.

After only two years of teaching, Saadia recused himself from teaching because of a dispute that had fallen out between him and the Exilarch. During Saadia&#x27;s absence, his post was occupied by Joseph ben Jacob, the grandson of Natronai ben Hilai. At length, Saadia was reconciled with the Exilarch and returned to serve in his former position, although Joseph ben Jacob also remained serving in his capacity as Gaon.

===Dispute with Ben Meir===
In 922, six years before Saadia was appointed Gaon of Babylonia, a controversy arose concerning the Hebrew calendar, that threatened the entire Jewish community. Since Hillel II (around 359 CE), the calendar had been based on a series of rules (described more fully in Maimonides&#x27; Code) rather than on observation of the lunar phases. One of these rules required the date of Rosh Hashanah to be postponed if the calculated lunar conjunction occurred at noon or later. Rabbi Aaron ben Meïr, head of the Palestinian Gaonate (then located in Ramla), claimed a tradition according to which the cutoff point was 642/1080 of an hour (approximately 35 minutes) after noon. In that particular year, this change would result in a two-day schism with the major Jewish communities in Babylonia: according to Ben Meir the first day of Passover would be on a Sunday, while according to the generally accepted rule it would be on Tuesday.

Saadia was in Aleppo, on his way from the East, when he learned of Ben Meïr&#x27;s regulation of the Jewish calendar. Saadia addressed a warning to him, and in Mesopotamia, he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch David ben Zakkai and the scholars of the academies, adding his letters to those sent by them to the communities of the Jewish diaspora (922). In Babylonia, he wrote his &quot;Sefer haMo&#x27;adim&quot;, or &quot;Book of Festivals,&quot; in which he refuted the assertions of Ben Meïr regarding the calendar and helped to avert from the Jewish community the perils of schism.

===Appointment as Gaon===
His dispute with Ben Meir was an important factor in his call to Sura in 928. The Exilarch insisted on appointing him as Gaon &quot;head of the academy&quot; despite the weight of precedent (no foreigner had ever served as Gaon before) and against the advice of the aged Nissim Nahrwani, a Resh Kallah at Sura, who feared a confrontation between the two strong-willed personalities, Exilarch David and Saadia. Nissim declared, however, that if David was determined to see Saadia in the position, then he would be ready to become the first of Saadia&#x27;s followers. Another factor against Saadia&#x27;s appointment was his relatively undistinguished family, compared to the familial legacies of certain rabbis and their oral traditions. 

Under his leadership, the ancient academy of Sura founded by Abba Arikha entered upon a new period of brilliancy. This renaissance was cut short by a clash between Saadia and David, much as Nissim had predicted.

In a probate case, Saadia refused to sign a verdict of the exilarch, which he thought unjust, although the Gaon of Pumbedita had subscribed to it. When the son of the exilarch threatened Saadia with violence to secure his compliance and was roughly handled by Saadia&#x27;s servant, open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon. Each excommunicated the other, declaring that he deposed his opponent from office. David ben Zakkai appointed Joseph ben Jacob Gaon of Sura and Saadia conferred the exilarchate on David&#x27;s brother Hasan (Josiah; 930).

Hasan was forced to flee and died in exile in Greater Khorasan, and the strife that divided Babylonian Judaism continued. Saadia was attacked by the exilarch and his chief adherent, the young but learned Aaron ibn Sargado (later Gaon of Pumbedita, 943-960), in Hebrew pamphlets. Fragments of these pamphlets show a hatred on the part of the exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal. Saadia did not fail to reply.

===Influence===
Saadia&#x27;s influence upon the Jews of Yemen has been exceptionally great, as many of Saadia&#x27;s extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them. The basis for the Yemenite &quot;tiklāl&quot; is founded upon the prayer format edited originally by Saadia. The Yemenite Jewish community also adopted thirteen penitential verse written by Saadia for Yom Kippur, as well as the liturgical poems composed by him for Hoshana Rabbah, the seventh day of Sukkot.

Saadia&#x27;s Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, the &quot;Tafsir&quot;, was copied by the Yemenite Jews in nearly all their handwritten codices. They originally studied Saadia&#x27;s major work of philosophy, &quot;Beliefs and Opinions&quot;, in its original Judeo-Arabic, although by the early 20th-century, only fragments survived.

===Method of translation===
As much as Saadia&#x27;s Judeo-Arabic translation of the Torah (&quot;Tafsīr&quot;) has brought relief and succour to Jews living in Arabic-speaking countries, his identification of places, fauna and flora, and the stones of the priestly breastplate, has found him at variance with some scholars. Abraham ibn Ezra, in his commentary on the Torah, wrote scathing remarks on Saadia&#x27;s commentary, saying: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have an oral tradition […] perhaps he has a vision in a dream, while he has already erred with respect to certain places […]; therefore, we will not rely on his dreams.&quot;

However, Saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty-odd unclean fowl mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, his translation was based on an oral tradition received by him. Saadia&#x27;s method of conveying names for the fowls based on what he had received by way of an oral tradition prompted him to add in his defense: &quot;Every detail about them, had one of them merely come unto us [for identification], we would not have been able to identify it for certain, much less recognize their related kinds.&quot;

The question often asked by scholars now is whether Saadia applied this principle in his other translations. &quot;Re&#x27;em&quot; (), as in Deuteronomy 33:17, improperly translated as &quot;unicorn&quot; in some English translations, is a word that is now used in Modern Hebrew to represent the &quot;oryx.&quot; However, Saadia understood the same word to mean &quot;rhinoceros&quot; and writes there the Judeo-Arabic word for the creature (). He interprets the &quot;zamer&quot; () in Deuteronomy 14:5 as giraffe. 
In Saadia&#x27;s translation and commentary on the &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Tasābiḥ&quot;), he has done what no other medieval writer has done before him, bringing down a biblical exegesis and noting where the verse is to be read as a rhetorical question, and where the verse itself derides the question with good humor:
Saadia&#x27;s approach to rabbinic exegesis and midrashic literature was ambivalent. Although he adopted them in his liturgies, he did not recoil from denouncing them in his commentary on the Bible whenever he thought that they broke-away from the plain and ordinary meaning of the text. Saadia adopts in principle the method of the Sages that even the episodic-like parts of the Bible (e.g. story of Abraham and Sarah, the selling of Joseph, etc.) that do not contain commandments have a moral lesson to tell.

In some instances, Saadia&#x27;s biblical translations reflect his own rationale of difficult Hebrew words based on their lexical root, and he will, at times, reject the earlier Targum for his own understanding. For example, in Psalm 16:4, Saadia retracts from the Targum (translated): &quot;They will multiply their goddesses (); they have hastened after some other thing; I shall not pour out their libations of blood, neither shall I take-up their names upon my lips,&quot; writing instead: &quot;They will multiply their revenues (Judeo-Arabic: אכסאבהם); they have hastened after some other thing,&quot; etc. Even where a certain explanation is given in the Talmud, such as the Hebrew words in Exo. 30:34 (explained in &quot;Taanit&quot; 7a as meaning &quot;each spice pounded separately&quot;), Saadia deviates from the rabbinic tradition in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, in this case explaining its sense as &quot;having them made of equal portions.&quot;

In another apparent deviation from Talmudic tradition, where the Talmud (&quot;Hullin&quot; 63a) names a biblical species of fowl known as &quot;raḥam&quot; () and says that it is the colorful European bee-eater called the &quot;sheraqraq&quot;, Saadia in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Humash writes that &quot;raḥam&quot; is the Egyptian vulture based on the phonetic similarity of its Arabic name with the Hebrew. The &quot;sheraqraq&quot; () is a bird that harbingers rain in the Levant (around October), for which reason the Talmud says: &quot;When &quot;raḥam&quot; arrives, mercy (&quot;raḥamīm&quot;) comes into the world.&quot;

===Later years===
He wrote both in Hebrew and in Arabic a work, now known only from a few fragments, entitled &quot;Sefer ha-Galui&quot; (Arabic title, &quot;Kitab al-Ṭarid&quot;), in which he emphasized with great but justifiable pride the services which he had rendered, especially in his opposition to heresy.

The fourteen years which Saadia spent in Babylonia did not interrupt his literary activity. His principal philosophical work was completed in 933; and four years later, through Ibn Sargado&#x27;s father-in-law, Bishr ben Aaron, the two enemies were reconciled. Saadia was reinstated in his office; but he held it for only five more years. David b. Zakkai died before him (c. 940), being followed a few months later by the exilarch&#x27;s son Judah, while David&#x27;s young grandson was nobly protected by Saadia as by a father. According to a statement made by Abraham ibn Daud and doubtless derived from Saadia&#x27;s son Dosa, Saadia himself died in Babylonia at Sura in 942, at the age of sixty, of &quot;black gall&quot; (melancholia), repeated illnesses having undermined his health.

===Mention in Sefer Hasidim===
An anecdote is reported in &quot;Sefer Hasidim&quot; about Saadia ben Yosef &quot;the sage,&quot; in which he ends a dispute between a servant who claims to be the heir of his deceased master and the man&#x27;s true son and heir by having them both draw blood into separate vessels. He then took a bone from the deceased man and placed it into each of the cups. The bone in the cup of the true heir absorbed the blood, while the servant&#x27;s blood was not absorbed in the bone. Using this as genetic proof of the son&#x27;s true inheritance, Saadia had the servant return the man&#x27;s property to his son.

==Significance==
Saadia Gaon was a pioneer in the fields in which he toiled. The foremost object of his work was the Bible; his importance is due primarily to his establishment of a new school of Biblical exegesis characterized by a rational investigation of the contents of the Bible and a scientific knowledge of the language of the holy text.

Saadia&#x27;s Arabic translation of the Torah is of importance for the history of civilization; itself a product of the Arabization of a large portion of Judaism, it served for centuries as a potent factor in the impregnation of the Jewish spirit with Arabic culture, so that, in this respect, it may take its place beside the Greek translation of antiquity and the German translation of the Pentateuch by Moses Mendelssohn. As a means of popular religious enlightenment, Saadia&#x27;s translation presented the Scriptures even to the unlearned in a rational form which aimed at the greatest possible degree of clarity and consistency.

His system of hermeneutics was not limited to the exegesis of individual passages, but also treated each book of the Bible as a whole, showing the connection of its various portions with one another.

The commentary contained, as is stated in the author&#x27;s own introduction to his translation of the Pentateuch, not only an exact interpretation of the text, but also a refutation of the cavils which the heretics raised against it. Further, it set forth the bases of the commandments of reason and the characterization of the commandments of revelation; in the case of the former the author appealed to philosophical speculation; of the latter, naturally, to tradition.

The position assigned to Saadia in the oldest list of Hebrew grammarians, which is contained in the introduction to Abraham ibn Ezra&#x27;s &quot;Moznayim,&quot; has not been challenged even by the latest historical investigations. Here, too, he was the first; his grammatical work, now lost, gave an inspiration to further studies, which attained their most brilliant and lasting results in Spain, and he created in part the categories and rules along whose lines was developed the grammatical study of the Hebrew language. His dictionary, primitive and merely practical as it was, became the foundation of Hebrew lexicography; and the name &quot;Agron&quot; (literally, &quot;collection&quot;), which he chose and doubtless created, was long used as a designation for Hebrew lexicons, especially by the Karaites. The very categories of rhetoric, as they were found among the Arabs, were first applied by Saadia to the style of the Bible. He was likewise one of the founders of comparative philology, not only through his brief &quot;Book of Seventy Words,&quot; already mentioned, but especially through his explanation of the Hebrew vocabulary by the Arabic, particularly in the case of the favorite translation of Biblical words by Arabic terms having the same sound.

Saadia&#x27;s works were the inspiration and basis for later Jewish writers, such as Berachyah in his encyclopedic philosophical work &quot;Sefer Hahibbur&quot; (The Book of Compilation).

Saadia likewise identifies the definitive trait of &quot;a cock girded about the loins&quot; within Proverbs 30:31 (Douay–Rheims Bible) as &quot;the honesty of their behavior and their success&quot;, rather than the aesthetic interpretations of so many others, thus identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema of purpose and use.

==Relations to mysticism==
In his commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah, Saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work by the light of philosophy and scientific knowledge, especially by a system of Hebrew phonology which he himself had founded. He did not permit himself in this commentary to be influenced by the theological speculations of the Kalam, which are so important in his main works. In introducing Sefer Yetzirah&#x27;s theory of creation he makes a distinction between the Biblical account of creation ex nihilo, in which no process of creation is described, and the process described in Sefer Yetzirah (matter formed by speech). The cosmogony of Sefer Yetzirah is even omitted from the discussion of creation in his magnum opus &quot;Kitab al-Amanat wal-I&#x27;tiḳadat.&quot; Concerning the supposed attribution of the book to the patriarch Abraham, he allows that the ideas it contains might be ancient. Nonetheless, he clearly considered the work worthy of deep study and echoes of Sefer Yetzirah&#x27;s cosmogony do appear in &quot;Kitab al-Amanat wal-I&#x27;tiḳadat&quot; when Saadia discusses his theory of prophecy.

==Works==

===Exegesis===
Saadia translated the Humash and some of the other books of the Hebrew Bible into Judeo-Arabic, adding a Judeo-Arabic commentary.
* Torah
* Isaiah
* Megillot
* Tehillim (Judeo-Arabic translation and commentary, which he called &quot;Kitāb al-tasbiḥ&quot; [= &quot;the Book of Praise&quot;])
* Iyyov (Book of Job) (translated to English by Dr. Goodman), and Mishlei
* Daniel
Saadia translated Megillat Antiochus into Judeo-Arabic and wrote an introduction.

===Hebrew linguistics===
# &quot;Agron&quot;
# &quot;Kutub al-Lughah&quot;, also known as &quot;Kitāb faṣīḥ lughat al-‘ibrāniyyīn&quot;, “The Book of Eloquent Language of the Hebrews”
# &quot;Tafsir al-Sab&#x27;ina Lafẓah,&quot; a list of seventy (properly ninety) Hebrew (and Aramaic) words which occur in the Hebrew Bible only once or very rarely, and which may be explained from traditional literature, especially from the Neo-Hebraisms of the Mishnah. This small work has been frequently reprinted.

===Halakhic writings===
# Short monographs in which problems of Jewish law are systematically presented. Of these Arabic treatises, little but the titles and extracts is known, and it is only in the &quot;Kitab al-Mawarith&quot; that fragments of any length have survived.
# A commentary on the thirteen rules of Rabbi Ishmael, preserved only in a Hebrew translation by Nahum Ma&#x27;arabi. An Arabic methodology of the Talmud is also mentioned, by Azulai, as a work of Saadia under the title &quot;Kelale ha-Talmud&quot;.
#Responsa. With few exceptions these exist only in Hebrew, some of them having been probably written in that language.
# The Siddur of Saadia Gaon (&quot;Kitāb jāmiʿ al-ṣalawāt wal-tasābīḥ&quot;), containing the texts of the prayers, commentary in Arabic and original synagogal poetry. Of this synagogal poetry the most noteworthy portions are the &quot;Azharot&quot; on the 613 commandments, which give the author&#x27;s name as &quot;Sa&#x27;id b. Joseph&quot;, followed by the title &quot;Alluf,&quot; thus showing that the poems were written before he became gaon.

===Philosophy of religion===
# Emunoth ve-Deoth (&quot;Kitāb al-amānāt wa-al-iʿatiqādāt&quot;), the &quot;Book of Beliefs and Opinions&quot;: This work, first compiled in 933 CE, of which several revisions were made until its final redaction, is considered to be the first systematic attempt to synthesize the Jewish tradition with philosophical teachings. Prior to Saadia, the only other Jew to attempt any such fusion was Philo . Saadia&#x27;s objective here was to show the parallelism between the truths delivered to the people of Israel by Divine revelation, on the one side, and the necessary conclusions that can also be reached by way of rational observation, on the other. The effect of these ideas expressed in his philosophical books are clearly reflected in Saadia&#x27;s story of creation, especially when he comes to deal with the theological problems, such as in the verse of Deuteronomy 4:24: “For the LORD your God is a devouring fire,” which constitutes an example of a verse that cannot be understood in its plain context, but should rather be understood in such a way as not to contradict one&#x27;s definite knowledge that God does not change, nor can anything corporeal be associated with him. 
# &quot;Tafsīr Kitāb al-Mabādī&quot;, an Arabic translation of and commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah, written while its author was still residing in Egypt (or Israel), and intended to explain in a scientific manner how the universe came into existence. On the linguistic aspect, Saadia combines a debate on the letters and on their attributes (e.g. phonemes), as well as a debate on related linguistic matters.

===Polemical writings===
# Refutations of Karaite authors, always designated by the name &quot;Kitab al-Radd,&quot; or &quot;Book of Refutation.&quot; These three works are known only from scanty references to them in other works; that the third was written after 933 is proved by one of the citations.
# &quot;Kitab al-Tamyiz&quot; (in Hebrew, &quot;Sefer ha-Hakkarah&quot;), or &quot;Book of Distinction,&quot; composed in 926, and Saadia&#x27;s most extensive polemical work. It was still cited in the twelfth century; and a number of passages from it are given in a Biblical commentary of Japheth ha-Levi.
# There was perhaps a special polemic of Saadia against Ben Zuta, though the data regarding this controversy between is known only from the gaon&#x27;s gloss on the Torah.
# A refutation directed against the rationalistic Biblical critic Hiwi al-Balkhi, whose views were rejected by the Karaites themselves;
# &quot;Kitab al-Shara&#x27;i&#x27;,&quot; or &quot;Book of the Commandments of Religion.&quot;
# &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Ibbur,&quot; or &quot;Book of the Calendar,&quot; likewise apparently containing polemics against Karaite Jews;
# &quot;Sefer ha-Mo&#x27;adim,&quot; or &quot;Book of Festivals,&quot; the Hebrew polemic against Ben Meir which has been mentioned above.
# &quot;Sefer ha-Galui,&quot; also composed in Hebrew and in the same flowery biblical style as the &quot;Sefer ha-Mo&#x27;adim,&quot; being an autobiographical and apologetic work directed against the Exilarch (&quot;rosh galuth&quot;), David b. Zakkai, and his chief patron, Aharon ibn Sargado, in which he proved his own uprightness and equity in the matter of controversy between them.

<text>Jaipur (; , ) is the capital and the largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. , the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the &quot;Pink City&quot; due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city.

==Etymology==
Jaipur derives its name from Sawai Jai Singh II (1693-1744), the ruler of Amer, who founded the city in 1727. In Sanskrit, variations of the word &quot;pur&quot; or &quot;pura&quot; are commonly used to refer to a city or town with &quot;Jaipur&quot; essentially meaning &quot;The City of Jai&quot; or &quot;Jai&#x27;s City,&quot; paying homage to Maharaja Jai Singh II, who established the city.

Jai Singh consulted with several architects while planning the layout of Jaipur and established the city on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. The construction of the city began in 1726. During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert Edward, Prince of Wales in 1876.

<text>Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 – February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, alternatively billed as Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, was an American singer, jazz pianist, and actor. Cole&#x27;s career as a jazz and pop vocalist started in the late 1930s and spanned almost three decades where he found success and recorded over 100 songs that became hits on the pop charts.

Cole started his career as a jazz pianist in the late 1930s, when he formed the King Cole Trio, which became the top-selling group (and the only black act) on Capitol Records in the 1940s. Cole&#x27;s trio was the model for small jazz ensembles that followed. Starting in 1950, he transitioned to become a solo singer billed as Nat King Cole. Despite achieving mainstream success, Cole faced intense racial discrimination during his career. While not a major vocal public figure in the civil rights movement, Cole was a member of his local NAACP branch and participated in the 1963 March on Washington. He regularly performed for civil rights organizations. From 1956 to 1957, Cole hosted the NBC variety series &quot;The Nat King Cole Show&quot;, which became the first nationally broadcast television show hosted by a black American.

Some of Cole&#x27;s most notable singles include &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;L-O-V-E&quot;, &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Love&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Straighten Up and Fly Right&quot;, &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;, &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;, &quot;Embraceable You&quot; and &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;. His 1960 Christmas album &quot;The Magic of Christmas&quot; (also known as &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;), is the best-selling Christmas album released in the 1960s; and was ranked as one of the 40 essential Christmas albums (2019) by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2022, Cole&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, broke the record for the longest journey to the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, when it peaked at number nine, 62 years after it debuted on the chart; and was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry. NPR named him one of the 50 Great Voices. Cole received numerous accolades including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1960) and a Special Achievement Golden Globe Award. Posthumously, Cole has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1990), along with the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award (1992) and has been inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame (1997), Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2000), and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame (2020).

Cole was the father of singer Natalie Cole (1950–2015), who covered her father&#x27;s songs in the 1991 album &quot;Unforgettable... with Love&quot;.

==Early life==
Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 17, 1919. He had three brothers: Eddie (1910–1970), Ike (1927–2001), and Freddy (1931–2020), and a half-sister, Joyce Coles. Each of the Coles brothers pursued careers in music. When Cole was four years old, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where his father, Edward, became a Baptist minister.

Cole learned to play the organ from his mother, Perlina Coles, the church organist. His first performance was &quot;Yes! We Have No Bananas&quot; at the age of four. Cole began formal piano lessons at 12, learning jazz, gospel, and classical music &quot;from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff&quot;. As a youth, Cole joined the news delivery boys&#x27; &quot;Bud Billiken Club&quot; band for &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;.

Cole and his family moved to the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago, where Cole attended Wendell Phillips Academy High School, the school Sam Cooke attended a few years later. Cole participated in Walter Dyett&#x27;s music program at DuSable High School. He would sneak out of the house to visit clubs, sitting outside to hear Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Noone.

==Career==
===Early career===

When he was 15, Cole dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. After his brother Eddie, a bassist, came home from touring with Noble Sissle, they formed a sextet and recorded two singles for Decca in 1936 as Eddie Cole&#x27;s Swingsters. They performed in a revival of the musical &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. Nat Cole went on tour with the musical. In 1937, he married Nadine Robinson, who was a member of the cast. After the show ended in Los Angeles, Cole and Nadine settled there while he looked for work.

One day in 1938, as he was relaxing in his hotel room, Bing Crosby heard the Nat Cole Trio for the first time from Jim Otto’s Steak House, and then took Johnny Mercer to hear them. Crosby soon had the trio on his &#x27;Kraft Music Hall&#x27; radio program, and Mercer would later sign them upon founding Capitol Records. In 1944, “Straighten Up and Fly Right” soared to the top of the charts.
With Crosby continually bringing them back on his program, the Trio even substituted for him in the summer of 1946.
Cole led a big band and found work playing piano in nightclubs. When a club owner asked him to form a band, Cole hired bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore. They called themselves the King Cole Swingsters after the nursery rhyme in which &quot;Old King Cole was a merry old soul&quot;. They changed their name to the King Cole Trio before making radio transcriptions and recording for small labels.

===1940s===
Cole recorded &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; in 1940, and it became his first hit. According to legend, his career as a vocalist started when a drunken bar patron demanded that Cole sing the song. He said that this fabricated story sounded good, so Cole did not argue with it. There was a customer one night who demanded that he sing, but because it was a song Cole did not know, he sang &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; instead. As people heard Cole&#x27;s vocal talent, they requested more vocal songs, and he obliged.

In 1941, the trio recorded &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Right&quot; for Decca, followed the next year by &quot;All for You&quot; for Excelsior. They recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Lost&quot;, a song written by Otis René, the owner of Excelsior.

Cole was the original house pianist for Jazz at the Philharmonic and performed at the first recorded concert in 1944. He was credited on Mercury as &quot;Shorty Nadine&quot;, a derivative of his wife&#x27;s name, because Cole had an exclusive contract with Capitol since signing with the label the year before. He used a variety of other pseudonyms for the same reason, including Eddie Laguna, Sam Schmaltz, Nature Boy and A Guy, &quot;or whatever name for himself he could think of, but only as an instrumentalist, never as a vocalist.&quot; Cole recorded with Illinois Jacquet and Lester Young.

In 1946, the trio broadcast &quot;King Cole Trio Time&quot;, a 15-minute radio program. This was the first radio program to be hosted by a black musician. From 1946 to 1948, the trio recorded radio transcriptions for Capitol Records Transcription Service. They performed on the radio programs &quot;Swing Soiree&quot;, &quot;Old Gold&quot;, &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;, &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, and &quot;The Orson Welles Almanac&quot;.

Cole began recording and performing pop-oriented material in which he was often accompanied by a string orchestra. Cole&#x27;s stature as a popular star was cemented by hits such as &quot;All for You&quot; (1943), &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (1947), &quot;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&quot;, &quot;(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons&quot; (1946), &quot;There! I&#x27;ve Said It Again&quot; (1947), &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (1948), &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (No. 1 song of 1950), &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot; (1950), &quot;Too Young&quot; (the No. 1 song of 1951).

=== 1950s ===
On June 7, 1953, Cole performed for the ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Chicago which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr.. Featured that day were Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Shorty Rogers, Earl Bostic, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, and Louis Armstrong and his All Stars with Velma Middleton.

On November 5, 1956, &quot;The Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole Show&quot; debuted on NBC. The variety program was one of the first hosted by an African American. The program started at a length of fifteen minutes but was increased to a half-hour in July 1957. Rheingold Beer was a regional sponsor, but a national sponsor was never found. The show was in trouble financially despite efforts by NBC, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Eartha Kitt, Frankie Laine, Peggy Lee, and Mel Tormé. Cole decided to end the program. The last episode aired on December 17, 1957. Commenting on the lack of sponsorship, Cole said shortly after its demise: &quot;Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.&quot;

Throughout the 1950s, Cole continued to record hits that sold millions throughout the world, such as &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Pretend&quot;, &quot;A Blossom Fell&quot;, and &quot;If I May&quot;. His pop hits were collaborations with Nelson Riddle, Gordon Jenkins, and Ralph Carmichael. Riddle arranged several of Cole&#x27;s 1950s albums, including &quot;Nat King Cole Sings for Two in Love&quot; (1953), his first 10-inch LP. In 1955, &quot;Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup&quot; reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;Love Is the Thing&quot; went to number one in April 1957 and remained his only number one album.

In 1959, Cole received a Grammy Award for Best Performance By a &quot;Top 40&quot; Artist for &quot;Midnight Flyer&quot;.

In 1958, Cole went to Havana, Cuba, to record &quot;Cole Español&quot;, an album sung entirely in Spanish. It was so popular in Latin America and the U.S. that it was followed by two more Spanish-language albums: &quot;A Mis Amigos&quot; (1959) and &quot;More Cole Español&quot; (1962).

After the change in musical tastes, Cole&#x27;s ballads appealed little to young listeners, despite a successful attempt at rock and roll with &quot;Send for Me&quot;, which peaked at number 6 on the pop chart. Like Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop chart had been taken over by youth-oriented acts.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Cole&#x27;s longtime collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol to join Reprise Records, which was established by Frank Sinatra. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album, &quot;Wild Is Love&quot;, with lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an Off-Broadway show, &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;.

Nevertheless, Cole recorded several hit singles during the 1960s, including &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; with George Shearing in 1961, the country-flavored hit &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Rose&quot; in August 1962 (reaching No. 2 on the Pop chart), &quot;Dear Lonely Hearts&quot; (No. 13), &quot;That Sunday, That Summer&quot; (No. 12) and &quot;Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer&quot; (his final top-ten hit, reaching number 6 on the Pop chart). Cole performed in many short films, sitcoms, and television shows and played W. C. Handy in the film &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1958). Cole appeared in &quot;The Nat King Cole Story&quot;, &quot;China Gate&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953).

In January 1964, Cole made one of his final television appearances, on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. He was introduced as &quot;the best friend a song ever had&quot; and sang &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;. &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; (1965), Cole&#x27;s final film, was released several months after his death.

Earlier on, Cole&#x27;s shift to traditional pop led some jazz critics and fans to accuse him of selling out, but he never abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, Cole recorded an all-jazz album, &quot;After Midnight&quot;, and many of his albums after this are fundamentally jazz-based, being scored for big band without strings, although the arrangements focus primarily on the vocal rather than instrumental leads.

Cole had one of his last major hits in 1963, two years before his death, with &quot;Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer&quot;, which reached number 6 on the Pop chart. &quot;Unforgettable&quot; was made famous again in 1991 by Cole&#x27;s daughter Natalie when modern recording technology was used to reunite father and daughter in a duet. The duet version rose to the top of the pop charts, almost forty years after its original popularity.

Cole&#x27;s final studio album was titled &quot;L-O-V-E&quot;. The album peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Albums chart in the spring of 1965.

==Personal life==
Around the time Cole launched his singing career, he entered into Freemasonry. Cole was raised in January 1944 in the Thomas Waller Lodge No. 49 in California. The lodge was named after fellow Prince Hall mason and jazz musician Fats Waller. Cole joined the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, becoming a 32nd Degree Mason.

Cole was &quot;an avid baseball fan&quot;, particularly of Hank Aaron. In 1968, Nelson Riddle related an incident from some years earlier and told of music studio engineers, searching for a source of noise, finding Cole listening to a game on a transistor radio.

===Marriages and children===

Cole met his first wife, Nadine Robinson, while they were on tour for the all-black Broadway musical &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. Cole was 18 when they married and she was the reason why he moved to Los Angeles and formed the Nat King Cole trio. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1948.

On March 28, 1948 (Easter Sunday), six days after his divorce became final, Cole married singer Maria Hawkins. The Coles were married in Harlem&#x27;s Abyssinian Baptist Church by Adam Clayton Powell Jr. They had five children: Natalie (1950–2015), who had a successful career as a singer before dying of congestive heart failure at age 65; an adopted daughter, Carole (1944–2009, the daughter of Maria&#x27;s sister), who died of lung cancer at the age of 64; an adopted son, Nat Kelly Cole (1959–1995), who died of AIDS at the age of 36; and twin daughters, Casey and Timolin, born September 26, 1961. Maria supported Cole during his final illness and stayed with him until his death. In an interview, she emphasized his musical legacy and the class he exhibited despite his imperfections.

===Experiences with racism===
In August 1948, Cole purchased a house from Col. Harry Gantz, the ex-husband of silent film actress Lois Weber, in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, a burning cross was placed on his front lawn and the property-owners association told Cole they did not want any &quot;undesirables&quot; moving into the neighborhood. Cole responded, &quot;Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I&#x27;ll be the first to complain.&quot; His dog died after eating poisoned meat, something likely to be connected to his moving to the neighborhood.

In 1956, Cole was contracted to perform in Cuba. He wanted to stay at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba in Havana but was refused because it operated a color bar. Cole honored his contract, and the concert at the Tropicana Club was a huge success. The following year, Cole returned to Cuba for another concert, singing many songs in Spanish.

====1956 Birmingham assault====
Cole was assaulted during a concert on April 10, 1956, in Birmingham, Alabama, while singing the song &quot;Little Girl&quot; on stage with the Ted Heath Band. After photographs of Cole with white female fans were circulated bearing such incendiary, boldface captions as &quot;Cole and His White Women&quot; and &quot;Cole and Your Daughter&quot;, three men belonging to the North Alabama Citizens Council attacked Cole in an apparent attempt to kidnap him.

The three assailants ran down the aisles of the auditorium towards Cole. Local law enforcement quickly ended their invasion of the stage, but not until Cole was toppled from his piano bench and received a slight injury to his back. He did not finish the concert. Police later found rifles, a blackjack, and brass knuckles, in a car outside the venue. A fourth member of the group was later arrested. All were tried and convicted.

Six men, including 23-year-old Willie Richard Vinson, were formally charged with assault with intent to murder Cole, but the charges against four of them was later changed to conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor. The original plan to attack Cole included 150 men from Birmingham and nearby towns.

&quot;I can&#x27;t understand it,&quot; Cole said afterwards. &quot;I have not taken part in any protests. Nor have I joined an organization fighting segregation. Why should they attack me?&quot; Cole wanted to forget the incident and continued to play for segregated audiences in the American South. He said he could not change the situation in a day. He contributed money to the Montgomery bus boycott and previously sued Northern hotels that had hired him but refused to serve him.

====Criticism and involvement in the Civil Rights Movement====
Thurgood Marshall, then-the chief legal counsel of the NAACP, said &quot;All Cole needs to complete his role as an Uncle Tom is a banjo.&quot; Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the NAACP, wrote him a telegram that said:
&quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; said that Cole&#x27;s performances for all-white audiences were an insult to his race. The &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; said that &quot;thousands of Harlem blacks who have worshiped at the shrine of singer Nat King Cole turned their backs on him this week as the noted crooner turned his back on the NAACP and said that he will continue to play to Jim Crow audiences&quot;. To play &quot;Uncle Nat&#x27;s&quot; discs, wrote a commentator in &quot;The American Negro&quot;, &quot;would be supporting his &#x27;traitor&#x27; ideas and narrow way of thinking&quot;.

Deeply hurt by the criticism in the black press, Cole was chastened. Emphasizing his opposition to racial segregation &quot;in any form&quot;, he agreed to join other entertainers in boycotting segregated venues. He paid $500 to become a lifetime member of the Detroit branch of the NAACP. Until his death in 1965, Cole was an active and visible participant in the civil rights movement, playing an important role in planning the March on Washington in 1963.

===Politics===
Cole performed in 1956 for President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s televised birthday celebration. At the 1956 Republican National Convention, he sang &quot;That&#x27;s All There Is to That&quot; and was &quot;greeted with applause&quot;.

Cole was also present at the Democratic National Convention in 1960 to support Senator John F. Kennedy. Cole was among the dozens of entertainers recruited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the Kennedy Inaugural gala in 1961. Cole consulted with Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, on civil rights.

==Illness and death==
In September 1964, Cole began to lose weight and experienced back problems. He collapsed with pain after performing at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In December, Cole was working in San Francisco when he was finally persuaded by friends to seek medical help. A malignant tumor in an advanced state of growth on Cole&#x27;s left lung was observed on a chest X-ray. Cole, who was a heavy cigarette smoker, had lung cancer and was expected to have only months to live. Against his doctors&#x27; wishes, Cole carried on his work and made his final recordings between December 1 and 3 in San Francisco, with an orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. The music was released on the album &quot;L-O-V-E&quot; shortly before Cole died. His daughter noted later that he did this to assure the welfare of his family.

Cole entered Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica on December 7, 1964, and cobalt therapy was started on December 10. Frank Sinatra performed in Cole&#x27;s place at the grand opening of the new Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center on December 12. Cole&#x27;s condition gradually worsened, but he was released from the hospital over the New Year&#x27;s period. At home, Cole was able to see the hundreds of thousands of cards and letters that had been sent after news of his illness was made public. Cole returned to the hospital in early January 1965. He also sent $5,000 (US$ in dollars) to actress and singer Gunilla Hutton, with whom Cole had been romantically involved since early 1964.

Hutton later telephoned Maria and implored her to divorce him. Maria confronted her husband, and Cole finally broke off the relationship with Hutton. Cole&#x27;s illness reconciled him with his wife, and Cole vowed that if he recovered, he would go on television to urge people to stop smoking. On January 25, Cole&#x27;s entire left lung was surgically removed. His father died of heart problems on February 1. Throughout Cole&#x27;s illness, his publicists promoted the idea that he would soon be well and working, despite the private knowledge of his terminal condition. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Nat King Cole has successfully come through a serious operation and... the future looks bright for &#x27;the master&#x27; to resume his career again&quot;. On Valentine&#x27;s Day, Cole and his wife briefly left St. John&#x27;s to drive by the sea. Cole died at the hospital early in the morning hours of Monday, February 15, 1965, at the age of 45.
Cole&#x27;s funeral was held on February 18 at St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles; 400 people were present inside the church, and thousands gathered outside. Hundreds of members of the public had filed past the coffin the day before. Honorary pallbearers included Robert F. Kennedy, Count Basie, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Johnny Mathis, George Burns, Danny Thomas, Jimmy Durante, Alan Livingston, Frankie Laine, Steve Allen, and Pat Brown, the governor of California.

The eulogy was delivered by Jack Benny, who said that &quot;Nat Cole was a man who gave so much and still had so much to give. He gave it in song, in friendship to his fellow man, devotion to his family. He was a star, a tremendous success as an entertainer, an institution. But he was an even greater success as a man, as a husband, as a father, as a friend.&quot; Cole&#x27;s remains were interred in Freedom Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.

==Posthumous releases==
Cole&#x27;s last album, &quot;L-O-V-E&quot;, was recorded in early December 1964—just a few days before he entered the hospital for cancer treatment—and was released just before his death. It peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Albums chart in the spring of 1965. A &quot;Best Of&quot; album was certified a gold record in 1968. His 1957 recording of &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; reached number 4 in the UK charts in 1987, released in reaction to a version by Rick Astley challenging for the coveted Christmas number 1 spot.

In 1983, an archivist for EMI Electrola Records, a subsidiary of EMI (Capitol&#x27;s parent company until 2013) in Germany, discovered some unreleased recordings by Cole, including one in Japanese and another in Spanish (&quot;Tu Eres Tan Amable&quot;). Capitol released them later that year as the LP &quot;Unreleased&quot;.

In 1991, Mosaic Records released &quot;The Complete Capitol Records Recordings of the Nat King Cole Trio&quot;, a compilation of 349 songs available as an 18-CD or a 27-LP set. In 2008, it was re-released in digital-download format through services like iTunes and Amazon Music.

Also in 1991, Natalie Cole recorded a new vocal track that was mixed with her father&#x27;s 1961 stereo re-recording of his 1951 hit &quot;Unforgettable&quot; for a tribute album of the same title on Elektra Records. The song and album won seven Grammy awards in 1992 for Best Album and Best Song.

There have been many tribute albums, including one by his brother, Freddy. Randy Napoleon, Freddy Cole&#x27;s guitarist and arranger for 13 years, has performed and recorded tributes to the Cole family.

In 2009, the year of the inauguration of Barack Obama as America&#x27;s first black president, Capitol released an album &quot;Voices of Change, Then and Now&quot;. On this album is the song &quot;We Are Americans Too&quot; that Capitol did not release in 1956, the year that Nat King Cole wrote it.

<doc id="166539" wikidata="Q1101938" url="?curid=166539" title="Clive Davis">
<text>Clive Jay Davis (born April 4, 1932) is an American record producer, A&amp;R executive, record executive, and lawyer. He has won five Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a non-performer, in 2000.

From 1967 to 1973, Davis was the president of Columbia Records. He was founder and president of Arista Records from 1974 through 2000 until founding J Records. From 2002 until April 2008, he was chair and CEO of the RCA Music Group (which included RCA Records, J Records, and Arista Records), chair and CEO of J Records, and chair and CEO of BMG North America.

Davis is credited with hiring a young recording artist, Tony Orlando, for Columbia in 1967. He has signed many artists who achieved significant success, including Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin, Laura Nyro, Santana, Bruce Springsteen, Chicago, Billy Joel, Donovan, Bay City Rollers, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Loggins and Messina, Ace of Base, Aerosmith, Olivia Longott, Pink Floyd and Westlife. He is also credited with bringing Whitney Houston and Barry Manilow to prominence.

As of 2018, Davis is the chief creative officer of Sony Music Entertainment.

== Early life and education ==
Davis was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jewish parents, Herman and Florence Davis. His father was an electrician and salesman. Davis was raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and attended Erasmus Hall High School.

His mother died at age 47, and his father died the following year when Davis was still a teenager. He then moved in with his married sister, who lived in Bayside, Queens.

Davis attended New York University College of Arts &amp; Science, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in political science and Phi Beta Kappa in 1953. He received a full scholarship to Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Board of Student Advisers and graduated in 1956.

== Career ==
=== Columbia/CBS Records years ===
Davis practiced law in a small firm in New York, then moved on to the firm of Rosenman, Colin, Kaye, Petschek, and Freund two years later, where partner Ralph Colin had CBS as a client. Davis was subsequently hired by a former colleague at the firm, Harvey Schein, to become assistant counsel of CBS subsidiary Columbia Records at age 28, and then general counsel the following year.

As part of a reorganization of Columbia Records Group, group president Goddard Lieberson appointed Davis as administrative vice president and general manager in 1965. In 1966, CBS formed the Columbia-CBS Group which reorganized CBS&#x27;s recorded music operations into CBS Records with Davis heading the new unit.

The next year, Davis was appointed president and became interested in the newest generation of folk rock and rock and roll. One of his earliest pop signings was the British folk-rock musician Donovan, who enjoyed a string of successful hit singles and albums released in the U.S. on the Epic Records label. That same year, Davis hired 23-year-old recording artist Tony Orlando as general manager of Columbia publishing subsidiary April-Blackwood Music; Orlando went on to become vice-president of Columbia/CBS Music and signed Barry Manilow in 1969.

In June 1967, Davis attended the Monterey Pop Festival after his friends and business associate, Lou Adler, convinced him. He immediately signed Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Columbia went on to sign Laura Nyro, The Electric Flag, Santana, The Chambers Brothers, Bruce Springsteen, Chicago, Billy Joel; Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Loggins and Messina, Aerosmith, and Pink Floyd (for rights to release their material outside of Europe). 

One of the most commercially successful recordings released during Davis&#x27; tenure at Columbia was Lynn Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Rose Garden&quot;, in late 1970. It was Davis who insisted that &quot;Rose Garden&quot; be the country singer&#x27;s next single release. The song crossed over and was a No. 1 hit in 16 countries worldwide. &quot;Rose Garden&quot; remained the biggest-selling album by a female country artist for 27 years.

In 1972, Davis signed Earth, Wind &amp; Fire to Columbia Records. One of his most recognized accomplishments was signing the Boston group Aerosmith to Columbia Records in the early 1970s at New York City&#x27;s Max&#x27;s Kansas City. The accomplishment was mentioned in the 1979 Aerosmith song &quot;No Surprize&quot;, where Steven Tyler sings, &quot;Old Clive Davis said he&#x27;s surely gonna make us a star, I&#x27;m gonna make you a star, just the way you are.&quot; Starting on December 30, 1978, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead occasionally changed the lyrics of the Dead standard &quot;Jack Straw&quot; in concert from &quot;we used to play for silver, now we play for life&quot;, to &quot;we used to play for acid, now we play for Clive.&quot;

One of the last bands Davis tried to sign to Columbia Records was the Detroit band Death. 

=== Arista years ===

After Davis was fired from CBS Records in 1973 for allegedly using company funds to bankroll his son&#x27;s bar mitzvah, Columbia Pictures then hired him to be a consultant for the company&#x27;s Bell Records label. Davis took time out to write his memoirs and then founded Arista Records in 1974. The company was named after New York City&#x27;s secondary school honor society of that name, of which Davis was a member.

At Arista, Davis signed Barry Manilow, followed by Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Patti Smith, Westlife, Al Jourgensen, The Outlaws, Eric Carmen, Kenny G, the Bay City Rollers, Exposé, Taylor Dayne, Ace of Base, Air Supply, Ray Parker Jr., Raydio, and Alicia Keys, and he brought Carly Simon, Melissa Manchester, Grateful Dead, The Kinks, Jermaine Stewart, Gil Scott-Heron (on whose episode of TV One&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot; Davis was interviewed) and Lou Reed to the label. He co-founded Arista Nashville in 1989 with Tim DuBois, which became the home to Alan Jackson, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Pam Tillis, and Brad Paisley.

Davis founded LaFace Records with L.A. Reid and Babyface. LaFace subsequently became the home of TLC, Usher, Outkast, Pink and Toni Braxton. He founded Bad Boy Records with Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs and it became the home of The Notorious B.I.G., Craig Mack, Combs, Mase, 112, and Faith Evans, although Davis would later admit that he never quite understood rap music. In 1998, Davis signed LFO from European Success. LFO charted #3 with &quot;Summer Girls&quot; in 1999, and went on to multiplatinum success.

During the Arista years, he set up his own production company Clive Davis Entertainment, for a two-year first-look agreement with movie studio TriStar Pictures in 1987.

Davis was made aware of Cissy Houston&#x27;s daughter Whitney Houston after he saw the Houstons perform at a New York City nightclub. Impressed with what he heard, Davis signed her to Arista. Houston became one of the biggest selling artists in music history under the guidance of Davis at Arista.

=== J Records, RCA, Sony years ===
Davis left Arista in 2000 and started J Records, an independent label with financial backing from Arista parent Bertelsmann Music Group, named with the middle initial of Davis and his four children. BMG would buy a majority stake in J Records in 2002, and Davis would become president and CEO of the larger RCA Music Group.

Davis&#x27; continued success in breaking new artists was recognised by the music industry A&amp;R site HitQuarters when the executive was named &quot;world&#x27;s No.1 A&amp;R of 2001&quot; based on worldwide chart data for that year.

In 2004, BMG merged with Sony Music Entertainment to form Sony BMG. With the assets of the former CBS Records (renamed Sony Music Entertainment in 1991) now under Sony&#x27;s ownership, the joint venture would mean a return of sorts for Davis to his former employer. Davis remained with RCA Label Group until 2008, when he was named chief creative officer for Sony BMG.

Davis was elevated to Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music Entertainment, a title he currently holds, as part of a corporate restructuring when Sony BMG became Sony Music Entertainment in late 2008 when BMG sold its shares to Sony. Arista Records and J Records, which were both founded by Davis, were dissolved in October 2011 through the restructuring of RCA Records. All artists under those labels were moved to RCA Records.

== Awards and honors ==
As a producer, Davis has won four Grammy Awards.

Davis also received the Grammy Trustees Award in 2000 and the President&#x27;s Merit Award at the 2009 Grammys. In 2011, the 200-seat theater at the Grammy Museum was named the &quot;Clive Davis Theater&quot;.

In 2000, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the non-performers category. The same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2015, he was recognized by Equality Forum as one of the 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.

Davis was a 2018 Honoree at The New Jewish Home&#x27;s Eight Over Eighty Gala.

==Charity and other==

An alumnus of New York University, Davis is a significant benefactor to it. The recorded music division of its Tisch School of the Arts, is named after him: the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.

Davis was portrayed by Oscar nominated actor, Stanley Tucci, in Sony Pictures&#x27;s &quot;Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody&quot; – a biopic about the life and music of Houston. Davis also served as a producer on the film.

== Personal life ==
Davis has been married and divorced twice. He was married to Helen Cohen from 1956 to 1965 and to Janet Adelberg from 1965 to 1985. He has four children: Fred (born 1960), a prominent media investment banker, Lauren (born 1962), an entertainment attorney and arts professor at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, Mitchell (born 1970), and Doug Davis (born 1974), a music executive and Grammy award-winning record producer.  Davis has eight grandchildren.

In 2013, at the age of 80, Davis publicly came out as bisexual in his autobiography &quot;The Soundtrack of My Life&quot;. On the daytime talk show &quot;Katie&quot;, he told host Katie Couric that he hoped his coming out would lead to &quot;greater understanding&quot; of bisexuality. The autobiography was the basis for the two-hour documentary &quot;Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives&quot;.

<doc id="166543" wikidata="Q105261" url="?curid=166543" title="Mount Parnassus">
<text>Mount Parnassus (; , &quot;Parnassós&quot;) is a mountain range of central Greece that is, and historically has been, especially valuable to the Greek nation and the earlier Greek city-states for many reasons. In peace, it offers scenic views of the countryside and is a major international recreational site with views of mountain landscapes. Economically, its rolling foothills and valleys host extensive groves of olive, a cash crop marketed world-wide since prehistory. The mountain is also the location of historical, archaeological, and other cultural sites, such as Delphi perched on the southern slopes of the mountain in a rift valley north of the Gulf of Corinth.

Parnassus has an abundance of trails for hiking in the three warm seasons. In the winter, the entire range is open to skiing, especially from the resorts of Arachova. Its melting snows are a source of municipal water for the surrounding communities. The mountain is composed of limestone, but also contains bauxite aluminum ore, which is mined and processed. In war, Parnassus has been a center of resistance if need be, providing cover and refuge to partisans.

Parnassus is mentioned in early Ancient Greek literature. Many of its ancient communities are cited in Homer&#x27;s Iliad. From a linguistic point of view, it was home to states of the Dorians, such as the Phokians, who spoke a Doric dialect, Phokian. According to Greek mythology, this mountain was sacred to Dionysus and the Dionysian mysteries; it was also sacred to Apollo and the Corycian nymphs, and it was the home of the Muses.

However, there is a significant gap in the proto-history of the name, Parnassos. Mycenaean settlements were abundant to the south and east. They had good views of Parnassus, and climbed some part of it frequently, and yet the name remains unattested in what is known of their language, Mycenaean Greek, which is written in Linear B script.

==Etymology==
The philologist Leonard Robert Palmer suggested that Parnassus is a name derived from Luwian language, one of the Anatolian languages. In his view, the name derives from &quot;parnassas&quot;, the possessive adjective of the Luwian word &quot;parna&quot; meaning &quot;house&quot;, or specifically &quot;temple&quot;, so the name effectively means the &quot;mountain of the house of the god&quot;. Such a derivation, being consistent with the reputation of the mountain as being a holy one, where the power of divinity is manifested, has always been considered a strong one, even by critics of the theory. Palmer goes on to postulate that some pre-Greek people were Anatolian, perhaps from an earlier wave of conquest, and that their country and facilities were taken by the proto-Greeks.

The consistency, however, ends there. With regard to a possible preponderance of the evidence, this one word remains an isolate. There is no historical or archaeological evidence to tie the name to an Anatolian presence. G. Mylonas, reviewing the possibilities, found nothing at all to tie the archaeology around the mountain to anything Anatolian, and although a probable Cretan connection has been detected, there is nothing to tie the Cretans to the Luwians. Linear A, the script of the Minoans, as the Cretans have been called, remains yet undeciphered. In summary, the ethnicity of the pre-Greek people or peoples, after many decades of scholarship, remains unknown, and there is yet no explanation of how and when this mountain was named with a Luwian name.

==Geology and geography==
Parnassus is one of the largest mountainous regions of Mainland Greece and one of the highest Greek mountains. It spreads over three municipalities, namely Boeotia, Phthiotis and Phocis, where its largest part lies. Its altitude is 2,457 meters (8,061 feet), and its highest peak is Liakouras. To the northwest, it is connected to Mount Giona and to the south to Kirphe.

The mountain is delimited to the east by the valley of the Boeotian Kephissus and to the west by the valley of Amfissa. An unusual geological feature of Parnassus is its rich deposits of bauxite, which has led to their systematic mining since the end of the 1930s, resulting in ecological damage to part of the mountain.

==Climate==
Mount Parnassus has very cold winters and cool summers. Below the data of the World Meteorological Organization station in the doline of Vathistalos.

==Mythology==
Mount Parnassus is named after Parnassos, son of the nymph Kleodora and the man Kleopompus. A city of which Parnassos was the leader was flooded by torrential rains. The citizens ran from the flood, following the howling of wolves, up the mountain slope. There, the survivors built another city called Lykoreia, which in Greek means &quot;the howling of the wolves.&quot; While Orpheus was living with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts on Parnassus, he met Apollo, who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Becoming fond of Orpheus, Apollo gave him a little golden lyre and taught him to play it. Orpheus&#x27;s mother taught him to write verses for singing. As the Oracle of Delphi was sacred to the god Apollo, so did the mountain itself become associated with Apollo. According to some traditions, Parnassus was the site of the fountain Castalia and the home of the Muses; according to other traditions, that honor fell to Mount Helicon, another mountain in the same range. As the home of the Muses, Parnassus became known as the home of poetry, music, and learning.

Parnassus was also the site of several unrelated minor events in Greek mythology.
*In some versions of the Greek flood myth, the ark of Deucalion comes to rest on the slopes of Parnassus. This is the version of the myth recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.
*Orestes spent his time in hiding on Mount Parnassus.
*Parnassus was sacred to the god Dionysus.
*The Corycian Cave, located on the slopes of Parnassus, was associated with Hermes and the Bee Maidens (Thriae) nymphs. It was later sacred to Pan and to the Muses.
*In Book 19 of The Odyssey, Odysseus recounts a story of how he was gored in the thigh during a boar hunt on Mount Parnassus in his youth.

Parnassus was also the home of Pegasus, the winged horse of Bellerophon.

==As metaphor==
This relation of the mountain to the Muses offered an instigation for its &quot;mystification&quot; by the poetic-artistic Parnassism movement, established in France in the decade of 1866 to 1876 as a reaction to Romanticism. Parnassism was characterized by a return to some classicistic elements and belief in the doctrine of &quot;Art for the Art&quot;, first articulated by Theophile Gautier. The periodical &quot;Modern Parnassus&quot;, issued by Catul Mendes and Xavier Ricard, contained direct references to Mt. Parnassus and its mythological feature as habitation of the Muses. The Parnassists, who did not exceed a group of twenty poets, exercised a relatively strong influence on the cultural life of Paris, particularly due to their tenacity in the perfection of rhyme and vocabulary. Parnassism influenced several French poets, but it also exercised an influence on modern Greek poets, particularly Kostis Palamas and Ioannis Gryparis.

The name of the mountain (Mont Parnasse) was given to a quarter of Paris on the left bank of the Seine, where artists and poets used to gather and recite their poems in public. Montparnasse is nowadays one of the most renowned quarters of the city, and in its cemetery, many personalities of the arts and culture are buried.

Parnassus figures earlier in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; (1697) as the site of an ideological war between the ancients and the moderns.

==Recreational use==
===National Park===
The National Park of Parnassus was founded in 1938. The idea behind the park was to preserve the natural habitat, for which it was necessary to govern the disposition of its natural resources. However, the park did not include all the terrain considered to be in the range. The highest peaks were omitted.

Within a few years the park aspect of the land became dormant as Greece turned its attention toward ending the German occupation, and then after World War II, settling the Greek Civil War. Parnassus was in a unique position to serve as a center for resistance, as it had for the Greek war of independence. Battles were fought in the valleys surrounding the range.

When the wars were over and the region went back to being an active park, the new science of ecology brought changes to the park administration. Species were inventoried, endemic and endangered ones were identified, and the concept of a protected area was established. Parnassus National Park became a protected area for birds under the &quot;Birds Directive.&quot; Subsequently, it acquired other protections under other laws as required by the EU. After 2000, it became Oros Parnassos, &quot;Mount Parnassus,&quot; Natura 2000 protected area ID GR2410002. The two are not exactly identical. The national park is about . The Natura 2000 area is about , bringing the terrain not covered by the park under protection..

Among the endemic flora species under protection are the Cephalonian fir tree and the Parnassian peony (&quot;Paeonia parnassica&quot;). In the Park are to be found birds of prey, wolves, boars, badgers, and weasels.

===Parnassos Ski Resort===
The slopes of Mount Parnassus are composed of two ski sections, Kellaria and Fterolakka, which together make up the largest ski center in Greece. A smaller ski center (only two drag lifts) called Gerontovrahos is across a ridge from Kellaria. Parnassus is mined for its abundant supply of bauxite which is converted to aluminium oxide and then to aluminium.

The construction of the ski resort started in 1975 and was completed in 1976, when the first two drag lifts operated in Fterolaka. In 1981 the construction of a new ski area was completed in Kelaria, while in winter season 1987–1988 the chair lift Hermes started operating and connected the two ski areas. Both ski resorts continued expanding, and in 1993, the first high-speed quad in Greece was installed, named Hercules. In 2014–2015, two new hybrid lifts were installed along with a new eight-seater, replacing the old infrastructure.

Today, the Ski Center operates with 16 lifts, two hybrid ski lifts that combine an eight-seater Cabin and a six-seater chair, an eight-seater Cabin, a 4-seater chair lift, a 2-seater chair lift, six drag lifts, and four baby lifts. The ski center boasts 25 marked ski runs and about 15 ski routes of total length, while the longest run is .

<text>The Battle of Mingolsheim () was fought on 27 April 1622, near the German village of Wiesloch, south of Heidelberg (and south of Wiesloch), between a Protestant army under General von Mansfeld and the Margrave of Baden-Durlach against a Roman Catholic army under Count Tilly.

Early in the spring of 1621, a mercenary force under the command of Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, crossed the Rhine River from Alsace to junction with a force under Ernst von Mansfeld. Combined, the armies aimed to prevent a link-up between Count Tilly and Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, arriving with an army 20,000 strong from the Spanish Netherlands under orders from General Ambrosio Spinola. Tilly met the Protestant army at its rear guard and drove upon it. This attack was successful until he engaged the main Protestant body, and was then rebuffed. Tilly retreated and bypassed the stationary Protestant army to link up with de Córdoba later that month. After the battle, Mansfeld found himself at a distinct disadvantage until the armies of Christian of Brunswick could arrive from the north. The two armies would engage later in the month at the Battle of Wimpfen.

<doc id="166554" wikidata="Q1437778" url="?curid=166554" title="Project plan">
<text>A project plan, is a series of structured tasks, objectives, and schedule to a complete a desired outcome, according to a project managers designs and purpose. According to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), is:
&quot;...a formal, approved document used to guide both &quot;project execution&quot; and &quot;project control&quot;. The primary uses of the project plan are to document planning assumptions and decisions, facilitate communication among &quot;project stakeholders&quot;, and document approved scope, cost, and schedule &quot;baselines&quot;. A project plan may be sumarized or detailed.&quot;

The latest edition of the PMBOK (v6) uses the term &quot;project charter&quot; to refer to the contract that the project sponsor and project manager use to agree on the initial vision of the project (scope, baseline, resources, objectives, etc.) at a high level. In the PMI methodology described in the PMBOK v5, the project charter and the project management plan are the two most important documents for describing a project during the initiation and planning phases.

PRINCE2 defines a project plan as:

:&quot;...a statement of how and when a project&#x27;s objectives are to be achieved, by showing the major products, milestones, activities and resources required on the project.&quot;

The project manager creates the &quot;project management plan&quot; following input from the project team and key project stakeholders. The plan should be agreed and approved by at least the project team and its key stakeholders.

Many project management processes are mentioned in PMBOK® Guide, but determining which processes need to be used based on the needs of the project which is called Tailoring is part of developing the project management plan.

== Purpose ==
The objective of a project plan is to define the approach to be used by the project team to deliver the intended project managers scope of the project.

At a minimum, a project plan answers basic questions about the project:
* Why? - What is the problem or value proposition addressed by the project? Why is it being sponsored?
* What? - What is the work that will be performed on the project? What are the major products/deliverables?
* Who? - Who will be involved and what will be their responsibilities within the project? How will they be organized?
* When? - What is the project timeline and when will particularly meaningful points, referred to as milestones, be complete?

== Plan contents ==
To be a complete project plan according to industry standards such as the PMBOK or PRINCE2, the project plan must also describe the execution, management and control of the project. This information can be provided by referencing other documents that will be produced, such as a procurement plan or construction plan, or it may be detailed in the project plan itself.

The project plan typically covers topics used in the project execution system and includes the following main aspects:

* Scope management
* Requirements management
* Schedule management
* Financial management
* Quality management
* Resource management
* Stakeholder management – New from PMBOK 5
* Communications management
* Project change management
* Risk management

==Details==
The project plan document may include the following sections:

* Introduction: A high-level overview of the project.
* Project management approach: The roles and authority of team members. It represents the executive summary of the project management plan.
* Project scope: The scope statement from the Project charter should be used as a starting point with more details about what the project includes and what it does not include (in-scope and out-of-scope).
* Milestone list: A list of the project milestones (the stop points that helps evaluating the progress of the project). This list includes the milestone name, a description about the milestone, and the date expected.
* Schedule baseline and work breakdown structure: The WBS which consists of work packages and WBS dictionary, which defines these work packages, as well as schedule baseline, which is the reference point for managing project progress, are included here.
* Project management plans: This section contains all management plans of all project aspects.
* Change management plan
* Communication management plan
* Cost management plan
* Procurement management plan
* Project scope management plan
* Schedule management plan
* Quality management plan
* Risk management plan
* HR or staffing management plan
* Resource calendar: Identify key resources needed for the project and their times and durations of need.
* Cost baseline: This section includes the budgeted total of each phase of the project and comments about the cost.
* Quality baseline: Acceptable levels of quality.
* Sponsor acceptance: Some space for the project sponsor to sign off the document.

<text>The land speed record (LSR) or absolute land speed record is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. By a 1964 agreement between the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) and Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), respective governing bodies for racing in automobiles and motorcycles (two or three wheels), both bodies recognise as the absolute LSR whatever is the highest speed record achieved across any of their various categories. While the three-wheeled &quot;Spirit of America&quot; set an FIM-validated LSR in 1963, all subsequent LSRs are by vehicles in FIA Category C (&quot;Special Vehicles&quot;) in either class JE (jet engine) or class RT (rocket powered).

FIA LSRs are officiated and validated by its regional or national affiliate organizations. Speed measurement is standardized over a course measuring either or , averaged over two runs with flying start (commonly called &quot;passes&quot;) going in opposite directions within one hour. A new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated.

== History ==

Until 1829 the fastest land transport was by horse. Then, railway speed records were set.

The first automobile record regulator was the &quot;Automobile Club de France&quot;, which proclaimed itself arbiter of the record in about 1902.


Different clubs had different standards and did not always recognize the same world records until 1924, when the &quot;Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus&quot; (AIACR) introduced new regulations: two passes in opposite directions (to negate the effects of wind) averaged with a maximum of 30 minutes (later more) between runs, average gradient of the racing surface not more than 1 percent, timing gear accurate within 0.01sec, and cars must be wheel-driven. National or regional auto clubs (such as AAA and SCTA) had to be AIACR members to ensure records would be recognized. The AIACR became the FIA in 1947. Controversy arose in 1963: &quot;Spirit of America&quot; was not recognized due to its being a three-wheeler (leading the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme to certify it as a three-wheel motorcycle record when the FIA refused) and not wheel-driven so the FIA introduced a special jet and rocket propelled class. No holder of the absolute record since has been wheel-driven.

In the U.S. and Australia, record runs are often done on salt flats, so the cars are often called salt cars.

== Women&#x27;s land speed record ==
The FIA does not recognize separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s land speed records, because the records are set using motorized vehicles, and not muscle-powered vehicles, so the gender of the driver does not matter; however, unofficial women&#x27;s records have long been claimed, seemingly starting with Dorothy Levitt&#x27;s 1906 record in Blackpool, England, and, unlike the FIA and other car-racing organisations, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; does recognize gender-based land speed records.

In 1906, Dorothy Levitt broke the women&#x27;s world speed record for the flying kilometer, recording a speed of and receiving the sobriquet the &quot;Fastest Girl on Earth&quot;. She drove a six-cylinder Napier motorcar, a development of the K5, in a speed trial in Blackpool.

In 1963, Paula Murphy drove a Studebaker Avanti to at the Bonneville Salt Flats as part of Andy Granatelli&#x27;s attempt on the overall record. In 1964, she was asked by the tire company Goodyear to try to improve her own record, which she raised to in Walt Arfons&#x27;s jet dragster &quot;Avenger&quot;. The rival tire company Firestone and Art Arfons hit back against Goodyear and Walt Arfons when Betty Skelton drove Art&#x27;s &quot;Cyclops&quot; to achieve a two-way average of in September 1965.

Five weeks later, Goodyear hit back against Firestone with Lee Breedlove. While recordkeeping has not been as extensive, a report in 1974 confirmed that a record was held by Lee Breedlove, the wife of then overall record holder Craig Breedlove, who piloted her husband&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of America – Sonic I&quot; to a record in 1965. According to author Rachel Kushner, Craig Breedlove had talked Lee into taking the car out for a record attempt in order to monopolize the salt flats for the day and block one of his competitors from making a record attempt.

In 1976, the women&#x27;s absolute record was set by Kitty O&#x27;Neil, in the jet-powered, three-wheeled &quot;SMI Motivator&quot;, at the Alvord Desert. Held back by her contract with a sponsor and using only 60 percent of her car&#x27;s power, O&#x27;Neil reached an average speed of .

On October 9, 2013, driver Jessi Combs, in a vehicle of the North American Eagle Project running at the Alvord Desert, raised the women&#x27;s four-wheel land speed class record with an official run of , surpassing Breedlove&#x27;s 48-year-old record. Combs continued with the North American Eagle Project, whose ongoing target is the overall land speed record; as part of that effort, Combs was killed, on August 27, 2019, during an attempt to raise the four-wheel record. In late June 2020, the Guinness Book of Records reclassified the August 27, 2019 speed runs as meeting its requirements, and Combs was posthumously credited with the record at , noting she was the first to break the record in 40 years.

== Records ==

=== 1898–1964 (wheel-driven) ===


=== 1963–present (jet and rocket propulsion) ===
Craig Breedlove&#x27;s mark of , set in &quot;Spirit of America&quot; in September 1963, was initially considered unofficial. The vehicle breached the FIA regulations on two grounds: it had only three wheels, and it was not wheel-driven, since its jet engine did not supply power to its axles. Some time later, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) created a non-wheel-driven category, and ratified &quot;Spirit of America&quot;″s time for this mark. On July 17, 1964, Donald Campbell&#x27;s Bluebird CN7 posted a speed of on Lake Eyre, Australia. This became the official FIA LSR, although Campbell was disappointed not to have beaten Breedlove&#x27;s time. In October, several four-wheel jet-cars surpassed the 1963 mark, but were eligible for neither FIA nor FIM ratification. The confusion of having three different LSRs lasted until December 11, 1964, when the FIA and FIM met in Paris and agreed to recognize as an absolute LSR the higher speed recorded by either body, by any vehicles running on wheels, whether wheel-driven or not.

<text>This list of the tallest buildings in Brazil ranks Brazilian skyscrapers in order by height. Most of Brazil&#x27;s tallest buildings are located in Balneário Camboriú, Goiânia and São Paulo, which is the biggest financial and residential center of the country. The majority of these buildings are residential.

At the twin towers Yachthouse Residence Club, in Balneário Camboriú, are the tallest buildings in Brazil. The first skyscraper in Brazil was the 105-meter-tall Martinelli Building in São Paulo, completed in 1929.

<doc id="166565" wikidata="Q710176" url="?curid=166565" title="Gabriel Naudé">
<text>Gabriel Naudé (2 February 1600 – 10 July 1653) was a French librarian and scholar. He was a prolific writer who produced works on many subjects including politics, religion, history and the supernatural. In 1627, he published an influential book in the field of library science called &quot;Advice on Establishing a Library&quot;. Naudé was later able to put into practice all the ideas he had put forth in &quot;Advice&quot; when he was given the opportunity to build and maintain the Bibliothèque Mazarine, the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin at Paris.

Naudé was a precursor of Pierre Bayle and Fontenelle.

==Biography==
Naudé was born in Paris in early 1600 to a family of modest means. His father was a lowly official and his mother a young illiterate woman. He was described by his teachers as tenacious and passionate about his education. Naudé entered college at a young age where he studied philosophy and grammar. Later he studied medicine at Paris and Padua (where he attended Cesare Cremonini&#x27;s lessons), and became physician to Louis XIII.

At the age of twenty, Naudé published his first book &quot;Le Marfore ou Discours Contre les Lisbelles&quot;. The work would bring him to the attention of Henri de Mesme, &quot;président à mortier&quot; of the Parlement of Paris. Mesme offered Naudé the job of librarian to his personal collection. Mesmes had a large library for the period (about 8,000 volumes) and it was open to scholars who had the appropriate references. Naudé&#x27;s service in Mesme&#x27;s library would give him experience which he would use later to write the book &quot;Advice on Establishing a Library&quot;. Naudé wrote &quot;Advice&quot; for Mesme as a guide for building and maintaining his library. In 1629 he became librarian to Cardinal Guidi di Bagno in Rome, and on Bagni&#x27;s death in 1641 librarian to Cardinal Francesco Barberini.

At the desire of Cardinal Richelieu he began a controversy with the Benedictines, denying Jean Gerson&#x27;s authorship of &quot;De Imitatione Christi&quot;. Richelieu intended to make Naudé his librarian, and on his death Naudé accepted a similar offer from Cardinal Mazarin. For the next ten years he devoted himself to bringing together from all parts of Europe the assemblage of books known as the &quot;Bibliothèque Mazarine&quot;. Mazarin had brought with him to Paris a collection numbering over 5,000 volumes. Like Naudé, he believed in an open library to be used by the public for the public good. In 1642 he purchased a building to house his library and he instructed Naudé to build up the finest collection possible.

The fastest way was to absorb entire libraries into the collection, advice that Naudé included in his book. Naudé plundered secondhand book sellers, and Mazarin instructed his ambassadors, government officials and generals to collect books for him. Naudé was able to travel Europe, and during one trip that lasted several months he collected more than 14,000 volumes. By 1648 the library had built up to an estimated at 40,000 volumes. It was open on a regular basis and had built up a sizable number (almost 100) of regular patrons, and several staff members to keep it functioning properly. It became the first in France to be open for all, without references.

Mazarin&#x27;s library was sold by the Parlement of Paris during the troubles of the Fronde, and Queen Christina invited Naudé to Stockholm. He was not happy in Sweden, and on Mazarin&#x27;s appeal that he should re-form his scattered library, Naudé returned at once. His health was broken, however, and he died on the return journey, in Abbeville on 10 July 1653.

The friend of Gui Patin, of Pierre Gassendi and all the liberal thinkers of his time, Naudé was no mere bookworm; his books show traces of the critical spirit which made him a worthy colleague of the humorists and scholars who prepared the way for the better known writers of the &quot;siècle de Louis XIV&quot;.

== Career as a librarian ==
Naudé, in his career as a librarian, &quot;opposed censorship, and encouraged library owners to allow others to use their books, a practice he considered a great honor for the owner – an honor equal to that of having the opportunity to build a fine library.&quot; Naudé found it favorable to collect original format of books and to keep the volumes collected intact. He was a true believer of considering the needs of those that would access them and felt strong consideration to be sought from the experts in each particular field. He was adamant about collecting in all languages, about all religions, subject matters, and literature.

During his career in librarianship, Naudé helped instruct collectors and libraries in the selection and acquisition of their titles and how to create catalogs for their libraries. He was a major proponent of scouring secondhand bookshops and print shops for valuable and hard to find literary works. &quot;When Naudé has been in town, the booksellers&#x27; shops seem devastated as by a whirlwind. Having bought up in every last one of them all the books, whether in manuscript or in print, dealing in any language whatever with any subject or division of learning no matter what, he has left the stores stripped and bare.&quot;

Naudé also had interesting ideas on the locale where a library should be located. &quot;While centrally located within the community it serves, a library should be at some distance from the noisiest streets. It should, if possible, be situated between some spacious court and a pleasant garden, from which it may enjoy good light, a wide and agreeable prospect, and pure air, unpolluted by marshes, sinks, or dunghills; the whole arrangement so well planned and ordered that it is compelled to share nothing unpleasant or obviously inconvenient.&quot;

Probably the most famous library that Naudé helped shape, and in which he served as librarian, was the &quot;Bibliothéque Mazarine&quot; in Paris, the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin in the rue de Richelieu. Naudé spent ten years of his life improving and shaping the &quot;Bibliothéque&quot;. It became the first publicly accessible library in France because of Naudé&#x27;s insistence and was open to the public as early as 1644.

As a librarian and scholar, Naudé proposed &quot;to direct a wealthy collector into paths of bibliothecarian righteousness&quot; as a result of his belief that the current century had advanced far beyond their predecessors with regard to the quantity and quality of the information or resources that they had access to. Naudé&#x27;s seminal work on library science, &quot;Advice on Establishing a Library&quot;, served as an early instruction manual or guide for private collectors who were interested in the book acquisition and maintenance process. Naudé encouraged collectors (and fellow librarians) to organize their books meticulously by &quot;their number and the range of their subject matter, the criteria of selection, and the means of procurement&quot;, in addition to the arrangement of the building(s) that book collections may be stored in and other potential methods of book cataloging. Naudé&#x27;s knowledge and expertise left a lasting impact on both the library community and the world at large, with his influence guiding collectors, scholars, politicians, and religious leaders.

== Artistic portrayals ==
Naudé is the subject of Peter Briscoe&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Best Read Man in France.&quot;

==Works==

Including works edited by him, a list of ninety-two pieces is given in the &quot;Naudaeana&quot;. The principal ones are:

*&quot;Le Marfore, ou discours contre les libelles&quot; (Paris, 1620), very rare, reprinted 1868;
*&quot;Instruction à la France sur la vérité de l&#x27;histoire des Frères de la Roze-Croix&quot; (1623, 1624), displaying their impostures;
*&quot;Apologie pour tous les grands personages faussement soupçonnez de magie&quot; (1625, 1653, 1669, 1712), Pythagoras, Socrates, Thomas Aquinas Jerome Cardan and Solomon are among those defended;
*&quot;Advis pour dresser une bibliothèque&quot; (1627, 1644, 1676; translated by John Evelyn, 1661), full of sound and liberal views on librarianship and considered as a founding stone of library science;
*&quot;Addition à l&#x27;histoire de Louys XI&quot; (1630), this includes an account of the origin of printing;
*&quot;Bibliographia politica&quot; (Venice, 1633, etc.; in French, 1642);
*&quot;De studio liberali syntagma&quot; (1632, 1654), a practical treatise found in most collections of directions for studies;
*&quot;De studio militari syntagma&quot; (1637), esteemed in its day;
*&quot;Considérations politiques sur les coups d&#x27;état&quot; (1639). A disciple of Machiavelli, he considered that politics must be rendered &quot;autonomous from morality, sovereign in relation to religion&quot;

== &quot;Advice on establishing a library&quot; ==
&quot;Advice&quot;, written as a set of instructions for a private collector, was based on Naudé&#x27;s own experience and research. In the introduction to his book, Naudé wrote that he is not an expert in the field of librarianship but he presented what he believed to be the most important ideas. He based some of the opinions in &quot;Advice&quot; on his own experience in Mesme&#x27;s library, and wrote out for Mesme the accepted practices and principles of librarians of the time. Chapters each covered topics such as number of books, selecting the books, procuring the books, and so forth.

Naudé&#x27;s first chapter poses the question, &quot;Why establish a library?&quot; He answers the question with a simple message; there is no greater honor than building a great library and sharing it with the public. Naudé believes libraries should model themselves after the best libraries of the world. The first task is to create a plan. Before a person can erect a library, he must educate himself on the subject of collecting and organizing books. A person must also seek the guidance of those who have already built their own libraries or are in the process. He suggests studying and copying the catalogues of other libraries.

Naudé devotes an entire chapter to book selection, remarked upon throughout. The first authors who need to be purchased are those considered experts in their respective fields. Regardless whether they are ancient or modern works, if a book were held in high regard by practitioners of a particular field then it should be present in any collection. In addition, any well known interpretations or commentaries that exist are a necessity. Naudé suggested purchasing books in the original languages because meaning can often be lost in translation. He stood strongly against censorship of any kind. Naudé believed that every book has a reader regardless of the subject, and that information should be free and available. Readers could always find use of a book, even if that use were to refute the ideas presented on its pages. Certain books are popular at times but later forgotten: he argued that it would be beneficial to a library if there were multiple copies of these books to accommodate the popular tastes of the times.

In his chapter on book acquisition, Naudé offered concise tips. The easiest way is to purchase another library in its entirety. Naudé went on to praise secondhand book sellers who often provided good books at cheap prices. Naudé himself browsed book-binding and printing shops for used paper, and once had discovered a rare manuscript that a book binder was using as scrap paper.

Naudé included a chapter in &quot;Advice&quot; for arranging the books. In discussing arrangement he quoted Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Oratore&quot;: &quot;It is order that gives light to memory&quot; (from De Oratore 2.353). He gave instructions that he considered logical. His subject headings included theology, philosophy, jurisprudence, medicine, history, mathematics and humanities. Naudé would add other subject headings in later years, but these categories best represented the known body of knowledge in the world. Each section, he said, should be divided into subheadings and begin with the principal authors followed by the commentaries.

<text>The tallest structure in the world is the Burj Khalifa skyscraper at . Listed are guyed masts (such as telecommunication masts), self-supporting towers (such as the CN Tower), skyscrapers (such as the Willis Tower), oil platforms, electricity transmission towers, and bridge support towers. This list is organized by absolute height. See List of tallest buildings and structures, List of tallest freestanding structures and List of tallest buildings and List of tallest towers for additional information about these types of structures.

==Terminology==
Terminological and listing criteria follow Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat definitions. Guyed masts are differentiated from towers – the latter not featuring any guy wires or other support structures; and buildings are differentiated from towers – the former having at least 50% of occupiable floor space although both are self-supporting structures.

==Lists by height==
These lists include structures with a minimum height of 500 metres (1640 feet). The lists of tallest structures from 400 to 500 metres and from 300 to 400 metres include shorter structures.

For all structures, the pinnacle height is given, so the height of skyscrapers may differ from the values at List of skyscrapers. Tension-leg platforms are not included.

===Structures (past or present) 600 m (1,969 ft) or taller ===


===Structures (past or present) between 550 and 600 m (1,804 ft and 1,969 ft)===

===Structures (past or present) between 500 and 550 m (1,640 and 1,804 ft)===

==On hold==
Structures that are on hold or have been cancelled.

==List by continent==
===Current===
The following table is a list of the current tallest structures by each continent (listed by geographic size):

<doc id="166584" wikidata="Q74332" url="?curid=166584" title="Dietrich of Nieheim">
<text>Dietrich of Nieheim (Niem or Nyem) (22 March 1418), medieval historian, was born at Nieheim, a small town subject to the see of Paderborn.

==Life==
Nothing is known about his family, and but little about his life previous to his entry into the service of the papal Curia. He spent some time in Italy in the study of law, but never obtained the degree of Doctor. He became a notary of the papal court of the rota at Avignon, to keep which he had to take orders, if he had not already done so. When Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome in 1377, Dietrich accompanied him.

Urban VI here took particular notice of him, made him an abbreviator to the papal chancery, and in 1383 took him with him in his visit to Charles III of Naples at Naples, an expedition which led to many unpleasant adventures, from which he escaped in 1385 by leaving the Curia. In 1387 he is again found among the abbreviators, and in 1395 Pope Boniface IX appointed him to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden. His attempt to take possession of the see, however, met with successful opposition. About Easter, 1401, Dietrich was at Erfurt in Germany, where he matriculated at the university.

Towards the end of the fourteenth century Johann Peters of Dordrecht had founded at Rome a hospital for German pilgrims, known as Santa Maria dell&#x27; Anima, still in existence and united with the German national church at Rome. Dietrich was an energetic promoter of the new foundation, to such an extent that after Peters he deserves to be considered its chief founder. 

He had to resume his work in the chancery, where his name again appears in 1403. Dietrich had begun to write a chronicle, of which only fragments are extant. His chief importance, however, lies in the part he took in the controversies arising out of the Great Schism. He accompanied Gregory XII to Lucca in May 1408. He took no part in the Council of Pisa itself, being then in Germany, but he adhered to the pope elected by the council of Pisa (Alexander V) and to his successor, Antipope Pope John XXIII resuming his place at the Curia. In view of the increasing confusion in the Church, however, he became one of the most ardent advocates of the appeal to a general council. He was present at the council of Constance as adviser to the German &quot;nation.&quot; He died at Maastricht on 22 March 1418.

Dietrich wrote about events in which he either had an intimate personal share or of which he was in an excellent position to obtain accurate information. His most important works are the &quot;Nemus unionis&quot; and the &quot;De schismate&quot;. Of these the first, compiled at Lucca after the breach with Gregory XII, is a collection of documents which had fallen into his hands during the negotiations for union: papal pronouncements, pamphlets, letters written and received by himself, and the like. 

The &quot;De schismate libri III&quot;, completed on 25 May 1410, describes the history of events since 1376 as he had seen them. It was continued in the &quot;Historia de vita Johannis XXIII&quot;. The abundance of its materials makes this work one of the most important authorities for the last stages of the schism. His judgments, however, concerning persons and facts must be taken with caution, Dietrich being strongly partisan.

==Works==
Other works are:
*&quot;De bono regimine Rom. pontificis&quot;, dedicated to the new [anti-]pope (John XXIII)
*&quot;De modis uniendiae reformandi ecclesiam&quot; and &quot;De difficultate reformationis in concilia universali&quot;, advocating the convocation of a council, to which the pope is to bow
*&quot;Contra dampnatos Wiclivitas Pragae&quot;, against the Hussites
*&quot;Jura ad privilegia imperil&quot;, a glorification of the empire in view of the convocation of the council of Constance
*&quot;Avisamenta pelcherrima de unions et reformatione membrorum et capitis fienda&quot;, a programme of church reform based on his experiences of the evils of the papal system.
* &quot;De shismate libri III, A.D. 1411 &quot;When the existence of the Church is threatened, she is released from the commandments of morality. With unity as the end, the use of every means is sanctified, even cunning, treachery, violence, simony, prison, death. For all order is for the sake of the community, and the individual must be sacrificed to the common good.&quot;&quot;

==Appearances in fiction==

A passage from Dietrich of Nieheim&#x27;s &quot;De schismate libri III&quot; is used as an epigraph at the beginning of the second chapter of Arthur Koestler&#x27;s novel, &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;: 

However, this is actually a paraphrase of Dietrich&#x27;s position in the treatise &quot;De modis&quot;, as expressed by the German historian Ludwig von Pastor, in his book &quot;Geschichte der Päpste seit dem Ausgang des Mittelalters&quot; (History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages), vol. 1, p. 149. &quot;De modis&quot; is credited in German editions of &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;, but von Pastor is not. The paraphrase is about how Dietrich wanted the Holy Roman Emperor to call a General Council, the Pope to bow to the will of Emperor and Council, and for Emperor and Council to do whatever they felt necessary to end the antipope schism.

Here is the actual quote from &quot;De Modis&quot;, from the section &#x27;De modis, loco trium malorum Pontificum, unum bonum eligendi, in Universalis Concilio Constantienst&#x27;:

<text>The Battle of Killiecrankie, also known as the Battle of Rinrory, took place on 27 July 1689 during the 1689 Scottish Jacobite rising. An outnumbered Jacobite force under Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel and John Graham, Viscount Dundee, defeated a government army commanded by General Hugh Mackay.

James VII went into exile in December 1688 after being deposed by the Glorious Revolution in Scotland. In March 1689, he began the Williamite War in Ireland, with a simultaneous revolt led by Dundee, previously military commander in Scotland.

Hampered by lack of men and resources, Dundee gambled on a decisive battle which he hoped would attract wider support. Although Killiecrankie was an unexpected and stunning victory, his army suffered heavy casualties and he was killed in the final minutes. It did little to change the overall strategic position, and the Jacobites were unable to take advantage of their success.

==Background==
Despite his personal Catholicism, in February 1685 James II &amp; VII succeeded his brother Charles II with widespread support from the Protestant majorities in both England and Scotland. Memories of the 1638-to-1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant many feared the consequences of bypassing the &#x27;natural heir&#x27;, and refused to support either the Monmouth Rebellion or Argyll&#x27;s Rising in June 1685.

By 1680, over 95% of Scots belonged to the Church of Scotland, or &quot;kirk&quot;. Catholics numbered less than 2% of the population and even other Protestant sects were barred. The 1681 Scottish Test Act required holders of public office to be members of the kirk; James&#x27; attempts to repeal it undermined his own supporters, while rewarding the dissident Presbyterians who backed Argyll.

In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis, the first being the birth of James Francis Edward on 10 June. This created the prospect of a Catholic dynasty, rather than James being succeeded by his Protestant daughter Mary, and her husband William of Orange. The second was the prosecution of the Seven Bishops, which seemed to extend official policy beyond mere tolerance for Catholicism to an assault on the established church. Their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James&#x27; political authority in both Scotland and England.

In 1685, many feared a return to civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, anti-Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one. William landed in Brixham on 5 November with 14,000 men; as he advanced, James&#x27; army deserted, and he went into exile on 23 December. The Parliament of England offered the English throne to William and Mary in February 1689.

On 14 March, a Convention met in Edinburgh to agree a settlement for Scotland. The Convention was dominated by supporters of the new administration, with &#x27;Jacobites&#x27; restricted to those linked to James by religion or personal ties. However, the number of activists on either side was tiny, the vast majority being unenthusiastic about either option. On 12 March, James landed in Ireland, and the Convention offered the Scottish throne to William and Mary on 11 April. On the following day, Dundee raised the Royal Standard on Dundee Law.

==Initial military actions==

William&#x27;s military commander in Scotland was General Hugh Mackay, head of the veteran Dutch Scots Brigade. His force of 3,500 included the Brigade regiments of Mackay, Balfour and Ramsay, the English Hastings Regiment and two newly raised Scots units. When Ewen Cameron of Lochiel learned of William&#x27;s landing, he began recruiting men to fight for James; but the short-term nature of clan warfare meant they needed to be put to use as soon as possible.

In April, Dundee joined him at Glenroy and on 18 May, took his force of around 1,800 Highlanders and attempted to bring Mackay to battle. He failed to do so and returned in June, after which most of the clansmen went home, leaving him with less than 200 men. On 27 June, Dundee wrote to the Earl of Melfort asking for reinforcements; the loss of Kintyre after the Battle of Loup Hill made resupply from Ireland extremely difficult, and the letter details alternative landing spots. As time went on, his position weakened due to continued defections – the surrender of Edinburgh Castle on 14 June being especially discouraging.

His requests for additional resources were denied, partly due to an internal dispute with the Catholic &#x27;Non-Compounders&#x27;, who dominated James&#x27;s court in Ireland and urged him to refuse any concessions to regain his throne. Dundee and other Scottish Jacobites were mostly Protestant &#x27;Compounders&#x27;, for whom concessions were essential, and thus viewed with suspicion. The only reinforcements sent to Scotland were 300 Irish soldiers under the Catholic Alexander Cannon, who landed near Duart Castle on 21 July.

A &#x27;Jacobite&#x27; garrison under Patrick Stewart of Ballechin occupied Blair Castle, a strategic point controlling access to the Lowlands and seat of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl. This illustrates how many families balanced both sides; claiming ill-health, Atholl went to England, leaving his eldest son, John Murray, to &#x27;besiege&#x27; his ancestral home. Stewart himself was a trusted family retainer and one of Atholl&#x27;s key lieutenants in the suppression of Argyll&#x27;s Rising in 1685.

In late July, Jacobite reinforcements arrived at Blair; Murray withdrew and Mackay moved north to support him, with somewhere between 3,600 and 5,100 troops. Seeing a chance to intercept, Dundee set out with his available forces, ordering the clans to follow &quot;with all haste.&quot; Lochiel&#x27;s sons were sent to raise additional levies; he and 240 Camerons plus Cannon&#x27;s Irish contingent reached Blair on 26 July.

==Battle==

On the morning of 27 July, Dundee learned Mackay&#x27;s forces were entering the Pass of Killiecrankie, a track nearly long with the River Garry on the left and steep hills on either side. Sir Alexander McLean and 400 men were sent to skirmish with the advance guard, while Dundee assembled the rest of his troops on the lower slopes of Creag Eallich, north of the pass. As they advanced into the pass, the government army had the Jacobites on the high ground above and the river behind, while the narrow track made advance or retreat equally hazardous. Mackay halted, moved off the track and deployed his troops facing uphill in a long line, only three men deep, to maximise firepower.

Mackay&#x27;s force included Balfour, Ramsay and Mackay&#x27;s regiments of the Scots Brigade, along with the newly raised regiments of Kenmure and Leven, part of Hastings&#x27; regiment, and 100 cavalry. As the most experienced, the Scots Brigade under Balfour and Lauder was placed on the left, which provided the best field of fire.

The Jacobites formed into columns and were in position by late afternoon but Dundee waited until sunset, just after 8:00pm to begin his attack. Balfour&#x27;s front line fired three volleys, killing nearly 600 Highlanders but their fire was partly masked by a shallow terrace on the hillside, while the regiments to their right apparently fled without firing a shot. Following their usual tactics, the Highlanders fired a single volley at 50 metres, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords crashed into Mackay&#x27;s centre.

Killiecrankie is the first major action in which British troops are known to have employed the plug bayonet. Once &#x27;plugged&#x27; into the musket barrel, further reloading or firing was no longer possible, so fixing them was delayed until the last possible moment. Inexperience in their use and the speed of the Highland charge left the government troops defenceless and many fled, abandoning Balfour, who was killed along with James Mackay, Hugh&#x27;s younger brother.

==Aftermath==
Mackay managed to reform Hastings and Leven&#x27;s regiments from the centre and right; some 800 men made it back to Stirling with relative ease, while others straggled in over the next few days. The Highlanders halted their pursuit to loot the baggage train, and their own casualties were enormous, with between 600 and 800 wounded or killed, the vast majority on the government left. Dundee was fatally wounded towards the end of the battle, and died shortly afterwards; a letter sent under his name to James reporting the victory is generally thought to be a forgery, although it provides a useful summary of the action.

Based on muster rolls before and after the battle, government losses were around 2,000 killed, wounded or missing, although some of the &quot;missing&quot; may well have deserted. As colonels were paid for the number of men in their regiment, there was an obvious temptation to over-report pre-battle figures, but it is possible they suffered losses of up to 50%.

Alexander Cannon took over as leader, and while not as talented a commander as Dundee, he faced the same problems; without siege equipment, he could not capture a port, making resupply almost impossible, while lack of cavalry made them vulnerable in the open. In addition, his most reliable unit, the Camrons, suffered particularly heavy casualties, while many other Highlanders went home with their loot. These factors meant time was on Mackay&#x27;s side, so long as he avoided another ambush.

After an assault on Dunkeld in August was repulsed with heavy losses, Cannon ended the campaign. Mackay spent the winter reducing Jacobite strongholds and constructing a new base at Fort William, while harsh weather conditions led to severe food shortages. When Thomas Buchan replaced Cannon in February 1690, he could only mobilise some 800 men; he was taken by surprise at Cromdale in May and his forces scattered. Mackay pursued him into Aberdeenshire and in November 1690 relinquished command to Livingstone.

In 2004, a fragment of a hand grenade was found, providing evidence of their first use in Britain 30 years earlier than that previously recorded at Glen Shiel in 1719. A detailed survey carried out in 2015 confirmed the location and intensity of the close-quarter fighting, along with the discovery of large numbers of pistol and musket balls.

<text>A tariqa () is a religious order of Sufism, or specifically a concept for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking , which translates as &quot;ultimate truth&quot;.

A tariqa has a (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as (singular &#x27;), meaning &quot;desirous&quot;, viz. &quot;desiring the knowledge of [[God]] and loving God&quot; (also called a&#x27;).
The murshid of the tariqa is also believed to be the same as the &quot;tzadik&quot; of Judaism, meaning the &quot;rightly guided one&quot;.

The metaphor of &quot;way, path&quot; is to be understood in connection of the term sharia which also has the meaning of &quot;path&quot;, more specifically &quot;well-trodden path; path to the waterhole&quot;. The &quot;path&quot; metaphor of &quot;tariqa&quot; is that of a further path, taken by the mystic, which continues from the &quot;well-trodden path&quot; or exoteric of sharia towards the esoteric &#x27;. A fourth &quot;station&quot; following the succession of &quot;shariah&quot;,&#x27; and &#x27; is called . This is the &quot;unseen center&quot; of&#x27;, and the ultimate aim of the mystic, corresponding to the unio mystica in Western mysticism. &quot;&quot;, an Arabic word that refers to Islamic mysticism, is known in the West as Sufism.

==Orders of Sufism==

The most popular tariqa in the West is the Mevlevi Order, named after Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi. In the same time the Bektashi Order was also founded, named after the Haji Bektash Veli. The four most significant tariqas in South Asia are the Qadiri Order, named after Abdul Qadir Jilani, the Chishti Order, named after Abu Ishaq Shami Chishti, the Naqshbandi Order, named after Baha al-Din Shah Naqshband, and the Suhrawardi Order, named after Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi. the Burhaniyya becoming popular within the people of Pakistan &amp; India. Large tariqats in Africa include Muridiyya, Rifa&#x27;iyya and Tijaniyya. Sufi orders can have sub-orders within them, such as the Ashrafiyya, named after the 13th century illustrious Sufi saint Ashraf Jahangir Semnani is a sub-order of Chishti spiritual lineage, the Maizbhandariyya, which is a Sufi sub-order established in the Bangladesh in the 19th century by the Shah Sufi Syed Ahmadullah Maizbhandari (1826 AD − 1906 AD), 27th generation descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and the Warisi sub-order, which was founded by Waris Ali Shah.

Membership in a particular Sufi order is not exclusive, unlike the Christian monastic orders which are demarcated by firm lines of authority and sacrament. Sufis often are members of various Sufi orders. The non-exclusiveness of Sufi orders has consequences for the social extension of Sufism. They cannot be regarded as indulging in a zero sum competition which a purely political analysis might have suggested. Rather, their joint effect is to impart to Sufism a cumulant body of tradition, rather than individual and isolated experiences.

In most cases the sheikh nominates his &quot;khalifa&quot; or &quot;successor&quot; during his lifetime, who will take over the order. In rare cases, if the sheikh dies without naming a &quot;khalifa&quot;, the students of the tariqa elect another spiritual leader by vote. In some orders it is recommended to take a &quot;Khalif&quot; from the same order as the &quot;murshid&quot;. In some groups it is customary for the khalifa to be the son of the sheikh, although in other groups the khalīfa and the sheikh are not normally relatives. In yet other orders a successor may be identified through the spiritual dreams of its members.

Tariqas have &quot;silsilas&quot; (; &quot;chain, lineage of sheikhs&quot;). All orders claim a &quot;silsila&quot; that leads back to Muhammad through Ali, except the Naqshbandi silsila, which traces its roots to Abu Bakr, the first Caliph of Sunni Islam.

Every &quot;Murid&quot;, on entering the tariqa, gets his &quot;awrad&quot;, or daily recitations, authorized by his &quot;murshid&quot; (usually to be recited before or after the pre-dawn prayer, after the afternoon prayer and after the evening prayer). Usually these recitations are extensive and time-consuming (for example the &quot;awrad&quot; may consist of reciting a certain formula 99, 500 or even 1000 times). One must also be in a state of ritual purity (as one is for the obligatory prayers to perform them while facing Mecca). The recitations change as a student (murid) moves from a mere initiate to other Sufi degrees (usually requiring additional initiations). The Initiation ceremony is routine and consists of reading chapter 1 of the Quran followed by a single phrase prayer. Criteria have to be met to be promoted in rank: the common way is to repeat a single phrase prayer 82,000 times or more as in the case of Burhaniyya, a number that grows with each achieved rank. Murids who experience unusual interaction during meditation: hear voices like &quot;would you like to see a prophet?&quot; or see visions who might even communicate with the Murid are held dear in the &quot;Haḍra&quot;, the weekly group-chanting of prayers in attempt of reaching spirits as they are likely to experience something unusual and pass it on. This Murid is promoted faster than others. The least common way is to cause a miracle to happen with criteria similar to that of Catholic Sainthood.

Being mostly followers of the spiritual traditions of Islam loosely referred to as Sufism, these groups were sometimes distinct from the &quot;Ulma&quot; or officially mandated scholars, and often acted as informal missionaries of Islam. They provided accepted avenues for emotional expressions of faith, and the Tariqas spread to all corners of the Muslim world, and often exercised a degree of political influence inordinate to their size (take for example the influence that the sheikhs of the Safavid had over the armies of Tamerlane, or the missionary work of Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i in Turkistan among the Mongol and Tatar people).

==History==
The tariqas were particularly influential in the spread of Islam in the sub-Sahara during the 9th to 14th centuries, where they spread south along trade routes between North Africa and the sub-Saharan kingdoms of Ghana and Mali. On the West African coast they set up Zawiyas on the shores of the river Niger and even established independent kingdoms such as &quot;al-Murabitun&quot; or Almoravids. The Al Hakika Mizaan Mizaani Sufi order deals with heavy internalization and meditations, their spiritual practice is called Al Qudra Mizaan. The Sanusi order was also highly involved in missionary work in Africa during the 19th century, spreading both Islam and a high level of literacy into Africa as far south as Lake Chad and beyond by setting up a network of &quot;zawiyas&quot; where Islam was taught.

Much of Central Asia and southern Russia was won over to Islam through the missionary work of the Tarīqahs, and the majority of Indonesia&#x27;s population, where a Muslim army never set foot, was converted to Islam by the perseverance of both Muslim traders and Sufi missionaries. Sufism in India played a similarly crucial role in the diffusion of Islam at the élite and popular levels; its music, art, and poetry flourished in a highly sophisticated Persianate society.

Tariqas were brought to China in the 17th century by Ma Laichi and other Chinese Sufis who had studied in Mecca and Yemen, and had also been influenced by spiritual descendants of the Kashgarian Sufi master Afaq Khoja. On the Chinese soil the institutions became known as &quot;menhuan&quot;, and are typically headquartered near the tombs (&quot;gongbei&quot;) of their founders.

<doc id="166589" wikidata="Q3352152" url="?curid=166589" title="On Numbers and Games">
<text>On Numbers and Games is a mathematics book by John Horton Conway first published in 1976. The book is written by a pre-eminent mathematician, and is directed at other mathematicians. The material is, however, developed in a playful and unpretentious manner and many chapters are accessible to non-mathematicians. Martin Gardner discussed the book at length, particularly Conway&#x27;s construction of surreal numbers, in his Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in September 1976.

The book is roughly divided into two sections: the first half (or &quot;Zeroth Part&quot;), on numbers, the second half (or &quot;First Part&quot;), on games. In the &quot;Zeroth Part&quot;, Conway provides axioms for arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and inequality. This allows an axiomatic construction of numbers and ordinal arithmetic, namely, the integers, reals, the countable infinity, and entire towers of infinite ordinals. The object to which these axioms apply takes the form {L|R}, which can be interpreted as a specialized kind of set; a kind of two-sided set. By insisting that L&lt;R, this two-sided set resembles the Dedekind cut. The resulting construction yields a field, now called the surreal numbers. The ordinals are embedded in this field. The construction is rooted in axiomatic set theory, and is closely related to the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. In the original book, Conway simply refers to this field as &quot;the numbers&quot;. The term &quot;surreal numbers&quot; is adopted later, at the suggestion of Donald Knuth.

In the &quot;First Part&quot;, Conway notes that, by dropping the constraint that L&lt;R, the axioms still apply and the construction goes through, but the resulting objects can no longer be interpreted as numbers. They can be interpreted as the class of all two-player games. The axioms for greater than and less than are seen to be a natural ordering on games, corresponding to which of the two players may win. The remainder of the book is devoted to exploring a number of different (non-traditional, mathematically inspired) two-player games, such as nim, hackenbush, and the map-coloring games col and snort. The development includes their scoring, a review of the Sprague–Grundy theorem, and the inter-relationships to numbers, including their relationship to infinitesimals.

The book was first published by Academic Press in 1976, , and a second edition was released by A K Peters in 2001 ().

== Zeroth Part ... On Numbers ==

In the Zeroth Part, Chapter 0, Conway introduces a specialized form of set notation, having the form {L|R}, where L and R are again of this form, built recursively, terminating in is called 1, and the game {|0} is called -1. The game {0|0} is called * (star), and is the first game we find that is not a number.

All numbers are positive, negative, or zero, and we say that a game is positive if Left has a winning strategy, negative if Right has a winning strategy, or zero if the second player has a winning strategy. Games that are not numbers have a fourth possibility: they may be fuzzy, meaning that the first player has a winning strategy. * is a fuzzy game.

<text>The National Garden Scheme opens privately owned gardens in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the Channel Islands on selected dates for charity. It was founded in 1927 with the aim of &quot;opening gardens of quality, character and interest to the public for charity&quot;. The scheme has raised over £67 million since it began, and normally opens over 3,500 gardens a year.

Volunteer County Organisers are responsible for vetting gardens to make sure they are of sufficient interest.
When the scheme began 609 private gardens were opened and £8,191 was raised. A small number of the original &quot;1927&quot; gardens still participate in the Scheme, while many more have joined. Over 3,700 gardens were due to open in 2020 but the impact of COVID-19 meant that most openings were cancelled. However, new online virtual garden tours were introduced. 

To help boost funds after COVID-19, the National Garden Scheme set up an annual fundraising event called The Great British Garden Party, encouraging everyone to enjoy outdoor spaces while raising money for the charity and championed by the charity&#x27;s President, Dame Mary Berry.

The National Garden Scheme not only opens beautiful gardens for charity – it is passionate about the physical and mental health benefits of gardens too. The Scheme funds projects which promote gardens and gardening as therapy, and in 2017, launched an annual Gardens and Health Week to raise awareness of the topic. 

Visitor information is published in a publication called &quot;The Garden Visitor&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (formerly the Yellow Book). There is another Yellow Book for the separate Scotland&#x27;s Gardens scheme.

==Charities supported==
Originally the admission fees raised money for district nurses, although the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 changed the nature of the support required.
In 1980, the National Garden Scheme Charitable Trust was launched as an independent charity with Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as patron. The current patron is Charles, the former Prince of Wales. 
The Queen&#x27;s Nursing Institute is still one of the charities supported, along with Marie Curie, Macmillan Cancer Support, Hospice UK, Parkinson&#x27;s UK, Carers Trust, Maggie&#x27;s, Horatio&#x27;s Garden, Perennial, and others that support gardening as therapy, community gardens and horticultural trainees. The National Garden Scheme runs a Community Gardens Grant programme to support health and well-being in communities around the country. 

You can read about the charity&#x27;s impact in their annual Impact Reports here.

<doc id="166591" wikidata="Q6863466" url="?curid=166591" title="Mind Dynamics">
<text>Mind Dynamics was a seminar company, founded by Alexander Everett in Texas in 1968. The company ceased operating in December 1973 after the death of co-owner William Penn Patrick and the resignation of President Robert White, alongside investigations for fraudulent representations and practicing medicine without a license.

== Techniques, methodology ==
Mind Dynamics has been compared to Dale Carnegie, and encounter groups. Mind Dynamics trained businessmen in personal development techniques, but relied on unique activities rather than academic theories. The coursework also utilized techniques that focused on visualization, and meditation. 

Techniques drawn from the Unity Church included periods of silence, focusing the mind on positive elements, and distinguishing the &quot;intuitive inner voice.&quot;

Some of Mind Dynamics&#x27; techniques were compared to self-hypnosis, and mind control. Mind Dynamics has been described as part of the &quot;consciousness transformation&quot; movement, and has been compared to Scientology, est, Psycho-Cybernetics, and Amway.

== Influences ==
Heelas&#x27; &quot;The New Age Movement&quot; states that Mind Dynamics and Alexander Everett were influenced by Edgar Cayce, Theosophy, and Silva Mind Control, and Curtiss&#x27; &quot;Depression is a Choice&quot; also cites Silva Mind Control and &quot;self-talk&quot; as the basis for Mind Dynamics. Mind Dynamics has also been described by several authors on religious texts as an offshoot of Silva Mind Control. According to Jose Silva, Alexander Everett was a graduate of Silva Mind Control. Everett also drew on principles from the Unity Church, Egyptology and Rosicrucianism in developing Mind Dynamics.

== Leadership Dynamics, Holiday Magic ==
Other companies which had corporate relationships with Mind Dynamics included Leadership Dynamics and Holiday Magic, both of which were founded by William Penn Patrick, co-owner and Board Member for Mind Dynamics. Holiday Magic later folded, amidst investigations by authorities and accusations of being a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme. Every employee in management positions at Holiday Magic was required to participate in the coursework.

== Investigated for fraud, practicing medicine without a license ==
In December 1972, Mind Dynamics was investigated for practicing medicine without a license, and fraudulent representation of the potential benefits of participating in their coursework. The company was also investigated by the state of California for making fraudulent claims. A lawsuit brought forth by the State of California in 1973 requested that Mind Dynamics be barred from what California referred to as its unlawful practice of medicine. William Penn Patrick was named as a party with Mind Dynamics in the lawsuit.

Mind Dynamics ceased operating in 1973, after being investigated and charged with fraud and practicing medicine without a license. According to an article in &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of 1974, the State of California was still seeking to enjoin the company from making fraudulent claims, and practicing medicine without a license.

== Later groups ==
Neal Vahle&#x27;s &quot;The Unity Movement&quot; lists nine personal growth organizations which grew out of Mind Dynamics, including: est and The Forum, Landmark Education, Lifespring, Lifestream, LifeResults, LifeSuccess, Context Training / Context International, PSI Seminars, Personal Dynamics in Switzerland, Life Dynamics in Japan and Hong Kong, Alpha Seminars in Australia, Hoffman Quadrinity Process, Dimensional Mind Approach, Pathwork, and Actualizations. Vahle goes on to describe similar techniques used by these groups which were incorporated from Mind Dynamics&#x27; practices. Berger&#x27;s &quot;Agit-Pop&quot; also gives examples of EST, Lifespring and Actualizations as groups that grew out of Mind Dynamics and helped form the human potential movement. The organizations cited above were founded by prior instructors from Mind Dynamics who had been trained by Alexander Everett, including Stewart Emery (who founded Actualizations), Randy Revell (who developed Context Training), James Quinn (who organized Lifestream/LifeResults/LifeSuccess), and Thomas Wilhite (who founded PSI Seminars).

Werner Erhard, subsequently associated with est (1971-1984), WE&amp;A (1981-1991) and Landmark Education (founded 1991, known as Landmark Worldwide since 2013) taught in the Mind Dynamics organization,
providing a link between Mind Dynamics and several subsequent Large-group awareness trainings (LGATs).

Former MDI President Robert White founded Lifespring and ARC International
which delivered the Life Dynamics seminars in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sydney.

<text>Nicomedia (; , &quot;Nikomedeia&quot;; modern İzmit) was an ancient Greek city located in what is now Turkey. In 286, Nicomedia became the eastern and most senior capital city of the Roman Empire (chosen by the emperor Diocletian who ruled in the east), a status which the city maintained during the Tetrarchy system (293–324). 

The Tetrarchy ended with the Battle of Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) in 324, when Constantine defeated Licinius and became the sole emperor. In 330 Constantine chose for himself the nearby Byzantium (which was renamed Constantinople, modern Istanbul) as the new capital of the Roman Empire.

The city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the victory of Sultan Orhan Gazi against the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines managed to retake it in the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara, but it fell definitively to the Ottomans in 1419.

==History==
It was founded in 712–711 BC as a Megarian colony and was originally known as Astacus (; , &#x27;lobster&#x27;). After being destroyed by Lysimachus, it was rebuilt by Nicomedes I of Bithynia in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia, and has ever since been one of the most important cities in northwestern Asia Minor. The great military commander Hannibal Barca came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa (Diliskelesi, Gebze). The historian Arrian was born there.
Nicomedia was the metropolis and capital of the Roman province of Bithynia under the Roman Empire. It is referenced repeatedly in Pliny the Younger&#x27;s Epistles to Trajan during his tenure as governor of Bithynia. Pliny, in his letters, mentions several public buildings of the city such as a senate-house, an aqueduct, a forum, a temple of Cybele, and others, and speaks of a great fire, during which the place suffered much. Diocletian made it the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire in 286 when he introduced the Tetrarchy system.

===Persecutions of 303===
Nicomedia was at the center of the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians which occurred under Diocletian and his Caesar Galerius. On 23 February 303 AD, the pagan festival of the Terminalia, Diocletian ordered that the newly built church at Nicomedia be razed, its scriptures burnt, and its precious stones seized. The next day he issued his &quot;First Edict Against the Christians,&quot; which ordered similar measures to be taken at churches across the Empire.

The destruction of the Nicomedia church incited panic in the city, and at the end of the month a fire destroyed part of Diocletian&#x27;s palace, followed 16 days later by another fire. Although an investigation was made into the cause of the fires, no party was officially charged, but Galerius placed the blame on the Christians. He oversaw the execution of two palace eunuchs, who he claimed conspired with the Christians to start the fire, followed by six more executions through the end of April 303. Soon after Galerius declared Nicomedia to be unsafe and ostentatiously departed the city for Rome, followed soon after by Diocletian.

===Later Empire===
Nicomedia remained as the eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire until co-emperor Licinius was defeated by Constantine the Great at the Battle of Chrysopolis (Üsküdar) in 324. Constantine mainly resided in Nicomedia as his interim capital city for the next six years, until in 330 he declared the nearby Byzantium (which was renamed Constantinople) the new capital. Constantine died in a royal villa in the vicinity of Nicomedia in 337. Owing to its position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads leading to the new capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the foundation of Constantinople.

A major earthquake, however, on 24 August 358, caused extensive devastation to Nicomedia, and was followed by a fire which completed the catastrophe. Nicomedia was rebuilt, but on a smaller scale. In the sixth century under Emperor Justinian I the city was extended with new public buildings. Situated on the roads leading to the capital, the city remained a major military center, playing an important role in the Byzantine campaigns against the Caliphate. From inscriptions we learn that in the later period of the empire Nicomedia enjoyed the honour of a Roman colony.

In 451, the local bishopric was promoted to a Metropolitan see under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The metropolis of Nicomedia was ranked 7th in the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; among the metropolises of the patriarchate. In the eighth century the Emperor Constantine V established his court there for a time, when plague broke out in Constantinople and drove him from his capital in 746–47. From the 840s on, Nicomedia was the capital of the &quot;thema&quot; of the &quot;Optimatoi&quot;. By that time, most of the old, seawards city had been abandoned and is described by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurdadhbih as lying in ruins, with settlement restricted to the hilltop citadel. In the 1080s, the city served as the main military base for Alexios I Komnenos in his campaigns against the Seljuk Turks, and the First and Second Crusades both encamped there.

The city was briefly held by the Latin Empire following the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204: in late 1206 the seneschal Thierry de Loos made it his base, converting the church of Saint Sophia into a fortress; however, the Crusader stronghold was subjected to constant raids by the Emperor of Nicaea Theodore I Laskaris, during which de Loos was captured by Nicaean soldiers; by the summer of 1207 Emperor Henry of Flanders agreed to evacuate Nicomedia in exchange for de Loos and other prisoners Emperor Theodore held. The city remained in Byzantine control for over a century after that, but following the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Bapheus in 1302, it was threatened by the rising Ottoman beylik. The city was twice besieged and blockaded by the Ottomans (in 1304 and 1330) before finally succumbing in 1337.

==Infrastructure==
During the Empire, Nicomedia was a cosmopolitan and commercially prosperous city which received all the amenities appropriate for a major Roman city. Nicomedia was well known for having a bountiful water supply from two to three aqueducts, one of which was built in Hellenistic times. Pliny the Younger complains in his &quot;Epistulae&quot; to Trajan, written in 110 AD, that the Nicomedians wasted 3,318,000 sesterces on an unfinished aqueduct which twice ran into engineering troubles. Trajan instructs him to take steps to complete the aqueduct, and to investigate possible official corruption behind the large waste of money. Under Trajan, there was also a large Roman garrison. Other public amenities included a theatre, a colonnaded street typical of Hellenistic cities and a forum.

The major religious shrine was a temple of Demeter, which stood in a sacred precinct on a hill above the harbor. The city adopted official cults of Rome avidly, there were temples dedicated to the Emperor Commodus, a sacred precinct of the city dedicated to Augustus, and a temple of Roma dedicated during the late-Republic.

The city was sacked in AD 253 by the Goths, but when Diocletian made the city his capital in 283 AD he undertook grand restorations and built an enormous palace, an armory, mint, and new shipyards.

==Remains==

The ruins of Nicomedia are buried beneath the densely populated modern city of İzmit, which has largely obstructed comprehensive excavation. Before the urbanization of the 20th century occurred, select ruins of the Roman-era city could be seen, most prominently sections of the Roman defensive walls which surrounded the city and multiple aqueducts which once supplied Nicomedia&#x27;s water. Other monuments include the foundations of a 2nd-century AD marble nymphaeum on İstanbul street, a large cistern in the city&#x27;s Jewish cemetery, and parts of the harbor wall.

The 1999 İzmit earthquake, which seriously damaged most of the city, also led to major discoveries of ancient Nicomedia during the subsequent debris clearing. A wealth of ancient statuary was uncovered, including statues of Hercules, Athena, Diocletian and Constantine.

In the years after the earthquake, the Izmit Provincial Cultural Directorate appropriated small areas for excavation, including the site identified as Diocletian&#x27;s Palace and a nearby Roman theatre. In April 2016 a more extensive excavation of the palace was begun under the supervision of the Kocaeli Museum, which estimated that the site covers 60,000 square meters (196,850 square feet).

<text>Jacques Lipchitz (26 May 1973) was a Lithuanian-born French-American Cubist sculptor. Lipchitz retained highly figurative and legible components in his work leading up to 1915–16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Crystal Cubism. In 1920 Lipchitz held his first solo exhibition, at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s Galerie L&#x27;Effort Moderne in Paris where he was counted as part of the School of Paris. Fleeing the Nazis he moved to the US and settled in New York City and eventually Hastings-on-Hudson. While in the US, he created a number of his best-known works, including the outdoor sculptures &quot;The&quot; &quot;Song of the Vowels&quot;, &quot;Birth of the Muses&quot;, and &quot;Bellerophon Taming Pegasus&quot;, the last of which was completed after his death.

==Life and career==
Jacques Lipchitz was born Chaim Jacob Lipschitz, in a Litvak family, son of a building contractor in Druskininkai, Lithuania, then within the Russian Empire. He studied at Vilnius grammar school and Vilnius Art School. Under the influence of his father he studied engineering in 1906–1909, but soon after, supported by his mother he moved to Paris (1909) to study at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian.

It was there, in the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse, that he joined a group of artists that included Juan Gris and Pablo Picasso as well as where his friend, Amedeo Modigliani, painted &quot;Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz&quot;.

Living in this environment, Lipchitz soon began to create Cubist sculpture. In 1912 he exhibited at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salon d&#x27;Automne with his first solo show held at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s Galerie L&#x27;Effort Moderne in Paris in 1920. In 1922 he was commissioned by the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania to execute seven bas-reliefs and two sculptures.

With artistic innovation at its height, in the 1920s he experimented with abstract forms he called &quot;transparent sculptures&quot;. Later he developed a more dynamic style, which he applied with telling effect to bronze compositions of figures and animals.

In 1924–25 Lipchitz became a French citizen through naturalization and married Berthe Kitrosser. With the German occupation of France during World War II, and the deportation of Jews to the Nazi death camps, Lipchitz had to flee France. With the assistance of the American journalist Varian Fry in Marseille, he escaped the Nazi regime and went to the United States. There, he eventually settled in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.
He was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the Third Sculpture International Exhibition held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. He has been identified among seventy of those sculptors in a photograph &quot;Life&quot; magazine published that was taken at the exhibition. In 1954 a Lipchitz retrospective traveled from The Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and The Cleveland Museum of Art. In 1959, his series of small bronzes &quot;To the Limit of the Possible&quot; was shown at Fine Arts Associates in New York.

In his later years Lipchitz became more involved in his Jewish faith, even referring to himself as a &quot;religious Jew&quot; in an interview in 1970. He began abstaining from work on Shabbat and put on Tefillin daily, at the urging of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson.

Beginning in 1963 he returned to Europe for several months of each year and worked in Pietrasanta, Italy. He developed a close friendship with fellow sculptor, Fiore de Henriquez. In 1972 his autobiography, co-authored with H. Harvard Arnason, was published on the occasion of an exhibition of his sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

==Death and legacy==
Jacques Lipchitz died in Capri, Italy. A contingent including Rabbi Gershon Mendel Garelik flew with his body to Jerusalem for the burial.

His Tuscan Villa Bozio was donated to Chabad-Lubavitch in Italy and currently hosts an annual Jewish summer camp in its premises.

<doc id="166598" wikidata="Q1300012" url="?curid=166598" title="Toy piano">
<text>The toy piano, also known as the  ( in German), is a small piano-like musical instrument. Most modern toy pianos use round metal rods, as opposed to strings in a regular piano, to produce sound. The U.S. Library of Congress recognizes the toy piano as a unique instrument with the subject designation, Toy Piano Scores: M175 T69. The most famous example of a dedicated composition for the instrument is the &quot;Suite for Toy Piano&quot; (1948) by John Cage.

== Characteristics ==
Toy pianos come in many shapes, from scale models of upright or grand pianos to toys which only resemble pianos in that they possess keys. Toy pianos are usually no more than 50 cm in width, and made out of wood or plastic. The first toy pianos were made in the mid-19th century and were typically uprights, although many toy pianos made today are models of grands. Rather than hammers hitting strings as on a standard piano, the toy piano sounds by way of hammers hitting metal bars or rods which are fixed at one end. The hammers are connected to the keys by a mechanism similar to that which drives celestas.
Toy pianos ostensibly use the same musical scale as full size pianos, although their tuning in all but the most expensive models is usually very approximate. Similarly, the pitch to which they are tuned is rarely close to the standard of 440 Hz for the A above middle C. A typical toy piano will have a range of one to three octaves. The cheapest models may not have black keys, or the black keys may be painted on. This means they can play a fixed diatonic scale (or an approximately tuned version of it), but not the full chromatic scale, or diatonic scales in other keys. Typically, diatonic toy pianos have only eight keys and
can play one octave. Other variants may have non-functioning black keys between every key (which would make it appear to play the quarter tones between E/F and B/C), but they either do not play, play the same notes as an adjacent white key, or play a special sound effect. Some toy pianos cost hundreds of dollars.

== History ==
Early toy pianos used glass bars to produce their sound, but Albert Schoenhut, son of a German toy-making family, introduced metal sounding bars to make the instrument more durable. One popular model used metal xylophone bars, struck by a wooden sphere thrown up by the piano key to make its sound. In 1866 he was offered employment in Philadelphia, United States, to repair German toy pianos which had been damaged in transit. In 1872 he established the Schoenhut Piano Company to manufacture toy pianos, diversifying into other instruments. By 1917, Schoenhut produced a catalog showing 10 pages of upright and grand pianos of all shapes and sizes, with one page devoted to miniature piano stools alone. The models had nicknames beginning with &quot;P&quot;, such as Packer, Padder, Papa and Poet. Keys were made of imitation ivory. By 1935, Schoenhut had produced over 40 styles and sizes of toy piano, with prices ranging from 50 cents to 25 dollars.

In 1930, a toy piano metal rod design was patented by Alice Violet Bennett.
During the 1950s, J. Chein &amp; Company of Burlington, NJ manufactured the PianoLodeon, a child&#x27;s piano remarkable for the fact that it operated by a mechanism closely related to an actual player piano. The child could play the keys or let a small piano roll take over, the metal rods being struck by hammers propelled by a vacuum driven by a blower. In the 1960s, the Tomy Toy Company offered the Tuneyville Player Piano using organ music, in which air blows through pipes. The child can play the keys manually or insert a plastic disk to play a recognizable tune.

By the 1950s, the toy piano market was dominated by two main toy piano makers: Jaymar and Schoenhut, counterparts to the Steinway and Baldwin for adult pianos. Wooden keys and hammers were replaced by moulded plastic ones. In the late 1970s, Schoenhut was acquired by Jaymar, although the two retained their distinct identities. Jaymar/Schoenhut experienced difficulty during the recession of the 1980s, folding and eventually re-emerging as the Schoenhut Piano Company in 1997. Today, Schoenhut Piano Company is still the leading manufacturer, with other toy piano manufacturers: Hering from Brazil, Zeada from China, and New Classic Toys from Netherlands.

From 1939 to 1970, Victor Michel improved toy-piano conception. Michelsonne French toy-pianos are known for their uniquely distinctive sound.

Launched in 2000, the annual Toy Piano Festival, held in San Diego at the University of California, San Diego&#x27;s Geisel Library, features a collection of toy pianos, recordings of compositions, and live performance of existing and new works written for toy pianos. The Festival influenced the Library of Congress to designate, in 2001, a dedicated subject heading and call number, Toy Piano Scores: M175 T69.

== Use in musical performance==
Though originally made as a child&#x27;s toy, the toy piano has been used in serious classical and contemporary musical contexts. The most famous example is the &quot;Suite for Toy Piano&quot; (1948) by John Cage. Other works in classical music for the instrument include &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot; by George Crumb and a number of pieces by Mauricio Kagel. &quot;Streicher, Tasti et Bizarreries&quot; (2019) by Bijan Olia uses toy piano and melodica in addition to piano quartet.

<text>The ancient Norse rulers of Greenland were called paramount chieftains. 

Among the island nation&#x27;s chieftains were:
*Erik the Red, or Eirikr Thorvaldsson, the nation&#x27;s first chieftain and its first settler, began rule in 985.
*Leif Ericson, likely the first European to set foot in North America
*Thorkell Leifsson succeeded his father, Leif, sometime after 1018.
