==Early life, ancestry and education ==
Kingsley was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji on 31 December 1943, in Snainton, North Riding of Yorkshire. His mother, Anna Lyna Mary (&quot;née&quot; Goodman) (1914–2010), was an English actress and model, and she later gave birth to a second son called Sadru Bhanji, who later worked as a psychiatrist in Devon. She was born out of wedlock and &quot;was loath to speak of her background&quot;. His father, Rahimtulla Harji Bhanji (1914–1968), was born in Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) to a family originating from the Indian city of Jamnagar, of Khoja Gujarati descent. Kingsley&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Harji Bhanji, was a successful spice trader who had moved from India to the Sultanate of Zanzibar, where Kingsley&#x27;s father lived until moving to the United Kingdom at the age of 14. Kingsley&#x27;s maternal grandfather was believed by the family to have been of Russian- or German-Jewish descent, while his maternal grandmother was English and worked in the garment district of London&#x27;s East End. Kingsley stated in 1994, &quot;I&#x27;m not Jewish, and though there might be some Russian-Jewish heritage way back on my mother&#x27;s side, the thread is so fine there&#x27;s no real evidence.&quot; In a 2016 interview, he indicated that his maternal grandmother was impregnated by a Russian-Jewish immigrant who later abandoned her, which led her to become a &quot;vile anti-Semite.&quot;

Kingsley grew up in Pendlebury, Lancashire. Although his father was a Gujarati Khoja who practised Isma&#x27;ili Shia Islam, Kingsley was not raised in his father&#x27;s faith, and identifies as a Quaker. He was educated at the Manchester Grammar School, where one of his classmates was actor Robert Powell. Kingsley went on to study at De La Salle College in Salford, which later became home to The Ben Kingsley Theatre. While at college, he became involved in amateur dramatics in Manchester, making his professional stage debut on graduation, aged 23.

==Career==
===1967–1981: Stage work and early career===
After graduating, in 1966, Kingsley was approached by music producer and manager Dick James. James, who was the publisher of The Beatles, offered to mould Kingsley into a pop star. Kingsley declined James&#x27; offer, and instead chose to join the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1967 after an audition before Trevor Nunn. Devoting himself almost exclusively to stage work for the next 15 years, he made his West End debut for the company at the Aldwych Theatre in 1967 in a production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Further productions for the RSC included &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (starring in Peter Brook&#x27;s acclaimed 1970 RSC production as Demetrius), &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;.
In the 1960s, Kingsley changed his name to Ben Kingsley, fearing that a foreign name would hamper his career. He told the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, &quot;As soon as I changed my name, I got the jobs. I had one audition as Krishna Bhanji and they said, &#x27;Beautiful audition but we don&#x27;t quite know how to place you in our forthcoming season.&#x27; I changed my name, crossed the road, and they said when can you start?&quot; In 1971 Kingsley made his Broadway debut playing Demetrius in the revival of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; acting with Patrick Stewart, Frances de la Tour and Martin Best. He played Mosca in Peter Hall&#x27;s 1977 production of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; for the Royal National Theatre. In 1981 he returned to Broadway playing the title role in the Raymond Fitzsimmons play &quot;Edmund Kean&quot; (1983). He played Willy Loman in a 1982 Sydney production of the Arthur Miller play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; opposite Mel Gibson.

Kingsley began his transition to film roles early on, making his feature film debut playing a supporting role in the British action thriller &quot;Fear Is the Key&quot; in 1972. Kingsley continued to play small roles in both film and television, including a role as Ron Jenkins on the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from 1966 to 1967 and regular appearances as a defence counsel in the long-running British legal programme &quot;Crown Court&quot;. In 1974 he played Thidias in a taped performance of the William Shakespeare play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He acted alongside Patrick Stewart and Tim Pigott-Smith. In 1975, he starred as Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the historical drama &quot;The Love School&quot; and appeared in the TV miniseries &quot;Dickens of London&quot; the following year.

===1982–1998: Transition to film and television===
A turning point in Kingsley&#x27;s career came with the historical biographical epic drama film &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), directed by Richard Attenborough, in which Kingsley played the titular role of the anti-colonialist activist and peacemaker Mahatma Gandhi. The film was a critical and financial success with film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praising the casting of Kingsley in the lead role writing, &quot;makes the role so completely his own that there is a genuine feeling that the spirit of Gandhi is on the screen. Kingsley&#x27;s performance is powerful without being loud or histrionic; he is almost always quiet, observant, and soft-spoken on the screen, and yet his performance comes across with such might that we realize, afterward, that the sheer moral force of Gandhi must have been behind the words.&quot; Kingsley went on to win numerous accolades for his performance including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for his performance. The following year he acted in the British drama film &quot;Betrayal&quot; (1983), an adaptation of the 1978 play of the same title by Harold Pinter. Kingsley starred opposite Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge. For his performance he won the Evening Standard British Film Awards.
Throughout the 1980s, Kingsley appeared in a variety of films, including a leading role in the John Irvin directed British drama &quot;Turtle Diary&quot; (1985) starring opposite Glenda Jackson. The film was based on the 1975 novel of the same title and was adapted for the screen by Harold Pinter. Sheila Benson of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; praised their performances writing, &quot;No filmic cliches, no swelling musical score; these are no &quot;littul peeple&quot; who melt into each other&#x27;s arms, but blessedly real people, who get exhausted and don&#x27;t talk all the time.&quot; He acted in the Merchant-Ivory costume drama &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987). The film was adapted from the 1971 novel of the same title by E. M. Forster. Kingsley acted alongside Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, and Denholm Elliott. He played the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich in &quot;Testimony&quot;, and the main character of Basil Pascali in &quot;Pascali&#x27;s Island&quot; (1988), and went on to portray Dr. John Watson alongside Michael Caine&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes in &quot;Without a Clue&quot; that year. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the organised crime figure Meyer Lansky in &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991). Additional roles include the supporting character of Cosmo in the thriller film &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992), Vice-President Gary Nance in &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), and the chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini in &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; (1993).

In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s historical drama film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), Kingsley portrayed the Holocaust survivor Itzhak Stern alongside Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Kingsley received a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Kingsley must act within much more rigid constraints as his trusted accountant Stern, a man who feels he must never make a misstep. Role is reminiscent of Alec Guinness&#x27; deluded Col. Nicholson in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;; in his compulsion to do a perfect job for Schindler, he often seems to forget that he&#x27;s working for the enemy.&quot; Further roles include the BBC adaptation of &quot;Silas Marner&quot; (1985) as the titular character. Kingsley starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (1994), having previously acted with her in &quot;Dave&quot;.

In 1996 he portrayed Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, a film adaptation of the William Shakespeare play. Kingsley starred alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Nigel Hawthorne, and Richard E. Grant. In a mixed review, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted his performance as a highlight writing, &quot;Ben Kingsley brings some nice readings to his rather mysterious role of Feste, the commentator on the convoluted proceedings.&quot; The following film he provided a voice in the video game &quot;Ceremony of Innocence&quot;. In 1998, he was the head of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival and starred in the family film &quot;Spooky House&quot;, saying he had chosen a role in a lighter film after acting in roles that left him feeling traumatised.

===1999–present: Further success===
Kingsley took on the role of Don Logan, a violent psychopath and recruiter for London&#x27;s underworld, in Jonathan Glazer&#x27;s &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; (2000), a psychological black comedy crime film acting with Ray Winstone and Ian McShane. Critic Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley&#x27;s gifts for control and stillness. There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach – it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain. But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning&quot;. Kingsley&#x27;s role as Logan earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. A year later, he won a Crystal Globe award for having an outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. In 2003 he portrayed Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani in the Vadim Perelman directed &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; acting opposite Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo. Critic Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Kingsley, carrying his body like armor, sculpting each line into a bitter dart of pride, plays fierceness with a powerful tug of sorrow.&quot; For his role he earned nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor. The following year he played a supporting role as Benjamin O&#x27;Ryan in the psychological thriller &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; (2004). Although the film received negative reviews from critics, reservations were made for Kingsley&#x27;s performance.
In July 2006, Kingsley received an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination for his performance in the HBO television film &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot; (2005), in which he played famed cardiologist Herman Tarnower, who was murdered by his jilted lover, Jean Harris played by Annette Bening. Later that year, he made a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; titled &quot;Luxury Lounge&quot;. Kingsley plays himself in the episode as Chris and Little Carmine pitch him the role of a mob boss in the film &quot;Cleaver&quot;, which he turns down. In 2007, Kingsley appeared as a Polish American mobster in the Mafia comedy &quot;You Kill Me&quot;, and a hitman in &quot;War, Inc.&quot; The following year he acted in the romantic drama &quot;Elegy&quot; (2008) directed by Isabel Coixet. He starred alongside Penélope Cruz, Peter Sarsgaard, Patricia Clarkson, and Dennis Hopper. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of the film and his performance, &quot;Ben Kingsley, who can play just about any role, seems to be especially effective playing slimy intellectuals. &quot;Elegy&quot; is a film that could have been made for him, although by the time it&#x27;s over, Penélope Cruz has slipped away with it, and transformed Kingsley&#x27;s character in the process. It&#x27;s nicely done.&quot; Kingsley received a nomination for the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best British Actor of the Year.

The years 2010 and 2011 contained several big roles for Kingsley. In 2010, he worked voicing a character named Sabine in the Lionhead Studios game &quot;Fable III&quot; and starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), directed by Martin Scorsese. That same year, Kingsley made his Bollywood debut in the thriller &quot;Teen Patti&quot; (2010). The following year he appeared in Scorsese&#x27;s next film, the children&#x27;s adventure film &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), playing the French illusionist Georges Méliès. Kingsley&#x27;s portrayal of Méliès also earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor. Kingsley also signed on to the sci-fi romance feature &quot;Broken Dream&quot;. The feature, by Neil Jordan and John Boorman, was later scrapped. In 2013, Kingsley appeared as the villain Trevor Slattery in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; with Robert Downey Jr.&quot;,&quot; and as the hero Mazer Rackham in the science-fiction action adventure film &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; with Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. A year later he played the Hebrew slave Nun in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Merenkahre, a simulacrum of an Egyptian pharaoh and father of Ahkmenrah, in Shawn Levy&#x27;s &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot; with Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rami Malek and Dan Stevens.

That same year, Kingsley would also reprise his role as Slattery in the direct-to-video short film &quot;All Hail the King&quot;.

In 2015, Kingsley portrayed a Sikh driving instructor in the film &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;. He voiced Bagheera in the live-action adaptation of Jon Favreau&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016), a remake of the original 1967 film shared cast with Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken. Kingsley also recorded Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; in book-on-tape format. In 2018, he narrated Amazon Prime&#x27;s documentary &quot;All or Nothing: Manchester City&quot; which followed Manchester City&#x27;s record breaking 2017–18 Premier League campaign. and served as the voice of General Woundwort in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot;. Kingsley reprised his role as Trevor Slattery in the film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021). Kingsley acted in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; (2023), a film adaptation of a short story by Roald Dahl, and starred opposite Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel and Benedict Cumberbatch. The film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

Kingsley has been announced as playing Ibrahim Arif in the upcoming film of Richard Osman&#x27;s multi-award-winning Thursday Murder Club series. Filming is due to begin in summer 2024.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and family ===
Kingsley has been married four times and has four children: Thomas Bhanji and artist Jasmin Bhanji, with his first wife, actress Angela Morant, and Edmund Kingsley and Ferdinand Kingsley, both of whom became actors, with his second wife, theatrical director Alison Sutcliffe. He divorced his third wife Alexandra Christmann in 2005, having been &quot;deeply, deeply shocked&quot; after pictures of her kissing another man surfaced on the internet. On 3 September 2007, Kingsley married Brazilian actress Daniela Lavender at Eynsham Hall in North Leigh, Oxfordshire.

=== Charity ===
Kingsley appeared in a production of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Monologues&quot; in 2010 on stage in London alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Gemma Arterton, and Eddie Redmayne.

== Filmography ==

== Awards and nominations==

Kingsley won an Academy Award in the Best Actor category for &quot;Gandhi&quot;, and has been nominated three more times: Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Bugsy&quot; and &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, and Best Actor for &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003). In 1984, Kingsley won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Nonmusical Recording for &quot;The Words of Gandhi&quot;, received an honorary degree from the University of Salford, and was awarded the Indian civilian honour Padma Shri.

He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2002 New Year Honours for services to the British film industry. The award was announced on 31 December 2001, which happened to be Kingsley&#x27;s 58th birthday. After being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Kingsley stated:

His demand to be called &#x27;Sir&#x27; in film and TV show credits was documented by the BBC, to some criticism. Co-star Penélope Cruz was reportedly unsure what to call him during the filming of &quot;Elegy&quot; as someone had told her she needed to refer to him as &quot;Sir Ben&quot;. One day it slipped out as such, and she called him that for the remainder of the shoot. Kingsley has denied accusations that he prefers to be referred to by his title, saying, &quot;If I&#x27;ve ever insisted on being called &#x27;Sir&#x27; by colleagues on a film set then I am profoundly sorry. I don&#x27;t remember ever doing that and I tend not to forget.&quot;
In May 2010, Kingsley was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In April 2013, Kingsley was honoured with the Fellowship Award at The Asian Awards in London.

<text>The Green Party of British Columbia, or simply the BC Greens, is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It was founded in 1983 and is based in Victoria. The party won its first seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2013 provincial election.

== Principles ==
The Green Party of BC promotes the principles of participatory democracy, sustainability, social justice, respect for diversity, ecological wisdom, and nonviolence.

==History==

=== Founding and early years (1983–1992)===
The first Green Party in North America was formed in British Columbia, Canada on February 6, 1983. It registered as a provincial society and a political party shortly before the 1983 provincial election. It fielded four candidates and received 0.19% of the vote under the leadership of Adriane Carr. In a federal by-election in the riding of Mission—Port Moody the same year, Betty Nickerson was the Green Party of Canada&#x27;s first federal candidate, but the party&#x27;s status was not yet recognized by Elections Canada. She appears in electoral records as an &quot;independent&quot; candidate.

Carr stepped back from active involvement in the party in 1985, and the party abolished the position of leader. Thereafter, it was represented in the media by three spokespersons. In the 1986 provincial election, the party won 0.23% of the vote and fielded nine candidates. In 1988, in response to a proposal to field only female candidates in the following election, Carr and her husband Paul George returned briefly to active involvement to defeat the proposal. From 1988 to 1992, the party was deeply divided between supporters of Carr and Greenpeace founder Jim Bohlen and its Ecofeminist Caucus. During this period, its internal politics were dominated by a compromise faction led by electoral reform activist Steve Kisby.

However, this period of relative stability ended with the party&#x27;s failure to make a breakthrough in the 1991 provincial election, despite increasing its province-wide vote share to 0.86% and fielding a slate of 42 candidates.

=== Parker years (1993–1999) ===
In 1993, the party elected a new leader, 21-year-old Stuart Parker, who revitalized the party with youthful new members. He managed to take the party to running close to a full slate in the 1996 election, but was only able to garner only 2% support province-wide, despite receiving the endorsement of prominent environmentalist David Suzuki. Green hopes for a breakthrough in the Kootenay riding of Nelson-Creston with candidate Andy Shadrack yielded a result of only 11%. Parker&#x27;s first term (1993–96) was characterized by near-continuous touring of rural BC which had, up to that point, negligible or highly intermittent organization outside of the Okanagan and Comox Valleys. This touring paid off in yielding on-going organization throughout the province, enabling the party to come just four candidates short of a full slate.

The direction of the party under Parker was set by many disgruntled ex–British Columbia New Democratic Party members, and the policies of the party under Parker were notably leftist. During Parker&#x27;s second term as leader, the party rose to a peak of 11% in public opinion polls between 1996 and 1999, almost exclusively at the NDP&#x27;s expense. Although he was arrested in logging road blockades in 1993 and 1997, Parker&#x27;s Greens actually invested more resources in opposing the BC Benefits package of welfare reforms and working on other social issues than it did on any significant environmental issue.

While remaining sharply critical of Glen Clark&#x27;s NDP government, Parker spearheaded highly controversial negotiations to form municipal electoral alliances with NDP-affiliated parties in 1998 after vote-splitting all but wiped out leftist representation at the local level in Vancouver and Victoria in 1996. These negotiations, approved by Clark, yielded tripartite agreements between local labour councils, Greens and New Democrats in Vancouver and Victoria, leading to Red-Green coalitions contesting the 1999 municipal elections in both cities with the support of organized labour. Neither coalition formed government but both made substantial gains, resulting in the election in Victoria, BC, of Art Vanden Berg, the first person in Canadian history to run as a Green and be elected to City Council. In Vancouver, the coalition effort also elected Parks Commissioner Roslyn Cassells.

=== Carr years (2000–2006)===
The party&#x27;s increased poll standing, new position on collaboration with its longtime rivals and impending electoral success attracted the attention of a number of prominent environmentalists, led by Carr, who began a campaign in 1999 to remove the party&#x27;s then leadership. The group conducted a bitter year-long public campaign that included an unsuccessful lawsuit against the party and later-disproven allegations against the party&#x27;s leader and board of directors including fraud, vote-rigging and even theft. Although the group was defeated at the party&#x27;s 1999 convention, it triumphed in 2000. Shortly thereafter, the party elected Carr as its new leader; since 2001, the party leader has ceased to be subject to annual review votes, the process by which Parker was removed. Following the 2000 convention, all of the party&#x27;s elected municipal representatives and some other members resigned.

With the high-profile changes at the top, the party was able to improve on its 9% poll standing at the beginning of 2000 and reached 12% of the popular vote in the May 2001 provincial election. In spite of that significant support, it won no seats in the provincial legislature – a fact which has been cited as an argument against the first-past-the-post voting system used in BC elections.

Although she had sponsored a series of resolutions at the party&#x27;s 2000 convention condemning what many saw as the party&#x27;s distraction with social and governance policy at the expense of work on environmental issues, electoral reform moved to the top of Carr&#x27;s agenda as leader. Disagreeing with Fair Voting BC&#x27;s decision to devote the movement&#x27;s energies to backing the new BC Liberal government&#x27;s plan to move forward with the Citizens&#x27; Assembly process it had developed in 1997, Carr founded a rival electoral reform organization called Free Your Vote to utilize the province&#x27;s citizen initiative legislation (which technically allows citizens to force referendums on legislation if they gather a sufficient number of signatures).

Despite facing public condemnation from FVBC&#x27;s Loenen, Free Your Vote recruited hundreds of volunteers for the province-wide effort, building a far larger citizen organization than either ECCO or FVBC. It also gained the support of many leftists, including the official endorsement of the BC Nurses&#x27; and other unions. The campaign also faced its share of difficulties, such as leaked internal memos from the party&#x27;s organizing chair explaining that organizers knew the petition drive would fail, but were simply using it to build the party&#x27;s organizational base. Although the campaign only submitted enough signatures in four of the province&#x27;s 79 ridings, Free Your Vote was successful in mobilizing new support for reform. But it also appears to have hardened the party&#x27;s support for a single model of proportional representation (mixed-member, closed-list) and public condemnation of others.

Following the failure of her preferred Free Your Vote, Carr focused her energy on a lively province-wide campaign opposing the 2010 Winter Olympic Games bid. But once the games were awarded to BC, the party was unable to find province-wide issues that resonated strongly with voters. Between 2003 and 2005, the party&#x27;s presence was notably low key as Carr returned to the constant touring mode that had characterized Parker&#x27;s first term.

In the 2005 provincial election, the GPBC&#x27;s vote declined to 9% province-wide from 12% four years previously. Despite being rated highly for her debate performance by media commentators, Carr&#x27;s performance was poorly rated by the public and her own vote share declined to 25% in her home constituency of Powell River-Sunshine Coast, 17% behind the victorious NDP candidate. Only in the constituencies of Vancouver-Burrard, West Vancouver-Garibaldi and Kelowna-Mission did the party&#x27;s popularity increase.

These measures seemed insufficient to quiet increasing internal dissatisfaction with her leadership. Prior to the first annual convention following the reinstitution of the practice of requiring leaders to step down and run to succeed themselves each electoral cycle (this policy, along with annual confidence votes, had been previously repealed in 2001), Carr announced her resignation on September 24, 2006. As predicted by those familiar with Carr&#x27;s long-standing relationship with the newly elected Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May, Carr accepted the paid position of deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada. She then ran as a federal candidate in the riding of Vancouver Centre but did not win.

=== Sterk and Weaver (2007–2020)===

The Green Party of British Columbia held a leadership election on October 21, 2007, after the resignation of Carr in September 2006. Christopher Bennett was appointed interim leader until the leadership election was held. Former Vancouver-Hastings candidate Ian Gregson was the first to announce his candidacy.

Jane Sterk, a municipal councillor, university professor and small business owner, was elected leader of the BC Greens at their 2007 Convention at Royal Roads University in Victoria. She assumed the role from interim leader Christopher Ian Bennett.

The Greens maintain they receive support from all over the political spectrum. In the federal election of 2004, former Social Credit Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and media personality Rafe Mair confounded many by openly supporting the Green Party. The Greens have often been labelled as right-wing at the same time as being labelled left-wing by opponents.

The Greens&#x27; strength is concentrated on Southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, The Okanagan, Sea-to-Sky region and in high density areas of Vancouver. In 1991, the party&#x27;s strongest showing was 4.4% in Rossland-Trail; in 1996, 11% in Nelson-Creston, in 2001 and 2005, in Carr&#x27;s riding of Powell River-Sunshine Coast where she received 27% and 25% respectively, and in 2009 in West Vancouver-Sea-to-Sky with 22%.

The Greens won their first ever seat with Andrew Weaver winning in Oak Bay-Gordon Head in the May 2013 general election. Despite a slight drop in overall popular vote, the party climbed to 11.15% in the 61 ridings where they ran candidates. Weaver won 40% of the vote in his riding, and the party also surpassed 20% of the vote in Esquimalt-Royal Roads, Nelson-Creston, Saanich North and the Islands, Victoria-Beacon Hill, and Victoria-Swan Lake.

On August 13, 2013, Sterk announced she would retire from politics after the 2013 Annual General Meeting, held on August 24, 2013. Adam Olsen, former candidate in Saanich North and the Islands served as interim leader until December 9, 2015, when Weaver was acclaimed to the full-time position.

In the May 2017 general election, Weaver, Adam Olsen and Sonia Furstenau were elected to the provincial legislature, with the party winning 16.84% of the popular vote. The Green Party signed a confidence and supply agreement with the NDP in exchange for policy concessions on environmental and social issues. The NDP and Greens then defeated the incumbent Liberal government by one vote in a no confidence vote, with the NDP then being invited to form government.

On October 7, 2019, Andrew Weaver announced he would step down as party leader once a new leader had been chosen and would not run in the next British Columbia election anticipated to take place in 2021. On December 20, 2019, Olsen was named interim leader, effective January 6, 2020. On January 16, 2020, Weaver resigned from caucus to sit as an independent member of the legislature.

The party was scheduled to hold a leadership election from June 15 to 26, 2020, but the election was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia. It had been planned that the winner would be announced at the party&#x27;s convention in Nanaimo. The leadership contest was relaunched on June 15, 2020. Sonia Furstenau was elected as leader on September 14, 2020.

=== Furstenau (2020–2025) ===

Sonia Furstenau was elected as leader on September 14, 2020. A week after her selection as leader, the 2020 general election was called. Furstenau and Adam Olsen were returned to the Legislature. The electoral district of West Vancouver-Sea to Sky was originally called for Green candidate Jeremy Valeriote; the winning margin was small enough to trigger an automatic judicial recount. After the recount, it was determined that Liberal Jordan Sturdy had held the seat.

In January 2024, Furstenau announced that she would run in Victoria-Beacon Hill riding during the provincial general election later that year. She was defeated but remained as leader following the election. She subsequently negotiated a cooperation agreement with the NDP in exchange for agreement that some policies from the Green platform would be implemented. On January 28, 2025, Furstenau announced her intention to resign as leader. Jeremy Valeriote became interim leader. The party will hold a leadership election in September 2025.

<text>My Favorite Year is a 1982 American comedy film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, directed by Richard Benjamin and written by Norman Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo from a story written by Palumbo. The film tells the story of a young comedy writer and stars Peter O&#x27;Toole, Mark Linn-Baker, Jessica Harper, and Joseph Bologna. O&#x27;Toole was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was adapted into an unsuccessful 1992 Broadway musical of the same name.

==Plot==
Through narration, Benjy Stone recalls the week (in his &quot;favorite year&quot; of 1954) when he met his idol: film actor Alan Swann, known for appearing in swashbuckler films during the 1930s and 1940s.

During television&#x27;s early days, Benjy works as a junior comedy writer for a variety show called &quot;Comedy Cavalcade&quot; starring Stan &quot;King&quot; Kaiser that is broadcast live from the NBC studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Swann, well past his prime, is booked as a guest star and arrives at the studio drunk. Kaiser nearly removes Swann from the show until Benjy intervenes, promising to keep Swann sober during the week preceding his scheduled appearance.
With help from Swann&#x27;s chauffeur Alfie, Benjy continuously monitors Swann. They learn much about each other, finding out that they each have family whom they want to remain out of the spotlight. Benjy&#x27;s mother is married to Filipino former bantamweight boxer Rookie Carroca, and Benjy has many other relatives who embarrass him. Swann&#x27;s young daughter Tess has been raised entirely by her mother, one of his many ex-wives. He rarely visits but secretly keeps tabs on her, unable to muster the courage to reconnect with her.
During the week of rehearsals, Kaiser is threatened by gangster Karl Rojeck, a corrupt union boss who objects to being parodied on the show. Disruptive events, ambiguous between real sabotage and random accidents, are noted after Kaiser belligerently insists on performing the &quot;Boss Hijack&quot; sketch.

Benjy clumsily and enthusiastically courts K.C. Downing, a pretty assistant to producer Leo Silver. Swann mentors Benjy, and Benjy is unable to prevent the drunken star from crashing a party at the home of K.C.&#x27;s affluent parents as they find themselves in the wrong apartment.
The night of the show, Swann suffers a panic attack after Benjy informs him that the program is broadcast live, not filmed as Swann had expected. Swann gets drunk and flees the studio. Benjy angrily confronts him, telling Swann that he always believed that he was the swashbuckling hero whom he had watched on the silver screen and that deep down, Swann possesses those qualities.
As the &quot;Boss Hijack&quot; sketch gets under way, Rojeck&#x27;s men appear backstage and attack Kaiser. The fight spills onto the stage during the broadcast, and the audience believes it&#x27;s part of the sketch. Swann and Benjy observe the melee from the balcony. Swann, dressed for a musketeer skit, grabs a rope and swings onto the stage and into action. He and Kaiser defeat the thugs together before the unwitting audience.
Benjy narrates the epilogue, relating that Swann, his confidence bolstered, visited his daughter the next day, enjoying a heartfelt reunion.

==Cast==
The girl in the Old Gold cigarette box was played (uncredited) by Lana Clarkson, who was murdered years later by Phil Spector. Gloria Stuart appears in a non-speaking role as Mrs. Horn.

==Relationship to real life==
Executive producer Mel Brooks was a writer for the Sid Caesar variety program &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; early in his career. Swashbuckler Errol Flynn was a guest on one episode, and his appearance inspired Dennis Palumbo&#x27;s mostly fictional screenplay. The character of Swann was based on Flynn, and Benjy Stone is based on both Brooks and Woody Allen, who also wrote for Caesar.

According to Brooks, the character Rookie Carroca was based on a Filipino sailor in the U.S. Navy who was his neighbor in Brooklyn. The name of the King Kaiser character is based on that of Sid Caesar (&quot;Kaiser&quot; is the German equivalent of the Roman title Caesar). Selma Diamond, another former &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; writer (who inspired Rose Marie&#x27;s character on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;), appears in the film as a wardrobe mistress.

The character of Herb, one of Kaiser&#x27;s writers who whispers rather than speaks, is based on Neil Simon, another of Caesar&#x27;s staff writers, who, according to Carl Reiner, whispered ideas to colleagues rather than trying to shout to be heard above the din of the noisy writers&#x27; room.
Brooks acknowledges that most of the film&#x27;s plot is fictional. He said that Flynn&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; was uneventful and that none of the writers had much interaction with Flynn, socialized with him or took him home to dinner.

==Production==
The film was based on an original script by Norman Steinberg.

&quot;My Favorite Year&quot; was the first film directed by actor Richard Benjamin, who worked as an NBC page at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1956.

Cameron Mitchell recalled that he met Mel Brooks when both were having lunch at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer commissary. Brooks told him that &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot; (which starred Mitchell and Brooks&#x27; wife Anne Bancroft) was his favorite film and asked him if he wanted to play a Jimmy Hoffa-type character in a film that he was producing at MGM. Mitchell accepted and was cast in &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; as Karl &quot;Boss&quot; Rojeck.

==Reception==
&quot;My Favorite Year&quot; opened in theaters on October 1, 1982, to $2,400,696 (#3, behind &quot;An Officer and a Gentlemen&quot;″s 11th weekend and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;″s 18th).

In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Janet Maslin called &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; &quot;a funny and good-natured comedy&quot; and wrote that director Richard Benjamin &quot;works in a steady, affable style that is occasionally inspired, always snappy and never less than amusing.&quot; On their movie review television program movie critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave praise to &quot;My Favorite Year.&quot; Siskel called it &quot;A wonderful little film full of big laughs and great nostalgia for TV&#x27;s golden age&quot; while Ebert, in agreement added, &quot; It was directed by Richard Benjamin, and it was directed well. It was a very, very funny movie. The physical comedy in this movie is just as good as the verbal comedy. It&#x27;s good from beginning to end.&quot; Michael Sragow of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had praise for the movie&#x27;s director Richard Benjamin, and its cast, saying, &quot;Director Richard Benjamin gets the most out of the script and the actors in almost every instance; it’s refreshing to see a small-scale movie that’s full to the brim with funny people.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 97% rating based on 30 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;My Favorite Year&quot; is a joyful ode to the early days of television, carried with a deft touch and Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s uproariously funny performance.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 62% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Musical adaptation==
Lainie Kazan was the only member of the cast to reprise her film role for the 1992 Broadway musical version of &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, in which Alan Swann was portrayed by Tim Curry and Alice Miller by Andrea Martin. All three were nominated for Tony Awards for their performances, with Martin winning her category.

<text>The New Democratic Party of British Columbia (BC NDP) is a social democratic political party in British Columbia, Canada. The party sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum and is one of the two major parties in British Columbia; since the 1990s, its rival was the centre-right BC United (formerly known as the BC Liberals) until the Conservative Party of British Columbia reconstituted itself for the 2024 British Columbia general election, with BC United withdrawing its candidates and endorsing the Conservatives. The party is formally affiliated with the federal New Democratic Party and serves as its provincial branch.

The party was established in 1933 as the provincial wing of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; the party adopted the NDP name in 1961 as part of the national party&#x27;s re-foundation. The CCF quickly established itself as a major party in BC: for all but five years between 1933 and 1972, the CCF/NDP was the Official Opposition to the Liberal, Conservative and Social Credit governments. The NDP won its first election in 1972 under leader Dave Barrett, who governed until being defeated in the 1975 election. The party returned to office in 1991 and governed until 2001 under a succession of leaders. The NDP lost the 2001 election in a landslide and remained in opposition until the 2017 election, when it formed a minority government under John Horgan. In 2020 election, the party was re-elected with a majority government. In 2022, following health concerns, Horgan stepped down as party leader and premier and was succeeded by David Eby, who led the party to a slim majority victory in the 2024 election.

Seven leaders of the NDP have served as premier of British Columbia: Dave Barrett, Mike Harcourt, Glen Clark, Dan Miller, Ujjal Dosanjh, John Horgan and David Eby. Since 2022, the party leader is David Eby, who is also premier of British Columbia.

==History==

===Foundation and early history: 1933–1951===
The party was formed in 1933, during the Great Depression, as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (British Columbia Section) — allied to the national CCF — by a coalition of the Socialist Party of Canada (SPC), the League for Social Reconstruction, and affiliated organizations. In August 1933, the latter two organizations merged to become the Associated CCF Clubs. The new party won seven seats in the 1933 provincial election, enough to form the official opposition. A further merger with the British Columbia SPC took place in 1935.

In 1936, the party split as its moderate leader, Reverend Robert Connell, was expelled over doctrinal differences in what was called the &quot;Connell Affair&quot;. Three other CCF members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in what had been a seven-member caucus quit and joined Connell in forming the Social Constructive Party, leaving only Harold Winch, Ernest Winch and Dorothy Steeves as CCF MLAs. The Constructivists nominated candidates in the 1937 election but failed to win a seat. The CCF regained their former contingent of seven MLAs but lost official opposition status to the reconstituted British Columbia Conservative Party.

Harold Winch succeeded Connell as CCF leader and guided the party until the 1950s.

The two-party system in Canada was challenged by the rise of the CCF and the Social Credit movement in western Canada during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The CCF first took power in 1944 in Saskatchewan under Premier Tommy Douglas. It also began to gain wider political support in British Columbia.

In order to block the rise of the CCF in BC, the provincial Liberal and Conservative parties formed a coalition government after the 1941 provincial election. That year neither party had enough seats to form a majority government on its own. For the ten years that the coalition held together, the CCF was the Official Opposition in the legislature.

===Solidification as opposition party: 1951–1972===
After the coalition fell apart in 1951, the government introduced the alternative vote electoral system, allowing voters to make two choices. They expected that Conservative voters would list the Liberals as their second choice and vice versa. The government hoped to prevent the CCF from winning in a three-party competition, but they did not realize that a new fourth party was on the rise: the BC Social Credit League.

In the 1952 election, the Liberals and Conservatives were decimated. The Social Credit League was the main beneficiary of the new voting system: many non-CCF voters chose Social Credit as either their first or second choices. Social Credit emerged as the largest party, with one seat more than Winch&#x27;s CCF. The Social Credit party chose a new leader, W. A. C. Bennett.

When Social Credit lost a motion of no confidence in the legislature in March 1953, Winch argued that the CCF should be allowed to try to form a government rather than the house being dissolved for an early election. The Liberals, however, refused to support the CCF&#x27;s bid to form a government, and new elections were called.

In the 1953 election, Bennett won a majority government, and both the Liberal and the Conservative parties were reduced to fringe parties. Throughout the 1950s, Bennett&#x27;s new electoral movement was able to keep the CCF at bay. This period coincided with the height of the Cold War, and Bennett effectively used the scare tactic of the &quot;Red Menace&quot; against the CCF, referring to them as the &quot;socialist hordes&quot;.

In 1960, the CCF joined with the Canadian Labour Congress nationally to create the New Party, which then in 1961 became the &quot;New Democratic Party&quot; (NDP). This reflected the formation of the national party from an alliance of the CCF and unions in the Canadian Labour Congress. Bennett managed to keep the CCF and the NDP out of power throughout the 1960s through four successive general elections. Each time, Bennett used the &quot;Red Menace&quot; tactic as a wedge issue against the NDP and its leaders: Robert Strachan and, in the 1969 general election, Thomas Berger.

===Barrett government: 1972–1975===
The NDP first won election in 1972 under Dave Barrett, who served as premier for three years. The NDP passed a considerable amount of legislation in a short time, including establishing the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia and the Agricultural Land Reserve. A Question Period was added to the legislative process.

The NDP drove the small BC Liberal caucus to abandon their leader David Anderson for the Social Credit Party, as did one of the two Tories elected in 1972. The NDP introduced capital taxes and slashed funding to universities. It suffered for bringing clarity to the accounting by Social Credit, and revealing that BC was significantly in debt.

In the 1975 election, the Social Credit party, under W. A. C. Bennett&#x27;s son Bill Bennett, won a snap election called by Barrett. The Barrett government had initiated a number of reforms in the areas of labour relations, the public service, and social programs. Most of these endured until the restraint budget of 1983.

=== Return to opposition: 1975–1991 ===
The NDP hit a then-high in popular support in the 1979 election with 46 percent of the vote. And after a minor decline in the party&#x27;s vote share in 1983, Barrett retired as leader.

Riding high in the polls, the NDP appeared poised to win the 1986 election against the unpopular Social Credit government, but its new leader Bob Skelly stumbled in a verbal gaffe during the campaign, and the Socreds&#x27; new leader William Vander Zalm attracted votes with his charisma and telegenic performance. The party failed to score its anticipated breakthrough.

===Harcourt government: 1991–1996===
The New Democratic Party governed BC for nine and a half years, winning two back-to-back general elections in 1991 and 1996 before being defeated in 2001. Although the party&#x27;s majority was reduced in 1996, it triumphed over the divided remnants of the Social Credit Party. In 1991, due in part to Social Credit&#x27;s scandals under Premier William Vander Zalm and in part to the stellar performance of British Columbia Liberal Party (BC Liberals) leader Gordon Wilson in debate, the old Social Credit vote split between the BC Liberals, which garnered 33 percent of the vote, and the Social Credit Party with 25 percent. The NDP, under the leadership of former Vancouver mayor Mike Harcourt, won with 41 percent of the popular vote, which was one percentage point lower than the share the party had lost with in 1986.

Harcourt&#x27;s first two years in government were characterized by a notably social democratic policy agenda, which included increases in welfare spending and rates. The voting age was lowered from 19 to 18 in 1992. In 1993, his government took a dramatic turn to the right with his televised address in which he lashed out against &quot;welfare cheats, deadbeats and varmints&quot;. Broadcast province-wide, his speech inaugurated a set of welfare reforms enacted between 1993 and 1995; these were similar to those adopted by new Progressive Conservative provincial governments elected in Alberta and Ontario in the same time period.

The cutbacks were, in part, a reaction to a dramatic reduction in federal transfer payments by the federal Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Parliament had repealed the Canada Assistance Plan bill of rights, which had included a right to food and a right to shelter. Unlike the reforms of the Harris and Klein governments in the other two provinces noted, the BC Benefits package of cutbacks and restrictions in social assistance eligibility was bundled with a childcare bonus paid to low- and medium-income families. The changes were unpopular with the province&#x27;s anti-poverty movement and the BC Green Party; they were condemned by a motion at the NDP&#x27;s 1997 convention.

Three months before BC Benefits was introduced by the Harcourt government, his government came into a protracted conflict with elements of the province&#x27;s environmental movement. Harcourt&#x27;s &quot;Peace in the Woods&quot; pact, which brought together traditionally warring environmental groups and forest workers&#x27; unions, began to collapse when Harcourt&#x27;s cabinet exempted an environmentally sensitive area of Vancouver Island, Clayoquot Sound, from its province-wide mediation process for land-use conflicts, the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE). First Nations peoples led protests, including logging road blockades, which resulted in the arrests of more than 800 people. Some key environmental leaders, such as David Suzuki and Colleen McCrory, became alienated from the NDP and shifted their support to the Green Party in the 1996 provincial election.

Although low in the polls for much of his term in office, Harcourt and his newly appointed attorney general, Ujjal Dosanjh, succeeded in regaining substantial public support by taking a hard line against an aboriginal group&#x27;s occupation of a farmer&#x27;s field in the Cariboo region of the province. In what became known as the Gustafsen Lake standoff, Dosanjh led the largest-scale police operation in British Columbia history as the government tried to regain control. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) used armoured vehicles provided by the Canadian military for protection. The military strongly rejected attempts by the RCMP to have them take over control of the situation, and ultimately it remained a police operation. The RCMP used anti-vehicle mines and shot thousands of rounds of ammunition at protesters.

With less than 72 hours before a planned election call, and with the NDP high in the polls for its hard line against welfare recipients and aboriginal and environmental radicals, the party&#x27;s provincial office was raided by RCMP officers as part of an ongoing investigation of illegal use of charity bingo money by former provincial cabinet minister and MP Dave Stupich (for which Stupich was later convicted on two counts). Media called the scandal &quot;Bingogate&quot;. Although Harcourt was not implicated in either the raid or the probe, he resigned; he was later fully exonerated. The NDP was led into the 1996 provincial general election by Glen Clark.

===Clark government: 1996–1999===
Clark entered the 1996 election far back in the polls but proved an excellent campaigner. For the duration of the election, he re-unified the party&#x27;s traditional coalition, using the slogan &quot;On Your Side&quot;. He effectively portrayed the Liberals&#x27; new leader, former Vancouver mayor Gordon Campbell, as a pawn of big business and a dangerous right-wing extremist. Clark, for example, pointed to Campbell&#x27;s promise to privatize BC Rail as an example of Campbell&#x27;s pro big business policies. Clark was aided by Jack Weisgerber, leader of the BC Reform Party (the name taken by the majority of the Social Credit caucus), and Wilson, by then leader of the Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA). Although the NDP won only 39 percent of the vote to Campbell&#x27;s 42 percent, it secured 39 seats to Campbell&#x27;s 33. This was partially explained by the vote splitting of the centre-right electorate following the collapse of the Social Credit party, with 9.29% and 5.74% of the popular vote going to the right wing Reform party and centrist Progressive Democrat parties respectively. This is possible because BC uses a first past the post electoral system.

Following the campaign, Clark&#x27;s government struggled to exert leadership; the premier&#x27;s scrappy style began to further alienate parts of the NDP coalition outside the core group of labour activists who helped to run Clark&#x27;s campaign. Shortly after the election, it was discovered that the 1995–96 and 1996–97 fiscal years did not have the balanced budgets on which Clark had campaigned but small deficits of approximately $100million. This became a political scandal following a report by the BC Auditor General, which stated that the finance minister acted in a way &quot;inconsistent with the principle of responsible and prudent fiscal planning&quot; when drawing up the projected revenue numbers. 

During these years, the NDP began to lose support and activists to the BC Greens, who reached 5 percent in the polls in the fourth quarter of 1997 and 11 percent by the fall of 1998. But most voters who left the NDP ultimately shifted to the Liberals, which was evident from the polling leading up to the 2001 BC election. 

New scandals surfaced. Clark allegedly used his influence to win a casino licence for a neighbour, Dimitrios Pilarinos, who had helped him with some home renovations. Construction of the PacifiCat BC Ferries suffered cost over-runs and poor technical decisions. The new ferries were intended to speed transportation between Vancouver and Nanaimo but became part of the fast ferry scandal, ultimately costing the province $454million when the government sold them for scrap. Technical issues with the ferries included their inability to operate at all if wave heights exceeded and their reduced motor vehicle carrying capacity compared to traditional ferries.

By mid-1999, an obvious rift had appeared in the administration as Attorney General Dosanjh and Finance Minister Joy MacPhail challenged Clark&#x27;s legitimacy. The party and province endured a few chaotic months of government with frequent cabinet shuffles following a police raid on Clark&#x27;s home before he stepped down as premier. In 2002, Clark was acquitted of all charges in the Pilarinos case. Pilarinos himself was convicted on six charges and acquitted on three charges. 

Dan Miller, the longest-serving member of the legislature, stepped in as premier and interim party leader during an acrimonious leadership race between Dosanjh, maverick West Kootenay MLA Corky Evans, and Wilson (who had been persuaded to fold his Progressive Democratic Alliance party into the NDP and join Glen Clark&#x27;s cabinet in 1999). Despite clear favouritism from Clark, Wilson dropped out of the race less than one hour before the delegates voted due to a lack of support, throwing his support behind Evans. The final vote tally was 769 votes for Dosanjh and 549 votes for Evans, hence Dosanjh became party leader and the next premier. 

===Dosanjh government: 2000–2001 ===
Having bottomed out at 15 percent in the polls, the Dosanjh government attempted to capitalize on the new premier&#x27;s high personal approval rating with their remaining year in power. The government made a number of concessions to the party&#x27;s anti-poverty and environmental wings in an attempt to reforge the coalition but the party would not budge in the polls.

Dosanjh waited as long as possible to call the next election, finally doing so in April 2001. By this time, the party had risen to 21 percent in opinion polling – a slight improvement from the nadir of a year earlier. Nonetheless, it became obvious that the NDP would not be re-elected. Midway through the campaign, Dosanjh conceded defeat in a pre-recorded message and asked the electorate to give the NDP a chance as a strong opposition party. De facto leadership passed to MacPhail, who managed to reinvigorate the campaign. The NDP&#x27;s popular vote dropped to 22 percent, while its seat count dropped to only two – MacPhail and neighbouring Vancouver-Mount Pleasant MLA Jenny Kwan. They were also the only surviving members of the previous Cabinet; even Dosanjh lost his seat. All 77 other seats were captured by the Liberals who won 58 percent of the vote. It was the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. Despite the severe defeat, MacPhail was credited for saving the party from being completely wiped off the electoral map. Shortly after the election, Dosanjh resigned as leader and MacPhail was appointed interim leader.

===Opposition and recovery: 2001–2017===
MacPhail and Kwan were initially not granted official party status by Campbell on the grounds that the legislature&#x27;s rules stipulated a party must hold four seats. However, the Speaker of the Assembly, former Social Credit cabinet minister-turned BC Liberal Claude Richmond, recognized MacPhail as leader of the Opposition. Ultimately, Richmond&#x27;s position gradually won out, and he was able to ensure that the remains of the NDP were provided the resources of an official party.

Given the high level of support within the party for her leadership, MacPhail surprised many by choosing not to seek the full-time leadership in 2003. The low-key leadership campaign was contested by establishment favourite and former Victoria School Board chair Carole James, Oak Bay City Councillor Nils Jensen, former MLAs Leonard Krog and Steve Orcherton, and a few minor candidates. First ballot results had James first followed by Jensen, Krog, and Orcherton. James won on the second ballot.

In late 2004, the party won an upset election victory in the constituency of Surrey-Panorama Ridge. Jagrup Brar became the third member of the party&#x27;s caucus, winning a riding that had supported the NDP in 1991 before falling to the Liberals in 1996. Brar beat a locally popular BC Liberal candidate and Adriane Carr, the BC Green Party&#x27;s leader, winning an absolute majority of the vote.

In the 2005 provincial election, James came closer to forming a government than even the NDP had predicted, winning 33 seats to Campbell&#x27;s 45 and receiving a vote share 5 percent higher in suburban Vancouver than any pollster had predicted. The NDP also exceeded 40 percent of the vote for the first time since 1991.

In 2008, the NDP won two key by-elections in Vancouver-Fairview and Vancouver-Burrard.

In the 2009 provincial election, the NDP came a close second to the Liberals, with 42 percent of the popular vote and the Liberals receiving 45 percent. 35 New Democrats and 49 Liberals were elected. Despite the popular vote, only 3,500 votes separated the party from forming government.

The NDP under Adrian Dix was widely expected to win the May 2013 provincial election as the NDP enjoyed a 20-point lead in the polls prior to the election campaign. However, the Liberals gained four seats, while the NDP lost two, in an election that returned the Liberal government under Premier Christy Clark. In September 2013, Dix announced his intention to resign as party leader once a leadership election was held.

Following Dix&#x27;s resignation, John Horgan, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca, was acclaimed as party leader in the 2014 party leadership election and subsequently became the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.

===Horgan and Eby governments: since 2017===

In the lead-up to the May 2017 provincial election, the NDP under Horgan occasionally led the Liberals in polls. The May 9 election returned 43 Liberal MLAs, 41 NDP MLAs and a record 3 Green MLAs. This was one of the closest elections in BC&#x27;s history, exemplified by the popular vote breakdown: 40.36% for the Liberals, 40.28% for the NDP, and 16.84% for the Greens. The Liberals won the popular vote by a razor-thin margin of just 1,566 votes province-wide. Following the election, which resulted in a hung parliament, the Greens entered into negotiations with both the Liberals and NDP to decide which party they should support in the minority parliament. On May 29, Horgan and Green leader Andrew Weaver announced that the Greens would support an NDP minority government in a confidence and supply agreement. This meant the Greens are obliged to vote with the NDP in matters of confidence – keeping the government from falling – but were allowed to vote freely on legislation brought forward by the NDP government. On June 29, the minority Liberal government of Premier Christy Clark was defeated 44–42 by the NDP-Green alliance in a confidence vote, leading Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon to ask Horgan to form a government. On July 18, Horgan was sworn in as British Columbia&#x27;s 36th premier, and first NDP premier in 16 years. The NDP formed a minority government, the first time the NDP has had such a government in provincial history.

On September 21, 2020, after only three years in government, Horgan called a snap election. The election call drew criticism, as it violated the agreement with the Green Party, and came during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic; journalists noted that Horgan and the NDP had been doing well in the polls at the time. In the 2020 election, the NDP won a majority government, securing a record 57 seats and receiving 47.7% of the overall popular vote — both record highs for the party.

After five years of being premier, Horgan announced in June 2022 that he would step down as party leader and as premier once a new leader had been chosen. The election for his successor was scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022. David Eby was acclaimed as Horgan&#x27;s successor on October 21, 2022, after the disqualification of the only other candidate, Anjali Appadurai, from the leadership contest. The 2024 British Columbia general election on October 19, 2024, had a narrow result. All but 3 NDP cabinet ministers were re-elected.

<text>Tommaso Antonio Conti (born 22 November 1941) is a Scottish actor. Conti has received numerous accolades including a Tony Award and a Laurence Olivier Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and two Golden Globe Awards. 

He won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play and the Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play in role in &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; which he performed on Broadway and the West End in 1978 and 1979. He also directed the Frank D. Gilroy play &quot;Last Licks&quot; (1979) on Broadway. Conti returned to the West End portraying Jeffrey Bernard in the Keith Waterhouse play &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot; (1989).

Conti received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; (1983). Conti also acted in such films as &quot;The Duellists&quot; (1977), &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983), &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (1986), &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1987), &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989), &quot;The Tempest&quot; (2010), &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), and &quot;Paddington 2&quot; (2017). He portrayed Albert Einstein in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Conti was born on 22 November 1941 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, the son of hairdressers Mary McGoldrick and Alfonso Conti. After being raised Roman Catholic, he described himself as antireligious in 2011. His father was Italian, while his mother was born and raised in Scotland to Irish parents. Conti was educated at independent Catholic boys&#x27; school Hamilton Park St Aloysius&#x27; College, Glasgow; and at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.

==Career==
Conti is a theatre, film, and television actor. He began working with the Dundee Repertory in 1959. He appeared on Broadway in &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; in 1979, and in London, he played the lead in &quot;Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell&quot; at the Garrick Theatre. Besides taking the leading role in the TV versions of Frederic Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Glittering Prizes&quot; and Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;, Conti appeared in the &quot;Princess and the Pea&quot; episode of the family television series &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, guest-starred on &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Cosby&quot;, and played opposite Nigel Hawthorne in a long-running series of Vauxhall Astra car advertisements in the United Kingdom from the early to the mid-1990s.

Conti has appeared in such films as &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot;, &quot;American Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot;, &quot;Miracles&quot;, &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Parking&quot;, and &quot;Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase&quot;. Conti&#x27;s novel &quot;The Doctor&quot;, about a former secret operations pilot for intelligence services, was published in 2004. According to the foreword, his friend Lynsey De Paul recommended the manuscript to publisher Jeremy Robson.

He appeared in the BBC sitcom &quot;Miranda&quot; alongside Miranda Hart and Patricia Hodge, as Miranda&#x27;s father, in the 2010 seasonal episode &quot;The Perfect Christmas&quot;. Most recently he portrayed Albert Einstein in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2023 thriller-drama &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. The film had one of the most successful opening weekends of 2023, and received wide critical acclaim.

==Personal life==
Conti has been married to Scottish actress Kara Wilson since 1967 and their daughter Nina is an actress and performs as a ventriloquist. According to Nina, her parents have an open marriage.

Conti is a resident of Hampstead in northwest London, having lived in the area for several decades. Conti was part of a campaign against the opening of a Tesco supermarket in nearby Belsize Park. Conti put his Hampstead house up for sale in 2015 for £17.5 million after his long-running opposition to the building plans of his neighbour, the footballer Thierry Henry. Conti had also opposed development plans for Hampstead&#x27;s Grove Lodge, the 18th-century Grade II listed former home of novelist John Galsworthy.

Conti participated in a genetic-mapping project conducted by the company ScotlandsDNA (now called BritainsDNA). In 2012, Conti and the company announced that Conti shares a genetic marker with Napoléon Bonaparte. Conti said that he &quot;burst out laughing&quot; when told he was related to Napoléon on his father&#x27;s side.

===Political views===
Conti considered running as the Conservative candidate in the 2008 London mayoral election, but did not, and in the following election in 2012, he supported unsuccessful independent candidate Siobhan Benita. In the run up to the 2015 general election, Conti said in an interview published in several newspapers that he was once a Labour supporter but had come to view socialism as a “religion” with a &quot;vicious, hostile spirit&quot;.

<text>Ludwig Quidde (; 23 March 1858 – 4 March 1941) was a German politician and pacifist who is mainly remembered today for his acerbic criticism of German Emperor Wilhelm II. Quidde&#x27;s long career spanned four different eras of German history: Otto von Bismarck (until 1890), the Hohenzollern Empire under Wilhelm II (1888–1918), the Weimar Republic (1918–1933); and Nazi Germany. In 1927, Quidde was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Born into a wealthy bourgeois merchant family, Quidde grew up in Bremen, read history and got involved in the activities of the German Peace Society (&quot;Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft&quot;). In his younger years, he had already opposed Bismarck&#x27;s policies. In 1881 he received his PhD at the University of Göttingen.
The fortune that Quidde inherited allowed him to devote himself entirely to politics. In 1893, he joined the German People&#x27;s Party (DtVP), which was founded in 1868 and met his anti-militarist, anti-Prussian, democratic and pacifist expectations.

In 1894, Quidde published a 17-page pamphlet, &quot;Caligula. Eine Studie über römischen Caesarenwahnsinn&quot; (&quot;Caligula: A Study of Roman Imperial Insanity&quot;). Containing 79 footnotes, the short essay is exclusively about the Roman Empire of the 1st century AD. However, Quidde drew an implicit parallel between the Roman Emperor Caligula and Wilhelm II and &quot;de facto&quot; accused both rulers of . The author had insisted on publishing his pamphlet under his real name, which effectively ended his academic career as a historian when a periodical had a short review, which explained the parallels that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. After he had made a derogatory comment on a new medal in honour of Wilhelm I, German Emperor from 1871 to 1888, he was criminally convicted of lèse majesté and sentenced to three months in prison, which he served in Stadelheim Prison.

After the end of the First World War, Quidde, like most other Germans, vehemently opposed the Treaty of Versailles but for different reasons from German militarists, who hated mainly the vast restrictions laid upon the German armed forces and the impending economic disaster that they stages would be caused by payment of the high reparations that the tretaty decreed. He and other German pacifists thought ahead and hoped that US President Woodrow Wilson would win the day by pointing out that such severe conditions would already sow the seeds of a new war:

When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Quidde escaped to Switzerland and finally settled down in Geneva for the rest of his days. He remained an optimist throughout his life. Aged 76, he published his essay &quot;Landfriede und Weltfriede&quot; (1934) while militarism was again on the rise. He believed that modern technology might serve as a deterrent from war:

Quidde died in his Swiss exile in 1941, aged 82.

<text>Reuben, Reuben is a 1983 comedy-drama film directed by Robert Ellis Miller and starring Tom Conti, Kelly McGillis (in her film debut), Roberts Blossom, Cynthia Harris, and Joel Fabiani.

The film was adapted by Julius J. Epstein from the 1967 play &quot;Spofford&quot; by Herman Shumlin, which in turn was adapted from the 1964 novel &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; by Peter De Vries.

The main character in DeVries&#x27;s novel was based largely on the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who was a compulsive womanizer and lifelong alcoholic, finally succumbing to the effects of alcohol poisoning in November 1953, while on a speaking tour in America.

==Plot==
Gowan McGland (Tom Conti) is a creatively blocked Scottish poet who ekes out a day-to-day existence by exploiting the generosity of strangers in an affluent Connecticut suburb, where he recites his verse to various arts groups and women&#x27;s clubs. Gowan is something of a leech, cadging expensive dinners from well-off patrons (usually stealing the tips afterward) while seducing their bored wives and affecting a superior attitude toward the smug bourgeois types he exploits.

Although a talented poet, he is a chronic drunk, indifferent to the wounds he can casually inflict with his wit. (When one of Gowan&#x27;s middle-aged conquests undresses for him, he mutters, &quot;Released from their support, her breasts dropped like hanged men,&quot; reducing her to tears.)

Gowan falls in love with a young college student, Geneva Spofford (Kelly McGillis), who has everything to lose from a relationship with a drunken deadbeat poet unable to hold a job. Gowan instigates two ugly incidents that eventually cause their breakup: first, a bar fight from which Geneva rescues him, and later, when he causes a scene in a fancy restaurant where the waiters know he has stolen their tips.

He also suffers an ironic comeuppance from Dr. Jack Haxby (Joel Fabiani). The dentist, after finding out about the poet&#x27;s affair with his wife, uses the ruse of free dental care for ruining Gowan&#x27;s smile and forcing him to wear dentures. When Gowan finds out, it is already too late, and the damage is irrevocable. (Gowan fears losing his teeth, equating it with death.)

Gowan prepares to hang himself, but while dictating his last thoughts into a tape recorder, he comes up with some good lines and regains his will to write. Unfortunately, his host&#x27;s pet dog, an Old English sheepdog named Reuben, comes bounding into the room, causing Gowan to lose his balance before he can undo the noose, turning the aborted suicide into accidental asphyxiation. The film&#x27;s title comprises Gowan&#x27;s final words, an unsuccessful attempt to halt the dog.

==Critical reception==
John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; called &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; &quot;dreadful&quot;.

&quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews .

<text>F. Murray Abraham (born Murray Abraham; October 24, 1939) is an American actor. Known for his roles on stage and screen, he has received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for a BAFTA Award, four Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award. He came to prominence for his portrayal of Antonio Salieri in the drama film &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984) for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor.

Abraham made his Broadway debut in the 1968 play &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot;. He received the Obie Award for Outstanding Performance for his roles in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1984) and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (2011). He returned to Broadway in the revival of Terrence McNally&#x27;s comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot; (2014), receiving a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play nomination.

He has appeared in many roles, both leading and supporting, in films such as &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993), &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995), &quot;Dillinger and Capone&quot; (1995), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000), &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013), &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018) and &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot; (2019).

He was a regular cast member on the Showtime drama series &quot;Homeland&quot; (2012–2018), which earned him two nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He also acted in &quot;Louie&quot; (2011–2014), &quot;Mythic Quest&quot; (2020–2021), &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2022) and &quot;The White Lotus&quot; (2022), with the latter earning him nominations for the Golden Globe Award and the Primetime Emmy Award.

==Early life and education==
Abraham was born Murray Abraham on October 24, 1939; in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Fahrid &quot;Fred&quot; Abraham, an automotive mechanic and his wife Josephine (née Stello; 1915–2012), Murray has described himself as an Italian American and Syrian American. 

His father emigrated with his family from Muqlus, Ottoman Syria, a small village in the Valley of the Christians, at age five; his paternal grandfather was a priest in the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. His mother, one of 14 children, was Italian American and the daughter of an Italian immigrant who worked in the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. He had two younger brothers, Robert and Jack, who were killed in separate car accidents.

Abraham was raised in El Paso, Texas. Murray and his two younger brothers were altar boys in the St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church in El Paso. He attended Vilas Grammar School, and graduated from El Paso High School in 1958. He was a gang member during his teenage years. In El Paso, Abraham worked in the factory owned by a Lebanese American family before launching a career in acting. He attended Texas Western College (later named University of Texas at El Paso), where he was given the best actor award by Alpha Psi Omega for his portrayal of the Indian Nocona in &quot;Comanche Eagle&quot; during the 1959–60 season. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, then studied acting under Uta Hagen at HB Studio in New York City. He began his acting career on the stage, debuting in a Los Angeles production of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;.

Abraham added &quot;F.&quot; to his stage name in honor of his father Fahrid. He has stated that &quot;Murray Abraham just doesn&#x27;t seem to say anything. It just is another name, so I thought I&#x27;d frame it&quot;.

==Career==
===1971–1978: Early roles ===
Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in the George C. Scott comedy &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (1971). He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973) and in television roles including the bad guy in one fourth-season episode of &quot;Kojak&quot; (&quot;The Godson&quot;). His early film roles include small parts as a cabdriver in the theatrical version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; (1975), a mechanic in the theatrical version of Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975). He also played a police officer in the Alan J. Pakula Watergate film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1976), and acted in the comedy films &quot;The Ritz&quot; (1976) opposite Rita Moreno and &quot;The Big Fix&quot; (1978) alongside Richard Dreyfuss.

By the mid-1970s, he also had steady employment doing commercials and voice-overs. Most notably, he played &quot;the leaf&quot;, one of four costumed characters, in television and print commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. In 1978, he gave up this work. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, he said: &quot;No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn&#x27;t do it, then I&#x27;d have no right to the dreams I&#x27;ve always had.&quot; His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a &quot;house husband&quot;. As he described it: &quot;I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot;

=== 1983–1986: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Abraham gained greater prominence when he appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez in the gangster film &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983). Then, in 1984, he played envious composer Antonio Salieri in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), directed by Miloš Forman. Abraham won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role, an award for which his co-star in the film Tom Hulce, playing Mozart, had also been nominated. He also won a Golden Globe Award, among other awards and his role in the film remains his most famous.

Abraham&#x27;s relatively low-profile film career subsequent to his Academy Award win has been considered an example of the &quot;Oscar jinx.&quot; According to film critic Leonard Maltin, professional failure following an early success is referred to in Hollywood circles as the &quot;F. Murray Abraham syndrome.&quot; Abraham rejected this notion and told Maltin, &quot;The Oscar is the single most important event of my career. I have dined with kings, shared equal billing with my idols, lectured at Harvard and Columbia. If this is a jinx, I&#x27;ll take two.&quot; In the same interview, Abraham said, &quot;Even though I won the Oscar, I can still take the subway in New York, and nobody recognizes me. Some actors might find that disconcerting, but I find it refreshing.&quot;

Abraham also joined The Mirror Theater Ltd&#x27;s Mirror Repertory Company in 1984. He joined MRC the week after winning his Oscar for Best Actor for his work in &quot;Amadeus&quot; because he wanted to work with MRC Artist-in-Residence Geraldine Page (to whom he would eventually present her own Academy Award the following year) and would star opposite her in MRC&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;.

Since &quot;Amadeus&quot;, he mainly focused on classical theater and has starred in many Shakespearean productions such as &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. He was highlighted in many other plays by the likes of Samuel Beckett and Gilbert and Sullivan and played the lead in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (for which he received an Obie Award). His next film role was in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sean Connery&#x27;s William of Baskerville. In its DVD commentary, the director of the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an &quot;egomaniac&quot; on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery because Connery did not have an Oscar. Despite the on-set tensions, the film was a critical and commercial success.

=== 1989–1998: Established actor ===
After the release of &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, Abraham tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy. From May 10 through July 14, 1991, Abraham portrayed King Lear in American Repertory Theater&#x27;s (A.R.T.) production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, directed by Adrian Hall, Cambridge, MA. In 1994, Abraham portrayed Roy Cohn in the first Broadway production of Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot; at the Walter Kerr Theater, replacing Ron Leibman in the role.

Over the next decade or so, Abraham had fewer prominent roles, but he did have substantial supporting roles in Peter Yates&#x27; &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; (1989), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; (1995), Ahdar Ru&#x27;afo in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998) and Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000), where he again played the nemesis to Connery. He had a significant role in Brian De Palma&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990), but chose not to be credited due to a contract dispute. He continued his association with classical music by narrating the plot summaries of the operas of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in the 1990 PBS broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera, to the largest viewing audience of the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; in history, conducted by James Levine.

In the 1997/98 Broadway season, he starred in the new chamber musical &quot;Triumph of Love&quot; opposite Betty Buckley, based on Marivaux&#x27;s classic comedy. The production did not find a large audience, running 85 performances after its pre-opening preview period. He has also taught theater at Brooklyn College.

=== 2000–present: Career resurgence ===

A 2009 guest appearance on &quot;Saving Grace&quot; began a new phase of Abraham&#x27;s career, wherein he has become gradually more prolific onscreen. Further guest appearances include roles on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Louie&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as well as a recurring role on &quot;The Good Wife&quot; between 2011 and 2014. Additionally, Abraham was the primary narrator for the PBS series &quot;Nature&quot; between 2007 and 2010, narrating 32 episodes (plus one more in 2013). Abraham&#x27;s most notable television role came about through Showtime&#x27;s drama series &quot;Homeland&quot;, in which he portrayed black ops specialist Dar Adal. This role resulted in his first Emmy Award nomination in 2015, followed by a second in 2018.

Abraham has focused on stage work throughout his career, giving notable performances as Pozzo in Mike Nichols&#x27;s production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; for the New York Shakespeare Festival and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; for the Off-Broadway Theatre for a New Audience (TFANA) in March 2007, which was performed at the Duke Theater in New York and also at the Swan Theater, part of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He reprised this role in February 2011, when he replaced Al Pacino in the Public Theater&#x27;s production.

In the 2010s, he featured prominently in two widely acclaimed films: first as folk music impresario Bud Grossman in the Coen brothers&#x27; drama &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013), then as the mysterious Mr. Moustafa in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014). He was nominated along with the ensemble for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for the latter. That same year he returned to Broadway portraying Ira Drew in the revival of Terrence McNally&#x27;s comedic play &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;. Abraham starred alongside Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Stockard Channing, and Rupert Grint. For his performance he earned a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play. In 2016, he played the title role in Classic Stage Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;.

He reunited with Wes Anderson voicing a role in stop-motion animated film &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018), voiced Grimmel in DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot; (2019), and played Tony in the Disney+ 2019 live-action &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;. From 2020 to 2021 he acted in the Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;Mythic Quest&quot;. In 2022 he was fired after being accused of inappropriate behavior while on set. In a response statement, Abraham apologized and stated that he never intended &quot;to offend anyone, I told jokes, nothing more, that upset some of my colleagues and as a result lost a great job with wonderful people.&quot; In February 2022, it was revealed that Abraham would be voicing Khonshu in the superhero limited series &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He starred in the 2022 film adaptation of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; based on the opera of the same name. That same year he played Dr. Carl Withers in the Netflix series &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; (2022). In 2023 he portrayed Judge John Sirica in the HBO political drama limited series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;.

Murray acted in the HBO series &quot;The White Lotus: Sicily&quot; (2022) playing the elderly and gregarious grandfather Bert Di Grasso, earning nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Also in 2023 he acted in the film &quot;Mother, Couch&quot; alongside Ewan McGregor, Taylor Russell, and Ellen Burstyn. The film is premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2024 it was announced that Abraham would return to the stage as David Siegel in the Stephen Schwartz musical &quot;The Queen of Versailles&quot; starring Kristin Chenoweth at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
Abraham was married to Kate Hannan for 60 years (1962–2022) until her death on November 19, 2022. At that time, they had two children and one grandchild.

=== Incidents ===
In 1993, while filming the movie &quot;Surviving the Game&quot; in rural Washington State, Abraham was involved in a car crash in which another driver was killed, while Abraham was injured. In January 2010, Abraham scuffled with a thief in the dressing room area during a public rehearsal at the Classic Stage Company in New York City.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Abraham has spoken about his faith: &quot;I&#x27;ve attended many churches. I grew up as an Orthodox Christian and I was an altar boy. I love the Society of Friends, the Quakers. I attended their meetings for almost fifteen years. I&#x27;m now [in 2008] attending the First Presbyterian Church of New York because they&#x27;re such a generous, terrific church with outreach. They reach out to old people, to homeless, to A.A., to cross-dressers: it&#x27;s truly a church of the teachings of Christ. Religion is essential to my life.&quot;

Abraham has an honorary doctorate from Rider University in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.

In 2009, he was recognized by the Alumni Association of the City College of New York with John H. Finley Award in recognition of exemplary dedicated service to the City of New York.

<doc id="168496" wikidata="Q684914" url="?curid=168496" title="Prime Minister of Northern Ireland">
<text>The prime minister of Northern Ireland was the head of the Government of Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972. No such office was provided for in the Government of Ireland Act 1920; however, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as with governors-general in other Westminster systems such as in Canada, chose to appoint someone to head the executive even though no such post existed in statute law. The office-holder assumed the title &quot;prime minister&quot; to draw parallels with the prime minister of the United Kingdom. On the advice of the new prime minister, the lord lieutenant then created the &quot;Department of the Prime Minister&quot;. The office of Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972 and then abolished in 1972, along with the contemporary government, when direct rule of Northern Ireland was transferred to London.

The Government of Ireland Act provided for the appointment of the executive committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland by the governor. No parliamentary vote was required. Nor, theoretically, was the executive committee and its prime minister &quot;responsible&quot; to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. In reality the governor chose the leader of the party with a majority in the House to form a government. On each occasion this was the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party; such was the UUP&#x27;s electoral dominance using both a simple plurality and for the first two elections, a proportional electoral system. All prime ministers of Northern Ireland were members of the Orange Order.

The prime minister&#x27;s residence from 1920 until 1922 was Cabin Hill, later to become the junior school for Campbell College. After 1922 Stormont Castle was used, though some prime ministers chose to live in Stormont House, the unused residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland.

The new offices of first minister and deputy first minister were created by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. In contrast with the Westminster-style system of the earlier Stormont government, the new Northern Ireland Executive operates on the principles of consociational democracy.

In 1974, Brian Faulkner was chosen to lead the Northern Ireland Executive not as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland but as Chief Executive of Northern Ireland.

<text>Starman is a 1984 American science fiction romance drama film directed by John Carpenter and written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon, with Dean Riesner making uncredited rewrites. It tells the story of a relationship between recently widowed Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen) and a non-corporeal alien who has come to Earth and cloned a human body (portrayed by Jeff Bridges), in response to the invitation found on the gold phonograph record installed on the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe.

The film received positive reviews but faltered in its initial box office debut. Bridges was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role. It inspired the short-lived &quot;Starman&quot; television series in 1986.

==Plot==
:&quot;Starman is a love story. It&#x27;s &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;.— John Carpenter
The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe, launched in 1977, carries a phonographic disc with a message of peace, inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth. The probe is intercepted by a planet which then sends a scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. Instead of greeting the vessel, the U.S. government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden. The alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a body for himself. The alien &quot;Starman&quot; has seven spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft was destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days&#x27; time. He then uses the second sphere in self-defense and the third to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous in Arizona.

Jenny, however, attempts to escape. Having a very basic understanding of the English language from the phonographic disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona&#x27;s Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die. Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards, so he can continue the journey alone. When he resurrects a dead deer, she is moved and decides to stay with him. The authorities pursue the pair across the country. A police officer shoots and critically wounds Jenny. To escape, the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect them from the explosion. They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed. He uses another sphere to heal Jenny. After being assured that Jenny will recover, he proceeds to hitchhike toward Arizona without her, but Jenny reaches him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock. Reunited, they hitchhike together, resuming their journey towards the crater.

Later, while stowing away on a railroad boxcar, the two have sex. The Starman tells Jenny, &quot;I gave you a baby tonight.&quot; Jenny reveals that she is infertile, but he assures her that she is pregnant. He explains that Scott is the posthumous father, as Starman used Scott&#x27;s DNA to clone himself. As a child also of Starman, their son will possess all the Starman&#x27;s knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher. Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes, but Jenny embraces him, accepting the gift. They accidentally travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas. Jenny loses her wallet. The Starman uses one of their last quarters in a slot machine, which he manipulates to win the $500,000 jackpot. They buy a Cadillac to complete their journey to Arizona.

National Security Agency director George Fox learns that the Starman&#x27;s flight trajectory, prior to being shot down, was to the Barringer Crater and arranges to have the Army capture the Starman, dead or alive. SETI scientist Mark Shermin, another government official involved in the case, criticizes Fox&#x27;s heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth. Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to vivisect the alien, Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than let Fox capture him.

Jenny and the dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them. Just as they are surrounded, a large spaceship appears and descends into the crater. Light surrounds the couple and the Starman is fully healed. While preparing to leave, he tells Jenny he will never see her again. Jenny asks him to take her with him, but he says she would die on his world. He then gives her his last sphere, saying that their son will know what to do with it. Jenny watches as the ship departs.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Starman&quot; spent five years in development at Columbia. The original script by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon was purchased by the studio at the urging of executive producer Michael Douglas, shortly before it optioned Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Night Skies&quot;. Evans and Gideon&#x27;s first, and only, rewrite was rejected by both the studio and Douglas. Screenwriter Dean Riesner came onto the project in late 1981 after director Mark Rydell left the project due to artistic differences with Douglas. Riesner had no idea that he would spend over two years struggling with the incessant demand for rewrites—he eventually authored five rewrites of &quot;Starman&quot; with six different directors, but did not receive screen credit because, according to him, &quot;the Writers Guild, in their infinite wisdom, decided I didn&#x27;t contribute 50 percent of the screenplay.&quot; Carpenter personally campaigned for Riesner&#x27;s credit; advocating Evans and Gideon&#x27;s initial draft was an entirely different movie (than the shooting script Riesner later authored)—Carpenter said that the alien actually flew around like Superman in the initial script. Carpenter was reportedly outraged when the WGA arbitration ruled in favor of original writers, Gideon and Evans. The director resolved to thank his screenwriter by including an on-screen dedication to Reisner in the film&#x27;s end credits sequence. The Writers&#x27; Guild deemed Carpenter&#x27;s on-screen accolade as a deliberately provocative violation of their ruling. For a short time the Guild were threatening to force Columbia to destroy all prints of the film (in exhibition) containing Carpenter&#x27;s offending dedication to Reisner. Other uncredited writers who worked on the script were Edward Zwick and Diane Thomas. Columbia chairman, Frank Price was disappointed with Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Night Skies&quot; script. Price consulted with their marketing department, it was determined &quot;Night Skies&quot;&#x27; narrative was too Disney and would only appeal to children (&quot;Starman&quot; was for a more mature audience). Insisting the picture would not be profitable, Frank Price put their Spielberg project into turnaround. &quot;Night Skies&quot; was eventually retitled &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film of its time; whereas &quot;Starman&quot; would earn less than a tenth of the revenue &quot;E.T.&quot; garnered—upon which Riesner commented, &quot;Goes to show how wrong you can be in this business.&quot;

According to Riesner, producers at Columbia were concerned at the initial box office returns for &quot;E.T.&quot;, because &quot;Starman&quot; (while Riesner was working its second rewrite) was too similar. Adrian Lyne worked with Douglas on the project, for about a year, before departing to direct &quot;Flashdance&quot; for Paramount. He was replaced by John Badham, who worked with Douglas for &#x27;some months&#x27; (developing the project); Columbia actually gave them an October 1982 start-date to begin principal photography. In 1985 Badham acknowledged his initial enthusiasm for the script, &quot;I wanted Tom Conti for the lead role [Badham had seen him in London doing “&quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;&quot;] and he was anxious to do it.&quot; But in the summer of 1982, &quot;Variety&quot; published the first review of &quot;E.T.,&quot; as soon as he read it he realized the two projects were too similar. Douglas immediately ordered script revisions, but Badham eventually moved on to take over directing duties on &quot;WarGames&quot;. Riesner was charged with keeping &quot;Starman&quot; essentially the same while making it distinct from &quot;E.T&quot;, and would work with three subsequent directors: Tony Scott, Peter Hyams, and John Carpenter. Whereas Scott was more interested in style than narrative drive and wanted to cast Philip Anglim, and Hyams pushed for a more conventional science fiction approach, Carpenter, who was eager to shed his image as a maker of exploitative thrillers, wished to emphasize the cross-country rapport that develops between the two leads, as in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; over special effects. Riesner dropped the &quot;heavy political implications&quot; from the script to comply with this.

Parts of the film were shot in Tennessee, Iowa, Arizona, Nevada, and Monument Valley, Utah.

=== Soundtrack ===

The soundtrack to &quot;Starman&quot; was released on December 14, 1984. The album also contains a rendition of &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; performed by stars Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen.

== Release ==

The film was released on Blu-ray on August 11, 2009. A collector&#x27;s edition reissue would later be released on December 18, 2018 by Shout Factory.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Starman&quot; grossed nearly $2.9 million in its opening weekend, debuting at number 6. It was released the same week as David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Dune&quot; and one week after the release of Peter Hyams&#x27;s film &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;. The film grossed a total of $28.7 million from its domestic run.

=== Critical response ===
The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 86% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;What initially begins as sci-fi transforms into a surprisingly sweet, offbeat drama, courtesy of John Carpenter&#x27;s careful direction.&quot; The aggregator Metacritic gives the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Contemporary opinion was generally positive, and tended to focus on the visual effects and Jeff Bridges&#x27; acting. Conversations around the film often questioned whether &quot;Starman&quot; would launch Bridges into an acting superstar. Retrospective reviews have generally remained positive.

==== Contemporary opinion ====
Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote &quot;&quot;Starman&quot; contains the potential to be a very silly movie, but the two actors have so much sympathy for their characters that the movie, advertised as space fiction, turns into one of 1984&#x27;s more touching love stories.&quot; In a highly positive review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised the film along with its actors and director, stating: &quot;If &quot;Starman&quot; doesn&#x27;t make a major difference in Jeff Bridges&#x27;s career, Mr. Bridges is operating in the wrong galaxy.&quot; She referred to it as &quot;a science fiction film with sex appeal&quot; and commended the film&#x27;s romance and humour.

==== Retrospective opinion ====
Duane Byrge wrote for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that &quot;Starman&quot; had &quot;an amusing and appealing storyline&quot; and a &quot;winning performance&quot; by Jeff Bridges, describing it as &quot;an often on-target look at current American culture&quot;. However, he found the script lacking in its plot development and characterisation of military officials, but praised its &quot;humane message&quot; and Carpenter for &quot;fluid storytelling&quot;, commending the score and visual effects. Mark Harrison wrote for Den of Geek that it was &quot;a classic sci-fi date movie&quot; and &quot;not only an outlier in [Carpenter&#x27;s] body of work but also an inarguable product of his direction&quot;. He praised it for a &quot;canny reversal of gender roles&quot; where Bridges&#x27; Star Man is shown the world by a cynical Karen Allen. He praised the film&#x27;s lead performances, believing that Karen Allen&#x27;s portrayal &quot;might be her best ever performance&quot;.

Alan Jones awarded it four stars out of five for &quot;Radio Times&quot;, referring to the film as a &quot;religious sci-fi parable&quot;, praising Bridges&#x27; acting and the special effects. He described it as &quot;funny, suspenseful and moving&quot; and concluded that it was one of Carpenter&#x27;s greatest films. &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; was less positive, describing it as a &quot;derivative but eccentric science-fiction fantasy with lapses of narrative and a general attempt to make the love story predominant over the hardware&quot;. The review by &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;a rather lame sci-fi love story&quot;, lacking the energy of many of Carpenter&#x27;s films. The review criticised the film&#x27;s predictability and Bridges&#x27; acting, believing the humour to &quot;wear thin pretty quick&quot;. Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Starman&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that it, &quot;starts well, with engaging performances from Karen Allen [...] and Jeff Bridges&quot;, but complains that the second half devolves into an &quot;irritatingly soft-headed love story&quot;.

=== Awards and accolades ===
Jeff Bridges was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, making Starman the only film by John Carpenter to receive an Academy Award nomination. Bridges was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Drama and was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Actor. Karen Allen also received a nod for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films. The film itself was nominated Best Science Fiction Film. Jack Nitzsche received a Golden Globe nomination for his score.

The film was nominated for, but does not appear on the following lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10: Nominated Science Fiction Film

==Legacy==

=== Remake ===
In April 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Shawn Levy would direct and produce a remake written by Arash Amel. Michael Douglas, who was a producer of the original, was also on board to produce, while Dan Cohen and Robert Mitas were executive producing, and Matt Milam and Adam North were overseeing the project for Columbia. In 2021, Levy declared the remake to be improbable, as he could not find a good draft that was worthy of adaptation.

=== In popular culture ===
The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra covered &quot;Starman Leaves (End Title)&quot; for their 2005 cover compilation album, &quot;The Science Fiction Album&quot;. The 2010 single &quot;Symphonies&quot; by Dan Black, and its remix featuring Kid Cudi, sampled CoPPO&#x27;s cover of the song. At the end of the music video the lead character is beamed away by a bright circular spaceship, similar to the manner in which the Starman from the film departs Earth. The music video itself contains scenes which pay homage to several Jeff Bridges films, including &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;.
In &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;, flashbacks revealing the courtship of Peter Quill&#x27;s parents feature a 1978 Ford Mustang King Cobra.

<text>Under the Volcano is a novel by English writer Malcolm Lowry (1909–1957) published in 1947. The novel tells the story of Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic British consul in the Mexican city of Quauhnahuac, on the Day of the Dead in November 1938. The book takes its name from the two volcanoes, Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl, that overshadow Quauhnahuac and the characters. &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; was Lowry&#x27;s second and last complete novel.

The novel was adapted for radio on &quot;Studio One&quot; in 1947 but had gone out of print by the time Lowry died in 1957. In 1984, it served as the basis of a film of the same name that restored its popularity. In 1998, Modern Library ranked &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; at number 11 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It was included also in &quot;Le Monde&quot;&#x27;s 100 Books of the Century, &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s All-Time 100 Novels, and Anthony Burgess&#x27; &quot;Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939&quot;.

==Genesis and publication history==
Lowry had already published one novel, &quot;Ultramarine&quot; (1933), by the time he was working on &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, and in 1936 wrote a short story called &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; containing the kernel of the future novel. That story was not published until the 1960s; passages of it are found also in the account of Sigbjorn Wilderness, found in &quot;Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend Is Laid&quot;, edited by Margerie Bonner (Lowry&#x27;s second wife) and published in 1968. It contains what Conrad Aiken would later call &quot;the horse theme,&quot; so important in &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. The story includes the horse branded with the number seven, the dying Indian encountered while on a bus trip, the &quot;pelado&quot; who steals the Indian&#x27;s money to pay his bus fare, and the inability of the spectator (Wilderness in the short story, the Consul in the novel) to act. All this ended up in the novel&#x27;s eighth chapter.

The first version of the novel was developed while Lowry lived in Mexico, frequently drunk and out of control while his first marriage was breaking up. In 1940, Lowry hired an agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for the manuscript but found nothing but rejection—this manuscript is referred to by scholars as the 1940 version, and differs in details of various significance from the published version. Between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel (with significant editorial assistance from Margerie Bonner), a process which occupied him completely: during those years Lowry, who had been wont to work on many projects at the same time, worked on nothing but the manuscript, a process documented exhaustively by Frederick Asals. One of the most significant changes involved Yvonne&#x27;s character: In earlier versions she was the Consul&#x27;s daughter, but, by 1940, she was his unfaithful wife. In that version (and a 1941 revision), chapter 11 ended with her and Hugh making love.

In 1944, the manuscript was nearly lost in a fire at the Lowrys&#x27; cabin in Dollarton, British Columbia. Margerie Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but all of Lowry&#x27;s other works in progress were lost in the blaze. The burned manuscript was called &quot;In Ballast to the White Sea,&quot; and would have been the third book in a trilogy made up of &quot;Under the Volcano,&quot; an expanded version of &quot;Lunar Caustic&quot;, and &quot;In Ballast.&quot; Like Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; these were to be infernal, purgatorial, and paradisal, respectively. Asals notes that the important 1944 revision evidences Lowry and Bonner paying extraordinary attention to references to fire in the novel, especially in Yvonne&#x27;s dream before her death.

The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately sent to different publishers. In late winter, while travelling in Mexico, Lowry learned the novel had been accepted by two publishing companies: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom. Following critical reports from two readers, Cape had reservations about publishing and wrote to Lowry on 29 November 1945 asking him to make drastic revisions, though he added that if Lowry didn&#x27;t make the revisions &quot;it does not necessarily mean I would say no&quot;. Lowry&#x27;s lengthy reply, dated 2 January 1946, was a passionate defence of the book in which he sensed he had created a work of lasting greatness: &quot;Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go &quot;on&quot; selling a very long time.&quot; The letter includes a detailed summary of the book&#x27;s key themes and how the author intended each of the 12 chapters to work; in the end, Cape published the novel without further revision.

&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; and &quot;Ultramarine&quot; were both out of print by the time Lowry died of alcoholism (and possibly sleeping pills) in 1957, but the novel has since made a comeback. In 1998, it was rated as number 11 on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century compiled by the Modern Library. &quot;TIME&quot; included the novel in its list of &quot;100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present,&quot; calling it a &quot;vertiginous picture of self-destruction, seen through the eyes of a man still lucid enough to report to us all the harrowing particulars.&quot;

==Structure and plot==

The book consists of twelve chapters, the first of which introduces the narrative proper and which is set exactly a year after the events. The following eleven chapters happen in a single day and follow the Consul chronologically, starting early on the morning of the Day of the Dead with the return of his wife, Yvonne, who left him the year before, to his violent death at the end of the day. In contrast with the omniscient narrative mode of the 1940 version, the published novel &quot;focus[es] each chapter through the mind of one central figure, no two sequential chapters employing the same character&#x27;s consciousness&quot;.

The number of chapters was important numerologically, as Lowry explained in a letter to Jonathan Cape: there are twelve hours in a day (and most of the novel happens in a single day), twelve months in a year (one year elapses between chapter 1 and the end of chapter 12). Besides, the number 12 is of symbolic importance in the Kabbalah which, according to Lowry, represents &quot;man&#x27;s spiritual aspirations&quot;. Finally, &quot;I have to have my 12&quot;, Lowry says, since he hears in it &quot;a clock slowly striking midnight for Faust&quot;.

===Chapter 1===
In the first chapter, set on 2 November 1939, Jacques Laruelle and Dr. Vigil drink anisette at the Hotel Casino de la Selva, on a hill above Quauhnahuac (an approximation of the Nahuatl name of Cuernavaca), and reminisce on the Consul&#x27;s presence, exactly a year ago. His alcoholism is discussed and his unhappy marriage; that his wife came back to him is remarked upon as particularly striking. Their conversation over (they are to meet later again that night at a party), Laruelle walks down from the hotel into town through the ruins of a palace of Archduke Maximilian. Along the way he remembers spending a season with the Consul: Laruelle&#x27;s family and the Consul&#x27;s adopted family (the Taskersons, consisting of a poetic-minded patriarch and a set of hard-drinking sons) rented adjoining summer homes on the English Channel. Afterward Laruelle spent some time with the Taskersons in England but the friendship soon petered out.

Laruelle is scheduled to leave Quauhnahuac the next day, but has not yet packed and does not want to go home, spending his time instead at the Cervecería XX, a bar connected to the local cinema, run by Sr. Bustamente. At that bar, he is given a book he had borrowed a year and a half before from the Consul—an anthology of Elizabethan plays he had meant to use for a film on the Faustus myth. Playing a variation on Sortes virgilianae, his eyes fall on the closing words of the chorus in Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, &quot;Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight...&quot;, then finds a desperate letter by the Consul to Yvonne, a final plea for her to return, interspersed with descriptions of alcoholic stupor and delirium tremens. Laruelle burns the letter. A bell outside sounds &quot;dolente, delor&quot; symbolising the closing of the chapter.

===Chapter 2===
Chapter 2 finds the Consul sitting at the bar of the Bella Vista hotel in Quauhnahuac at 7:00am on 2 November 1938, drinking whisky the morning after the Red Cross ball, when Yvonne enters. The Consul has not been home yet and isn&#x27;t wearing any socks (as is explained later, his alcoholism is so advanced he cannot put them on). Yvonne has returned to try and save their marriage, but the Consul appears stuck in the past and begins to talk about his visit to Oaxaca, where he went on a drinking binge after Yvonne left. In interior monologue Yvonne wonders if the Consul will be able to return from &quot;this stupid darkness&quot;. The chapter had opened with an exclamation about a child&#x27;s corpse being transported by train; the Consul explains that in such cases in Mexico the dead child always needs to be accompanied by an adult, leading to a reference to William Blackstone, &quot;the man who went to live among the Indians&quot;, a reference the Consul will repeat later on in the day.

Yvonne and the Consul leave the hotel and walk through town, along the Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca; they stop at a printer&#x27;s shop window, their attention drawn by a photograph of a boulder split in two by the elements, an image Yvonne immediately recognises as emblematic of her marriage. On the way to their house in the &quot;Calle Nicaragua&quot; they stop at Jacques Laruelle&#x27;s &quot;bizarre&quot; house, with the inscription &quot;No se puede vivir sin amar&quot; (&quot;one cannot live without loving&quot;) on the wall, and Popocatépetl and Ixtaccihuatl come into view. The Consul tells Yvonne that Hugh is staying with him as well and is expected back from a trip this very day. As they enter the garden of their house a pariah dog follows them in.

===Chapter 3===
Yvonne inspects the garden, which has fallen into chaos while she was away, and the Consul is making an attempt to keep up the appearance that he is dealing with his drinking problem. Throughout the chapter, hallucinations, memories, and imaginary conversations interrupt his train of thought, and he hears voices that alternately tell him all is lost and that there is still hope. Dr. Vigil had prescribed him a strychnine concoction which the Consul sips from continuously, all the while trying to resist the temptation to drink whisky. While Yvonne is in the bathroom, however, he leaves the house to visit a &quot;cantina&quot; but falls facedown in the street, passed out, and is almost run over by an English driver in an MG Magna who offers him Burke&#x27;s whisky from a flask. While unconscious, memories of Hugh return to him, particularly his having forced Yvonne on him. Back at the house, he enters Yvonne&#x27;s bedroom but their conversation is halted, in part by the temptation of the bottle of Johnnie Walker he knows is on the patio and in part by hallucinations. An unsuccessful attempt at making love to her establishes his impotence and his despair; afterward, while Yvonne is crying in her room, he murmurs &quot;I love you&quot; to his bottle of whisky and falls asleep.

===Chapter 4===
Much of the chapter takes Hugh&#x27;s point of view. Hugh arrives at his brother&#x27;s home and it&#x27;s understood that he&#x27;s not wearing any of his own clothes. Because his clothes have been impounded, he wears his brother&#x27;s jacket, shirt, and bag. He stores his news dispatch in his brother&#x27;s jacket. References to the Battle of the Ebro are found throughout the chapter, as are mentions of Hugh&#x27;s friend Juan Cerillo, a Mexican who was in Spain with Hugh. Hugh sees Yvonne at the Consul&#x27;s home; it&#x27;s obvious that she has some hold on his heart. In fact, an affair between the two is alluded to in the chapter. While the Consul is sleeping, Hugh and Yvonne rent horses and ride through the countryside, stopping at a brewery and then at the country estate of Archduke Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, haunted by the memory of Maximilian and his consort Carlota, and of the Consul and Yvonne in happier times.

===Chapter 5===
While Hugh and Yvonne are out, the Consul endures a &quot;horripilating&quot; hangover. The chapter begins with a vision of a man suffering unquenchable thirst; while the Consul inspects his garden (the Garden of Eden is referenced throughout, and a snake crosses his path) he finds a bottle of tequila he had hidden, and sees a newly placed sign: LE GUSTA ESTE JARDIN? QUE ES SUYO? EVITE QUE SUS HIJOS LO DESTRUYAN! He mistranslates this as &quot;You like this garden? Why is it yours? We evict those who destroy!&quot; As he is getting more drunk he has visions of the &quot;Farolito&quot;, a bar in Parian. He engages his American neighbour, Mr. Quincey, in conversation. Quincey obviously disdains the drunk Consul, who speaks of the Garden of Eden and proposes that perhaps Adam&#x27;s punishment was to continue to live in the Garden of Eden, alone, &quot;cut off from God&quot;. Vigil (also hungover from the Red Cross ball) visits Quincey; he carries a newspaper with headlines of the Battle of the Ebro and the sickness of Pope Pius XI. He then visits the Consul, telling him to stay away from mescal and tequila. Hugh and Yvonne return, and the Consul wakes up from a black-out in the bathroom, slowly remembering the strained conversation during which it is decided that rather than accept Vigil&#x27;s offer of a day trip to Guanajuato they will go to Tomalin, near Parian.

===Chapter 6===
Hugh ruminates upon his career as sailor, journalist, and musician, while smoking a cigar. He imagines himself to be a traitor to his &quot;journalist friends&quot;, somehow responsible for the Ebro, and comparable to Adolf Hitler as &quot;another frustrated artist&quot; and anti-semite. It is revealed that Hugh&#x27;s signing aboard the &quot;S.S. Philoctetes&quot; was intended as a publicity stunt to promote his songs, which are to be printed by a Jewish publisher named Bolowski. Doubting his choice, Hugh attempts to escape his journey to sea but is thwarted by the Consul, who wires words of support for Hugh&#x27;s choice to their aunt. Hugh remembers his time aboard the &quot;Philoctetes&quot; and, later, the &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot;, revealing his naivete and bigotry. Back in England, Hugh finds that Bolowski has made &quot;No effort [...] to distribute [Hugh&#x27;s songs]&quot;. It is further revealed that Hugh cuckolds Bolowski, who raises charges of plagiarism against Hugh. Later, Bolowski drops the charges. Once again in the present, Hugh shaves the Consul, who is suffering from &quot;delirium tremens&quot;. The two men discuss literature and the occult; their discussion is intermingled with Hugh&#x27;s ongoing inner monologue. At the end of the chapter, Hugh, Yvonne, the Consul, and Laruelle make their way to Laruelle&#x27;s home. On the way, the Consul receives a postcard from Yvonne, which she wrote the year before, days after she left him, and which has travelled around the world before reaching Quauhnahuac.

===Chapter 7===
The four arrive at Jacques Laruelle&#x27;s home, which features two towers that the Consul compares to both Gothic battlements and the camouflaged smokestacks of the &quot;Samaritan&quot;. Hugh, Yvonne, and the Consul go upstairs, where the Consul simultaneously struggles to resist drinking and look for his copy of &quot;Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays&quot;. Yvonne wants to leave from the start, and she soon suggests going to the fiesta before they board the bus to Tomalin. The Consul stays behind as Hugh and Yvonne leave; once the two are gone, Laruelle rounds on him for coming only to drink. The Consul can no longer resist, and does so while Laruelle changes into his tennis clothes for a match with Vigil. They accompany each other down to the fiesta, where the Consul gets himself drunk at a cafe called the Paris while Laruelle tries to lecture him on his drinking. At the fiesta, more mention is made of the Pope&#x27;s illness and the Battle of the Ebro. Eventually Laruelle leaves, although the Consul is not sure when; he ends up lecturing himself on his drinking problem. Now wandering around to avoid Hugh and Yvonne, he finds an unoccupied ride called the Infernal Machine and is pressured by a gang of children to take the ride. He loses all of his possessions on the ride, which the children gather and return to him. The Consul still has more time to waste, so he stumbles into the Terminal Cantina El Bosque, wherein he chats with the proprietor, Senora Gregorio, and has at least two more drinks. The pariah dog follows him inside but is scared off when he rises. Finally, he walks back outside to find Vigil, Quincey, and Bustamente walking together—they do not notice him—just as the bus to Tomalin pulls into the station.

===Chapter 8===
The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne travel to Tomalin by bus. A number of allusions and symbols are repeated: &quot;Las Manos de Orlac,&quot; the battle of the Ebro, cigarettes, the Good Samaritan, the number seven, etc. Along the way, Hugh notices a dead dog at the bottom of the barranca (Spanish for &quot;canyon&quot; or &quot;ravine&quot;). During the trip, a &quot;pelado&quot; on the bus is noted, and Hugh and the Consul debate the meaning of the epithet. Hugh believes the term to mean &quot;a shoeless illiterate&quot; but the Consul corrects him, claiming that &quot;pelados&quot; are &quot;indeed &#x27;peeled ones,&#x27; the stripped, but also those who did not have to be rich to prey on the really poor&quot;. Further along, Hugh spots a man by the road, seemingly asleep. The bus stops and the man is found to be an Indian dying with his hat covering his face. No one helps the man due to a law that makes any such samaritan liable for &quot;accessory after the fact&quot;. However, the pelado removes the Indian&#x27;s hat, revealing a head wound and bloodied money. Nearby, Hugh and the Consul spot the recurring horse: &quot;branded number seven&quot;. Leaving the peasant to his fate, the passengers reboard the bus. The Consul directs Hugh to look at the pelado, who is now clutching the &quot;bloodstained pile of silver pesos and centavos&quot;: the pelado has pilfered the Indian&#x27;s money, and has used it to pay his fare. The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne take a pinch of habanero, and the bus rattles on toward Tomalin, where it arrives at the end of the chapter.

===Chapter 9===

The Consul, Hugh, and Yvonne arrive at Arena Tomalin and take in a bullfight. The narrative references Munro Leaf&#x27;s Ferdinand the Bull, as the bull does not care to participate in the occasion for much of the event. This chapter offers Yvonne&#x27;s point of view, including her memories of the Indian that had been injured and the emotion that she feels when reflecting on the volcano, Popocatépetl. As the chapter continues, she reminisces about her childhood and early adulthood in multiple instances; for example, when she claimed to see her father come toward her in a hallucination, when she thinks about her mother&#x27;s death around the time of World War I, and when she discusses her life as an actress in Hollywood. Also, Yvonne dreams of the future she could have had, and would still like to have, with the Consul. Yvonne&#x27;s futuristic dreams included living with the Consul in solidarity and peace with nature. During the bullfight, Hugh decides to jump in and ride the bull while the Consul and Yvonne profess their love for each other in the crowd.

===Chapter 10===
Told from the Consul&#x27;s perspective, Chapter 10 opens with Geoffrey having drinks at the Salon Ofelia. He sits at the bar contemplating varieties of liquor while listening to Hugh and Yvonne banter as they swim nearby. They dress in separate changing rooms as the Consul continues to listen to their playful repartee, and they soon join him for dinner. Various landmarks, including the San Francisco Convent, the City Parish and the Tlaxcala Royal Chapel and Sanctuary, are mentioned as the Consul reads a tourist information booklet and remembers places he and Yvonne visited in happier times of their past. The Consul leaves early after arguing politics with Hugh and lashing out against Hugh and Yvonne&#x27;s concerns about his drinking.

===Chapter 11===
Hugh and Yvonne leave Salon Ofelia in search of the Consul. They walk in the shadow of the two volcanoes, Popocatépetl and Ixtaccihuatl, and come to a point where they must choose one of two paths. Told from Yvonne&#x27;s perspective, they choose the main path, which they believe the Consul would have taken, since it passes by two cantinas on the way to Parian. Their progress is hindered by a growing thunderstorm and there are numerous references to constellations, such as Orion and the Pleiades. Yvonne is trampled by the horse with the number 7 branded on its leg and imagines seeing her dream house in Canada burn down as she dies.

===Chapter 12===

The final chapter of &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, is told again from the Consul&#x27;s point of view. He is in the main barroom of the Farolito, which is located at the foot of and seemingly under the volcano Popocatépetl. He does not realise that Hugh and Yvonne are looking for him. Diosdado, also called The Elephant, hands the Consul a stack of letters he has had, which were written by Yvonne and sent to the Consul throughout the past year. The Consul gets into a disagreement with the local police chiefs. They push him outside of the bar and out of the light, where they shoot the Consul and throw him off the edge of the ravine that the Farolito is built atop of. The shot startles a horse which runs off.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
*Geoffrey Firmin is the alcoholic Consul living in Quauhnahuac. The Consul was born in India, and his mother died when he was young. His father remarried but walked away from his wife, his son Geoffrey, and his newly born son Hugh, disappearing into the Himalayas. The stepmother dies soon afterward, and the Firmin boys are sent to England and taken in by the Taskersons. A naval officer during World War I, he was court-martialed and subsequently decorated for his actions aboard a submarine destroyer disguised as a merchant vessel (the captured German officers disappeared and were allegedly burned alive in the boiler). His appointment to the consular service is a kind of lateral promotion to get him out of the headlines, and he ends up with the sinecure of a consular position in a Mexican town with no British interests. By the novel&#x27;s start he is actually an ex-consul: he resigned the service at the time when the UK and Mexico broke up diplomatic relationships in the aftermath of President Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27;s 1938 nationalisation of the country&#x27;s oil reserves. He wants to write a book on comparative mythology, but his alcoholism dominates all areas of his life.
*Yvonne Constable is a former actress, born in Hawaii, who at age 14 began a brief career in the movies, which she abandoned and never picked up again. She has returned to Mexico, after a long absence in the United States, to rekindle her marriage to the Consul. She was married before and had a child, which died young; she may have had affairs with Hugh Firmin and Jacques Laruelle.
*Hugh Firmin who had interrupted his career as a singer-songwriter in England for a year at sea, is Geoffrey&#x27;s half-brother and a child-prodigy like Yvonne. After returning to England, he falls in with the political left and supports the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He visits Mexico to report on fascist activity for the &quot;London Globe&quot;, and is to leave the next day, to board a ship bringing ammunition to the Spanish government forces. There are frequent allusions in later chapters to an earlier affair between Hugh and Yvonne.
*Jacques Laruelle (usually referred to as &quot;M. Laruelle&quot;), a French film director and childhood friend of the Consul. Born in the Moselle area, he grew up in Paris and became acquainted with the Consul during the summer of 1911 in the beach resort of Courseulles-sur-Mer, on the Channel. Independently of the Consul he has also moved to Quauhnahuac, and like Hugh has an affair with Yvonne. He is 42 when the novel starts and is preparing to leave Mexico.

===Secondary characters===
*Dr. Arturo Díaz Vigil, a local physician, friend of the Consul and Laruelle.
*Sr. Bustamente, owner of the local cinema.
*Señora Gregorio, owner of the &quot;Terminal Cantina El Bosque&quot;, a bar in Quauhnahuac.
*The Taskersons, the Consul&#x27;s adoptive family; the patriarch, a poet named Abraham Taskerson, took Geoffrey in as a fifteen-year-old brooding poet. The entire family, including the mother and at least six sons, drinks hard and takes long walks in the countryside around their home, across the River Mersey and with a view of the Welsh mountains.
*Juan Cerillo, a Mexican national who was in Spain with Hugh and is now an agent for a cooperative holding made possible by the nationalisations of president Lázaro Cárdenas: he transports money between rural cooperatives and farmers and the national Credit Bank (much like the murdered Indian in Chapter VII). Cerillo is modelled on a real-life friend of Lowry&#x27;s, Juan Fernando Márquez, whom he befriended during his 1936–1938 stay in Mexico and who also appears in &quot;Dark as the Grave Wherein my Friend is Laid&quot;.

==Symbolism and allusion==
&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; is particularly rich in symbolism; references and allusions to other writers and literary works abound. The influence of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; runs throughout the novel, and references to Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot;, William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; enrich the novel&#x27;s meaning.

===Marlowe and &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;===
Critics have remarked that Marlowe&#x27;s version of the Faustus myth is &quot;Lowry&#x27;s single most important source for &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;&quot;. Lowry alludes to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as well and uses a quote for one of his three epigraphs but Marlowe&#x27;s dominates, with the Consul being suggested as a Faustian black magician by Hugh. The Consul &quot;often associates himself with Faustus as a suffering soul who cannot ask for salvation, or who even runs toward hell&quot;, and parodies Marlowe&#x27;s line about Helen of Troy (&quot;was this the face that launched a thousand ships, / and burnt the topless towers of Illium?&quot;) when looking at a fighting cock in a bar, &quot;Was this the face that launched five hundred ships, and betrayed Christ into being in the Western Hemisphere?&quot;

A literary game based on the Sortes virgilianae—a form of divination by bibliomancy in which advice or predictions of the future are sought by randomly selecting a passage from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, but with Shakespeare replacing Virgil—is an important theme. The Consul (who &quot;had delighted in the absurd game&quot;) refers to it again in chapter 7, this time using Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Infernal Machine&quot;. Exactly a year later Laruelle plays it yet again, this time with the Consul&#x27;s copy of &quot;Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays&quot;. After two lines and then another from &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and a passage from Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, the book opens on the last page of &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, and the four lines Laruelle reads are particularly appropriate to the Consul: &quot;Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight, ... Faustus is gone: regard his hellish fall.&quot;

===Others===
Many of the individual symbols in the novel relate to each other and to Lowry&#x27;s literary models. The Consul&#x27;s wild and overgrown garden, which stands for his life, alludes to the Garden of Eden; the barranca symbolises and becomes his tomb. Throughout the novel the number 7 appears branded on the horse which is encountered in many of the chapters, and often as time: Laruelle&#x27;s Day of the Dead, in the first chapter, ends at 7 p.m.; Yvonne returns to the Consul at 7 a.m.. and the day which takes up chapters 2 through 12 ends at 7 p.m. At the novel&#x27;s close, the clock strikes seven times and a cock apparently confirms the Indian belief that &quot;a cock crowing seven times announces death&quot;, while the clock also announces the opening of the seventh seal.

== Literary significance and critical reception ==
An early review of the book, by R. W. Flint in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, called it &quot;one of the most readable novels to appear since the war&quot; but ultimately criticised it severely for its &quot;second-handedness&quot;, saying that Lowry &quot;lacks the confidence of the innovator&quot;.

Poet and novelist Charles Bukowski said that, when he read Lowry&#x27;s novel, &quot;I yawned myself to shit&quot;. He criticised it for lack of &quot;pace, quickness, life, sunlight, juice and flavour in his lines.&quot;

Michael Hofmann, who would edit the collection of posthumous work of Lowry&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage That Never Ends&quot;, wrote, &quot;&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; eats light like a black hole. It is a work of such gravity and connectedness and spectroscopic richness that it is more world than product. It is absolute mass, agglomeration of consciousness and experience and terrific personal grace. It has planetary swagger.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, critic Michael Wood wrote, &quot;&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; is a great book about missing grandeur, about the specialised tragedy that lies in the unavailability of the tragedy you want.&quot;

Chris Power, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said: &quot;I came to the book knowing only its reputation as a masterpiece of English modernism. I left thinking it one of the greatest novels of the 20th century... Lowry is closer to Melville and Conrad than Joyce, but he creates his corner of Mexico in a manner similar to the Dublin of &quot;Ulysses&quot;: not by describing it so much as by building an alternate reality from language.&quot;

Novelist Elizabeth Lowry (no relation), writing in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, described it as a &quot;black masterpiece about the horrors of alcoholic disintegration.&quot;

Reviewing Gordon Bowker&#x27;s biography of Lowry, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented on &quot;Volcano&quot;&#x27;s legacy: &quot;&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; is too famous to be just a cult object, but more than most great novels it is revisited year after year by a few zealous defenders, who place Lowry high up in the modernist pantheon, while the rest of the world is only barely aware of his masterpiece as an exotic and harrowing read.&quot;

Modern Library&#x27;s 100 Best Novels of English novels in the 20th century lists the book at position 11. It was ranked number 99 on Le Monde&#x27;s 100 Books of the Century.

==In other media==
John Huston directed the 1984 film adaptation, with Albert Finney, Jacqueline Bisset, Anthony Andrews and Katy Jurado. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Albert Finney) and Best Music, Original Score.
&quot;&quot; (1976) is a National Film Board of Canada documentary produced by Donald Brittain and Robert A. Duncan and directed by Brittain and John Kramer. It opens with the inquest into Lowry&#x27;s &quot;death by misadventure,&quot; and then moves back in time to trace the writer&#x27;s life. Selections from Lowry&#x27;s novel are read by Richard Burton amid images shot in Mexico, the United States, Canada and England.

The novel was the inspiration for the 1971 song &quot;The Consul at Sunset&quot; by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, as well as the 1987 song &quot;Back Room of the Bar&quot; by The Young Fresh Fellows.

The book was featured in episode 5 of &quot;For All Mankind&quot;.

<text>The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is a species complex of snakes endemic to Asia. With an average of and a record length of , it is the world&#x27;s longest venomous snake and among the heaviest. Under the genus Ophiophagus, it is not phylogenetically a true cobra despite its common name and some resemblance. Spanning from the Indian Subcontinent through Southeastern Asia to Southern China, the king cobra is widely distributed albeit not commonly seen. 

Individuals have diversified colouration across its habitats, from black with white strips to unbroken brownish grey, although after taxonomic re-evaluation, it is no longer the sole member of its genus but is now a species complex; these differences in pattern and other aspects may cause the genus to be split into at least four species, spread across its large geographic range.

It chiefly hunts other snakes, including those of its own kind, although other lizards and rodents are occasional prey items. This is the only ophidian that constructs an above-ground nest for its eggs, which are purposefully and meticulously gathered and protected by the female throughout the incubation period. Typical threat display of this elapid includes neck-flap spreading, head raising, hissing and sometimes charging. Capable of striking at a considerable range and height with an immense venom yield, envenomation from this species may induce rapid onset of neurotoxic and cytotoxic symptoms, requiring prompt antivenom administration. Despite the fearsome reputation, aggression toward humans usually only arises from an individual inadvertently exposing itself or being cornered; encounters happen through chance, including negative interactions.

Threatened by habitat destruction, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010. Regarded as the national reptile of India, it has an eminent position in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

== Etymology ==
The king cobra is also referred to by the common name &quot;hamadryad&quot;, especially in older literature. &quot;Hamadryas hannah&quot; was the scientific name used by Danish naturalist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1836 who described four king cobra specimens, three captured in the Sundarbans and one in the vicinity of Kolkata. The origin of the species name &quot;hannah&quot; was not specified during description and has long been uncertain, but may potentially refer to Hannah Sarah Wallich, the eldest daughter of Cantor&#x27;s uncle, botanist Nathaniel Wallich, who hosted Cantor during his studies in India.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Ophiophagus&quot; was proposed by Günther in 1864 in place of &quot;Hamadryas&quot;, as the genus &quot;Hamadryas&quot; was already used for the cracker butterflies. The name is derived from its propensity to eat snakes. &quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot; was accepted as the valid name for the king cobra by Charles Mitchill Bogert in 1945 who argued that it differs significantly from &quot;Naja&quot; species.

It has been suggested that three more king cobra species exist in addition to &quot;O. hannah&quot;, namely the Sunda king cobra &quot;O. bungarus&quot;, the Western Ghats king cobra (&quot;O. kaalinga&quot;) and the Luzon king cobra (&quot;O. salvatana&quot;). These distinct genetic lineages are geographically isolated and adapted to specific ecological regions.

=== Synonyms ===
In 1838, Cantor proposed the name &quot;Hamadryas ophiophagus&quot; for the king cobra and explained that it has dental features intermediate between the genera &quot;Naja&quot; and &quot;Bungarus&quot;.
&quot;Naia vittata&quot; proposed by Walter Elliot in 1840 was a king cobra caught offshore near Chennai that was floating in a basket. This provenance is disputed, as wild king cobras have never occurred near Chennai, and an analysis of this specimen has found it to be more similar to the northern king cobra.
&quot;Hamadryas elaps&quot; proposed by Albert Günther in 1858 were king cobra specimens from the Philippines and Borneo. Günther considered both &quot;N. bungarus&quot; and &quot;N. vittata&quot; a variety of &quot;H. elaps&quot;. &quot;Naja ingens&quot; proposed by Alexander Willem Michiel van Hasselt in 1882 was a king cobra captured near Tebing Tinggi in northern Sumatra. 

The earliest scientific name for the king cobra was &quot;Naja bungaroides&quot;, given by Friedrich Boie in 1828 based on a juvenile specimen from Java. This description was improperly done, leaving it a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; at the time. However, Johann Georg Wagler validated the name in 1830 with a sufficient diagnosis, and also proposed a new genus for it, &quot;Hoplocephalus&quot;. In 1837, Hermann Schlegel used the name &quot;Naja bungaroides&quot; for his description of the Australian broad-headed snake, which was later reclassified into Wagler&#x27;s &quot;Hoplocephalus&quot;, and used the species name &quot;Naja bungarus&quot; for the king cobra. Since then, the species name &quot;Naja&quot;/&quot;Hoplocephalus bungaroides&quot;, originally coined for the king cobra and improperly assigned to the broad-headed snake, became conflated with the broad-headed snake and used as the type species of &quot;Hoplocephalus&quot;, while the species name &quot;Naja bungarus&quot; was treated as a junior synonym of the king cobra (until its revival as the species name for the Sunda king cobra in 2024). This longstanding discrepancy, which breaks the principle of priority, was overlooked for nearly two centuries and only discovered in 2024. Due to the long presence of the names &quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot; and &quot;Hoplocephalus bungaroides&quot; in the literature, which would be upended if these two species were reclassified based on this issue, it was decided to maintain the longstanding scientific names for both taxa and designate a new, accurate type specimen for the broad-headed snake.

=== Evolution ===
A genetic analysis using cytochrome b, and a multigene analysis showed that the king cobra was an early offshoot of a genetic lineage giving rise to the mambas, rather than the &quot;Naja&quot; cobras.

A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that specimens from Surat Thani Province and Nakhon Si Thammarat Provinces in southern Thailand form a deeply genetically divergent clade from those in northern Thailand, which grouped with specimens from Myanmar and Guangdong in southern China.

== Description ==
The king cobra&#x27;s skin is olive green with black and white bands on the trunk that converge to the head. The head is covered by 15 drab-coloured and black-edged shields (large scales consistently present between individuals). The muzzle is rounded, and the tongue black. It has two fangs and 3–5 maxillary teeth in the upper jaw, and two rows of teeth in the lower jaw. The nostrils are between two shields. The large eyes have a golden iris and round pupils. Its hood is oval shaped and covered with olive green smooth scales and two black spots between the two lowest scales. Its cylindrical tail is yellowish green above and marked with black.
It has a pair of large occipital scales on top of the head, 17 to 19 rows of smooth oblique scales on the neck, and 15 rows on the body. Juveniles are black with chevron shaped white, yellow or buff bars that point towards the head.
Adult king cobras are long. The longest known individual measured . Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales are placed in an oblique arrangement.

The king cobra is sexually dimorphic, with males being larger and paler in particular during the breeding season. Males captured in Kerala measured up to and weighed up to . Females captured had a maximum length of and a weight of .
The largest known king cobra was long and captured in Thailand.
It differs from other cobra species by size and hood. It is larger, has a narrower and longer stripe on the neck.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The king cobra has a wide distribution throughout tropical Asia. It occurs in elevations of from the Terai in India and southern Nepal to the Brahmaputra River basin in Bhutan and northeast India, down to Bangladesh, Myanmar, southern China, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam; to the maritime Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.

In northern India, it has been recorded in Garhwal and Kumaon, and in the Sivalik hills and terai regions of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In northeast India, the king cobra has been recorded in northern West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram.
In the Eastern Ghats, it occurs from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to coastal Odisha, and also in Bihar and southern West Bengal, especially the Sundarbans. In the Western Ghats, it was recorded in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, and also in Gujarat. It also occurs on Baratang Island in the Great Andaman chain. It may have reached the furthest west of its distributional range in extreme western India &amp; eastern Pakistan, in the vicinity of Lahore and Palanpur. These populations have sometimes been thought to be the result of introduction by snake charmers or transport along rivers, but are now more likely considered natural populations. However, it remains uncertain if any populations continue to persist there.

== Behaviour and ecology==
Like other snakes, a king cobra receives chemical information via its forked tongue, which picks up scent particles and transfers them to a sensory receptor (Jacobson&#x27;s organ) located in the roof of its mouth.
Following envenomation, it swallows its prey whole. Because of its flexible jaws, it can swallow prey much larger than its head. It is considered diurnal because it hunts during the day, but has also been seen at night, rarely.

=== Diet ===

The king cobra is an apex predator and dominant over all other snakes except large pythons. Its diet consists primarily of other snakes and lizards, including Indian cobra, banded krait, rat snake, pythons, green whip snake, keelback, banded wolf snake and Blyth&#x27;s reticulated snake.
It also hunts Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper by following their odour trails. In Singapore, one was observed swallowing a clouded monitor.
When food is scarce, it also feeds on other small vertebrates, such as birds, and lizards. In some cases, the cobra constricts its prey using its muscular body, though this is uncommon. After a large meal, it may go for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic rate.

=== Antipredator behavior ===
The king cobra is not considered aggressive. It usually avoids humans and slinks off when disturbed, but is known to aggressively defend incubating eggs and attack intruders rapidly. When alarmed, it raises the front part of its body, extends the hood, shows the fangs and hisses loudly.
Wild king cobras encountered in Singapore appeared to be placid, but reared up and struck in self defense when cornered.

The king cobra can be easily irritated by closely approaching objects or sudden movements. When raising its body, the king cobra can still move forward to strike with a long distance, and people may misjudge the safe zone. It can deliver multiple bites in a single attack.

The hiss of the king cobra is a much lower pitch than many other snakes and many people thus liken its call to a &quot;growl&quot; rather than a hiss. While the hisses of most snakes are of a broad-frequency span ranging from roughly 3,000 to 13,000 Hz with a dominant frequency near 7,500 Hz, king cobra growls consist solely of frequencies below 2,500 Hz, with a dominant frequency near 600 Hz, a much lower-pitched frequency closer to that of a human voice. Comparative anatomical morphometric analysis has led to a discovery of tracheal diverticula that function as low-frequency resonating chambers in king cobra and its prey, the rat snake, both of which can make similar growls.

=== Reproduction ===

The female is gravid for 50 to 59 days.
The king cobra is the only snake that builds a nest using dry leaf litter, starting from late March to late May. Most nests are located at the base of trees, are up to high in the centre and wide at the base. They consist of several layers and have mostly one chamber, into which the female lays eggs.
Clutch size ranges from 7 to 43 eggs, with 6 to 38 eggs hatching after incubation periods of 66 to 105 days. Temperature inside nests is not steady but varies depending on elevation from . Females stay by their nests between two and 77 days. Hatchlings are between long and weigh .

The king cobra was shown to be capable of facultative parthenogenesis. The parthenogenetic mechanism appears to be a variation of meiosis referred to as terminal fusion automixis in which there is fusion of the meiotic products formed at the anaphase II stage of meiosis.

The venom of hatchlings is as potent as that of the adults. They may be brightly marked, but these colours often fade as they mature. They are alert and nervous, being highly aggressive if disturbed.

The average lifespan of a wild king cobra is about 20 years.

== Venom ==
===Composition===
Venom of the king cobra, produced by the postorbital venom glands, consists primarily of three-finger toxins (3FTx) and snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs).

Of all the 3FTx, alpha-neurotoxins are the predominant and most lethal components when cytotoxins and beta-cardiotoxins also exhibit toxicological activities. It is reported that cytotoxicity of its venom varies significantly, depending upon the age and locality of an individual. Clinical cardiotoxicity is not widely observed, nor is nephrotoxicity present among patients bitten by this species, presumably due to the low abundance of the toxins.

SVMPs are the second most protein family isolated from the king cobra&#x27;s venom, accounting from 11.9% to 24.4% of total venom proteins. The abundance is much higher than that of most cobras which is usually less than 1%. This protein family includes principal toxins responsible for vasculature damage and interference with haemostasis, contributing to bleeding and coagulopathy caused by envenomation of vipers. While there are such haemorrhagins isolated from the king cobra&#x27;s venom, they only induce species-sensitive haemorrhagic and lethal activities on rabbits and hares, but with minimal effects on mice. Clinical pathophysiology of the king cobra&#x27;s SVMPs has yet to be well studied, although its substantial quantity suggests involvement in tissue damage and necrosis as a result of inflammatory and proteolytic activities, which are instrumental for foraging and digestive purposes.

Ohanin, a minor vespryn protein component specific to this species, causes hypolocomotion and hyperalgesia in experimental mice. It is believed that it contributes to neurotoxicity on the central nervous system of the victim.

===Clinical management===
A king cobra&#x27;s bite, and subsequent envenomation, is an immediate medical emergency in humans or domesticated animals, as, if not treated as soon as possible, death can occur in as little as 30 minutes. Local symptoms include dusky discolouration of skin, edema and pain; in severe cases, swelling extends proximally, with necrosis and tissue sloughing that may require amputation. Onset of general symptoms follows while the venom is targeting the victim&#x27;s central nervous system, resulting in blurred vision, vertigo, drowsiness, and eventual paralysis. If not treated promptly, it may progress to cardiovascular collapse and, subsequently, coma. Death soon follows due to respiratory failure, among other simultaneous and varied system and organ failures.

Polyvalent antivenom of equine origin is produced by Haffkine Institute and King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in India.
A polyvalent antivenom produced by the Thai Red Cross Society can effectively neutralise venom of the king cobra. In India and Thailand, a concoction (or liquid blend) of turmeric (&quot;Curcuma longa&quot;) and other potent, medically relevant herbs reportedly creates a strong resilience against the venom of the king cobra when ingested. Proper and immediate treatments are critical to avoid death. Successful precedents include a client who recovered and was discharged in 10 days after being treated by accurate antivenom and inpatient care.

It can deliver up to 420 mg venom in dry weight (400–600 mg overall) per bite, with a toxicity in mice of 1.28 mg/kg through intravenous injection, 1.5 to 1.7 mg/kg through subcutaneous injection,
and 1.644 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injection. For research purposes, up to 1 g of venom was obtained through milking.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Conservation ===
In Southeast Asia, the king cobra is threatened foremost by habitat destruction owing to deforestation and expansion of agricultural land. It is also threatened by wildlife smuggling, as well as by poaching, then sold as bushmeat or turned into snake leather, and for use in traditional Chinese medicine.

The king cobra is listed in CITES Appendix II. It is protected in China and Vietnam. 
In India, it is placed under Schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing a king cobra is punished with imprisonment of up to six years. In the Philippines, king cobras (locally known as &quot;banakon&quot;) are included under the list of threatened species in the country. It is protected under the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act (Republic Act No. 9147), which criminalises the killing, trade, and consumption of threatened species with certain exceptions (like indigenous subsistence hunting or immediate threats to human life), with a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and a fine of ₱20,000.

=== Cultural significance ===

The king cobra has an eminent position in the mythology and folklore of India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.
A ritual in Myanmar involves a king cobra and a female snake charmer. The charmer is a priestess who is usually tattooed with three pictograms and kisses the snake on the top of its head at the end of the ritual. 
Members of the Pakokku clan tattoo themselves with ink mixed with cobra venom on their upper bodies in a weekly inoculation that they believe would protect them from the snake, though no scientific evidence supports this. It is regarded as the national reptile of India. In India, the king cobra is believed to possess exceptional memory; according to a myth, the killer of a king cobra stays in the eyes of the snake as an image, which is later picked up by the snake&#x27;s partner and used to hunt down the killer for revenge. Because of this myth, whenever a cobra is killed especially in India, the head, if not the entire body, is either crushed or burned to destroy the eyes completely.

<text>The esophagus (American English), oesophagus (British English), or œsophagus (archaic spelling) (see spelling difference) all ; : ((o)e)(œ)sophagi or ((o)e)(œ)sophaguses), colloquially known also as the food pipe, food tube, or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, about long in adults, that travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm, and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. Only about one centimeter of oesophagus lies in the abdominal cavity. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word &quot;esophagus&quot; is from Ancient Greek οἰσοφάγος (oisophágos), from οἴσω (oísō), future form of φέρω (phérō, &quot;I carry&quot;) + ἔφαγον (éphagon, &quot;I ate&quot;). It acquires great importance as it is a site of portosystemic anastomoses.

The wall of the esophagus from the lumen outwards consists of mucosa, submucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the stomach. The transition between these two types of epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. Most of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve) and in addition voluntary nerves (lower motor neurons) which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.

The esophagus passes through the thoracic cavity into the diaphragm into the stomach.

The esophagus may be affected by gastric reflux, cancer, prominent dilated blood vessels called varices that can bleed heavily, tears, constrictions, and disorders of motility. Diseases may cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful swallowing (odynophagia), chest pain, or cause no symptoms at all. Clinical investigations include X-rays when swallowing barium sulfate, endoscopy, and CT scans. Surgically, 
the esophagus is difficult to access in part due to its position between critical organs and directly between the sternum and spinal column.
==Structure==
The esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins at the back of the mouth, passing downward through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25 cm (10 in) in length.

Many blood vessels serve the esophagus, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper parts of the esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, the parts of the esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, with the exception of the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.

;Position

The upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point, it passes through the diaphragm.

The thoracic duct, which drains the majority of the body&#x27;s lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.

;Constrictions

The esophagus has four points of constriction. When a corrosive substance, or a solid object is swallowed, it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points. These constrictions arise from particular structures that compress the esophagus. These constrictions are:
* At the start of the esophagus, where the laryngopharynx joins the esophagus, behind the cricoid cartilage
* Where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in the superior mediastinum
* Where the esophagus is compressed by the left main bronchus in the posterior mediastinum
* The esophageal hiatus, where it passes through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum

===Sphincters===

The esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed. The upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter, which is formed by the lower portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, also known as the cricopharyngeal sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly. However, the lower esophageal sphincter is not an anatomical but rather a functional sphincter, meaning that it acts as a sphincter but does not have a distinct thickening like other sphincters.

The upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.

The lower esophageal sphincter, or gastroesophageal sphincter, surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the &quot;cardia&quot;. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn, and, if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.

===Nerve supply===
The esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.

===Gastroesophageal junction===
The gastroesophageal junction (also known as the esophagogastric junction) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach, at the lower end of the esophagus. The pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa, and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zig-zag line, which is often called the z-line. Histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach. Normally, the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia; however, when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in Barrett&#x27;s esophagus the true gastroesophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition. The functional location of the lower oesophageal sphincter is generally situated about below the z-line.

The human esophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals, the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There are two types of glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells that is part of the enteric nervous system.

The muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.

==Development==
In early embryogenesis, the esophagus develops from the endodermal primitive gut tube. The ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac. It is very small in the beginning, but it lengthens due to descent of lungs and heart. During the second week of embryological development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. The sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the midgut, hindgut and foregut.

The muscle of upper one-third is striated, middle one-third, mixed, and lower one-third smooth.

The surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops as part of the foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches. Nerve supply to upper two-third is from vagus and to lower one-third is from autonomic plexus.

==Function==
===Swallowing===
Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.

===Reducing gastric reflux===
The stomach produces gastric acid, a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. The acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this sphincteric action.

== Gene and protein expression ==
About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.

==Clinical significance==
The main conditions affecting the esophagus are described here. For a more complete list, see esophageal disease.

===Inflammation===

Inflammation of the esophagus is known as esophagitis. Reflux of gastric acids from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis. Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the yeast &quot;Candida albicans&quot; that may occur when a person is immunocompromised. the causes of some forms of esophagitis, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, are not well-characterized, but may include Th2-mediated atopies or genetic factors. There appear to be correlations between eosinophilic esophagitis, asthma (itself with an eosinophilic component), eczema, and allergic rhinitis, though it is not clear whether these conditions contribute to eosinophilic esophagitis or vice versa, or if they are symptoms of mutual underlying factors. Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.

=== Barrett&#x27;s esophagus ===

Prolonged esophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play a role in the development of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. In this condition, there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus, which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia. Barrett&#x27;s esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer.

===Cancer===

There are two main types of cancer of the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma is a carcinoma that can occur in the squamous cells lining the esophagus. This type is much more common in China and Iran. The other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus. This is most common in developed countries in those with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells.

In its early stages, esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases in different parts of the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.

===Varices===

Esophageal varices are swollen twisted branches of the azygous vein in the lower third of the esophagus. These blood vessels anastomose (join up) with those of the portal vein when portal hypertension develops. These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis. This collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.

Esophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person to vomit blood, or suffer shock. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. IV fluids and blood products may be given in order to prevent hypovolemia from excess blood loss.

===Motility disorders===
Several disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.

===Malformations===
Esophageal strictures are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had reflux for many years. Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastroesophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.

Two of the most common congenital malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.

===Imaging===

An X-ray of swallowed barium may be used to reveal the size and shape of the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.

==History==
The word &quot;esophagus&quot; (British English: &quot;oesophagus&quot;), comes from the () meaning &quot;gullet&quot;. It derives from two roots &quot;(eosin)&quot; to carry and () to eat. The use of the word esophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature since at least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that &quot;the oesophagus ... receives the greatest amount of what we consume.&quot; Its existence in other animals and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (AD23–AD79), and the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus have been documented since at least the time of Galen.

The first attempt at surgery on the esophagus focused in the neck, and was conducted in dogs by Theodore Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. By 1908, an operation had been performed by Voeckler to remove the esophagus, and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus, (to control esophageal cancer), had been conducted.

The Nissen fundoplication, in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to stimulate its function and control reflux, was first conducted by Rudolph Nissen in 1955.

==Other animals==
===Vertebrates===
In tetrapods, the pharynx is much shorter, and the esophagus correspondingly longer, than in fish. In the majority of vertebrates, the esophagus is simply a connecting tube, but in some birds, which regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach. In ruminants, animals with four chambered stomachs, a groove called the &quot;sulcus reticuli&quot; is often found in the esophagus, allowing milk to drain directly into the hind stomach, the abomasum. In the horse the esophagus is about in length, and carries food to the stomach. A muscular ring, called the cardiac sphincter, connects the stomach to the esophagus. This sphincter is very well developed in horses. This and the oblique angle at which the esophagus connects to the stomach explains why horses cannot vomit. The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may have the condition known as choke.

The esophagus of snakes is remarkable for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey.

In most fish, the esophagus is extremely short, primarily due to the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.

In many vertebrates, the esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, the esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat &quot;Plecotus auritus&quot;, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.

The muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is initially striated but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, it is entirely striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds.

Contrary to popular belief, an adult human body would not be able to pass through the esophagus of a whale, which generally measures less than in diameter, although in larger baleen whales it may be up to when fully distended.

===Invertebrates===
A structure with the same name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species &quot;Tarebia granifera&quot;, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.

In the cephalopods, the brain often surrounds the esophagus.

<text>Thomas Edward Hulce (; born December 6, 1953) is an American actor and theatre producer. He is best known for his portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), as well as the roles of Larry &quot;Pinto&quot; Kroger in &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), Larry Buckman in &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989), and Quasimodo in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996). Hulce&#x27;s awards include an Emmy Award for &quot;The Heidi Chronicles&quot;, a 2007 Tony Award for Best Musical as a lead producer for &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and four Golden Globe nominations.

==Early life==
Thomas Edward Hulce was born on December 6, 1953, in Detroit, Michigan (some sources incorrectly cite his birthplace as Whitewater, Wisconsin). The youngest of four children, he was raised in Plymouth, Michigan. His mother, Joanna Winkleman, sang briefly with Phil Spitalny&#x27;s &quot;All-Girl Orchestra,&quot; and his father, Raymond Albert Hulce, worked for the Ford Motor Company. As a child, he wanted to be a singer, but he switched to acting after his voice changed in his teenage years. He left home at the age of 15 and attended Interlochen Arts Academy and the North Carolina School of the Arts, leaving a year before finishing his BFA. He graduated with a BA from Beloit College in Wisconsin.

==Career==
===Acting career===
Hulce debuted as an actor in 1974, playing opposite Anthony Hopkins in &quot;Equus&quot; on Broadway and in Los Angeles. Throughout the rest of the 1970s and the early 1980s, he worked primarily as a theater actor, taking occasional parts in movies. His first film role was in the James Dean-influenced film &quot;September 30, 1955&quot; in 1977. His next movie role was as freshman college student Larry &quot;Pinto&quot; Kroger in the classic comedy &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978). In 1983, he played a gunshot victim in the television show &quot;St. Elsewhere.&quot;

In the early 1980s, Hulce was chosen over intense competition (including David Bowie, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Mark Hamill, and Kenneth Branagh) to play the role of Mozart in director Miloš Forman&#x27;s film version of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play. In 1985, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, losing to his co-star, F. Murray Abraham. In his acceptance speech, Abraham paid tribute to his co-star, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s only one thing missing for me tonight, and that is to have Tom Hulce standing by my side.&quot;
In 1989, he received his second Best Actor Golden Globe Award nomination for a critically acclaimed performance as an intellectually-challenged garbage-collector in the 1988 movie &quot;Dominick and Eugene.&quot; He played supporting roles in &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) and &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994). In 1988, he played the title part in the British–Dutch movie &quot;Shadow Man,&quot; directed by the Polish director Piotr Andrejew.

In 1990, he was nominated for his first Emmy Award for his performance as the 1960s civil rights activist Michael Schwerner in the 1990 TV-movie &quot;Murder in Mississippi.&quot; He starred as Joseph Stalin&#x27;s projectionist in Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;The Inner Circle.&quot; In 1996, he won an Emmy Award for his role as a pediatrician in a television-movie version of the Wendy Wasserstein play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles,&quot; starring Jamie Lee Curtis. Also that year, he was cast in Disney&#x27;s animated film adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame,&quot; providing the speaking and singing voice of the protagonist Quasimodo. Although Hulce largely retired from acting in the mid-1990s, he had bit parts in the movies &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (2006) and &quot;Jumper&quot; (2008).

Hulce remained active in theater throughout his entire acting career. In addition to &quot;Equus,&quot; he appeared in Broadway productions of &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot; and &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; for which he was a Tony Award nominee in 1990. In the mid-1980s, he appeared in two different productions of playwright Larry Kramer&#x27;s early AIDS-era drama &quot;The Normal Heart.&quot; In 1992, he starred in a Shakespeare Theatre Company production of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; His regional theatre credits include &quot;Eastern Standard&quot; at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum, both in 1988.

He retired from acting in the mid-1990s to focus on stage directing and producing. In 2023, Hulce made a brief return to acting by reprising the role of Quasimodo in the live-action/animated short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

===Career as producer===
Among Hulce&#x27;s major projects are the six-hour, two-evening stage adaptation of John Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;; and &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, a festival of Alan Bennett&#x27;s one-man plays that won six Obie Awards, a Drama Desk Award, a special Outer Critics Circle Award, and a New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Foreign Play. He also headed &quot;10 Million Miles&quot;, a musical project by Keith Bunin and Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, that premiered in Spring 2007 at the Atlantic Theater Company.

Hulce was a lead producer of the Broadway hit &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, which won eight Tony Awards in 2007, including one for Best Musical. He is also a lead producer of the stage adaptation of the Green Day album &quot;American Idiot&quot;. The musical had its world premiere in Berkeley, California, at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009 and opened on Broadway in April 2010. In 2017 he began work as a producer on the musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud&quot;, which received 11 Tony Award nominations in 2019. He also produced the 2004 movie &quot;A Home at the End of the World&quot;, based upon Michael Cunningham&#x27;s novel.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Hulce identified as gay in an interview with &quot;Seattle Gay News&quot;. In the same interview, he took the opportunity to debunk a rumor he married a woman (supposedly an Italian artist named Cecilia Ermini) and had a daughter named Anya with her: &quot;That information – having a wife and child – is false. In the world of the Internet, there are many falsehoods. Anyone can write stuff on Wikipedia and it doesn&#x27;t have to be true. I&#x27;m comfortable among the lists [of openly gay actors] although I stopped acting about 10 years ago.&quot;

<doc id="168509" wikidata="Q178436" url="?curid=168509" title="Constipation">
<text>Constipation is a bowel dysfunction that makes bowel movements infrequent or hard to pass. The stool is often hard and dry. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day.
Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, vitamin B12 deficiency, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person&#x27;s family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.
Treatment of constipation depends on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been present. Measures that may help include drinking enough fluids, eating more fiber, consumption of honey and exercise. If this is not effective, laxatives of the bulk-forming agent, osmotic agent, stool softener, or lubricant type may be recommended. Stimulant laxatives are generally reserved for when other types are not effective. Other treatments may include biofeedback or in rare cases surgery.
In the general population rates of constipation are 2–30 percent. Among elderly people living in a care home the rate of constipation is 50–75 percent. People in the United States spend more than on medications for constipation a year.
==Definition==

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Most commonly, constipation is thought of as infrequent bowel movements, usually fewer than 3 stools per week. However, people may have other complaints as well including:
* Straining with bowel movements
* Excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement
* Hard stools
* Pain with bowel movements secondary to straining
* Abdominal pain
* Abdominal bloating.
* the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.

The Rome III Criteria are a set of symptoms that help standardize the diagnosis of constipation in various age groups. These criteria help physicians to better define constipation in a standardized manner.

==Causes==
The causes of constipation can be divided into congenital, primary, and secondary. The most common kind is primary and not life-threatening. It can also be divided by the age group affected such as children and adults.

Primary or functional constipation is defined by ongoing symptoms for greater than six months not due to an underlying cause such as medication side effects or an underlying medical condition. It is not associated with abdominal pain, thus distinguishing it from irritable bowel syndrome. It is the most common kind of constipation, and is often multifactorial. In adults, such primary causes include: dietary choices such as insufficient dietary fiber or fluid intake, or behavioral causes such as decreased physical activity. In children, causes can include diets low in fiber and fluids, underlying medical conditions, and reluctance to go to the bathroom. In the elderly, common causes have been attributed to insufficient dietary fiber intake, inadequate fluid intake, decreased physical activity, side effects of medications, hypothyroidism, and obstruction by colorectal cancer. Evidence to support these factors however is poor.

Secondary causes include side effects of medications such as opiates, endocrine and metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism, and obstruction such as from colorectal cancer or ovarian cancer. Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity may also present with constipation. Cystocele can develop as a result of chronic constipation.

===Diet===
Constipation can be caused or exacerbated by a low-fiber diet, low liquid intake, or dieting. Dietary fiber helps to decrease colonic transport time, increases stool bulk but simultaneously softens stool. Therefore, diets low in fiber can lead to primary constipation.

===Medications===
Many medications have constipation as a side effect. Some include (but are not limited to) opioids, diuretics, antidepressants, antihistamines, antispasmodics, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrythmics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, anti-diarrheals, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, and aluminum antacids. Certain calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and verapamil can cause severe constipation due to dysfunction of motility in the rectosigmoid colon. Supplements such as calcium and iron supplements can also have constipation as a notable side effect.

===Medical conditions===
Metabolic and endocrine problems which may lead to constipation include: pheochromocytoma, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, porphyria, chronic kidney disease, pan-hypopituitarism, diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis. Constipation is also common in individuals with muscular and myotonic dystrophy.

Systemic diseases that may present with constipation include celiac disease and systemic sclerosis.

Constipation has a number of structural (mechanical, morphological, anatomical) causes, namely through creating space-occupying lesions within the colon that stop the passage of stool, such as colorectal cancer, strictures, rectocoles, anal sphincter damage or malformation and post-surgical changes. Extra-intestinal masses such as other malignancies can also lead to constipation from external compression.

Constipation also has neurological causes, including anismus, descending perineum syndrome, desmosis and Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. In infants, Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease is the most common medical disorder associated with constipation. Anismus occurs in a small minority of persons with chronic constipation or obstructed defecation.

Spinal cord lesions and neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to constipation.

Chagas disease may cause constipation through the destruction of the myenteric plexus.

===Psychological===
Voluntary withholding of the stool is a common cause of constipation. The choice to withhold can be due to factors such as fear of pain, fear of public restrooms, or laziness. When a child holds in the stool a combination of encouragement, fluids, fiber, and laxatives may be useful to overcome the problem. Early intervention with withholding is important as this can lead to anal fissures.

=== Congenital ===
A number of diseases present at birth can result in constipation in children. They are as a group uncommon with Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease (HD) being the most common. There are also congenital structural anomalies that can lead to constipation, including anterior displacement of the anus, imperforate anus, strictures, and small left colon syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis is typically made based on a person&#x27;s description of the symptoms. Bowel movements that are difficult to pass, very firm, or made up of small hard pellets (like those excreted by rabbits) qualify as constipation, even if they occur every day. Constipation is traditionally defined as three or fewer bowel movements per week. Other symptoms related to constipation can include bloating, distension, abdominal pain, headaches, a feeling of fatigue and nervous exhaustion, or a sense of incomplete emptying. Although constipation may be a diagnosis, it is typically viewed as a symptom that requires evaluation to discern a cause.

=== Description ===
Distinguish between acute (days to weeks) or chronic (months to years) onset of constipation because this information changes the differential diagnosis. This in the context of accompanied symptoms helps physicians discover the cause of constipation. People often describe their constipation as bowel movements that are difficult to pass, firm stool with lumpy or hard consistency, and excessive straining during bowel movements. Bloating, abdominal distension, and abdominal pain often accompany constipation. Chronic constipation (symptoms present at least three days per month for more than three months) associated with abdominal discomfort is often diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when no obvious cause is found.

Poor dietary habits, previous abdominal surgeries, and certain medical conditions can contribute to constipation. Diseases associated with constipation include hypothyroidism, certain types of cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. Low fiber intake, inadequate amounts of fluids, poor ambulation or immobility, or medications can contribute to constipation. Once the presence of constipation is identified based on a culmination of the symptoms described above, then the cause of constipation should be figured out.

Separating non-life-threatening from serious causes may be partly based on symptoms. For example, colon cancer may be suspected if a person has a family history of colon cancer, fever, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. Other alarming signs and symptoms include family or personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, age of onset over 50, change in stool caliber, nausea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness and difficulty urinating.

=== Examination ===
A physical examination should involve at least an abdominal exam and rectal exam. Abdominal exam may reveal an abdominal mass if there is significant stool burden and may reveal abdominal discomfort. Rectal examination gives an impression of the anal sphincter tone and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, the presence of hemorrhoids, blood and whether any perineal irregularities are present including skin tags, fissures, anal warts. Physical examination is done manually by a physician and is used to guide which diagnostic tests to order.

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Functional constipation is common and does not warrant diagnostic testing. Imaging and laboratory tests are typically recommended for those with alarm signs or symptoms.

The laboratory tests performed depends on the suspected underlying cause of the constipation. Tests may include CBC (complete blood count), thyroid function tests, serum calcium, serum potassium, etc.

Abdominal X-rays are generally only performed if bowel obstruction is suspected, may reveal extensive impacted fecal matter in the colon, and may confirm or rule out other causes of similar symptoms.

Colonoscopy may be performed if an abnormality in the colon like a tumor is suspected. Other tests rarely ordered include anorectal manometry, anal sphincter electromyography, and defecography.

Colonic propagating pressure wave sequences (PSs) are responsible for discrete movements of the bowel contents and are vital for normal defecation. Deficiencies in PS frequency, amplitude, and extent of propagation are all implicated in severe defecatory dysfunction (SDD). Mechanisms that can normalize these aberrant motor patterns may help rectify the problem. Recently the novel therapy of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has been utilized for the treatment of severe constipation.

===Criteria===
The Rome III Criteria for functional constipation must include two or more of the following and present for the past three months, with symptoms starting for at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.
* Straining during defecation for at least 25% of bowel movements
* Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations
* Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations
* Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations
* Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations
* Fewer than 3 defecations per week
* Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives
* There are insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome

==Prevention==
Constipation is usually easier to prevent than to treat. Following the relief of constipation, maintenance with adequate exercise, fluid intake, and high-fiber diet is recommended.

==Treatment==
A limited number of cases require urgent medical intervention or will result in severe consequences.

The treatment of constipation should focus on the underlying cause if known. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) break constipation in adults into two categories: chronic constipation of unknown cause, and constipation due to opiates.

In chronic constipation of unknown cause, the main treatment involves the increased intake of water and fiber (either dietary or as supplements). The routine use of laxatives or enemas is discouraged, as having bowel movements may come to be dependent upon their use.

=== Fiber supplements ===
Soluble fiber supplements such as psyllium are generally considered first-line treatment for chronic constipation, compared to insoluble fibers such as wheat bran. Side effects of fiber supplements include bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and possible malabsorption of iron, calcium, and some medications. However, patients with opiate-induced constipation will likely not benefit from fiber supplements.

===Laxatives===
If laxatives are used, milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol are recommended as first-line agents due to their low cost and safety. Stimulants should only be used if this is not effective. In cases of chronic constipation, polyethylene glycol appears superior to lactulose. Prokinetics may be used to improve gastrointestinal motility. A number of new agents have shown positive outcomes in chronic constipation; these include prucalopride and lubiprostone. Cisapride is widely available in third world countries, but has been withdrawn in most of the west. It has not been shown to have a benefit on constipation, while potentially causing cardiac arrhythmias and deaths.

===Enemas===

Enemas can be used to provide a form of mechanical stimulation. A large volume or high enema can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces, and the solution administered commonly contains castile soap which irritates the colon&#x27;s lining resulting in increased urgency to defecate. However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.

===Physical intervention===
Constipation that resists the above measures may require physical intervention such as manual disimpaction (the physical removal of impacted stool using the hands; see fecal impaction).

===Regular exercise===
Regular exercise can help improve chronic constipation.

=== Surgical intervention ===
In refractory cases, procedures can be performed to help relieve constipation. Sacral nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to be effective in a minority of cases. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is another intervention performed only in patients known to have a slow colonic transit time and in whom a defecation disorder has either been treated or is not present. Because this is a major operation, side effects can include considerable abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, and post-surgical infections. Furthermore, it has a very variable rate of success and is very case dependent.

==Prognosis==
Complications that can arise from constipation include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal prolapse, and fecal impaction. Straining to pass stool may lead to hemorrhoids. In later stages of constipation, the abdomen may become distended, hard and diffusely tender. Severe cases (&quot;fecal impaction&quot; or &quot;malignant constipation&quot;) may exhibit symptoms of bowel obstruction (nausea, vomiting, tender abdomen) and encopresis, where soft stool from the small intestine bypasses the mass of impacted fecal matter in the colon.

==Epidemiology==
Constipation is the most common chronic gastrointestinal disorder in adults. Depending on the definition employed, it occurs in 2% to 20% of the population. It is more common in women, the elderly and children. Specifically constipation with no known cause affects females more often affected than males. The reasons it occurs more frequently in the elderly is felt to be due to an increasing number of health problems as humans age and decreased physical activity.
* 12% of the population worldwide reports having constipation.
* Chronic constipation accounts for 3% of all visits annually to pediatric outpatient clinics.
* Constipation-related health care costs total $6.9 billion in the US annually.
* More than four million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
* Around $725 million is spent on laxative products each year in America.

==History==
Since ancient times different societies have published medical opinions about how health care providers should respond to constipation in patients. In various times and places, doctors have made claims that constipation has all sorts of medical or social causes. Doctors in history have treated constipation in reasonable and unreasonable ways, including use of a spatula mundani.

After the advent of the germ theory of disease then the idea of &quot;auto-intoxication&quot; entered popular Western thought in a fresh way. Enema as a scientific medical treatment and colon cleansing as alternative medical treatment became more common in medical practice.

Since the 1700s in the West there has been some popular thought that people with constipation have some moral failing with gluttony or laziness.

==Special populations==
===Children===

Approximately 3% of children have constipation, with girls and boys being equally affected. With constipation accounting for approximately 5% of general pediatrician visits and 25% of pediatric gastroenterologist visits, the symptom carries a significant financial impact upon the healthcare system. While it is difficult to assess an exact age at which constipation most commonly arises, children frequently experience constipation in conjunction with life-changes. Examples include: toilet training, starting or transferring to a new school, and changes in diet. Especially in infants, changes in formula or transitioning from breast milk to formula can cause constipation. The majority of constipation cases are not tied to a medical disease, and treatment can be focused on simply relieving the symptoms.

===Postpartum women===
The six-week period after pregnancy is called the postpartum stage. During this time, women are at increased risk of being constipated. Multiple studies estimate the prevalence of constipation to be around 25% during the first 3 months. Constipation can cause discomfort for women, as they are still recovering from the delivery process especially if they have had a perineal tear or underwent an episiotomy. Risk factors that increase the risk of constipation in this population include:
* Damage to the levator ani muscles (pelvic floor muscles) during childbirth
* Forceps-assisted delivery
* Lengthy second stage of labor
* Delivering a large child
* Hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are common in pregnancy and also may get exacerbated when constipated. Anything that can cause pain with stooling (hemorrhoids, perineal tear, episiotomy) can lead to constipation because patients may withhold from having a bowel movement so as to avoid pain.

The pelvic floor muscles play an important role in helping pass a bowel movement. Injury to those muscles by some of the above risk factors (examples- delivering a large child, lengthy second stage of labor, forceps delivery) can result in constipation. Enemas may be administered during labor and these can also alter bowel movements in the days after giving birth. However, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of laxatives in this group of people.

<text>Laxatives, purgatives, or aperients are substances that loosen stools and increase bowel movements. They are used to treat and prevent constipation.

Laxatives vary as to how they work and the side effects they may have. Certain stimulant, lubricant, and saline laxatives are used to evacuate the colon for rectal and bowel examinations, and may be supplemented by enemas under certain circumstances. Sufficiently high doses of laxatives may cause diarrhea. Some laxatives combine more than one active ingredient, and may be administered orally or rectally.

==Types==

===Bulk-forming agents===
Bulk-forming laxatives, also known as roughage, are substances, such as fiber in food and hydrophilic agents in over-the-counter drugs, that add bulk and water to stools so they can pass more easily through the intestines (lower part of the digestive tract).

Properties
* Site of action: small and large intestines
* Onset of action: 12–72 hours
* Examples: dietary fiber, Metamucil, Citrucel, FiberCon
Bulk-forming agents generally have the gentlest of effects among laxatives, making them ideal for long-term maintenance of regular bowel movements.

====Dietary fiber====
Foods that help with laxation include fiber-rich foods. Dietary fiber includes insoluble fiber and soluble fiber, such as:
* Fruits, such as bananas, though this depends on their ripeness, kiwifruits, prunes, apples (with skin), pears (with skin), and raspberries
* Vegetables, such as broccoli, string beans, kale, spinach, cooked winter squash, cooked taro and poi, cooked peas, and baked potatoes (with skin)
* Whole grains
* Bran products
* Nuts
* Legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils

===Emollient agents (stool softeners)===
Emollient laxatives, also known as stool softeners, are anionic surfactants that enable additional water and fats to be incorporated in the stool, making movement through the bowels easier.

Properties
* Site of action: small and large intestines
* Onset of action: 12–72 hours
* Examples: Docusate (Colace, Diocto), Gibs-Eze

Emollient agents prevent constipation rather than treating long-term constipation.

===Lubricant agents===
Lubricant laxatives are substances that coat the stool with slippery lipids and decrease colonic absorption of water so the stool slides through the colon more easily. Lubricant laxatives also increase the weight of stool and decrease intestinal transit time.

Properties

* Site of action: colon
* Onset of action: 6–8 hours
* Example: mineral oil

Mineral oils, such as liquid paraffin, are generally the only nonprescription lubricant laxative available, but due to the risk of lipid pneumonia resulting from accidental aspiration, mineral oil is not recommended, especially in children and infants. Mineral oil may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and some minerals.

===Hyperosmotic agents===

Hyperosmotic laxatives cause the intestines to hold more water, creating an osmotic gradient, which adds more pressure and stimulates bowel movement.

Properties

* Site of action: colon
* Onset of action: 12–72 hours (oral), 0.25–1 hour (rectal)
* Examples: glycerin suppositories (Hallens), sorbitol, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol (PEG - Colyte, MiraLax)

Lactulose works by the osmotic effect, which retains water in the colon; lowering the pH through bacterial fermentation to lactic, formic, and acetic acids; and increasing colonic peristalsis. Lactulose is also indicated in portal-systemic encephalopathy. Glycerin suppositories work mostly by hyperosmotic action, but the sodium stearate in the preparation also causes local irritation to the colon.

Solutions of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes (sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and sometimes sodium sulfate) are used for whole bowel irrigation, a process designed to prepare the bowel for surgery or colonoscopy and to treat certain types of poisoning. Brand names for these solutions include GoLytely, GlycoLax, Cosmocol, CoLyte, Miralax, Movicol, NuLytely, Suprep, and Fortrans. Solutions of sorbitol (SoftLax) have similar effects.

===Saline laxative agents===
Saline laxatives are nonabsorbable, osmotically active substances that attract and retain water in the intestinal lumen, increasing intraluminal pressure that mechanically stimulates evacuation of the bowel. Magnesium-containing agents also cause the release of cholecystokinin, which increases intestinal motility and fluid secretion. Saline laxatives may alter a patient&#x27;s fluid and electrolyte balance.

Properties
* Site of action: small and large intestines
* Onset of action: 0.5–3 hours (oral), 2–15 minutes (rectal)
* Examples: sodium phosphate (and variants), magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia), and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt)

===Stimulant agents===
Stimulant laxatives are substances that act on the intestinal mucosa or nerve plexus, altering water and electrolyte secretion. They also stimulate peristaltic action and can be dangerous under certain circumstances.

Properties
* Site of action: colon
* Onset of action: 6–10 hours
* Examples: senna, bisacodyl

Prolonged use of stimulant laxatives can create drug dependence by damaging the colon&#x27;s haustral folds, making users less able to move feces through their colon on their own. A study of patients with chronic constipation found that 28% of chronic stimulant laxative users lost haustral folds over the course of one year, while none of the control group did.

===Miscellaneous===
Castor oil is a glyceride that is hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to ricinoleic acid, which produces laxative action by an unknown mechanism.

Properties
* Site of action: colon, small intestine (see below) 
* Onset of action: 2–6 hours
* Examples: castor oil

Long-term use of castor oil may result in loss of fluid, electrolytes, and nutrients.

===Serotonin agonist===
These are motility stimulants that work through activation of 5-HT4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. However, some have been discontinued or restricted due to potentially harmful cardiovascular side effects.

Tegaserod (brand name Zelnorm) was removed from the general U.S. and Canadian markets in 2007, due to reports of increased risks of heart attack or stroke. It is still available to physicians for patients in emergency situations that are life-threatening or require hospitalization.

Prucalopride (brand name Resolor) is a current drug approved for use in the EU since October 15, 2009, in Canada (brand name Resotran) since December 7, 2011, and in the United States since December 2018.

===Chloride channel activators===
Lubiprostone is used in the management of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. It causes the intestines to produce a chloride-rich fluid secretion that softens the stool, increases motility, and promotes spontaneous bowel movements.

==Comparison of available agents==
===Effectiveness===
For adults, a randomized controlled trial found PEG (MiraLax or GlycoLax) 17 grams once per day to be superior to tegaserod at 6 mg twice per day. A randomized controlled trial found greater improvement from two sachets (26 g) of PEG versus two sachets (20 g) of lactulose. 17 g per day of PEG has been effective and safe in a randomized, controlled trial for six months. Another randomized, controlled trial found no difference between sorbitol and lactulose.

For children, PEG was found to be more effective than lactulose.

==Problems with use==

===Laxative abuse===
Some of the less significant adverse effects of laxative abuse include dehydration (which causes tremors, weakness, fainting, blurred vision, kidney damage), low blood pressure, fast heart rate, postural dizziness and fainting; however, laxative abuse can lead to potentially fatal acid-base, and electrolyte imbalances. For example, severe hypokalaemia has been associated with distal renal tubular acidosis from laxative abuse. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base imbalance observed. Other significant adverse effects include rhabdomyolysis, steatorrhoea, inflammation and ulceration of colonic mucosa, pancreatitis, kidney failure, factitious diarrhea and other problems. The colon will need more quantities of laxatives to keep functioning, this will result in a lazy colon, infections, irritable bowel syndrome, and potential liver damage.

Although some patients with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa abuse laxatives in an attempt to lose weight, laxatives act to speed up the transit of feces through the large intestine, which occurs after the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine is already complete. Thus, studies of laxative abuse have found that effects on body weight reflect primarily temporary losses of body water rather than energy (calorie) loss.

===Laxative gut===
Physicians warn against the chronic use of stimulant laxatives due to concern that chronic use could cause the colonic tissues to get worn out over time and not be able to expel feces due to long-term overstimulation. A common finding in patients having used stimulant laxatives is a brown pigment deposited in the intestinal tissue, known as melanosis coli.

==Historical and health fraud uses==
Laxatives, once called &quot;physicks&quot; or &quot;purgatives&quot;, were used extensively in historic medicine to treat many conditions for which they are now generally regarded as ineffective in evidence-based medicine. Likewise, laxatives (often termed colon cleanses) may be promoted in alternative medicine for various conditions of quackery, such as &quot;mucoid plaque&quot;.

<doc id="168528" wikidata="Q549793" url="?curid=168528" title="Halloumi">
<text>Halloumi or haloumi is a cheese that originated in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is made from a mixture of goat&#x27;s and sheep&#x27;s milk, and sometimes also cow&#x27;s milk. Its texture is described as squeaky. It has a high melting point and so can easily be fried or grilled, a property that makes it a popular meat substitute. Rennet (mostly vegetarian or microbial) is used to curdle the milk in halloumi production, although no acid-producing bacteria are used in its preparation.

Halloumi is popular throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. By 2013, demand in the United Kingdom had surpassed that in every other European country except Cyprus.

In the United States, &quot;Halloumi&quot; is a registered trademark owned by the government of Cyprus, while in the UK it is owned by the Foundation for the Protection of the Traditional Cheese of Cyprus named Halloumi. It is also protected as a geographical indication in the EU, as a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), which means within the EU only products made in certain parts of Cyprus can be called &quot;halloumi&quot;. PDO protection for Halloumi was delayed largely by disagreements among farmers of cattle, sheep, and goats regarding the inclusion of cows&#x27; milk, and (if cows&#x27; milk was included) the proportion of it.

==Etymology==
The English name &quot;halloumi&quot; is derived from Modern , , from Cypriot Maronite Arabic , ultimately from Egyptian .

The Egyptian Arabic word is itself a loanword from Coptic (Sahidic) and (Bohairic), and was used for cheese eaten in medieval Egypt. The name of the cheese likely goes back to the Demotic word &quot;ḥlm&quot; attested in manuscripts and ostraca from 2nd-century Roman Egypt.

The Cypriot Turkish name derives from this source, as does the name of the different modern Egyptian cheese .

==History==

A recipe for enhancing () by brining is found in the 14th-century Egyptian cookbook ().

The earliest known surviving descriptions of halloumi in Cyprus were recorded in the mid-16th century by Italian visitors to Cyprus, where it is often said to have originated. However, the question of whether the recipe for the quintessential halloumi was born in Cyprus and then travelled to Lebanon and the rest of the Levant, or whether the basic techniques of making cheese that resists melting evolved over time in various parts of the eastern Mediterranean—or both—does not have a definitive answer.

Traditionally, Cypriot halloumi was made from sheep and/or goat&#x27;s milk, since there were few cows on the island until they were brought over by the British in the 20th century. But as demand grew, industrial cheese-makers began using more of the cheaper and more plentiful cow&#x27;s milk.

==Overview and preparation==

Although it can be consumed raw, halloumi is often used in cooking and can be fried until brown (without melting) due to its higher-than-typical melting point. This makes it an excellent cheese for frying or grilling (as in saganaki) and serving either as is, or with vegetables, or as an ingredient in salads or sandwiches. There are many recipes that use halloumi beyond simple grilling.

Traditional halloumi is a semicircular shape, weighing . The fat content is approximately 25% wet weight, 47% dry weight with about 17% protein. Its firm texture when cooked causes it to squeak on the teeth when being chewed.

Traditional halloumi is typically made from fresh, unpasteurised sheep and/or goat&#x27;s milk. However, for its commercial production a mixture of pasteurized sheep, goat and occasionally cow&#x27;s milk is used (with the cow&#x27;s milk making up the lowest proportion of the milk used, if used at all).

Two main types of halloumi exist: fresh and mature. Fresh halloumi has a semi-hard, elastic texture and a milder, less salty flavor compared to the aged version. As mature halloumi is stored in brine it has a harder, drier texture, as well as a saltier flavor. Both versions have a slight minty flavor, due to the addition of spearmint during the production of the cheese.

Sealed, halloumi (both fresh and mature) can last in a refrigerator for as long as a year.

== Production ==
Production of halloumi cheese involves several key steps.

The first step of halloumi production involves the coagulation of the milk in order to make curds. This occurs by stirring rennet into the milk mixture while keeping it at a temperature of 30–34 °C until the milk coagulates (a process which takes approximately 30–45 minutes). Once the curd is formed it is then cut, reheated and stirred in order to increase its firmness. The curds are then added to special molds and pressed until a sufficient amount of whey has been removed.

The next step of production involves the boiling of the pressed curds in hot whey (collected during the pressing of the curds) for at least 30 minutes, during a process known as scalding. This is the most crucial step in the halloumi production as it contributes to the characteristic texture of the cheese. The cooked pieces are then removed from the whey and are salted and garnished with fresh or dried mint (&quot;Mentha viridis&quot;) leaves. They are then folded and stored in salted whey for 1–3 days before being packed in airtight containers, ready to be sold and consumed.

For the production of mature halloumi, the cheese needs to be kept in the brine whey for at least 40 days.

<doc id="168531" wikidata="Q2704236" url="?curid=168531" title="The Age of Plastic">
<text>The Age of Plastic is the debut album by the English new wave duo the Buggles, first released on 10 January 1980 on Island Records. It is a concept album about the possible repercussions of modern technology. The title was conceived from the group&#x27;s intention of being a &quot;plastic group&quot; and the album was produced in the wake of the success of their debut record, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; (1979), which topped the UK Singles Chart. Most of the album&#x27;s other tracks were written during promotion of the single.

The album was recorded on a budget of £60,000. Bassist Trevor Horn was chiefly inspired by Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and sought unconventional recording methods for &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;. Keyboardist Geoff Downes characterised the album as &quot;science fiction music ... like modern psychedelic music ... very futuristic.&quot; Several tracks also featured contributions from vocalist Bruce Woolley, who left the group mid-production. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin&#x27;s Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.

&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; reached number 27 on the UK Albums Chart amid a mixed critical reception. Its three subsequent singles, &quot;The Plastic Age&quot;, &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; and &quot;Elstree&quot;, charted in the UK, reaching number 16, 38 and 55 respectively. &quot;Classic Pop&quot; magazine called it the 99th best album of the 1980s, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine the 45th-best new wave album of all-time. A September 2010 performance at the Ladbroke Grove&#x27;s Supperclub in Notting Hill, London marked the first time that the group performed the album in its entirety.

==Background==

Geoff Downes formed the Buggles in 1977 in Wimbledon, South West London with Trevor Horn and Bruce Woolley. The trio had recorded rough demos of early compositions such as &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; and &quot;On TV&quot;, a track later included on their second album, &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot;. Talking about the formation of the Buggles, Downes said about the demos: 


The Buggles were signed to Island Records, who gave Horn and Downes recording and publishing contracts. The group started recording their first studio album in the first half of 1979. Although Woolley was originally intended to be the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, he left the group during the sessions to form his own band, the Camera Club, who also recorded versions of &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; and &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, songs that appeared on their 1979 album &quot;English Garden&quot;. When &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; became a huge commercial success, Horn and Downes realized that they needed to record more material to fill out a full album, so they wrote additional songs, during the promotion of the single, while in airport lounges, dressing rooms, rehearsal rooms and studios.

==Production==

&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; was afforded a budget of £60,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Engineer Hugh Padgham recorded the backing tracks at Virgin&#x27;s Town House in West London, as Sarm East Studios was very small and Horn wanted to record real drums. The Buggles went to London&#x27;s Wardour Street to recruit two women to appear on the album. The mixing and Horn&#x27;s vocal recording were later performed at Sarm East Studios, and mixing was finished before Christmas 1979 for a 1980 album release. Sarm East mixer Gary Langan used a 40-input Trident TSM console to record and mix the album, which was housed inside the same control room as were two Studer A80 24-track machines and outboard gear that included an EMT 140 echo plate, Eventide digital delay, Eventide phaser, Marshall Time Modulator, Kepex noise gates, Urei and Orban equalizers, and Urei 1176, Dbx 160 and UA LA2 and LA3 compressors.

Vocals were recorded at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine and other various machines and boxes that were synced to the tracks. As Langan recalls: &quot;In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push what we had to the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process.&quot; Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs was an issue because of the limited storage capacities of the time: &quot;We&#x27;d make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we&#x27;d erase.&quot;

==Style and composition==

Unable to make the album sound similar to others of the late 1970s, Horn &quot;figured that if I couldn&#x27;t get records to sound like Elton John, which I couldn&#x27;t because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how they did it, then whatever I could do, I&#x27;d better exaggerate it.&quot; He had also wanted to &quot;perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds.&quot; &quot;Audio&quot; noted that the album&#x27;s sound was reminiscent of duo Godley &amp; Creme&#x27;s debut album &quot;Consequences&quot;.

Some music reviewers have labeled &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; as the first landmark of another electropop era. In his book &quot;Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s&quot;, Theo Cateforis writes that the album&#x27;s title and the songs &quot;I Love You (Miss Robot)&quot; and &quot;Astroboy&quot; &quot;picture the arrival of the 1980s as a novelty era of playful futurism.&quot; In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as &quot;science fiction music. It&#x27;s like modern psychedelic music. It&#x27;s very futuristic.&quot; Multiple music journalists have described it as a mixture of synthpop and new wave music, with elements of disco, punk, progressive rock and pop music from the 1960s. The album was also influenced by groups such as 10cc, ELO and Kraftwerk.

Downes and &quot;Krinein Magazine&quot; noted the tracks&#x27; instrumentations of guitars, bass guitar, drums, vocoded, robotic and female vocals, and synthesizers used to emulate orchestral instruments, and well as compositional elements of a variety of complex builds. Downes has said that he used five synthesizers in making &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;, which were used to &quot;fake up things and to provide effects we won&#x27;t use them in the manner that somebody like John Foxx does.&quot; According to Horn: &quot;We used about three different drummers including one [Richard James Burgess] from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from the Rubettes, who&#x27;s really good. We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved. Apart from that, we did everything ourselves.&quot; Downes claimed to have used George Shearing&#x27;s trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs.

==Themes==

&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; is a tragicomic concept album with lyrical themes of intense nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. The lyrics, which were written by Trevor Horn, were inspired by the works of J. G. Ballard. The Buggles have claimed that they were necessarily a &quot;plastic group&quot; to meet the needs of a &quot;plastic age&quot;, explaining the album&#x27;s title, &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;. Downes has said that the lyrics were &quot;trying to make cynical comments on a number of issues.&quot; Eight tracks are included on &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;: &quot;Living in the Plastic Age&quot;, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, &quot;Kid Dynamo&quot;, &quot;I Love You (Miss Robot)&quot;, &quot;Clean, Clean&quot;, &quot;Elstree&quot;, &quot;Astroboy (And the Proles on Parade)&quot; and &quot;Johnny (on the Monorail)&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrical concept was compared by &quot;Orange Coast&quot; magazine to that of the works of Canadian progressive rock band Klaatu.

&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star,&quot; the second track, refers to a period of technological change in the 1960s, the desire to remember the past and the disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past. The fast-paced third song, &quot;Kid Dynamo,&quot; is about the effects of media on a futuristic kid of the 1980s. Of the album&#x27;s fourth track, &quot;I Love You (Miss Robot)&quot;, Downes has said it is about &quot;being on the road and making love to someone you don&#x27;t really like, while all the time you&#x27;re wanting to phone someone who&#x27;s a long way off.&quot; &quot;Wave Maker&quot; magazine viewed the song as &quot;a darkly soothing, bass guitar-driven ballad which brings us back into cyberpunk country.&quot;

&quot;Clean, Clean&quot; is the album&#x27;s fifth track, and follows the story of a young boy who grows out of being a gangster, and, despite not willing to do so, will at least try to keep the fighting clean. &quot;Wave Maker&quot; found &quot;Elstree,&quot; the album&#x27;s sixth song, as lyrically similar to &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star,&quot; as it follows &quot;a failed actor taking up a more regular position behind the scenes and looking back at his life in regret.&quot; The slow-tempo ballad &quot;Astroboy (And the Proles on Parade)&quot;, according to &quot;Wave Maker&quot;, &quot;once again revisits cyberpunk with a much lighter vibe, although the keyboards do occasionally border darker realms, with the post-chorus hook,&quot; and the album closer &quot;Johnny on the Monorail&quot; has a &quot;pop atmosphere&quot; that &quot;better suits the flow of the rest of the album.&quot;
==Release==
&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; was first released in Australia on 10 January 1980, and in the United Kingdom on 8 February the same year. Initially, songs from &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; were played on English radio stations from 31 December 1979, and two advertisements for the album were also released. On 1 February 1980, Hans Zimmer filed an injunction to the High Court of Justice threatening to take the album off store shelves for not being credited, but was it rejected; Zimmer didn&#x27;t play any instrument and only programmed the sequencer and a few Prophet V sounds. &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; appeared on the UK Albums Chart for six weeks, reaching number 27 on the chart. The album debuted at number 32 in Norway, eventually reaching number 23, and peaked at number 24 in Sweden. It also reached the number 15 spot on the French Albums Chart and number 35 in Japan.

Lead single &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, released months earlier, was commercially successful, topping the record charts in 16 countries, including the UK Singles Chart. From January to October 1980, three more singles were issued in support of the album: &quot;Living in the Plastic Age&quot;, &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; and &quot;Elstree&quot;. All of the singles had chart success in the UK, with &quot;The Plastic Age&quot; and &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; gaining chart success on an international level.

A &quot;Trouser Press&quot; writer recalled that &quot;&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; was a disappointment to fans of the Buggles&#x27; cogent 45s ... technically stunning, reasonably catchy and crashingly hollow.&quot; Upon release, Betty Page from &quot;Sounds&quot; commented that the group &quot;stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a skein of well-chewed bubblegum.&quot; Dave Marsh and John Swenson, writing for &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; (1983), opined that &quot;aside from the wonderful &#x27;Video Killed the Radio Star&#x27; — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material&quot;, the album was &quot;high-tech dreck.&quot; Conversely, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; noted that the album is &quot;all jerky twitchings and absurdly inflated post-punk melodrama&quot; and named it as &quot;essential.&quot; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;&#x27;s Keith Gosman found the production excellent and said the album sounded &quot;crisp as fresh dollar bills.&quot; &quot;Smash Hits&quot; rated the album 8 out of 10 and called the &quot;electronic and futuristic flavouring&quot; of the album &quot;quite human and therefore the most enjoyable of the lot.&quot;, including &quot;lots of energy, well constructed, imaginative and above all a set of GREAT TUNES throughout&quot;.

==Retrospective reviews==
Among retrospective reviews, Jeri Montesano from AllMusic described it as &quot;a fun record that doesn&#x27;t need to be taken too seriously&quot; and that &quot;it would be difficult to find a record from this era that sounds half as good. Pop rarely reaches these heights.&quot; While reviewing the Buggles&#x27; second album, Montesano stated that both albums &quot;still sound fresh&quot; compared to 1990s pop music. Amazon editorial reviewer Grant Alden also compared the album to 1990s pop, and labelled the group as &quot;Part of the early-1980s great explosion of pop music [...] to have any real impact.&quot;

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; described the LP as &quot;one of the best examples of the decade&#x27;s characteristically disposable pop&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot; named it one of the &quot;8 Essentials of Post-Kraftwerk Pop.&quot; Napster&#x27;s Nicholas Baker liked the album&#x27;s composition and concluded that &quot;this LP is not so much a guilty pleasure as an essential point in electropop history.&quot; &quot;Metro Pulse&quot;&#x27;s Anthony Nownes found the tunes &quot;punchy, memorable&quot; and &quot;accessible&quot;, concluding his review with &quot;If all rock records sounded like this—shiny and slick and highly processed—the world would be terrible. But a few Trevor Horns—people who use studio technology the way a curious and playful child uses a room full of fictile toys—are nice to have around.&quot;

Less favourably, Joseph Stannard opined that &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; &quot;sounds like unfinished business, a series of good ideas in need of elaboration.&quot; In a review of the album&#x27;s 1999 reissue, Richard Wallace of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; wrote that the record &quot;shows how [The Buggles] pioneered the synth-led nonsense which fused much of the decade&#x27;s pop, but had little creative imagination. That bombastic electro-sound became [Trevor] Horn&#x27;s trademark as a producer. Skip it.&quot; Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;awful beyond measure&quot;, pointing to the liner notes conceding that &quot;we did not have an album&#x27;s worth of material&quot; and called reissuing it &quot;wasteful, it&#x27;s stupid.&quot;

==Legacy and influence==

Popular French bands such as Justice, Daft Punk and Phoenix have been influenced by &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;. Justice has said that they were &quot;totally fascinated by The Buggles&#x27; first album [&quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;]. It&#x27;s full of stuff we like - there&#x27;s a bit of electro, a bit of pop, a bit of classical going on there... We like the way they operated too, as an autonomous duo...&quot;

In 2000, as part of the &quot;Island Remasters&quot; series, the album was reissued with three bonus tracks, &quot;Technopop&quot;, &quot;Island&quot; and &quot;Johnny on the Monorail (A Very Different Version)&quot;. The album was remastered and re-released again on 24 February 2010 in Japan. The new edition included nine additional tracks, three of which were from the 2000 re-release album. A single and special DJ version of &quot;Elstree&quot; also appeared on the 2010 reissue of the album, as well as a 12&quot; version of &quot;Clean, Clean&quot;. The album&#x27;s 2010 reissue briefly appeared at number 225 in Japan.

On 28 September 2010, the Buggles reunited to play their first full-length live performance of the album. The event was billed as &quot;The Lost Gig&quot; and took place at Ladbroke Grove&#x27;s Supperclub in Notting Hill, London. It was a fundraiser with all earnings going to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability. With the exception of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and &quot;The Plastic Age&quot;, which the band had previously played together, &quot;The Lost Gig&quot; saw the first live performances of all of the remaining songs from &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;.

<text>William McChord Hurt (March 20, 1950 – March 13, 2022) was an American actor. For his performances on stage and screen, he has received various awards including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, in addition to nominations for five Golden Globe Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award.

Hurt studied at the Juilliard School before his film debut, in Ken Russell&#x27;s science-fiction feature &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. He went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor playing a gay prisoner in &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1985). He was Oscar-nominated for &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986), and &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), and &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005). He starred in films such as &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981), &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988), &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), &quot;One True Thing&quot; (1998), &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; (2007) &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Yellow Handkerchief&quot; (2008). He portrayed Thaddeus Ross in five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films starting with &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008) and concluding with &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021).

On television, he received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series playing a scientist in the FX legal drama &quot;Damages&quot; (2009) and for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his portrayal of Henry Paulson in the HBO movie &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; (2011). He later acted in the legal drama series &quot;Goliath&quot; (2016–2021) and the thriller series &quot;Condor&quot; (2018–2020).

On stage, Hurt appeared in off-Broadway productions of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1975), and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1982) as well as Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fifth of July&quot; (1978). He made his Broadway debut in David Rabe&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; (1984) playing a Hollywood casting director, for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

== Early life and education ==
Hurt was born on March 20, 1950, in Washington, D.C., to Claire Isabel (née McGill; 1923–1971), who worked for Time Inc., and Alfred McChord Hurt (1910–1996), who worked for the United States Agency for International Development and the State Department. He had two brothers. With his father, he lived in Lahore, Mogadishu, and Khartoum. His parents divorced and, in 1960, his mother married Henry Luce III (1925–2005), a son of publisher Henry Luce.

Hurt attended the Middlesex School, where he was vice-president of the Dramatics Club and had the lead role in several school plays. He graduated in 1968 and his yearbook predicted, &quot;you might even see him on Broadway.&quot; Hurt attended Tufts University and studied theology, but turned instead to acting and joined the Juilliard School (Drama Division &quot;Group 5&quot;: 1972–1976).

== Career ==
=== 1977–1989: Early roles and stardom ===

Hurt began his career in stage productions. From 1977 to 1989, he was a member of the acting company at Circle Repertory Company. He won an Obie Award for his debut appearance there in Corinne Jacker&#x27;s &quot;My Life&quot;, and won a 1978 Theatre World Award for his performances in &quot;Fifth of July&quot;, &quot;Ulysses in Traction&quot;, and &quot;Lulu&quot;. In 1979, Hurt played Hamlet under the direction of Marshall W. Mason opposite Lindsay Crouse and Beatrice Straight. His first major film role was in the science-fiction film &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), where his performance as an obsessed scientist gained him wide recognition. His performance opposite newcomer Kathleen Turner in Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) elevated Hurt to stardom. Kasdan and he became frequent collaborators: Hurt co-starred in Kasdan&#x27;s acclaimed comedy-dramas &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988), both of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and he later had a supporting role in the ensemble comedy &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990).

In the 1980s, Hurt received three consecutive Academy Award nominations for Best Actor, beginning with an Oscar win for his turn as a prisoner in Hector Babenco&#x27;s drama &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; in 1985. He also received the Best Male Performance Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for this role. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Hurt won a well-deserved best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for a performance that is crafty at first, carefully nurtured and finally stirring in profound, unanticipated ways... What starts out as a campy, facetious catalog of Hollywood trivia becomes an extraordinarily moving film about manhood, heroism and love.&quot;

Hurt subsequently received Best Actor Oscar nominations for playing a speech teacher at a school for the deaf who falls for a deaf custodian in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986) and for playing a dim-witted television news anchor in &quot;Broadcast News&quot; the following year. &quot;Broadcast News&quot;, a romantic comedy directed by James L. Brooks, would come to be Hurt&#x27;s most acclaimed film, with an inclusion to the National Film Registry in the Library of Congress in 2018. After this run of prominent roles in the 1980s he appeared in the thriller &quot;Gorky Park&quot; (1983) opposite Lee Marvin. 

=== 1990–2007: Career fluctuations ===
Hurt began to appear more frequently in supporting roles. Some of his notable roles include performances in &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998), &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (1999), &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (2002), &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005), and &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005). Hurt&#x27;s fourth career Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor, would come in 2006 for playing a powerful crime boss in &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005), despite less than 10 minutes of screen time, he received an Academy Award nomination. 

Other later film roles included &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007), &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; (2007), Hurt had several roles in television and theater. Hurt starred in the Sci Fi Channel miniseries adaptation &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; in 2000, playing Duke Leto Atreides; it was one of Syfy&#x27;s highest-rated series ever. He was in the miniseries adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;, in a piece titled &quot;Battleground&quot; (known for its complete lack of dialogue). He appeared in the cast of &quot;Vanya&quot;, an adaptation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, at the Artists Repertory Theatre in Portland, Oregon. 

=== 2008–2021: MCU films and television work ===
In June 2007, Marvel Studios announced that Hurt would portray General Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross in the 2008 film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; alongside Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth. Hurt reprised his role in four additional Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films: &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), and &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021). Harrison Ford would then take over the role of Ross after Hurt&#x27;s death in &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot; (2025). During this time he acted in &quot;Vantage Point&quot; (2008), &quot;The Yellow Handkerchief&quot; (2008), and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010).

In 2009, Hurt became a series regular on the FX series &quot;Damages&quot; playing a corporate whistleblower opposite Glenn Close and Marcia Gay Harden. For his role in the series, he earned a 2009 Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. In September 2010, Hurt played United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson in the HBO film &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot;, an adaptation of Andrew Ross Sorkin&#x27;s book. He also starred as Captain Ahab in the 2011 television adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. Hurt was set to play Gregg Allman in the film &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;, but he left the production after an on-set accident.

In 2018, Hurt was cast as the lead in &quot;The Coldest Game&quot; (2019), but after he was injured in an off-set accident, he was replaced by Bill Pullman. In one of his final roles, Hurt played opposite F. Murray Abraham in a standalone episode of &quot;Mythic Quest&quot; in 2021. Hurt had been set to appear in the series &quot;Pantheon&quot; and films &quot;The Fence&quot;, &quot;Men of Granite&quot;, and &quot;Edward Enderby&quot; before his death in March 2022, though he ultimately only appeared in &quot;Pantheon&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
Hurt was married to actress Mary Beth Hurt (née Supinger) from 1971 to 1982, and to Heidi Henderson from 1989 to 1993. Hurt had four children: one with Sandra Jennings; two with Henderson; and one with French actress, film director, and screenwriter Sandrine Bonnaire.

In 1981, while he was still married, Hurt and Sandra Jennings began a relationship in Saratoga Springs, New York. Jennings became pregnant in the spring of 1982, which was followed by Hurt&#x27;s divorce from Mary Beth, after which Hurt and Jennings relocated to South Carolina, a state that recognized non-ceremonial common-law marriages. Hurt and Jennings never held a marriage ceremony and later separated.

Hurt was a private pilot and owner of a Beechcraft Bonanza. He was fluent in French and maintained a home outside Paris.

Hurt and Marlee Matlin had a relationship for two years, which included living together.

=== Domestic violence allegations ===
Hurt&#x27;s girlfriend Sandra Jennings sued Hurt in New York, seeking recognition of their relationship as a common-law marriage under South Carolina law. The New York court held that the relationship between Hurt and Jennings did not qualify as a common-law marriage under South Carolina law and found in Hurt&#x27;s favor that no marriage existed. During Jennings&#x27; lawsuit against Hurt, she alleged that Hurt subjected her to physical and verbal abuse. His spokesperson denied that Hurt ever beat Jennings.

In her 2009 autobiography &quot;I&#x27;ll Scream Later&quot;, Marlee Matlin said that their relationship involved drug use and physical violence from Hurt, including a rape. In response to the accusations aired on CNN on April 13, 2009, Hurt&#x27;s agent declined to respond, but Hurt issued a statement the following day that his &quot;own recollection is that we both apologized and both did a great deal to heal our lives. Of course, I did and do apologize for any pain I caused. And I know we have both grown. I wish Marlee and her family nothing but good.&quot;

In a 2022 essay for &quot;Variety&quot;, after Hurt had died, author Donna Kaz wrote about dating Hurt in their twenties, from 1977 to 1980. She accused Hurt of domestic abuse in the article.

==Death and tributes==
Hurt died on March 13, 2022, at his Portland, Oregon home from bone-metastasized terminal prostate cancer, with which he was diagnosed in May 2018. He was 71.

Many actors paid tribute to Hurt, including Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Dennis Quaid, Marg Helgenberger, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, John Goodman, Patton Oswalt, Albert Brooks, Bryce Dallas Howard, Maria Bello, Jonathan Frakes, Ben Stiller, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, Jeremy Renner, and Topher Grace.

<doc id="168536" wikidata="Q64513386" url="?curid=168536" title="Bulimia nervosa">
<text>Bulimia nervosa, also known simply as bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating (eating large quantities of food in a short period of time, often feeling out of control) followed by compensatory behaviors, such as vomiting, excessive exercise, or fasting to prevent weight gain.

Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at normal weight and have higher risk for other mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and problems with drugs to alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.
Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living in a culture that commercializes or glamorizes dieting, and having parental figures who fixate on weight are also risks.

Diagnosis is based on a person&#x27;s medical history; however, this is difficult, as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits. Further, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine–Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bulimia typically involves rapid and out-of-control eating, which is followed by self-induced vomiting or other forms of purging. This cycle may be repeated several times a week or, in more serious cases, several times a day and may directly cause:
* Dehydration 
* Electrolyte imbalance can lead to abnormal heart rhythms, cardiac arrest, and even death
* Oral trauma, lacerations to the lining of the mouth or throat due to forced throwing up movements. 
* Russell&#x27;s sign: calluses on knuckles and back of hands due to repeated trauma from incisors
* Swollen salivary glands (in the neck, under the jawline)
* Gastrointestinal problems, like constipation and acid reflux 
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Hypotension
* Infertility and/or irregular menstrual cycles
* Weight Fluctuations

These are some of the many signs that may indicate whether someone has bulimia nervosa:
* A fixation on the number of calories consumed
* A fixation on an extreme consciousness of one&#x27;s weight
* Low self-esteem and/or self-harming
* Suicidal tendencies
* An irregular menstrual cycle in women
* Regular trips to the bathroom, especially soon after eating
* Depression, anxiety disorders, and sleep disorders
* Frequent occurrences involving the consumption of abnormally large portions of food
* The use of laxatives, diuretics, and diet pills
* Compulsive or excessive exercise
* Unhealthy/dry skin, hair, nails, and lips
* Fatigue, or exhaustion

As with many psychiatric illnesses, delusions can occur, in conjunction with other signs and symptoms, leaving the person with a false belief that is not ordinarily accepted by others.

People with bulimia nervosa may also exercise to a point that excludes other activities.

=== Interoceptive ===

People with bulimia exhibit several interoceptive deficits, in which one experiences impairment in recognizing and discriminating between internal sensations, feelings, and emotions. People with bulimia may also react negatively to somatic and affective states. Regarding interoceptive sensation, hyposensitive individuals may not detect normal feelings of fullness at the appropriate time while eating, and are prone to eating more calories in a short period of time as a result of this decreased sensitivity.

Examining from a neural basis also connects elements of interoception and emotion; notable overlaps occur in the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, and anterior insula cortices, which are linked to both interoception and emotional eating.

===Related disorders===
People with bulimia are at a higher risk to have an affective disorder, such as depression or general anxiety disorder. One study found 70% had depression at some time in their lives (as opposed to 26% for adult females in the general population), rising to 88% for all affective disorders combined. Another study in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that of the population of patients that were diagnosed with an eating disorder according to the DSM-V guidelines about 27% also suffered from bipolar disorder. Within this article, the majority of the patients were diagnosed with bulimia nervosa, the second most common condition reported was binge-eating disorder. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit episodes of bulimic tendencies through purging (either through self-induced vomiting or laxatives) as a way to quickly remove food in their system. There may be an increased risk for diabetes mellitus type 2. Bulimia also has negative effects on a person&#x27;s teeth due to the acid passed through the mouth from frequent vomiting causing acid erosion, mainly on the posterior dental surface.

Research has shown that there is a relationship between bulimia and narcissism. According to a study by the Australian National University, eating disorders are more susceptible among vulnerable narcissists. This can be caused by a childhood in which inner feelings and thoughts were minimized by parents, leading to &quot;a high focus on receiving validation from others to maintain a positive sense of self&quot;.

The medical journal &quot;Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation&quot; notes that a &quot;substantial rate of patients with bulimia nervosa&quot; also have borderline personality disorder.

A study by the Psychopharmacology Research Program of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine &quot;leaves little doubt that bipolar and eating disorders—particularly bulimia nervosa and bipolar II disorder—are related.&quot; The research shows that most clinical studies indicate that patients with bipolar disorder have higher rates of eating disorders, and vice versa. There is overlap in phenomenology, course, comorbidity, family history, and pharmacologic treatment response of these disorders. This is especially true of &quot;eating dysregulation, mood dysregulation, impulsivity and compulsivity, craving for activity and/or exercise.&quot;

Studies have shown a relationship between bulimia&#x27;s effect on metabolic rate and caloric intake with thyroid dysfunction.

Scientific research has shown that people suffering from bulimia have decreased volumes of brain matter, and that the abnormalities are reversible after long-term recovery.

==Causes==

===Biological===

As with anorexia nervosa, there is evidence of genetic predispositions contributing to the onset of this eating disorder. Abnormal levels of many hormones, notably serotonin, have been shown to be responsible for some disordered eating behaviors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is under investigation as a possible mechanism.

There is evidence that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women and the onset of bulimia nervosa. Studies have shown that women with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome have a dysregulation of appetite, along with carbohydrates and fats. This dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa. There is evidence that there is an association between polymorphisms in the ERβ (estrogen receptor β) and bulimia, suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa.

Bulimia has been compared to drug addiction, though the empirical support for this characterization is limited. However, people with bulimia nervosa may share dopamine D2 receptor-related vulnerabilities with those with substance use disorders.

Dieting, a common behaviour in bulimics, is associated with lower plasma tryptophan levels. Decreased tryptophan levels in the brain, and thus the synthesis of serotonin, such as via acute tryptophan depletion, increases bulimic urges in currently and formerly bulimic individuals within hours.

Abnormal blood levels of peptides important for the regulation of appetite and energy balance are observed in individuals with bulimia nervosa, but it remains unknown if this is a state or trait.

In recent years, evolutionary psychiatry as an emerging scientific discipline has been studying mental disorders from an evolutionary perspective. If eating disorders, Bulimia nervosa in particular, have evolutionary functions or if they are new modern &quot;lifestyle&quot; problems is still debated.

===Social===

Media portrayals of an &#x27;ideal&#x27; body shape are widely considered to be a contributing factor to bulimia. In a 1991 study by Weltzin, Hsu, Pollicle, and Kaye, it was stated that 19% of bulimics undereat, 37% of bulimics eat an average or normal amount of food, and 44% of bulimics overeat. A survey of 15- to 18-year-old high school girls in Nadroga, Fiji, found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0% in 1995 (a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province) to 11.3% in 1998. In addition, the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population.

When attempting to decipher the origin of bulimia nervosa in a cognitive context, Christopher Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot;″s cognitive-behavioral model is often considered the golden standard. Fairburn et al.&#x27;s model discusses the process in which an individual falls into the binge-purge cycle and thus develops bulimia. Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot; argue that extreme concern with weight and shape coupled with low self-esteem will result in strict, rigid, and inflexible dietary rules. Accordingly, this would lead to unrealistically restricted eating, which may consequently induce an eventual &quot;slip&quot; where the individual commits a minor infraction of the strict and inflexible dietary rules. Moreover, the cognitive distortion due to dichotomous thinking leads the individual to binge. The binge subsequently should trigger a perceived loss of control, promoting the individual to purge in hope of counteracting the binge. However, Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot; assert the cycle repeats itself, and thus consider the binge-purge cycle to be self-perpetuating.

In contrast, Byrne and Mclean&#x27;s findings differed slightly from Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot;″s cognitive-behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in that the drive for thinness was the major cause of purging as a way of controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating that it is not a binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot;″s cognitive-behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Every one differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive-behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very culturally bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn &quot;et al.&quot;.&#x27;s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.

A considerable amount of literature has identified a correlation between sexual abuse and the development of bulimia nervosa. The reported incident rate of unwanted sexual contact is higher among those with bulimia nervosa than anorexia nervosa.

When exploring the etiology of bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective, the &quot;thin ideal internalization&quot; is significantly responsible. The thin-ideal internalization is the extent to which individuals adapt to the societal ideals of attractiveness. Studies have shown that young women that read fashion magazines tend to have more bulimic symptoms than those women who do not. This further demonstrates the impact of media on the likelihood of developing the disorder. Individuals first accept and &quot;buy into&quot; the ideals, and then attempt to transform themselves in order to reflect the societal ideals of attractiveness. J. Kevin Thompson and Eric Stice claim that family, peers, and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal, which may lead to an individual accepting and &quot;buying into&quot; the thin ideal. In turn, Thompson and Stice assert that if the thin ideal is accepted, one could begin to feel uncomfortable with their body shape or size since it may not necessarily reflect the thin ideal set out by society. Thus, people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness. Consequently, body dissatisfaction coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects, which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing. Binges lead to self-disgust which causes purging to prevent weight gain.

A study dedicated to investigating the thin ideal internalization as a factor of bulimia nervosa is Thompson&#x27;s and Stice&#x27;s research. Their study aimed to investigate how and to what degree media affects the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) dedicated to teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, to reduce thin-ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media&#x27;s control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin-ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media greatly affected the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed that it is not the thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.

==Diagnosis==
The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence, between 13 and 20 years of age, and many cases have previously experienced obesity, with many relapsing in adulthood into episodic bingeing and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. A lifetime prevalence of 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent for adults and adolescents, respectively, is estimated among the United States population. Bulimia nervosa may affect up to 1% of young women and, after 10 years of diagnosis, half will recover fully, a third will recover partially, and 10–20% will still have symptoms.

Adolescents with bulimia nervosa are more likely to have self-imposed perfectionism and compulsivity issues in eating compared to their peers. This means that the high expectations and unrealistic goals that these individuals set for themselves are internally motivated rather than by social views or expectations.

===Criteria===

Bulimia Nervosa is diagnosed using the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).&quot; The diagnostic criteria include the following:

* Recurrent episodes of binge eating 
* Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, like self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.
* The binge eating and compensatory behaviors both occur at least once a week for three months
* Self-evaluation is influenced by body shape and weight.

Other methods are also used to narrow down the diagnosis, such as physical exams (measuring height, weight, and vitals, or checking skin, nails, heart and lungs), or lab tests (for blood count, electrolytes, protein, or urinalysis).

==Treatment==
There are two main types of treatment given to those with bulimia nervosa; psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments.

===Psychotherapy===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. This approach focuses on helping patients identify and change distorted thought patterns related to eating, body image, and self worth

CBT helps patients identify and challenge the distorted thinking individuals might have about food, weight and body image. It also helps by offering the chance to identify the unhelpful thoughts about food and body image.

By using CBT people record how much food they eat and periods of vomiting with the purpose of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis, as a component of this therapy is food journaling. CBT is necessarily good for those with bulimia as it targets the binge-purge cycle, which is the hallmark of bulimia. People undergoing CBT who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run.

Researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy. These therapies have good outcomes for treating bulimia, especially in patients with emotional regulation difficulties or interpersonal issues. While these therapies are not as extensively research as CBT, they can be beneficial when integrated into a comprehensive treatment plan.

For adolescents, Family-Based therapy (FBT) has been identified as an effective treatment. FBT involes the family in the treatment process, where parents are empowered to take an active role in helping their child recover from bulimia nervosa. This approach is particularly helpful in younger patients who are still living with their families

The use of CBT has been shown to be quite effective for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost-efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent&#x27;s food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.

===Medication===
Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), are often prescribed to treat bulimia nervosa, especially when comorbid depression or anxiety disorders are present. However, medications alone are generally not sufficient and are typically used in conjunction with psychotherapy Compared to placebo, the use of a single antidepressant has been shown to be effective. Combining medication with counseling can improve outcomes in some circumstances. Some positive outcomes of treatments can include: abstinence from binge eating, a decrease in obsessive behaviors to lose weight and in shape preoccupation, less severe psychiatric symptoms, a desire to counter the effects of binge eating, as well as an improvement in social functioning and reduced relapse rates.

A combination of psychotherapy, especially CBT and pharmacological treatments, such as SSRIs, often lead to better outcomes for individuals with bulimia. Combining both approaches is particularly beneficial in severe or chronic cases, where behavioral modification and mood stabilization are crucial.

===Alternative medicine===
Some researchers have also claimed positive outcomes in hypnotherapy. &quot;The first use of hypnotherapy in Bulimic patients was in 1981. When it comes to hypnotherapy, Bulimic patients are easier to hypnotize than Anorexia Nervosa patients. In Bulimic patients, hypnotherapy focuses on learning self-control when it comes to binging and vomiting, strengthening stimulus control techniques, enhancing ones ego, improving weight control, and helping overweight patients see their body differently (have a different image).&quot;

=== Risk factors ===
Being female and having bulimia nervosa takes a toll on mental health. Women frequently reported an onset of anxiety at the same time of the onset of bulimia nervosa. The approximate female-to-male ratio of diagnosis is 10:1. In addition to cognitive, genetic, and environmental factors, childhood gastrointestinal problems and early pubertal maturation also increase the likelihood of developing bulimia nervosa. Another concern with eating disorders is developing a coexisting substance use disorder.

==Epidemiology==

There is little data on the percentage of people with bulimia in general populations. Most studies conducted thus far have been on convenience samples from hospital patients, high school or university students; research on bulimia nervosa among ethnic minorities has also been limited. Existing studies have yielded a wide range of results: between 0.1% and 1.4% of males, and between 0.3% and 9.4% of females. Studies on time trends in the prevalence of bulimia nervosa have also yielded inconsistent results. According to Gelder, Mayou and Geddes (2005) bulimia nervosa is prevalent between 1 and 2 percent of women aged 15–40 years. Bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities, with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas. There is a perception that bulimia is most prevalent amongst girls from middle-class families; however, in a 2009 study girls from families in the lowest income bracket studied were 153 percent more likely to be bulimic than girls from the highest income bracket. According to a study conducted in 2022 by Silen et al., which conglomerated statistics using various methods such as SCID, MRFS, EDE, SSAGA, and EDDI, the US, Finland, Australia, and the Netherlands had an estimated 2.1%, 2.4%, 1.0%, and 0.8% prevalence of bulimia nervosa among females under 30 years of age. This demonstrates the prevalence of bulimia nervosa in developed, Western, first-world countries, indicating an urgency in treating adolescent women. Additionally, these statistics may be misrepresentative of the true population affected with bulimia nervosa due to potential underreporting bias.

There are higher rates of eating disorders in groups involved in activities which idealize a slim physique, such as dance, gymnastics, modeling, cheerleading, running, acting, swimming, diving, rowing and figure skating. Bulimia is thought to be more prevalent among whites; however, a more recent study showed that African-American teenage girls were 50 percent more likely than white girls to exhibit bulimic behavior, including both binging and purging.

==History==

===Etymology===
The term &quot;bulimia&quot; comes from Greek &quot;boulīmia&quot;, &quot;ravenous hunger&quot;, a compound of βοῦς &quot;bous&quot;, &quot;ox&quot; and λιμός, &quot;līmos&quot;, &quot;hunger&quot;. Literally, the scientific name of the disorder, &quot;bulimia nervosa&quot;, translates to &quot;nervous ravenous hunger&quot;.

===Before the 20th century===
Although diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa did not appear until 1979, evidence suggests that binging and purging were popular in certain ancient cultures. The first documented account of behavior resembling bulimia nervosa was recorded in Xenophon&#x27;s Anabasis around 370 B.C, in which Greek soldiers purged themselves in the mountains of Asia Minor. It is unclear whether this purging was preceded by binging. In ancient Egypt, physicians recommended purging once a month for three days to preserve health. This practice stemmed from the belief that human diseases were caused by the food itself. In ancient Rome, elite society members would vomit to &quot;make room&quot; in their stomachs for more food at all-day banquets. Emperors Claudius and Vitellius both were gluttonous and obese, and they often resorted to habitual purging.

Historical records also suggest that some saints who developed anorexia (as a result of a life of asceticism) may also have displayed bulimic behaviors. Saint Mary Magdalen de Pazzi (1566–1607) and Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727) were both observed binge eating—giving in, as they believed, to the temptations of the devil. Saint Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) is known to have supplemented her strict abstinence from food by purging as reparation for her sins. Catherine died from starvation at age thirty-three.

While the psychological disorder &quot;bulimia nervosa&quot; is relatively new, the word &quot;bulimia&quot;, signifying overeating, has been present for centuries. The Babylon Talmud referenced practices of &quot;bulimia&quot;, yet scholars believe that this simply referred to overeating without the purging or the psychological implications bulimia nervosa. In fact, a search for evidence of bulimia nervosa from the 17th to late 19th century revealed that only a quarter of the overeating cases they examined actually vomited after the binges. There was no evidence of deliberate vomiting or an attempt to control weight.

===20th century===

Globally, bulimia was estimated to affect 3.6 million people in 2015. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world. Bulimia is about nine times more likely to occur in women than men. Among women, rates are highest in young adults. Bulimia was named and first described by the British psychiatrist Gerald Russell in 1979.

At the turn of the century, bulimia (overeating) was described as a clinical symptom, but rarely in the context of weight control. Purging, however, was seen in anorexic patients and attributed to gastric pain rather than another method of weight control.

In 1930, admissions of anorexia nervosa patients to the Mayo Clinic from 1917 to 1929 were compiled. Fifty-five to sixty-five percent of these patients were reported to be voluntarily vomiting to relieve weight anxiety. Records show that purging for weight control continued throughout the mid-1900s. Several case studies from this era reveal patients with the modern description of bulimia nervosa. In 1939, Rahman and Richardson reported that out of their six anorexic patients, one had periods of overeating, and another practiced self-induced vomiting. Wulff, in 1932, treated &quot;Patient D&quot;, who would have periods of intense cravings for food and overeat for weeks, which often resulted in frequent vomiting. Patient D, who grew up with a tyrannical father, was repulsed by her weight and would fast for a few days, rapidly losing weight. Ellen West, a patient described by Ludwig Binswanger in 1958, was teased by friends for being fat and excessively took thyroid pills to lose weight, later using laxatives and vomiting. She reportedly consumed dozens of oranges and several pounds of tomatoes each day, yet would skip meals. After being admitted to a psychiatric facility for depression, Ellen ate ravenously yet lost weight, presumably due to self-induced vomiting. However, while these patients may have met modern criteria for bulimia nervosa, they cannot technically be diagnosed with the disorder, as it had not yet appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders at the time of their treatment.

An explanation for the increased instances of bulimic symptoms may be due to the 20th century&#x27;s new ideals of thinness. The shame of being fat emerged in the 1940s when teasing remarks about weight became more common. The 1950s, however, truly introduced the trend of aspiration for thinness.

In 1979, Gerald Russell first published a description of bulimia nervosa, in which he studied patients with a &quot;morbid fear of becoming fat&quot; who overate and purged afterward. He specified treatment options and indicated the seriousness of the disease, which can be accompanied by depression and suicide. In 1980, bulimia nervosa first appeared in the DSM-III.

After its appearance in the DSM-III, there was a sudden rise in the documented incidents of bulimia nervosa. In the early 1980s, incidents of the disorder rose to about 40 in every 100,000 people. This decreased to about 27 in every 100,000 people at the end of the 1980s/early 1990s. However, bulimia nervosa&#x27;s prevalence was still much higher than anorexia nervosa&#x27;s, which at the time occurred in about 14 people per 100,000.

In 1991, Kendler et al. documented the cumulative risk for bulimia nervosa for those born before 1950, from 1950 to 1959, and after 1959. The risk for those born after 1959 is much higher than those in either of the other cohorts.

<doc id="168540" wikidata="Q15615" url="?curid=168540" title="Lil Wayne">
<text>Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September27, 1982), known professionally as Lil Wayne, is an American rapper. He is often regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation, as well as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Born and raised in New Orleans, he was discovered by hometown rapper Birdman in 1993 and signed with his record label, Cash Money Records, at age eleven. He emerged as the label&#x27;s artist for the following years until his departure in June 2018.

He was first placed in a duo with Cash Money labelmate B.G. in 1994—known collectively as the B.G.&#x27;z—and they released an album, &quot;True Story&quot;, in July of that year, although Carter (at the time known as Baby D) appeared on only three its tracks. Carter and B.G. then formed the Southern hip-hop group Hot Boys with labelmates Juvenile and Turk in 1997; they released their debut album, &quot;Get It How U Live!&quot; in October of that year. The Hot Boys gained mainstream success following the release of their second album &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot; (1999), and their appearance on B.G.&#x27;s single, &quot;Bling Bling&quot;. The group briefly disbanded after the album due to each member (besides Carter) parting ways with the label, although one further album—&quot;Let &#x27;Em Burn&quot; (2003)—was released.

Carter&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Tha Block Is Hot&quot; (1999) quickly achieved commercial success and served as his breakthrough as a solo act, followed by &quot;Lights Out&quot; (2000) and &quot;500 Degreez&quot; (2003). His fourth and fifth albums, &quot;Tha Carter&quot; (2004) and &quot;Tha Carter II&quot; (2005), both debuted within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received critical acclaim. His sixth album, &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; (2008), yielded the pinnacle of Wayne&#x27;s career, with first-week sales of over one million units domestically. Furthermore, it won the Best Rap Album at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards and was supported by his first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one single &quot;Lollipop&quot; (featuring Static Major), the top-ten singles &quot;A Milli&quot; and &quot;Got Money&quot; (featuring T-Pain), and the top-20 single &quot;Mrs. Officer&quot; (featuring Bobby V and Kidd Kidd).

Carter&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Rebirth&quot; (2010), experimented with rap rock and was released in February of that year to generally negative critical response. A month later in March, he began serving an 8-month jail sentence for criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. His eighth album, &quot;I Am Not a Human Being&quot; (2010), was released during his incarceration, while his ninth album, &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; (2011), followed months after his release from prison. Despite mixed reviews, &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; sold 964,000 units in its first-week domestically. His twelfth studio album, &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; (2018)—preceded by &quot;I Am Not a Human Being II&quot; (2013) and &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot; (2015)—was released following long-term delays and label disputes, and was met with 480,000 in first-week sales. His thirteenth album, &quot;Funeral&quot; (2020), became his fifth non-consecutive number one album.

Carter has sold over 120 million records worldwide, including over 25 million albums and 95 million digital tracks in the United States, making him one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. He has won five Grammy Awards, eleven BET Awards, four &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and eight NAACP Image Awards. On September27, 2012, he became the first male artist to surpass Elvis Presley with the most entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with 109 songs. Carter founded the record label Young Money Entertainment in 2005, which has signed artists including Drake, Tyga and Nicki Minaj.

==Early life==
Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September27, 1982, and spent his first few years in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana&#x27;s 17th Ward. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was two and his father permanently abandoned the family. In a 2009 interview, CBS News anchor Katie Couric asked the rapper why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name. Carter replied, &quot;I’ll tell you why I dropped the D right here on TV. I dropped the D because I am a junior. My father, he’s livin&#x27;, and he is not in my life and he’s never been in my life. So I don&#x27;t wanna be Dwayne. I’d rather be Wayne.” Couric asked if his father knew that, and Carter, chuckling, said, “He knows it now.” Carter has said that he considers his deceased stepfather Reginald &quot;Rabbit&quot; McDonald to be his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to McDonald.

Carter was enrolled in the gifted program at Lafayette Elementary School. He later attended Eleanor McMain Secondary School for two years, where he was an honor student and a member of the drama club, playing the Tin Man in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. Despite matriculating to Marion Abramson Senior High School, Carter left during his tenth grade year to pursue a GED. Carter’s mother made the decision to remove him from school for his safety. At 15, Carter was already finding success in the music industry; his mother decided he needed to leave high school after discovering the gun he packed in his school bag for protection.

Carter wrote his first rap song at age eight. In the summer of 1991, he met rapper and Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan &quot;Baby&quot; Williams (known currently as Birdman), who mentored him and encouraged his love of hip-hop; Birdman included Carter on several Cash Money tracks, and he (in return) would often record freestyle raps on Williams&#x27; answering machine.

In 1994, at age 12, Carter suffered a near-fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. At the time, he said the injury was accidental. However, in September 2018, Carter claimed in interviews that it was an attempted suicide after he was told by his mother that he would have to end his rap-related associations. Carter credits off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler (1956–2022), who he calls &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;, with saving his life by insisting the dying child be driven immediately to hospital in a police car rather than waiting for an ambulance to become available. Other accounts indicate that several officers played a part in deciding on and implementing that course of action.

==Career==
===1994–1999: Career beginnings and Hot Boys===
After recovering from his self-inflicted gunshot wound, Carter linked with Christopher Dorsey, a local New Orleans rapper known as B.G., his longtime friend, future Cash Money labelmate and Hot Boys bandmate. They would later form their duo, the B.G.&#x27;z, with B.G. being named &quot;Lil Doogie&quot; and Carter being &quot;Baby D&quot;. They only released one album under the group name, &quot;True Story&quot; (1995).

In 1997, Carter and Dorsey then joined the hip-hop quartet, the Hot Boys, along with rappers and labelmates, Juvenile, and Turk. Having joined at age 14, Carter was the youngest member at the time. Hot Boys&#x27; debut album, &quot;Get It How U Live!&quot;, was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group&#x27;s major-label debut &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, which respectively reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, &quot;We on Fire&quot; from &quot;Get It How U Live!&quot; and &quot;I Need a Hot Girl&quot; from &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;. The group shared a track, &quot;Bling Bling&quot;, alongside another Cash Money group, duo Big Tymers (consisting of Birdman and producer Mannie Fresh). Carter&#x27;s verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus. &quot;Bling Bling&quot; appeared on Hot Boys member B.G.&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Chopper City in the Ghetto&quot;, released in April 1999. Carter was also featured on Juvenile&#x27;s single &quot;Back That Azz Up&quot;, which reached number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number five on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.

&quot;Let &#x27;Em Burn&quot;, a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded by the quartet during 1998 and 2000, was released in March 2003, several years after the group disbanded. It reached number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, but underperformed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number fourteen.

===1999–2004: &quot;Tha Block Is Hot&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, and &quot;500 Degreez&quot;===
Carter&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Tha Block Is Hot&quot;, was released on November 2, 1999, when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA in December 1999, less than a month after its release. The album earned Carter a 1999 &quot;Source&quot; magazine nomination for &quot;Best New Artist&quot;, and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was the album&#x27;s title track, which its chorus was performed by Carter&#x27;s former Hot Boys cohort, Juvenile and B.G.

His second album, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, was released on December 19, 2000. It failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut, but was certified gold by RIAA in June 2001, nearly six months after its release. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was &quot;Get Off the Corner&quot;, which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was &quot;Shine&quot; featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of &quot;Lights Out&quot;, Carter was featured on the single, &quot;Number One Stunna&quot; with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The track, originally featured on Big Tymers&#x27; &quot;I Got That Work&quot;, would be used for the Spike Lee-directed comedy film, &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;.

Carter&#x27;s third album, &quot;500 Degreez&quot;, was released in August 2002. It followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor, it also failed to match the success of his debut. The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile&#x27;s debut solo studio album, &quot;400 Degreez&quot; (1998). Its lead single was &quot;Way of Life&quot;, featuring Birdman and singer TQ with narration by its producer, Mannie Fresh; it reached number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 23 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The single featured a sample of Tupac Shakur&#x27;s diss track towards the Notorious B.I.G., &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot; (1996), which itself sampled Dennis Edwards and Siedah Garrett&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Any Further&quot; (1984). Despite the album&#x27;s commercial failure, John Bush of AllMusic praised &quot;500 Degreez&quot;, while calling &quot;Way of Life&quot; an &quot;infectious party hit&quot;. After the release of &quot;500 Degreez&quot;, Carter was featured on the single &quot;Neva Get Enuf&quot; by 3LW, and later appeared on his future girlfriend, singer Nivea&#x27;s single, &quot;Ya Ya Ya&quot;.

===2004–2006: &quot;Tha Carter&quot;, &quot;Tha Carter II&quot;, and &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;===
On June 29, 2004, Carter&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Tha Carter&quot;, was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes. In addition, the album&#x27;s cover art featured the debut of Wayne&#x27;s now-signature dreadlocks. &quot;Tha Carter&quot; gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single &quot;Go DJ&quot; became a top five hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After the release of &quot;Tha Carter&quot;, Lil Wayne was featured on Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s single &quot;Soldier&quot; alongside Atlanta rapper T.I., which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.

In 2005, Carter appeared on a remix of singer Bobby Valentino&#x27;s &quot;Tell Me&quot;, which rose to number thirteen on the U.S. Hot R&amp;B Songs chart. That same year, Carter was named the president of Cash Money Records, but was later granted his own label; he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money and Universal Music Group. However, as of late 2007, Carter reported having stepped down from the management of both labels and handed management of Young Money over to his longtime manager, Cortez Bryant.

&quot;Tha Carter II&quot;, the sequel to 2004&#x27;s &quot;Tha Carter&quot;, was released on December 6, 2005. Mannie Fresh was not involved in the production of the album, as he had left the label prior, due to financial issues. &quot;Tha Carter II&quot; sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the album went on to sell two million copies worldwide. The lead single, &quot;Fireman&quot;, became a hit in the U.S., peaking at 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Other singles included &quot;Grown Man&quot; with Currensy, &quot;Hustler Musik&quot;, and &quot;Shooter&quot; with R&amp;B singer Robin Thicke.

In 2006, Carter collaborated with his label boss, Birdman, for the album, &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;, which its first single &quot;Stuntin&#x27; Like My Daddy&quot;, reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===2006–2007: Mixtapes and collaborations===

Instead of a follow-up solo album, Carter began to reach his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop, R&amp;B and hip hop singles. Of his many mixtapes, &quot;Dedication 2&quot; and &quot;Da Drought 3&quot; received the most media exposure and critical review. &quot;Dedication 2&quot;, released in 2006, paired Carter with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track, &quot;Georgia Bush&quot;, a remix of Field Mob and Ludacris&#x27; &quot;Georgia&quot;, in which Carter critiqued former U.S. president George W. Bush&#x27;s response to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the city of New Orleans. &quot;Da Drought 3&quot; was released the following year and was available for free legal download. It contained Carter rapping over a variety of beats from recent hits by other musicians. A number of prominent hip hop magazines such as &quot;XXL&quot; and &quot;Vibe&quot; covered the mixtape. Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine considered the mixtapes &quot;Da Drought 3&quot; and &quot;The Drought Is Over 2 (The Carter 3 Sessions)&quot; &quot;among the best albums of 2007&quot;.

Despite no album release for two years, Carter appeared in numerous singles as a featured performer, including in 2006 with the remix to &quot;Gimme That&quot; by Chris Brown, &quot;Make It Rain&quot; by Fat Joe and &quot;You&quot; by Lloyd, and in 2007 with &quot;We Takin&#x27; Over&quot; by DJ Khaled (also featuring Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and Birdman), &quot;Duffle Bag Boy&quot; by Playaz Circle, &quot;Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)&quot; by Wyclef Jean (also featuring Akon), and the remix to &quot;I&#x27;m So Hood&quot; by DJ Khaled (also featuring T-Pain, Young Jeezy, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Big Boi, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Rick Ross). All these singles charted within the top 20 spots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Hot Rap Tracks, and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. On Birdman&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;5 * Stunna&quot;, Carter appeared on the singles &quot;100 Million&quot; and &quot;I Run This&quot; among several other tracks. Carter also appeared on tracks from albums, &quot;Getback&quot; by Little Brother, &quot;American Gangster&quot; by Jay-Z, and &quot;Graduation&quot; by Kanye West and &quot;Insomniac&quot; by Enrique Iglesias. &quot;Make It Rain&quot; (2006), a Scott Storch production that peaked at number thirteen on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for 2008.

&quot;Vibe&quot; magazine ranked a list of 77 of Lil Wayne&#x27;s songs from 2007 and ranked his verse in DJ Khaled&#x27;s &quot;We Takin Over&quot; as his best of 2007, with &quot;Dough Is What I Got&quot; (a freestyle over the beat of Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot;) from &quot;Da Drought 3&quot;. At the end of 2007, an MTV poll selected Lil Wayne as &quot;Hottest MC in the Game&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine ranked him &quot;Rapper of the Year&quot;, and &quot;GQ&quot; magazine named him &quot;Workaholic of the Year&quot;. In 2008, he was named &quot;Best MC&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Another article, built around Lil Wayne&#x27;s 2007 mixtape work, cites his creative practice as an example of post-performance creative practice.

===2007–2010: &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;, &quot;We Are Young Money&quot;, and &quot;Rebirth&quot;===

In 2007, Carter stated that he would reunite with Hot Boys, with plans to release an album after B.G.&#x27;s solo album &quot;Too Hood to Be Hollywood&quot; was completed. &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in 2007, but it was delayed after several recordings were leaked and distributed through mixtapes, including &quot;The Drought Is Over Pt. 2&quot; and &quot;The Drought Is Over Pt. 4&quot;. Lil Wayne initially planned to release &quot;The Leak&quot;, a separate album with leaked songs and four additional tracks, on December18, 2007, with &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; delayed to March18, 2008. Instead, &quot;The Leak&quot; became an EP with five songs and was released digitally on December25, 2007.

&quot;Tha Carter III&quot; was released on June10, 2008, with first-week sales of over 1 million copies, the first to do so since 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;The Massacre&quot; (2005). The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Lollipop&quot;, featuring Static Major, became the Carter&#x27;s most successful song at the time, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming his first top ten single as a solo artist and his first number one on the chart. The third single &quot;Got Money&quot;, featuring T-Pain, peaked at number thirteen on the Billboard 100. &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; went on to win four Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song, which he won for &quot;Lollipop&quot;. On July14, 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America certified &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; two times platinum. In October 2008, Lil Wayne announced plans to MTV News to re-release the album with new tracks, including a duet with Ludacris and remixes of &quot;A Milli&quot;.

Carter also appeared on R&amp;B singles &quot;Girls Around the World&quot; by Lloyd, &quot;Love in This Club, Part II&quot; by Usher, &quot;Official Girl&quot; by Cassie, &quot;I&#x27;m So Paid&quot; by Akon, &quot;Turnin&#x27; Me On&quot; by Keri Hilson, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Believe It&quot; by T-Pain; rap singles &quot;My Life&quot; by The Game, &quot;Shawty Say&quot; by David Banner, &quot;Swagga Like Us&quot; by T.I., &quot;Cutty Buddy&quot; by Mike Jones, All My Life (In the Ghetto) by Jay Rock and the remix to &quot;Certified&quot; by Glasses Malone; and pop single &quot;Let It Rock&quot; by new Cash Money artist Kevin Rudolf.

Throughout 2008, Carter performed at the Voodoo Experience in October in New Orleans, which was described by Jonathan Cohen of &quot;Billboard&quot; as his biggest hometown headlining set of his career. He also performed at the Virgin Mobile Music Fest with Kanye West, where they performed the remix of &quot;Lollipop&quot; and lip-synced to Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. Lil Wayne also performed at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards with Kid Rock (&quot;All Summer Long&quot;), Leona Lewis (&quot;DontGetIt (Misunderstood)&quot;) and T-Pain (&quot;Got Money&quot;) and performed &quot;Lollipop&quot; and &quot;Got Money&quot; on the season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He later performed at the homecoming rally at Vanderbilt University and the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, where he received 12 nominations. He won eight awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards, one of which included the &quot;MVP&quot; title. After M.I.A. dropped out of performing on Carter&#x27;s I Am Music Tour due to her pregnancy, Jay-Z performed &quot;Mr. Carter&quot; with Lil Wayne at select shows.

After &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; sold over 3 million copies and became the best-selling record of 2008, Carter re-signed with Cash Money Records for a multi-album deal.
On November11, 2008, Carter became the first hip hop act to perform at the Country Music Association Awards, playing &quot;All Summer Long&quot; alongside Kid Rock, in which Carter inaudibly strummed guitar strings alongside the guitarist in Kid Rock&#x27;s band. Shortly after, Wayne was nominated for eight Grammys – the most for any artist nominated that year. He was then named the first MTV Man of the Year at the end of 2008. He won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for &quot;A Milli&quot;, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for his appearance on T.I.&#x27;s single &quot;Swagga Like Us&quot;, and Best Rap Song for &quot;Lollipop&quot;. &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; won the award for Best Rap Album. MTV News listed Carter number two on their 2009 list of the Hottest MCs in the Game.

Prior to the 2009 Grammy Awards, Wayne was featured in an interview with Katie Couric. On February7, 2009, he presented the Top Ten List on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. On April24, 2009, he appeared on &quot;The View&quot;, discussing his GED and addictions. In September 2009, Carter was profiled in an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; and was a presenter of the 2009 MTV Movie Awards. In film, Carter produced and composed music for and starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;Hurricane Season&quot;. A documentary of Carter, titled &quot;The Carter&quot;, was released at the Sundance Film Festival.

On December23, 2009, Carter released his label, Young Money&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;We Are Young Money&quot;, with its lead single being &quot;Every Girl&quot;. The second single was &quot;BedRock&quot;, featuring Lloyd, with the third being &quot;Roger That&quot;. On May24, 2010, the album was certified gold by the RIAA with over 500,000 copies sold. Carter is featured on the song, &quot;Revolver&quot;, with Madonna for her greatest hits album, &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009). He was also featured on a Weezer song, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Partying&quot;, on &quot;Raditude&quot; (2009). In late 2008, Carter announced plans to reissue &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; with leftover recordings, and was to be titled &quot;Rebirth&quot;, originally scheduled to be released on April7, 2009, before being delayed several times. &quot;Rebirth&quot; instead became his sixth solo studio album, re-recorded with replaced material and later released on February2, 2010. The album received negative reviews from fans and critics, considering it Carter&#x27;s worst album released since &quot;500 Degreez&quot; (2002).

To support its release and that of &quot;We Are Young Money&quot;, Carter was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and headlined the &#x27;Young Money Presents: America&#x27;s Most Wanted Music Festival&#x27;, a United States and Canada–only concert tour which began on July29, 2009. &quot;Prom Queen&quot;, the first official single, debuted on January27, 2009, immediately after a live Internet broadcast of his concert in San Diego on Ustream (now IBM Cloud Video). It peaked at number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. On December3, 2009, the second single, &quot;On Fire&quot;, produced by Cool &amp; Dre, was released. Based on a sample of Amy Holland&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s on Fire&quot; from the soundtrack to the 1983 film, &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;On Fire&quot; peaked at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Drop the World&quot;, which features Eminem, was the album&#x27;s third single; it was produced by a then-unknown Hit-Boy.

===2010–2013: &quot;I Am Not a Human Being&quot; series and &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;===
In an interview on MTV&#x27;s Mixtape Monday, Carter hinted at the release of &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;. He later announced that it would be released in late 2009 before the holiday season. Birdman had previously stated that &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; would be packaged with &quot;Rebirth&quot; as a double disc album. Carter denied this, saying that &quot;&quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; deserves &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;&quot;, adding that &quot;We Are Young Money&quot; may be packaged with &quot;Rebirth&quot;. These albums were eventually released separately.

Carter released his eighth album, &quot;I Am Not a Human Being&quot;, on his 28th birthday, September27, 2010. Unfortunately, the album was released during Carter&#x27;s incarceration on a weapon possession charge. The album has sold over 953,000 copies in the U.S. and spawned the successful single &quot;Right Above It&quot;, which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also debuted at number two, but later climbed to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making Carter the first rapper while incarcerated (since Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Me Against the World&quot;, released in 1995) to have a number one album. &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; was delayed into 2011, after Lil Wayne began recording from scratch after his release from prison. He described his first song since his release as &quot;a 2010 version of &quot;A Milli&quot; on steroids&quot;. The lead single from &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;, &quot;6 Foot 7 Foot&quot; featuring Cory Gunz, was released on December15, 2010. On March8, Carter released another song, &quot;We Back Soon&quot;, though it was not included on the official track listing of &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;. The second single, &quot;John&quot;, featuring Rick Ross, was released on March24. In an interview on March29, Carter announced that he would retire at age 35; saying that &quot;I would feel selfish still going to the studio when it&#x27;s such a vital point&quot; in the lives of his four children.

Throughout a two-year period between 2010 and 2012, Carter has been featured in many hit singles such as &quot;I Made It (Cash Money Heroes)&quot; by Kevin Rudolf, &quot;Miss Me&quot;, &quot;The Motto&quot;, and &quot;HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)&quot; by Drake, &quot;No Love&quot; by Eminem, &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; by Jay Sean, &quot;Look at Me Now&quot; by Chris Brown, &quot;Welcome to My Hood&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on One&quot;, &quot;Take It to the Head&quot;, and &quot;No New Friends&quot; by DJ Khaled, &quot;Motivation&quot; by Kelly Rowland, &quot;Ballin&#x27;&quot; by Young Jeezy, &quot;Strange Clouds&quot; by B.o.B, &quot;I Can Only Imagine&quot; by David Guetta, &quot;Faded&quot; by Tyga, &quot;Pop That&quot; by French Montana, and &quot;Bandz a Make Her Dance&quot; by Juicy J. 

The artwork for &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; was unveiled on April20. Originally scheduled to be released on May16, it was delayed several times until being confirmed for release on August 29, 2011. On May26, the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;How to Love&quot;, was released. He released another track, &quot;Dear Anne (Stan Part 2)&quot;, in June. In preparation for &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot;, Carter released a mixtape, &quot;Sorry 4 the Wait&quot;, in similarity to his mixtape &quot;No Ceilings&quot; (2009); the mixtape was re-released on streaming services in January 2022 with four additional tracks.

Finally released on August 29, 2011, &quot;Tha Carter IV&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 964,000 copies (overshadowing the first-week sales of Jay-Z and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;), making it Carter&#x27;s third chart-topping album of his career. On January8, 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan, Carter was the seventh all-time best-selling artist for digital track sales with 36,788,000 million to the end of 2011.

In October 2011, it was reported that Carter was working on sequels to both &quot;I Am Not a Human Being&quot; and &quot;Rebirth&quot;. In January 2012, Birdman announced that he and Carter had finished recording &quot;Like Father, Like Son 2&quot;. On November22, 2012, Carter announced that &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; would be his final album, as he wanted to pursue other interests.

After a one-year delay, &quot;I Am Not a Human Being II&quot; was released on March26, 2013, debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 217,000 copies in its first week; &quot;My Homies Still&quot;, &quot;Love Me&quot;, and &quot;No Worries&quot; were released as singles prior to its release. The album was met with generally mixed reviews, with most critics noticing the declining quality of his releases. Carter toured North America with 2 Chainz and T.I. on the second America&#x27;s Most Wanted Festival. On May3, 2013, Pepsi dropped Carter, who was a spokesperson for Mountain Dew, due to him performing offensive lyrics about civil rights icon Emmett Till on the remix to rapper Future&#x27;s single, &quot;Karate Chop&quot;.

===2014–2019: &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot; and &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;===

On October18, 2013, former Cash Money Records vice president of promotion Mel Smith, tweeted: &quot;Happy Friday!! New YMCMB music coming soon!! Carter 5.&quot; Nearly four months later, in an interview with &quot;The Griffin&quot;, released on February14, 2014, Smith spoke on the upcoming album: &quot;We&#x27;re very close to dropping the album. It&#x27;s going to be a huge surprise to everyone ... I can&#x27;t release the date because he wants to surprise people.&quot; On February15, during Drake&#x27;s performance at the NBA All-Star Weekend festivities in New Orleans, Carter appeared as a guest performer before announcing that &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; would be released on May5, 2014. In March 2014, Carter again said during an interview at SXSW that &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; would be his last album.

On March27, 2014, Carter&#x27;s manager Cortez Bryant announced that the album had been delayed. Carter then serviced released a single &quot;Believe Me&quot;, which features vocals from Drake, to mainstream urban radio in the United States on May6, 2014. Three more singles, &quot;Krazy&quot;, &quot;Grindin&#x27;&quot; (featuring Drake) and &quot;Start a Fire&quot; (featuring Christina Milian), were also released, but ultimately scrapped from the album.

Carter and Drake embarked on their joint tour, Drake vs. Lil Wayne (running from August 8 to September 28, 2014), determining who is &quot;the best rapper on tour and in the world&quot;. The concept of the tour was based on the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise. It was the third-largest grossing hip hop concert tour of 2014 behind Eminem and Rihanna&#x27;s Monster Tour, and Jay-Z and Beyoncé&#x27;s On the Run Tour.

In late 2014, Carter claimed that the album&#x27;s release was postponed due to his financial disputes with Cash Money.

On January20, 2015, Carter self-released &quot;Sorry 4 the Wait 2&quot;, a sequel to his 2011 mixtape, to compensate for the continued delay of &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;. In February 2015, due to &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;″s delay, Carter announced that a free album would be released prior to the fifth installment in his popular series. In June 2015, Carter joined Jay-Z&#x27;s TIDAL, as an artist owner, kicking off the partnership by exclusively releasing a single on the service titled &quot;Glory&quot;. He also announced plans on his own TIDAL X concert series. On July4, 2015, Carter released &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot;, exclusively through TIDAL, under Young Money and Republic Records.

On March4, 2016, 2 Chainz released his third studio album, &quot;ColleGrove&quot;. The album was initially a collaborative effort between 2 Chainz and Carter, but due to his record label issues, only 2 Chainz was credited as the primary artist. On June28, 2016, Carter was one of several artists who appeared on the track &quot;Sucker for Pain&quot; for the film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. In September 2016, Carter tweeted &quot;I AM NOW DEFENSELESS and mentally DEFEATED&quot;, followed by stating &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot;, hinting at a possible retirement. Many rappers responded with respect and encouragement.

In 2017, Carter announced he had signed with Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation, although he later stated that there was no official paperwork that he signed to the label. On August8, 2017, he released the song &quot;Like a Man&quot; with sound engineer Onhel. On June7, 2018, it was announced that Carter had been released from Cash Money Records and would be releasing &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; via Young Money and Republic Records.

On Christmas Day 2017, Carter released the mixtape &quot;Dedication 6&quot;, the sixth installment of the &quot;Gangsta Grillz&quot; chronology. The second part was released on January26, 2018.

&quot;Tha Carter V&quot; was finally released on September27, 2018, the day of Carter&#x27;s 36th birthday, debuting at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 480,000 album-equivalent units, including 140,000 pure album sales. It is the second-largest streaming week for an album behind former Young Money labelmate Drake&#x27;s &quot;Scorpion&quot; with 433 million streams. It is also Carter&#x27;s fourth number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album. Every song on the album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100, while simultaneously charting 4 songs in the top 10, also becoming the first artist to debut two songs in the top five. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Uproar&quot;, produced by Swizz Beatz, was its leading, reaching number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it features a sample from rapper G. Dep&#x27;s 2001 single, &quot;Special Delivery&quot;. &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; has since been certified 2× platinum by the RIAA.

===2020–2021: &quot;Funeral&quot; and &quot;Trust Fund Babies&quot;===

The song&#x27;s music video was released on March3, 2020. This marked the second collaboration for the two artists in 2020, with the first being on Carter&#x27;s single, &quot;I Do It&quot;.

On April24, 2020, Lil Wayne, along with Litt Live (formerly at the time, Dash Radio), launched his own radio show, Young Money Radio, on Apple Music through its subdivision Apple Music 1. Wayne described the show as having &quot;heavyweights calling in discussing sports, music, comedy, everything!&quot;. On July3, Lil Wayne released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Free Weezy Album&quot; (2015) on streaming services to commemorate its five-year anniversary. The album charted at number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the following week. On May29, Wayne released the deluxe edition of &quot;Funeral&quot; featuring artists such as Doja Cat, Tory Lanez, Lil Uzi Vert, Benny The Butcher, Conway the Machine and Jessie Reyez. On August28, Wayne released another old project, his 2009 mixtape &quot;No Ceilings&quot;, for commercial release. He also celebrated the release by collaborating with ASAP Ferg on the song &quot;No Ceilings&quot;. Wayne was featured on YoungBoy Never Broke Again&#x27;s album &quot;Top&quot; on the track &quot;My Window&quot;, released on September11. His verse received praise from critics. On September25, he released the deluxe edition of his twelfth album &quot;Tha Carter V&quot;, to celebrate the album&#x27;s second anniversary; it consists of songs that did not make the cut on the original album.

On November27, 2020, Lil Wayne released the mixtape, &quot;No Ceilings 3&quot;, while announcing the album, &quot;I Am Not a Human Being III&quot;, for 2021, although it would not be released that year due to delays. On October1, 2021, Wayne and Rich the Kid released a collaborative mixtape titled &quot;Trust Fund Babies&quot;, along with a music video for the single &quot;Feelin&#x27; Like Tunechi&quot;. The mixtape took roughly a month and a half to record. On their working relationship, Wayne said, &quot;For me, it&#x27;s the chemistry, it&#x27;s the camaraderie because first of all, Rich like my little bro and me and Rich been rockin&#x27; for a minute&quot;.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Welcome 2 Collegrove&quot; and &quot;Tha Carter VI&quot; ===
On March31, 2023, Wayne dropped his first ever greatest hits album titled &quot;I Am Music&quot;. It included the then-unreleased &quot;Kant Nobody&quot;, featuring DMX, whose song, &quot;Niggaz Done Started Something&quot; (1998), was sampled through. Wayne and DMX previously collaborated on &quot;Dogs Out&quot;, a track from the latter&#x27;s posthumous album, &quot;Exodus&quot;, which was released a month after his death in 2021. Wayne released a single titled &quot;Kat Food&quot; on September1, 2023. That October, Lil Wayne released a mixtape, &quot;Tha Fix Before Tha VI&quot;. On November3, 2023, Wayne was featured on the remix to Ciara and Chris Brown&#x27;s single &quot;How We Roll&quot;. That same month, he and 2 Chainz released a collaborative album, &quot;Welcome 2 Collegrove&quot;. A sequel to 2 Chainz&#x27;s 2016 album, &quot;ColleGrove&quot;, Wayne was credited as a co-leading artist as he was previously unable to receive credit for its predecessor, due to his prior legal issues involving his Cash Money dispute.

On February 6, 2025, during an advert for Cetaphil, Wayne announced that &quot;Tha Carter VI&quot; would be released on June 6, 2025. On February 17, after being critical of his &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; collaborator Kendrick Lamar replacing him as the headliner of the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, Carter performed for the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 50th anniversary special.

===Future and unreleased projects===

Carter has announced several possible upcoming projects, including a collaborative album entitled &quot;I Can&#x27;t Feel My Face&quot; with Harlem-based rapper Juelz Santana, that has been in production for several years. In late 2011, it was announced by Mack Maine that Carter and Juelz Santana had gone back to work on their collaborative album &quot;I Can&#x27;t Feel My Face&quot;, which had been delayed for a few years due to &quot;label politics&quot;.

On June19, 2008, Carter and T-Pain formed a duo called T-Wayne with plans to release an album, titled &quot;He Raps, He Sings&quot;; however, those plans have died down due to much of the material recorded for the album being leaked. T-Pain ultimately released &quot;T-Wayne&quot; as a mixtape in 2017.

According to an interview with Drake, in the December 2011 issue of &quot;XXL&quot;, plans for an upcoming album with Carter had been scrapped for the time being because of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot; (2011).

In April 2012, on the premiere of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop POV&quot;, Carter sat down with Amanda Seales and spoke briefly about an album he put together titled &quot;Devol&quot; (loved, backwards), an album full of &quot;love songs&quot; that he wrote during his imprisonment at Rikers Island. In May 2013, he confirmed the album will still be released.

Carter&#x27;s once ongoing litigation with Cash Money prevented numerous completed projects from being released. In January 2017, Young Money revealed the title of a planned Carter album called &quot;Velvet&quot;. The album ended up leaking online in November 2018.

==Musical style and artistry==
Known for his creative lyrical ability—which often uses punchlines, homonyms, word play—and braggadocio, Carter&#x27;s music often deals with the subjects of wealth, drugs, and sex.

Carter has cited rapper Missy Elliott as his biggest musical inspiration, saying &quot;she&#x27;s a huge influence of everything I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. Another one of his major influences is American hip hop group Goodie Mob. In an interview with Genius, Carter said &quot;I&#x27;ve been listening to Goodie Mob since I was in the 7th grade&quot;. For his &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special, Carter paid tribute to Tupac by covering his music. He also pulled inspiration from Tupac&#x27;s &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; for his 2011 single &quot;How to Love&quot;.

Additionally, he has mentioned T-Pain, Prince, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lenny Kravitz as influences, stating &quot;I viewed them seriously and was like, &#x27;Wow, I could do that without being totally them.&quot; Carter and rapper Calboy paid homage to Hill on their 2021 single &quot;Miseducation&quot; titled after Hill&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;.

According to &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Carter credits Jay-Z for inspiring him to freestyle rhymes while recording over an instrumental, as opposed to writing down his lyrics. Carter also credits The Notorious B.I.G. as an influence.

==Legacy==
Lil Wayne is claimed to be &quot;one of the most influential artists in the 21st century&quot; and is many times called as &quot;the greatest rapper of his generation&quot;, as well as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His musical style and usage of autotune influenced modern sound of hip-hop music and its subgenres, especially the development of trap.

Many rappers and musicians have cited Lil Wayne as an influence on their careers and musical style, including Nicki Minaj, Drake, Fall Out Boy, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Future, Lil B, Young Thug, Trippie Redd, Lil Skies, Playboi Carti, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Lil Baby, DaBaby, Polo G, BlocBoy JB, NLE Choppa, Flo Milli, and The Kid Laroi. His lyrics have also been criticized for their controversial subject matter.

In November 2024, Lil Wayne, during the Lil WeezyAna Fest, received a Key to the City from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. In the same tribute, Master P announced the creation of the NOLA Walk of Fame and presented Wayne with a fleur-de-lis plaque to mark this honor. Additionally, February 6–7 will now be celebrated as &quot;Lil Wayne Day&quot; in New Orleans.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Carter has four children. His first child, daughter Reginae, was born November29, 1998, when he was 16, to his high school sweetheart and later ex-wife Toya Johnson. Internet rumors circulated in August 2008 that Carter&#x27;s daughter had died in an auto accident; he immediately dispelled them. His second child, son Dwayne III, was born on October22, 2008, at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati to former radio personality Sarah Vivan. His third child, son Cameron, was born to actress Lauren London on September9, 2009. His fourth child, son Neal, was born on November30, 2009, to singer Nivea.

Carter met his high school sweetheart Toya Johnson, when he was 15 and she was 14, respectively. After dating on and off for seven years, they married on Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14, 2004 and divorced in January 2006. Johnson cited her inability to cope with his lifestyle and the fact he had communicated with his other former romantic partners prior. More specifically, his career kept him away from their home for long periods of time. Despite being divorced, the two have remained good friends and continued to jointly support their daughter, Reginae.

In February 2002, after he first broke up with Johnson, he began dating singer Nivea. On the 2007 song &quot;Something You Forgot&quot;, he explained his feelings for Nivea, whom he got engaged to in December 2002 but broke off the engagement with in August 2003. Nivea stated that Carter tried to make her quit doing music so that he could take care of her, but also acknowledged that the song was written about her.

Previously having known each other since 1999, Carter and Lauren London reconciled following his divorce from Johnson in 2006, but broke up again in 2009, after London found out that she was pregnant at the same time as Carter&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Nivea. In a May 2011 radio interview, London said of her relationship with Wayne and his fatherhood, &quot;I met Wayne when I was 15 years old. I&#x27;ve known him a very long time, and we were in a relationship that didn&#x27;t make it. We tried more than once to revive it, and we were engaged briefly years ago, but we eventually parted ways. People see the &#x27;Lil Wayne&#x27; personality and think they know who he really is. My son&#x27;s father is an intelligent, loving, and lovable person who will always be a dear friend. And that will never change. That is all.&quot; On the &quot;500 Degreez&quot; track, &quot;Young&#x27;n Blues&quot;, he discussed his breakup with Toya Johnson and his issues with London, while he nicknamed the latter &quot;young Cali sweet thing&quot;.

Carter began dating rapper Trina in 2005, after featuring on her single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Trip&quot;. The two were discussing future plans for engagement and moving to Florida to live together. However, in 2006, after Trina suffered a miscarriage from what was later confirmed to be her and Carter&#x27;s unborn child, they have grown distant from one another. It was during that time when Trina developed an affair with Carter&#x27;s would be rival, rapper Young Buck. In October 2007, the relationship ended after Trina realized that it was not properly empathized. According to her, it was the cause of the pair &quot;being young and not knowing what [we were] doing&quot;. The two reunited to collaborate for the 2013 single, &quot;Wowzerz&quot;, and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Situation&quot;, and remain on good terms.

Carter and Nivea reconciled in early 2008, following Nivea&#x27;s divorce from singer-songwriter The-Dream. Both were re-engaged in 2009, but Nivea decided to end her relationship with Carter while pregnant with their son and they called off their engagement for the second time in June 2010, in the midst of Carter&#x27;s prison sentence.

He dated model Karrine Steffans (on and off) from 2007 to 2014. Carter briefly dated Dana Lee in 2012.

He entered into an intimate relationship with glamour model Tammy Torres from 2009 to 2010. While imprisoned, Drake encouraged him not to rekindle his relationship with Torres, due to him already having had an encounter with her. After ending his relationship with Torres and mending over his falling out with Drake, Carter later got involved with Dhea Sodano from 2011 to 2019.

In July 2014, it was rumored that Carter was dating singer Christina Milian, with whom he attended the ESPY Awards. They later confirmed their relationship in mid-2015, after which they received criticism from their interconnected exes, singer Nivea and songwriter The-Dream. They split in August 2015, having collaborated on multiple singles, videos, and concert dates.

Wayne was engaged to model La&#x27;Tecia Thomas but called off the engagement in May 2020. A month later, it was announced that Wayne had started dating Denise Bidot, another model. In November 2020, they reportedly broke up over Wayne&#x27;s endorsement of Donald Trump. Shortly after, it was reported that the couple had reconciled. Wayne and Bidot later broke up again in January 2022.

Carter&#x27;s son, Neal Carter, currently performs music under the alias, Lil Novi.

===Beliefs and interests===
In an interview with &quot;Blender&quot;, Carter said that one of his favorite bands from childhood was rock group Nirvana, and cites them as a major influence in his music.
Carter got his first tattoo at age 14 of his dad&#x27;s name and his second was &quot;Cash Money&quot; across his stomach. His tattoos have grown to include a Jay-Z verse on his leg, &quot;I Am Music&quot; on his forehead and teardrops on his cheeks among many others. His most recent one is &quot;Baked&quot; on his forehead stylized as the Baker Skateboards logo.

Carter identifies as a Catholic. While playing in Newark Symphony Hall, Carter professed his belief &quot;in God and His son, Jesus&quot;. During his 2011 tour in Australia with Eminem, before beginning his bracket he proclaimed his belief in God.

After earning his GED, Carter enrolled at the University of Houston in January 2005. He dropped out in the same year due to his conflicting schedule. He also stated on &quot;The View&quot; that he switched to the University of Phoenix and majored in psychology taking online courses. An article in &quot;Urb&quot; magazine in March 2007 asserted that Carter had been earning high grades at Houston.

In 2016, Carter purchased Player&#x27;s Rep. Sports Agency, and became Young Money APAA sports, which hired NFL&#x27;s first female sports agent, Nicole Lynn. She currently represents Seth Roberts, Corey Nelson, Jordan Evans, Malik Jefferson, Erik Harris, Quinnen Williams, as well as NCAA coaches, and two former No. 1 Pro Softball draft picks.

On October29, 2020, less than a week before the presidential election, Carter posted an image of him and President Donald Trump to Twitter. In the caption for the photo, Carter stated that he and Trump had recently met to discuss criminal justice reform and Trump&#x27;s Platinum Plan, an initiative which aims to raise access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billion. Carter claimed Trump &quot;listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done&quot;.

===Health problems===
On October25, 2012, Carter&#x27;s private jet, bound for Los Angeles, made an emergency landing in Texas due to an in-flight medical episode. Lil Wayne was transferred to a local hospital upon arrival. TMZ and other media sources said that Carter had suffered a seizure aboard the plane. His publicist denied this, saying that he was in fact treated for &quot;a severe migraine and dehydration&quot;.

The following day, while flying from Texas to Los Angeles, Carter&#x27;s private jet was reportedly again forced to make an emergency landing, this time in Louisiana, after he suffered a second seizure and required further hospitalization. His representative said that the reports of Carter&#x27;s condition had been exaggerated, and that he was resting at his Louisiana home. In a November 2012 interview with MTV, Carter stated that he was taking seizure medication, on doctors&#x27; orders, due to the aforementioned incidents.

On March14, 2013, TMZ reported that Carter had been treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of March12, after having seizures while on a music video set with Young Money rapper Nicki Minaj. He was reportedly released in the early hours of March13. On March15, TMZ published a second story, claiming that hours after his release on March13, Carter was found unconscious after experiencing further seizures, and was brought back to Cedars-Sinai, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit in critical condition. The article alleged the latest seizures were found to be linked to high amounts of codeine in Carter&#x27;s system, possibly due to bingeing on purple drank after his initial hospital release. Multiple celebrities, including Drake and Birdman, were photographed on March15 and 16 visiting Carter at Cedars-Sinai.

Several members of Young Money Entertainment, including president Mack Maine, criticized media reports on Carter&#x27;s hospitalization, particularly those of TMZ, alleging that they exaggerated the severity of his condition and falsely implied that he was on his (such as by saying that he was in a medically induced coma), triggering what the &quot;Washington Post&quot; called &quot;the most overheated celebrity deathwatch in recent years&quot;. In separate interviews on March18, Mack Maine and Birdman disputed TMZ&#x27;s reports, and stated that in fact there were not multiple seizures or multiple hospital visits. They explained that after Carter began seizing on the way to the music video shoot on March12, an ambulance was called and he was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and remained continuously thereafter. They also refuted the claims that Carter&#x27;s seizures are drug-induced, saying that they are an ongoing problem for which doctors have been unable to identify a cause.

Carter was released from the hospital late on March18, following a six-day stay. He addressed his condition via a vlog, on March21 saying he was more than good.

Carter had two seizures in June 2016, during a cross-country flight from Wisconsin to California, and landed in Omaha, Nebraska. His plane was only two minutes in the air when the second seizure occurred, forcing the plane to land in Omaha once again. Less than a month later, he had another seizure, supposedly due to not taking his epilepsy medication.

Carter canceled a Las Vegas show on September3, 2017, having had a seizure in a Chicago hospital earlier that day, where he was brought after being found unconscious in a hotel room.

==Legal issues==
===Arrests, incarceration, and presidential pardon===
On July22, 2007, Carter was arrested in New York City following a performance at the Beacon Theatre; the New York City Police Department discovered Carter and another man smoking marijuana near a tour bus. After taking Carter into custody, police discovered a .40 caliber pistol near his person. The gun, which was registered to his manager, was in a bag located near the rapper. He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and marijuana.

Following a performance at Qwest Arena in Boise, Idaho, Carter was arrested October5, 2007, on felony fugitive charges after Georgia authorities accused the rapper of possessing a controlled substance. The incident was later described as a &quot;mix-up&quot; and the fugitive charges were dropped.

On January23, 2008, Carter was arrested alongside two others. His tour bus was stopped by Border Patrol agents near Yuma, Arizona. A K-9 Unit recovered of marijuana, almost of cocaine, of ecstasy, and $22,000 in cash. Carter was charged with four felonies: possession of narcotic drug for sale, possession of dangerous drugs, misconduct involving weapons and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was granted permission to travel outside of the state and remain out of custody on the $10,185 bond he posted.

On May6, 2008, Carter returned to court in Arizona to plead not guilty to the charges. A bench warrant was issued on March17, 2010, when Carter did not show for a final trial management conference. However, he was already incarcerated, serving a one-year sentence on Rikers Island on weapons charges. On June22, 2010, Carter pleaded guilty to the charges. As part of the plea deal he was able to serve 36 months of probation, which he was sentenced to on June30, 2010.

On December18, 2009, Carter and 11 others were detained at the Falfurrias, Texas, border patrol checkpoint after an unknown amount of marijuana was found on two of his tour buses.

On October22, 2009, Carter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon. He was due for sentencing in February 2010 and was expected to receive a one-year county jail sentence, but on February9, 2010, Carter&#x27;s attorney announced that the sentencing was delayed until March2 due to dental surgery, which was performed on February16. The surgery included eight root canals, the replacement of several tooth implants, as well as the addition of a few new implants and work on his remaining original teeth. On March2, 2010, sentencing was postponed again when the courthouse reported a fire in the basement.

On March8, 2010, Carter was given a one-year sentence, which he served on Rikers Island. His lawyer said the rapper expected to be held in protective custody, separated from other prisoners. In May 2010, Carter was found by Rikers Island correctional staff to be in possession of contraband (an MP3 player, charger, and headphones). In April 2010, Carter&#x27;s friends created a website called Weezy Thanx You, which published letters written by Carter while incarcerated. In the first letter, titled &quot;Gone &#x27;til November&quot;, Carter said he was staying in good spirits thinking about his children and spending his time working out regularly and reading the Bible every day. Carter was released from Rikers Island Jail on November4, 2010, after serving eight months of his year-long sentence.

On December12, 2020, Carter pleaded guilty to a federal firearms charge brought against him by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This plea stemmed from an incident during December of the previous year, when Carter was arrested in Florida after transporting a loaded handgun on his private jet from California. As a convicted felon, he is barred from possessing such weapons. He was pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump on January19, 2021, his last full day in office.

===Lawsuits===
On July24, 2008, Abkco Music filed a lawsuit against Carter for copyright infringement and unfair competition, specifically referring to &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; track &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;. In the lawsuit, Abkco says that the song was obviously derived from the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Play with Fire&quot;, to which Abkco owns the rights. Subsequently, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; was removed from the track list of &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; on all online music stores and replaced with the David Banner produced track, &quot;Pussy Monster&quot;.

In February 2009, production company RMF Productions filed a $1.3 million lawsuit against Carter following a $100,000 advance payment for three shows, all of which were cancelled by the artist.

In October 2009, Carter, Birdman, Cash Money Records, and various music distribution outlets were sued for copyright infringement by Thomas Marasciullo, who says his voice was used without permission. The rappers asked him to record some &quot;Italian-styled spoken word recordings&quot; in 2006. The lyrics were allegedly used on &quot;Respect&quot; and other tracks from the rappers&#x27; collaboration album &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; and Birdman&#x27;s &quot;5 * Stunna&quot;.

In March 2011, producer Deezle (Darius Harrison) sued Carter and his parent labels Cash Money Records over unpaid royalties from &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;. Two months later, that May, producer Bangladesh also filed a lawsuit against Wayne over unpaid royalties as well.

In early June 2011, another producer named David Kirkwood filed a lawsuit against Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records on claims that the labels have failed to pay him over $1.5 million in royalties and production services for his work on the album, also including his songwriting on &quot;Love Me or Hate Me&quot;, a bonus song featured only on the deluxe edition of the album.

Also in June 2011, Dallas producers Play-N-Skillz filed a lawsuit against him, saying Carter owes them at least $1 million in unpaid royalties for &quot;Got Money&quot; from his album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;. The single has sold over 2 million copies since being released.

In July 2011, Done Deal Enterprises, a production company based in Georgia, filed suit against Carter, Universal Music Group, Cash Money Records and Young Money Entertainment, claiming copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges Carter stole the song &quot;BedRock&quot;, featured on the compilation album &quot;We Are Young Money&quot;, and seeks damages of $15 million.

In November 2012, Wayne was ordered to pay Quincy Jones III $2.2 million based on a lawsuit which stated that the rapper blocked the release of Jones&#x27;s film &quot;The Carter&quot;, therefore infringing on its profits.

==Controversies and feuds==
===Juvenile===
Carter began feuding with former Hot Boys member and Cash Money Records labelmate Juvenile in 2002, after Juvenile took offense to Carter naming his third studio album &quot;500 Degreez&quot;, a diss aimed towards Juvenile whose last album was named &quot;400 Degreez&quot;. Juvenile responded with a diss track on his 2002 album &quot;600 Degreez&quot;, titled &quot;A Hoe&quot;. In the song, Juvenile questions Carter&#x27;s sexuality, and says he&#x27;s a fake gangster. The two squashed their beef for a short period in 2004, with Carter and Birdman appearing in the music video for Juvenile and Soulja Slim&#x27;s song, Slow Motion. Carter later paid tribute to the Hot Boys with a song called &quot;I Miss My Dawgs&quot; on 2004&#x27;s Tha Carter. Juvenile responded by calling the song &quot;fake&quot;, and criticized Carter for releasing a tribute song and later promoting the album on BET and having &quot;nothing good to say about them&quot;. The two eventually reconciled once again, and Juvenile re-signed with Cash Money Records in 2014.

===Young Buck===
Young Buck released a song called &quot;Off Parole&quot;, featuring Tony Yayo, which insulted Carter. Young Buck said that Carter could not be angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said &quot;You think you got a problem with Juve and B.G.; you&#x27;ll have a true problem with me&quot;, referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud. One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called &quot;inconsistent behavior&quot; which included appearing on stage with Carter, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit. After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video &quot;My Life&quot; by The Game, which featured Carter on the song&#x27;s chorus. As of 2009, Young Buck and Carter have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track &quot;Up&#x27;s and Down&#x27;s&quot; for Young Buck&#x27;s &quot;Back on My Buck Shit&quot; mixtape.

===Pusha T===
Tension between Wayne and Pusha T had been going on for years, beginning soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on &quot;What Happened to That Boy&quot;, the latter&#x27;s 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song &quot;Mr. Me Too&quot; was directed at him which caused more tension between the two. In 2012, after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne&#x27;s Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T&#x27;s &quot;Exodus 23:1&quot; song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled &quot;Goulish&quot;. In the first verse, Wayne raps &quot;Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I&#x27;mma have to head-butt him&quot;. Pusha T called Wayne&#x27;s diss track &quot;horrible&quot; and said he felt it did not deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he&#x27;s over it. However, in November 2012, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled &quot;Tell Me What They Mad For&quot;. In December 2014, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.

===Jay-Z===
In a 2009 interview with Tropical TV, Birdman disputed the MTV poll that voted Jay-Z &quot;The Hottest MC in the Game&quot;, stating that Lil Wayne was a better rapper and made more money. In early 2011, when Jay-Z and Kanye West&#x27;s single &quot;H•A•M&quot; was released, Jay-Z took shots at Birdman, saying &quot;Really, you got Baby money&quot; and &quot;[you] ain&#x27;t got my lady&#x27;s money!&quot;. On August24, 2011, a song called &quot;It&#x27;s Good&quot; by Lil Wayne (featuring Drake and Jadakiss) was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout baby money? I gotcha baby money. Kidnap your bitch, get that, How much you love your lady? money&quot;. Jadakiss later absolved himself of involvement in any brewing beef on his official Twitter feed.

=== Dispute with Cash Money Records ===
On December 4, 2014, just five days before &quot;Tha Carter V&quot; was due to be released, Carter issued a statement saying the album would not be released on its expected release date, due to his displeasure with Cash Money Records label-boss Birdman, refusing to release the album although it had been completed. Carter also expressed his feelings by stating he felt both he and his creativity were being held &quot;prisoner&quot;.

Upon &quot;Sorry for the Wait 2&quot;″s release on January 20, 2015, he continuously disses Birdman and Cash Money Records, several times throughout the mixtape. Birdman was reported to be upset with this. In late January 2015, Carter sued Birdman and Cash Money Records for $51 million. Carter and Birdman supposedly reconciled after being seen at Drake&#x27;s NYE Party, at Miami&#x27;s Club Liv, and in studio.

On January 27, 2024, both Carter and Birdman reunited during a studio session, putting an end to their nine-year quarrel.

=== Political and racial views ===
In 2013, Carter received criticism after a video released by TMZ showed him apparently stepping on the U.S. flag. Carter later explained that &quot;It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States&quot;, and that he was shooting a video for a song on his upcoming album, &quot;God Bless Amerika&quot;. He says the purpose of the flag was to show that &quot;behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America&quot;.

In late 2016, Carter made statements critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel connected to a damn thing that ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; to do with me. If you do, you crazy as shit,&quot; adding that his status as a wealthy black man who has white fans is evidence that black people are valued in the United States.

<text>Lords of Acid is a Belgian electronic music group, originally formed in 1988 by Praga Khan, Oliver Adams, and Jade 4U. The band is known for their provocative lyrics, blending techno, acid house, and industrial music with themes of sexuality, drug use, and hedonism. Their debut album, &quot;Lust&quot; (1991), became an underground hit, establishing their signature sound.

== History ==
Lords of Acid debuted with the new beat single &quot;I Sit on Acid&quot; in 1988. Created by Praga Khan, Olivier Adams, and Jade 4U; their debut album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Lust&quot; (along with additional singles &quot;Rough Sex&quot; and &quot;I Must Increase My Bust&quot;). Their second album, &quot;Voodoo-U&quot; (1994), features Industrial dance music. This was followed by &quot;Our Little Secret&quot; (1997), a B-side compilation titled &quot;Heaven Is an Orgasm&quot; (1998), and a remix album titled &quot;Expand Your Head&quot; (1999). In 2000 they released a more rock-influenced fourth album titled &quot;Farstucker&quot; and in 2003, after being in the business for fifteen years, released a greatest hits album called &quot;Greatest T*ts&quot;.

Their fifth album &quot;Deep Chills&quot; was released on 10 April 2012. Tracks on the album included &quot;Children of Acid&quot;, &quot;Paranormal Energy&quot; with Zak Bagans, and &quot;Pop That Tooshie&quot; with Alana Evans.

In 2017, Lords of Acid re-released their back catalogue of albums through Metropolis Records as Special Remastered Band Editions, the albums featured bonus tracks selected from B-sides from singles with artwork re-designed by artist/producer Jo-Z Lords. In 2018, Lords of Acid released their sixth album &quot;Pretty in Kink&quot; following a successful Kickstarter campaign.

In early December, 2024 Lords Of Acid&#x27;s manager Marc Jordan confirmed that the band has a new vocalist who will be featured on the new LP and will tour with Lords Of Acid in 2025: “The album will feature vocals from a well-known American female vocalist, known for her groundbreaking stage presence and powerhouse vocals.”

Ruth McArdle died in December 2024. On January 3rd, 2025, Lords of Acid announced that former Butcher Babies vocalist, Carla Harvey has joined the band. 

Lords of Acid&#x27;s soundtrack credits include &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;Paparazzi&quot;, &quot;Virtuosity&quot;, &quot;Sucker Punch&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

<text>Bandolier is the fifth album by Welsh rock band Budgie, released in September 1975 through MCA Records. It reached No. 36 in the UK. The album was released in the US on A&amp;M Records in late 1975. The cover art was created by artist Patrick Woodroffe. This was the first LP to feature drummer Steve Williams, who thereafter would play on all of Budgie&#x27;s releases, along with Burke Shelley.

The song &quot;I Can&#x27;t See My Feelings&quot; was covered by Iron Maiden on the B-side of their 1992 single &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;.

&#x27;Bandolier – Budgie&#x27;, a free iTunes app for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, was released in December 2011. It tells the story of the making of &quot;Bandolier&quot; in the band&#x27;s own words, including an extensive audio interview with Burke Shelley.

<text>James Scott Garner (né Bumgarner; April 7, 1928 – July 19, 2014) was an American actor. He played leading roles in more than 50 theatrical films, which included &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) with Steve McQueen; Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964) with Julie Andrews; &quot;Cash McCall&quot; (1960) with Natalie Wood; &quot;The Wheeler Dealers&quot; (1963) with Lee Remick; &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; (1958) with Stuart Whitman; Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1965) with Eva Marie Saint; as a Formula 1 racing star in &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966); Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Marlowe&quot; (1969) with Bruce Lee; &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; (1969) with Walter Brennan; Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (1982) with Julie Andrews; and &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985) with Sally Field, for which he received an Academy Award nomination. He also starred in several television series, including popular roles such as Bret Maverick in the ABC 1950s Western series &quot;Maverick&quot; and as Jim Rockford in the NBC 1970s private detective show, &quot;The Rockford Files.&quot;

Garner&#x27;s career and popularity continued into the 21st century with films such as &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000) with Clint Eastwood; the animated film &quot;&quot; (2001) (voice work) with Michael J. Fox and Cree Summer; &quot;The Notebook&quot; (2004) with Gena Rowlands and Ryan Gosling; and in his TV sitcom role as Jim Egan in &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; (2003–2005).

==Early life==
Garner was born James Scott Bumgarner on April 7, 1928, in Denver, Oklahoma, (now under Lake Thunderbird). His parents were Weldon Warren Bumgarner (1901–1986), a widower, and Mildred Scott (née Meek; 1907–1933), who died five years after his birth. His father was of part German ancestry. He claims his mother was half Cherokee. His older brothers were Jack Garner, also an actor, and Charles Warren Bumgarner (1924–1984), a school administrator. His family was Methodist. &quot;The family ran a general store at Denver Corner on the east side of Norman.&quot; After their mother&#x27;s death, Garner and his brothers were sent to live with relatives.

Garner attended Wilson Elementary School, Norman Junior High and Norman High School (Norman Public Schools).

Garner was reunited with his family in 1934 when his father remarried, the first of several times. He had a volatile relationship with one of his stepmothers, Wilma, who beat all three boys. He said that his stepmother also punished him by forcing him to wear a dress in public. When he was 14 years old, he fought with her, knocking her down and choking her to keep her from retaliating against him physically. She left the family and never returned. His brother Jack later commented, &quot;She was a damn no-good woman&quot;.

:&quot;I managed to steer pretty clear of it... I was doing all of it, but I never really got caught. I was a bad boy, but I just, you know, they never caught me at it.&quot; — James Garner

Garner&#x27;s last stepmother was Grace, whom he said he loved and called &quot;Mama Grace&quot;, and he felt that she was more of a mother to him than anyone else had been.

Shortly after Garner&#x27;s father&#x27;s marriage to Wilma broke up, his father moved to Los Angeles, leaving Garner and his brothers in Norman. After working at several jobs he disliked, Garner joined the U.S. Merchant Marine at age 16 near the end of World War II. He liked the work and his shipmates, but he had chronic seasickness and only lasted a year.

:&quot;Garner followed his father to Los Angeles in 1945, attending Hollywood High while helping his dad lay carpet. The next five years were back and forth between California and Oklahoma, during which Garner worked in chick hatcheries and the oil fields, as a truck driver and grocery clerk, and even as a swim trunks model for Jantzen...&quot;

After World War II, Garner joined his father in Los Angeles and was enrolled at Hollywood High School, where he was voted the most popular student. A high school gym teacher recommended him for a job modeling Jantzen bathing suits. It paid well ($25 an hour) but, in his first interview for the Archives of American Television, he said he hated modeling. He soon quit and returned to Norman.

There he played football and basketball at Norman High School and competed on the track and golf teams. However, he dropped out in his senior year. In a 1976 &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine interview, he admitted, &quot;I was a terrible student and I never actually graduated from high school, but I got my diploma in the Army.&quot;

===Military service===
Garner enlisted in the California Army National Guard, serving his first 7 months in California. He was deployed to Korea during the Korean War, and spent 14 months as a rifleman in the 5th Regimental Combat Team, then part of the 24th Infantry Division. He was wounded twice: in the face and hand by fragmentation from a mortar round, and in the buttocks by friendly fire from U.S. fighter jets as he dove into a foxhole. Garner would later joke that &quot;there was a lot of room involving my rear end. How could they miss?&quot;

Garner received the Purple Heart in Korea for his initial wounding. He also qualified for a second Purple Heart (for which he was eligible, since he was hit by friendly fire which &quot;was released with the full intent of inflicting damage or destroying enemy troops or equipment&quot;), but did not actually receive it until 1983, 32 years after the event. This was apparently the result of an error which was not rectified until Garner appeared on Good Morning America in November 1982, with presenter David Hartman making inquiries &quot;after he learned of the case on his television show&quot;. At the ceremony where he received his second Purple Heart, Garner understated: &quot;After 32 years, it&#x27;s better to receive this now than posthumously&quot;. Reflecting on his military service, Garner recalled: &quot;Do I have fond memories? I guess if you get together with some buddies it’s fond. But it really wasn’t. It was cold and hard. I was one of the lucky ones.&quot;

====Awards====


==Career==
===Earliest acting roles (1954-1957)===

In 1954, Paul Gregory, a friend whom Garner had met while attending Hollywood High School, persuaded Garner to take a nonspeaking role in the Broadway production of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, where he was able to study Henry Fonda night after night. During the week of Garner&#x27;s death in 2014, TCM broadcast a marathon, July 28, of a dozen of his movies, introduced by Robert Osborne, who said that Fonda&#x27;s gentle, sincere persona rubbed off on Garner, greatly to Garner&#x27;s benefit.

Garner subsequently moved to television commercials and eventually to television roles. In 1955, Garner was considered for the lead role in the Western series &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, which went to Clint Walker because the casting director could not reach Garner in time (according to Garner&#x27;s autobiography). Garner wound up playing an Army officer in the 1955 &quot;Cheyenne&quot; pilot titled &quot;Mountain Fortress&quot;. His first film appearances were in &quot;The Girl He Left Behind&quot; and &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot; in 1956. Also in 1956, Garner appeared with Ralph Bellamy and Gloria Talbott in a half-hour television episode of &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot; titled &quot;Star Over Texas&quot; in which a rivalry exists between Bellamy and Garner over Talbott until they&#x27;re attacked by a group of Native Americans.

In 1957, he had a supporting role in the TV anthology series episode on &quot;Conflict&quot; entitled &quot;Man from 1997,&quot; portraying Maureen&#x27;s brother &quot;Red&quot;; the show stars Jacques Sernas as Johnny Vlakos, Gloria Talbott as Maureen, and Charlie Ruggles as elderly Mr. Boyne, a time-travelling librarian from 1997, and involved a 1997 Almanac that was mistakenly left in the past by Boyne and found by Johnny in a bookstore. The series&#x27; producer Roy Huggins noted in his Archive of American Television interview that he subsequently cast Garner as the lead in &quot;Maverick&quot; due to his comedic facial expressions while playing scenes in &quot;Man from 1997&quot; that were not originally written to be comical (Huggins knew this because he&#x27;d written the episode himself). Garner changed his last name from Bumgarner to Garner after the studio had credited him as &quot;James Garner&quot; without permission. He then legally changed it upon the birth of his child, when he decided she had too many names.
===&quot;Maverick&quot; (1957–1960)===


After several feature film roles, including &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957) with Marlon Brando, Garner got his big break playing the role of professional gambler Bret Maverick in the Western series &quot;Maverick&quot; from 1957 to 1960. In 1959, he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Bret Maverick. 

Only Garner and series creator Roy Huggins thought &quot;Maverick&quot; could compete with &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; but for two years it beat both in the time slot. The show almost immediately made Garner a household name.

Garner was the lone star of &quot;Maverick&quot; for the first seven episodes but production demands forced the studio, Warner Bros., to create a Maverick brother, Bart Maverick, played by Jack Kelly. This allowed two production units to film different story lines and episodes simultaneously, necessary because each episode took an extra day to complete, meaning that eventually the studio would run out of finished episodes to air partway through the season unless another actor was added.

Critics were positive about the chemistry between Garner and Kelly and the series occasionally featured popular cross-over episodes starring both Maverick brothers as well as numerous brief appearances by Kelly in Garner episodes. This included the famous &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres,&quot; upon which the first half of the 1973 movie &quot;The Sting&quot; appears to be based, according to Roy Huggins&#x27; Archive of American Television interview. Garner and guest star Clint Eastwood staged a fistfight in an episode titled &quot;Duel at Sundown&quot;, in which Eastwood played a vicious and cowardly gunslinger. Although Garner quit the series after the third season because of a dispute with Warner Bros., he did make one fourth-season &quot;Maverick&quot; appearance, in an episode titled &quot;The Maverick Line&quot; starring both Garner and Jack Kelly that had been filmed in the third season but held back to run as the season&#x27;s first episode if Garner lost his lawsuit against Warner Bros. Garner won in court, left the series, and the episode was run in the middle of the season instead.

The studio attempted to replace Garner&#x27;s character with a Maverick cousin who had lived in Britain long enough to gain an English accent, featuring Roger Moore as Beau Maverick, but Moore left the series after filming only 14 episodes. Warner Bros. had also hired Robert Colbert, a Garner look-alike, to play a third Maverick brother named Brent Maverick. Colbert only appeared in two episodes toward the end of the season. That left the rest of the series&#x27; run to Kelly, alternating with reruns of episodes with Garner during the fifth season. Garner still received billing during the opening series credits for these newly produced Kelly episodes, aired in the 1961–1962 season, although he did not appear in them and had left the series two years previously. The studio did, however, reverse the billing, at the beginning of each show and in advertisements during the fifth season, billing Kelly above Garner.

Garner played the lead role in &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; (1958). Originally slated for a supporting role, he was given the lead when Charlton Heston turned down the part. He performed well as William Orlando Darby, who was approximately Garner&#x27;s age during World War II. Following Garner&#x27;s success in &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot;, Warner Bros. gave Garner two more major theatrical films to be filmed during breaks in his &quot;Maverick&quot; shooting schedule: &quot;Up Periscope&quot; (1959) with Edmond O&#x27;Brien and the romantic drama &quot;Cash McCall&quot; (1960) with Natalie Wood.

===1960s===

After his acrimonious departure from Warner Bros. in 1960, Garner briefly found himself graylisted by Warner until director William Wyler hired him for a starring role in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961) with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine, a drama about two teachers surviving scandal started by a student. After that, the graylist was broken and Garner abruptly became one of the busiest leading men in cinema. In &quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; (1962) with Kim Novak and Tony Randall and &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; (1963) with Doris Day, he returned to comedy. Garner also starred opposite Day in &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot;, a 1963 remake of 1940&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; in which Garner portrayed the role originally played by Cary Grant. (The remake had begun as &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;, but was recast and retitled after Marilyn Monroe died and Dean Martin chose to withdraw as a result.)

Next came the war dramas &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) with Steve McQueen, Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964) with Julie Andrews, and Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1965) with Eva Marie Saint (all three pictures are set in World War II and both the latter two films involve D-Day). In the smash hit &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, Garner played the second lead for the only time during the decade, supporting fellow ex-TV series cowboy McQueen among a cast of British and American screen veterans including Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, David McCallum, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson in a story depicting a mass escape from a German prisoner of war camp based on a true story. The film was released in the same month as &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot;, giving Garner two hit films at the box office at the same time.
&quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot;, a literate antiwar D-Day comedy, featured a screenplay written by Paddy Chayefsky and remained Garner&#x27;s favorite of all his work. In 1963, exhibitors voted him the 16th most popular star in the US and it was hoped that he might be a successor to Clark Gable. He also made &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; (1966), a picture depicting a man suddenly suffering from amnesia while sitting on a bench in Central Park.


By October 1964, Garner had formed his own independent film production company, Cherokee Productions. He next starred in the Cherokee co-production, Norman Jewison&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Art of Love&quot; (1965) with Dick Van Dyke and Elke Sommer. The Westerns &quot;Duel at Diablo&quot; (1966) with Sidney Poitier and &quot;Hour of the Gun&quot; (1967) with Garner as Wyatt Earp and Jason Robards Jr. as Doc Holliday followed, as well as the comedy &quot;A Man Could Get Killed&quot; (1966) with Melina Mercouri and Tony Franciosa. &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966) with Eva Marie Saint and Yves Montand, directed by John Frankenheimer and co-produced through Garner&#x27;s Cherokee Productions, left Garner with a fascination for car racing that he often explored by actually racing during the ensuing years. The expensive Cinerama epic by MGM did not fare as well as expected at the box office and, together with the poor performance of his last six films, he was blamed for the movie not doing better, which damaged Garner&#x27;s theatrical film career.

In 1969, despite opposition from some at MGM and having to plead his case, Garner played Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe in &quot;Marlowe&quot;, a neo-noir featuring an early extended kung fu scene with the martial artist and actor Bruce Lee. The same year, Garner scored a hit with the comedy Western &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; with Walter Brennan and Jack Elam.

===1970s===
====&quot;Nichols&quot; (1971–1972)====

In 1971, Garner returned to television in an offbeat series, &quot;Nichols&quot;, in which his character was killed and replaced by a less colorful twin brother at the end of the series. In one explanation for the unusual denouement, the recast as the character&#x27;s somewhat more normal twin brother would have hopefully created a more popular series with few cast changes. However, according to Garner&#x27;s 1999 videotaped Archive of American Television interview, Garner killed his character because they had already cancelled the show and played his own twin because they had to finish the episode.

====Feature films====
Also in 1969 he starred in &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter!&quot; (similar to the Western spoof &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot;), while in the frontier comedy &quot;Skin Game&quot;, Garner and Louis Gossett Jr. starred as con men pretending to be a slaveowner and his slave during the pre-Civil War era. The following year, Garner played a small town sheriff investigating a murder in &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot; with Katharine Ross. He appeared in two Disney films also starring Vera Miles as his leading lady, &quot;One Little Indian&quot; (1973), featuring Jodie Foster in an early minor role, and &quot;The Castaway Cowboy&quot; (1974) with Robert Culp.

====&quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (1974–1980)====
In the 1970s, Roy Huggins had an idea to remake &quot;Maverick&quot;, but this time as a modern-day private detective. Huggins worked with co-creator Stephen J. Cannell to rekindle the success of &quot;Maverick&quot;, eventually recycling many of the plots from the original series in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, according to both Huggins&#x27; and Cannell&#x27;s Archive of American Television interviews. Starting with the 1974 season, Garner appeared as private investigator Jim Rockford for six seasons, for which he received an Emmy Award for Best Actor in 1977. In the 2016 book titled &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz stated that the series gave Garner &quot;the role he was put on earth to play&quot;. Veteran character actor Noah Beery Jr. played Rockford&#x27;s father &quot;Rocky&quot;.

Between 1978 and 1985, Garner co-starred with Mariette Hartley, who had made an Emmy-nominated appearance on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, in 250 TV commercials for Polaroid, a manufacturer of instant film and cameras. They portrayed a bantering, bickering couple so convincingly that some viewers believed that the two were married. After six seasons, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; was cancelled in 1980. The physical toll on Garner resulted in his doctor ordering him to take some time off to rest. Appearing in nearly every scene of the series, doing many of his own stunts—including one that injured his back—was wearing him out. A knee injury from his National Guard days worsened in the wake of the continuous jumping and rolling, and he was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer in 1979. When Garner&#x27;s physician ordered him to rest, the studio immediately cancelled &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

Stuart Margolin (who played Angel Martin in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;) said that despite Garner&#x27;s health problems in the later years of &quot;The Rockford Files,&quot; he would often work long shifts, unusual for a starring actor, staying to do off-camera lines with other actors, doing his own stunts despite his knee problems. When Garner later made &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; television movies, he said that 22 people (with the exception of series co-star Beery, who died late in 1994) came out of retirement to participate.

In July 1983, Garner filed suit against Universal Studios for US$16.5 million in connection with his ongoing dispute from &quot;The Rockford Files.&quot; The suit charged Universal with &quot;breach of contract; failure to deal in good faith and fairly; and fraud and deceit&quot;. Garner alleged that Universal was &quot;creatively accounting&quot;, two words that are now part of the Hollywood lexicon. The suit was eventually settled out of court in 1989. As part of the agreement, Garner could not disclose the amount of the settlement.

&quot;The industry is like it always has been. It&#x27;s a bunch of greedy people,&quot; he stated in 1990. Garner sued Universal again in 1998 for $2.2 million over syndication royalties. In this suit, he charged the studio with &quot;deceiving him and suppressing information about syndication&quot;. He was supposed to receive $25,000 per episode that ran in syndication, but Universal charged him &quot;distribution fees&quot;. He also felt that the studio did not release the show to the highest bidder for the episode reruns.

====&quot;The New Maverick&quot; (1978)====
Garner and Jack Kelly reappeared as Bret and Bart Maverick in a 1978 made-for-television film titled &quot;The New Maverick&quot; written by Juanita Bartlett, directed by Hy Averback, and also starring Susan Sullivan as Poker Alice. As had often been the case in episodes of the original series, Bret&#x27;s brother Bart shows up only briefly toward the end.

&quot;The New Maverick&quot; served as the pilot for a failed television series, &quot;Young Maverick&quot;, featuring the adventures of Bret and Bart&#x27;s younger cousin Ben Maverick, portrayed in both &quot;The New Maverick&quot; and &quot;Young Maverick&quot; by Charles Frank. The series itself, which presented Garner for only a few moments at the beginning of the first show, was canceled so rapidly that some of the episodes filmed were never broadcast in the United States. Despite the title, Frank was three years older than Garner had been at the launch of the original series.

===1980s===
====&quot;Bret Maverick&quot; (1981–1982)====
After the abrupt disappearance of &quot;Young Maverick&quot; two seasons earlier, an attempt to make a &quot;Maverick&quot; series without Garner, he returned to his earlier TV role in 1981 in the revival series &quot;Bret Maverick&quot;, but NBC unexpectedly canceled the show after only one season despite reasonably good ratings. Critics noted that the scripts did not measure up to the episodes starring Garner in the first series. Jack Kelly (Bart Maverick) was slated to become a series regular had the show been picked up for another season. Kelly was presented with a stack of finished scripts featuring Bart Maverick for the upcoming second season, and he appeared in the last scene of the final episode in a surprise guest appearance.

====TV movies====
During the 1980s, Garner played dramatic roles in a number of television films, including &quot;Heartsounds&quot; with Mary Tyler Moore featuring the true story of a doctor (played by Garner) who is deprived of oxygen for too long during an operation and wakes up mentally impaired; &quot;Promise&quot; with James Woods and Piper Laurie, about dealing with a mentally ill adult sibling; and &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot; with James Woods, in which Garner portrays the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1984, he played the lead in Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s &quot;The Glitter Dome&quot; for HBO Pictures, which was directed by his &quot;Rockford Files&quot; co-star Stuart Margolin. The film generated a mild controversy for a bondage sequence featuring Garner and co-star Margot Kidder.
In 1984 he also starred in the movie &quot;Tank&quot;, about a soon-to-be retiring US Army Command Sergeant Major named Zack Carey who butted heads with a corrupt local sheriff after an incident with one of his deputies off base and used a privately owned Sherman tank to exact justice.

====&quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985)====
Garner&#x27;s only Oscar nomination was for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the film &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1985), opposite Sally Field. Field and director Martin Ritt had to fight the studio, Columbia Pictures, to have Garner cast, since he was regarded as a TV actor by then despite having co-starred in the box office hit &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; opposite Julie Andrews two years earlier. Columbia did not want to make the movie, because it had no &quot;sex or violence&quot; in it. But because of the success of &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979), with the same star (Field), director, and screenplay writing team (Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch), and with Field&#x27;s new production company (Fogwood Films) producing, Columbia agreed. L wanted Marlon Brando to play the part of Murphy, so Field and Ritt had to insist on Garner. Part of the deal from the studio, which at that time was owned by The Coca-Cola Company, included an eight-line sequence of Field and Garner saying the word &quot;Coke,&quot; and also having Coke signs appear prominently in the film. In A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot; of Garner, Field reported that her on-screen kiss with Garner was the best cinematic kiss she had ever experienced.

====&quot;Sunset&quot; (1988)====
Garner played Wyatt Earp (whom he physically resembled) in two very different movies shot 21 years apart, John Sturges&#x27;s &quot;Hour of the Gun&quot; in 1967 and Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Sunset&quot; in 1988. The first film was a realistic depiction of the O.K. Corral shootout and its aftermath, while the second centered around a comedic fictional adventure shared by Earp and silent movie cowboy star Tom Mix. Earp had actually worked as a consultant for Western films during the silent film era toward the end of his life. The movie features Bruce Willis as Mix in only his second movie role. Although Willis was billed over Garner, the film actually gave more screen time and emphasis to Earp.

For the second half of the 1980s, Garner also appeared in several of the North American market Mazda television commercials as an on-screen spokesman.

===1990s===
In 1991, Garner starred in &quot;Man of the People&quot;, a television series about a con man chosen to fill an empty seat on a city council, with Kate Mulgrew and Corinne Bohrer. Despite reasonably fair ratings, the show was canceled after only 10 episodes.

In 1993, Garner played the lead in a well-received HBO movie, the true story &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;, and went on to reprise his role as Jim Rockford in eight &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; made-for-TV movies beginning the following year. Practically everyone in the original cast of recurring characters returned for the new episodes except Noah Beery Jr., who had died in the interim. According to Garner&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Garner Files&quot;, he insisted upon being fully paid in cash before the shooting began on each of the Rockford TV-movies.

In 1994, Garner played Marshal Zane Cooper in a movie version of &quot;Maverick&quot;, with Mel Gibson as Bret Maverick (in the end it is revealed that Garner&#x27;s character is the father of Gibson&#x27;s Maverick) and Jodie Foster as a gambling lass with a fake Southern accent.

In 1995, he played lead character Woodrow Call, an ex-lawman, in the TV miniseries sequel to &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; entitled &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, based on Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel. In 1996, Garner and Jack Lemmon teamed up in &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot;, playing two former presidents who uncover scandalous activity by their successor (Dan Aykroyd) and are pursued by murderous NSA agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=myfellowamericans.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a major recurring role during the last part of the run of TV series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, Garner also starred in two short-lived series, the animated &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot; and &quot;First Monday&quot;, in which he played a fictional version of the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice of the United States.

===2000s and 2010s===
In 2000, after an operation to replace both knees,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/entertainment/ca-18538&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Garner appeared with Clint Eastwood, who had played a villain in the original &quot;Maverick&quot; series in the episode &quot;Duel at Sundown,&quot; as astronauts in the movie &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;, also featuring Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland.

In 2001, Garner voiced Commander Rourke in &quot;&quot;. In 2002, following the death of James Coburn, Garner took over Coburn&#x27;s role as TV commercial voiceover for Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rock&quot; advertising campaign. Garner continued to voice the commercials until the end of the campaign. Also in 2002, he played Sandra Bullock&#x27;s father in &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; as Shepard James &quot;Shep&quot; Walker. After the death of John Ritter in 2003, Garner joined the cast of &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; as Grandpa Jim Egan (Cate&#x27;s father) and remained with the series until it finished in 2005.

In 2004, Garner starred as the older version of Ryan Gosling&#x27;s character in the film version of Nicholas Sparks&#x27;s &quot;The Notebook&quot; alongside Gena Rowlands as his wife, directed by Nick Cassavetes, Rowlands&#x27;s son. The Screen Actors Guild nominated Garner as best actor for &quot;Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role&quot;. In 2006, Garner made his last personal appearance in the film &quot;The Ultimate Gift&quot; as billionaire Howard &quot;Red&quot; Stevens. In 2010, Garner voiced Shazam in &quot;Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam&quot;.

===Memoir===

On November 1, 2011, Simon &amp; Schuster published Garner&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Garner Files: A Memoir&quot;. In addition to recounting his career, the memoir, co-written with nonfiction writer Jon Winokur, detailed the childhood abuses Garner suffered at the hands of his stepmother. It also offered frank, unflattering assessments of some of Garner&#x27;s co-stars such as Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. In addition to recalling the genesis of most of Garner&#x27;s hit films and television shows, the book also featured a section where the star provided individual critiques for every one of his acting projects accompanied by a star rating for each. Garner&#x27;s three-time co-star Julie Andrews wrote the book&#x27;s foreword. Lauren Bacall, Diahann Carroll, Doris Day, Tom Selleck, Stephen J. Cannell, and many other Garner associates, friends, and relatives provided their memories of the star in the book&#x27;s coda.

The &quot;most explosive revelation&quot; in his autobiography was that Garner smoked marijuana for much of his adult life. &quot;I started smoking it in my late teens,&quot; Garner wrote.

===Awards and nominations===
Garner was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards during his television career, winning twice: in 1977 as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (&quot;The Rockford Files&quot;), and in 1987 as executive producer of &quot;Promise&quot;.

For his contribution to the television industry, Garner received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1990, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame that same year. In February 2005, he received the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. He was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role that year, for &quot;The Notebook&quot;. When Morgan Freeman won that prize for his work in &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, Freeman led the audience in a sing-along of the original &quot;Maverick&quot; theme song, written by David Buttolph and Paul Francis Webster.

In 2010, the Television Critics Association gave Garner its annual Career Achievement Award.

===Statue===

On April 21, 2006, a bronze statue of Garner as Bret Maverick was unveiled in Garner&#x27;s hometown of Norman, Oklahoma, with Garner present at the ceremony.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
Despite his popularity and sociable nature, Garner was seen by others as a down-to-earth man who kept his family life private.
Garner was married once, to Lois Josephine Fleischman Clarke, whom he met at a party in 1956. They wed 16 days later on August 17, 1956. &quot;We went to dinner every night for 14 nights. I was just absolutely nuts about her. I spent $77 on our honeymoon, and it about broke me.&quot; According to Garner, &quot;Marriage is like the Army; everyone complains, but you&#x27;d be surprised at the large number of people who re-enlist.&quot; His wife practiced Judaism.

When Garner and Clarke married, Lois&#x27; daughter from a previous marriage was seven years old and recovering from polio. Garner had one daughter with Lois who was born on January 4, 1958.

Garner and his wife Lois were still married at his death in 2014, although they had had two periods of separation: the first for three months in 1970, and the second in 1979. The couple reunited two years later in September 1981. 

Garner stated that during this second period apart he split his time between Canada and &quot;a rented house in the Valley.&quot; In each case Garner said the separations were caused by the stress of his acting career and were not due to marital problems. In the case of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; he was in almost every scene while in constant pain due to his arthritic knees, and under tremendous stress from the studio. Garner stated that when he quit the series in 1979, he simply needed to spend time alone in order to recover. 

Garner&#x27;s death in 2014 was less than a month before their 58th wedding anniversary. His wife died seven years later, on October 30, 2021.

===Racing===
In his youth, Garner had raced with &quot;hot cars&quot; in &quot;chases&quot;, but his interest in auto racing was magnified during preparations for the filming of &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. John Frankenheimer, the director and impetus behind the project, was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. He was trying to determine which actor he could focus on for high speed takes. At his disposal were the services of Bob Bondurant, a Formula 1 racer who was serving as technical consultant for the film. The first step was to place the actors in a two-seater version of a Formula 1 car to see how they would handle the high speeds. Bondurant noted that all the actors became quite frightened going over 240 kph, (149 mph) except Garner, who returned to the pit laughing like an excited child. Said Bondurant, &quot;This is your man&quot;. From there on out, all the actors were placed in a race driver training program except for Garner, whom Bonderant was assigned to personally train. Garner proved to be a good student, a hard worker and a talented driver. Compared to the other actors in the movie, Bondurant tagged Garner as being &#x27;light years&#x27; ahead. By the end of the film Bonderant asserted that Garner could compete on a Formula 1 team, and would best some of the drivers currently in the field.

Following the completion of &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, Garner become involved in auto racing. From 1967 through 1969 Garner was an owner of the &quot;American International Racers&quot; (AIR) auto racing team. Motorsports writer William Edgar and Hollywood director Andy Sidaris teamed with Garner for the racing documentary &quot;The Racing Scene&quot;, filmed in 1969 and released in 1970. The team fielded cars at the Le Mans, Daytona, and Sebring endurance races, but is best known for raising public awareness in early off-road motor-sports events, in many of which Garner competed. In 1978, he was one of the inaugural inductees in the Off-Road Motorsports Hall of Fame.

Garner signed a three-year sponsorship contract with American Motors Corporation (AMC). His shops prepared ten 1969 SC/Ramblers for the Baja 500 race. Garner did not drive in this event because of a film commitment in Spain that year. Nevertheless, seven of his cars finished the grueling race, taking three of the top five places in the sedan class. Garner also drove the pace car at the Indianapolis 500 race in 1975, 1977, and 1985 (see: list of Indianapolis 500 pace cars).

In 1987 Garner announced plans to partner with Larry Cahill to form a racing team to compete in the 1988 Indycar season. The intention was to base the team in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where Cahill operated his businesses. The estimated budget was $3.5 million. Plans for this team never came to fruition.
Cahill later formed his own team to compete in the Indy Racing League.

===Golf===
Garner was an avid golfer for many years. Along with his brother, Jack, he played golf in high school. Jack even attempted a professional golfing career after a brief stint in the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball farm system. Garner took it up again in the late 1950s to see if he could beat Jack. He was a regular for years at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. In February 1990 at the AT&amp;T Golf Tournament, he won the Most Valuable Amateur Trophy. Garner appeared on Sam Snead&#x27;s Celebrity Golf TV series, which aired from 1960 – 1963. These matches were 9-hole charity events pitting Snead against Hollywood celebrities.

===American football===
Garner was noted as an enthusiastic fan of the Raiders in the NFL; he regularly attended games and mixed with the players. He was also present when the Raiders won Super Bowl XVIII over the Washington Redskins in January 1984 at Tampa, Florida.

===University of Oklahoma===
Garner was a supporter of the University of Oklahoma, often returning to Norman for school functions. When he attended Oklahoma Sooners football games, he frequently could be seen on the sidelines or in the press box. Garner received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree at OU in 1995.

In 2003, to endow the James Garner Chair in the School of Drama, he donated $500,000 towards a total $1 million endowment for the first endowed position at the drama school.

===Politics===
Garner was a strong Democratic Party supporter.

On August 28, 1963, Garner was one of several celebrities to join Martin Luther King Jr. in the &quot;March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.&quot; In his autobiography, Garner recalled sitting in the third row listening to King&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.
:&quot;If there was an environmental cause, James Garner was there&quot; — Zev Yaroslavsky
In July 1964, Garner, over a master plan for a 92-square-mile Santa Monica Mountains area, engaged in a public quarrel with Karl L. Rundberg, a Los Angeles City Council member, at a council meeting. Later, Garner, Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster, became founding members of the &quot;Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains&quot; conservancy group, according to the book &quot;Transforming California&quot; by Stephanie S. Pincetl, but contested by Dash Stolarz, spokesperson for the state&#x27;s Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy

In the 1980s, Garner worked against oil drilling offshore of Will Rogers State Beach.

From 1982, Garner gave at least $29,000 to Federal campaigns, of which over $24,000 was to Democratic Party candidates, including Dennis Kucinich (for Congress in 2002), Dick Gephardt, John Kerry, Barbara Boxer, and various Democratic committees and groups.
For his role in the 1985 CBS miniseries &quot;Space&quot;, the character&#x27;s party affiliation was changed from Republican to Democrat, as in the book, to reflect Garner&#x27;s personal views. Garner said, &quot;My wife would leave me if I played a Republican.&quot;

===Friendship with Richmond Barthé===
Garner became a friend, supporter and main benefactor of African-American sculptor Richmond Barthé, from the time the latter returned from Europe in 1977 and settled in Pasadena, until Barthé&#x27;s death in 1989.

==Health issues and death==
Garner&#x27;s knees became a chronic problem during the filming of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; in the 1970s, with &quot;six or seven knee operations during that time.&quot; In 2000, he underwent knee replacement surgery for both knees.

On April 22, 1988, Garner had quintuple bypass heart surgery. Though he recovered rapidly, he was advised to stop smoking. Garner eventually quit smoking 17 years later in 2005.: &quot;My dad had smoked since he was 12 years old,&quot; recalled daughter Gigi Garner.

Garner underwent surgery on May 11, 2008, following a severe stroke he had suffered two days earlier. His prognosis was reported to be &quot;very positive&quot;.

On July 19, 2014, police and rescue personnel were summoned to Garner&#x27;s Brentwood, Los Angeles home, where they found the actor dead at the age of 86. He had a heart attack caused by coronary artery disease. He had been in poor health since his stroke in 2008.

Longtime friends Tom Selleck (who worked with Garner on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;), Sally Field (who starred with Garner in &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot;), and Clint Eastwood (who guest-starred with Garner on &quot;Maverick&quot; and starred in &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;) reflected on his death. Selleck said, &quot;Jim was a mentor to me and a friend, and I will miss him.&quot; Field said, &quot;My heart just broke. There are few people on this planet I have adored as much as Jimmy Garner. I cherish every moment I spent with him and relive them over and over in my head. He was a diamond.&quot; Eastwood said, &quot;Garner opened the door for people like Steve McQueen and myself.&quot;

==Recognition==
In 2004, Garner was given a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award.

In 2006, a James Garner statue was installed at Main Street and Jones Avenue, Norman, Oklahoma.

<text>&quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; is a 1993 comic book story made by Don Rosa for The Walt Disney Company, mentioned by Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide as &quot;possibly the greatest comic book story of all time&quot;. Although afraid at the time of its creation of cramming too many historical details into the story, Rosa himself mentions in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #383 (November, 2008) that in fan mail he receives to this day, &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; to his own surprise is often referred to as &quot;&#x27;the best Rosa story&#x27; or &#x27;the best Duck story&#x27; or even &#x27;the best comic book story&#x27; (?!!) that fans say they&#x27;ve ever read.&quot;

In this story Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie, and General Snozzie search for the Lost Library of Alexandria. This story was Don Rosa&#x27;s first use of General Snozzie, the Junior Woodchucks bloodhound.

The story was first published in the Danish &quot;Anders And &amp; Co.&quot; #1993-42; the first American publication was in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #27, in July 1994.

== Background ==
Rosa created &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; at the request of Scandinavia-based, European Disney publisher Egmont in reference to the fact that Norway had officially declared 1993 to be &quot;The Year of The Book&quot; in order to promote reading (as the story was published in Norway and Denmark in 1993, one year prior to its first edition in the original English). Rosa figured that he would honor the written word best by sending the Ducks on an epic quest for the Library of Alexandria, where he:

:&quot;could show the evolution of books from papyrus scrolls through parchment tomes and the first Gutenberg volumes on up to the present day. &quot;[...]&quot; In the process, it was easy to show how books have recorded and even inspired the advancements of science and art through the ages &quot;[...]&quot;. And what could be better than for the key to tracing the Library around the world be that most famous mythical book of all - the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook?!&quot;

== Plot ==
Donald Duck and his nephews go to the new Woodchuck Museum to see the exhibit on artifacts from the first Junior Woodchucks. The nephews are particularly enthusiastic about an old, worn, massive volume that is the oldest known copy of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook. 

Scrooge McDuck is also there to get a copy of the Guidebook, which he knows contains an enormous wealth of information. However, the scoutmaster refuses, on the regulation that McDuck is too old to join the organization, and only members are allowed to read its guidebook. Also the scoutmaster suspects, correctly, that Scrooge would use the information mainly to enrich himself, as he has recently done by acquiring the entire log books of the 16th century Spanish fleet to find lost treasures. Scrooge tells the nephews that he would like to find the Library of Alexandria for the same purpose. The head of The Junior Woodchucks organization agrees to sponsor Scrooge&#x27;s trip in the name of science as well as lend out General Snozzie, the Woodchucks bloodhound. Scrooge and the nephews set out to find the lost library, leaving behind Donald totally oblivious to the events as he sits constantly glued to the TV, currently holding the occupation of Scrooge&#x27;s Money Bin guard.

They set out to Egypt, where they find an underground chamber with a million bronze tubes containing the original scrolls of the Library of Alexandria. Unfortunately, it turns out that the scrolls have long crumbled to dust. Cleopatra had however founded a special organization, &quot;The Guardians of the Great Library&quot;, to protect the unique book collection. Still in operation centuries later, the Guardians had extensive parchment copies made of the contents of the library, which were shipped to Byzantium, Greece around 400 AD, to become known as the Library of Constantinople.

In Istanbul, modern-day Turkey, these &quot;100,000 parchment scrolls&quot; (&quot;perhaps they left out the plays and poetry&quot;) once were &quot;the light of the Dark Ages for 800 years&quot; and had &quot;the books from the great libraries of Islam&quot; added to them over time. However, the entire collection finally perished in a fire. Yet the contents survived, since for centuries the Orthodox monks had copied them into the modern technology of 10,000 manuscripts (with each hand-written book holding 10 original scrolls). This Byzantine Library of manuscripts was however stolen in 1204 in the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, with crusader knights bringing the books to Venice.

In Venice, these books were kept in an abbey whose library henceforth &quot;sparked the Renaissance&quot;, inspired &quot;Leonardo and Michelangelo&quot;, and motivated Marco Polo and his father to journey to the Orient, paying back the library by adding the Great Books from Kublai Khan&#x27;s Empire of Cathay to it upon Marco&#x27;s return. The Venice Library was lost in 1485 during the collapse of the abbey&#x27;s bell tower, but following the invention of movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439, the rotting books had been saved in their entirety by making their first typeset copy &quot;of about 1,000 volumes&quot;, with each typeset book containing 10 manuscripts.

Inspired by Phoenician accounts dating 600 BCE of rich new lands beyond the Western ocean in the books, Lorenzo de Medici sent a bookdealer named Cristobal Colon in 1484 to buy these 1,000 volumes, but Colon never turned the books over to the Medici family. When Scrooge and the nephews find out that the English name of this bookdealer-turned sailor happens to be Christopher Columbus and that Columbus&#x27;s private library is in Seville, Spain, Scrooge is pacing out the door, &quot;already halfway across France&quot;.

In the Biblioteca Colombina, they are forced to decipher Columbus&#x27; private notes hand-written in a secret, unknown code by means of the Woodchuck Guidebook, to find out Columbus had the library moved to Santo Domingo in 1498, far from the reach of the Medici and the Spanish King, but Ferdinand II of Aragon soon found out and had Columbus put into chains.

Scrooge and the nephews hurry back to Duckburg (where they encounter Donald still in front of the TV, making condescending remarks about their passion for &quot;some dusty old library books&quot;) to search Scrooge&#x27;s above-mentioned Spanish logs to find out whether the library had ever been removed from the island. Apparently, Francisco Pizarro had it moved to his new capital, modern-day Lima, Peru in 1535, where beginning in 1551, the scholars at San Marcos University added &quot;all the knowledge of the Mayans, Aztecs, Incas, and Olmecs&quot;. When the Spanish tried to send the library home to Spain in 1579, the ships were captured by Sir Francis Drake. As the battle had damaged his own ship, Drake was forced to go ashore on the coast of Nova Albion, founding Fort Drake Borough which later became Duckburg, for the sole purpose of burying the library below the fort, on Killmotor Hill where Scrooge built his Money Bin in 1902 (see Fort Duckburg).

Hurrying into old caves and bricked gangways Scrooge never explored before below the Bin, they find a large crypt full of old books. On closer inspection, only the covers are left, since the vellum pages turn out to have been eaten by rats. Scrooge is furious because the library seems to have perished once and for all.

However, in the middle of the room stands a metal case, with the emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library our heroes first saw in Egypt: an Ibis symbolizing Thoth, the Egyptian deity of wisdom and writing. An inscription on a metal plate by the last survivor of Drakeborough tells how he, on Drake&#x27;s orders, had the library condensed into one single volume with every information no other surviving book in the world included. As the Lost Library&#x27;s last guardian, he had this one book sealed into this rat-proof metal box. Scrooge is triumphant that the unique essence of the library seems to have survived after all, but upon opening the box he is deeply frustrated to find it empty.

The nephews stitch the remaining puzzle together: the British didn&#x27;t find the library when they reoccupied Drakeborough, but Cornelius Coot, the founder of the City of Duckburg, found it during the late 18th century, and left the book to his son Clinton Coot, the founder of the Junior Woodchucks. The very volume that was on display in the Woodchuck Museum at the beginning of the story, it was used as the framework for the Junior Woodchuck&#x27;s Guidebook, the only one book in the world Scrooge cannot buy. This not only explains why the Guidebook facilitated them to follow the trail of the Lost Library all over the world with its enormous knowledge base, but also the fact the Junior Woodchuck&#x27;s logo, based on the letters J and two Ws, looks uncannily like the inverted Ibis emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library.

Later on, Scrooge comments on how depressed he is about not getting the books he has traveled all over the globe for, until the boys remind him that he would have had to turn the library over to Alexandria. Scrooge gets excited about how much money he saved on the fine he would have had to pay otherwise for 1,000,000 library scrolls each overdue for 2,000 years, and Donald complains about the noise drowning out the TV, muttering &quot;Cripes! They&#x27;re still going on about their stupid library! As if messing with books was as interesting as watching TV! Hah! That&#x27;ll be the day!&quot;

== Historical accuracy ==
The story contains at least one potential historical error: It apparently claims that Alexander the Great intended Alexandria to be the capital of his empire. Actually, he built it to be the capital of Egypt but not of the entire empire. Babylon was the capital of Alexander&#x27;s empire, even though Alexandria became the capital of the diadochic Ptolemaic Kingdom under Alexander&#x27;s immediate successor Ptolemy I Soter.

The exact quote found in &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot;, &quot;The city was founded by Alexander the Great in the fourth century B. C. to be the capital of his empire!&quot; is a bit ambiguous, meaning either that it was Alexander&#x27;s direct personal intention or that it was about to happen independently of whatever Alexander had intended.

== Disney and in-universe references ==
=== Disney reference ===
Scrooge makes a reference to Mickey Mouse not being published anymore. That was true during the time this story was first published but it was mainly used as an inside joke.

=== Duckburg genealogy ===
The names Fulton Gearloose and Clinton Coot were first used in this story but it was not revealed that they were the fathers of Gyro Gearloose and Grandma Duck, respectively.

=== Other stories by Don Rosa ===
&quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; was later referenced in Part 10: &quot;The Invader of Fort Duckburg&quot; (1994), of Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; where in 1902 the first three Junior Woodchucks are expelled from their former headquarter, the ruins of Fort Duckburg recently bought by Scrooge. As the boyscouts walk down Killmotor Hill, along with some JWC pennants they carry a large, old volume with the Iris Emblem of the Guardians of the Lost Library with them. One of the Junior Woodchucks says &quot;Someday we&#x27;ve just got to make pocket-size copies of this monster!&quot;

As the condensed book passed on by the last survivor of Drakeborough and found by Clinton Coot is the framework for the first edition of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, in Rosa&#x27;s later story &quot;The Lost Charts of Columbus&quot; (1995), the Junior Woodchucks intend to raise funds for excavations at the site of Cleopatra&#x27;s hidden library in Egypt before it was brought to Byzantium. So they organize a raffle and Gladstone Gander wins a fishing trip to Canada, where he recovers the Golden Helmet from Barks&#x27;s eponymous story, allowing Azure Blue to resume his plans of owning North America. Above-mentioned ancient Phoenician accounts of the Americas having inspired Lorenzo de Medici and Christopher Columbus in &quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; are revisited in this story as well.

== Publication history ==

&quot;Guardians of the Lost Library&quot; was first published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #27, July, 1994. Compared to European prints, this original English-language edition was of a poor quality where on a number of pages the CMYK printing plates had been misaligned resulting in more than obvious color fringing.

The story was eventually re-published at a higher printing quality in Gemstone&#x27;s &quot;60 Years of Uncle $crooge&quot; celebratory edition &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #383, November, 2008 (which turned out to be Gemstone&#x27;s ultimate Disney comic publication, as Boom! Kids was about to take over publishing Disney&#x27;s classic characters starting September, 2009). Again, original art by Rosa was used for the cover, however the artwork used for the 2008 reprint had been initially made by Rosa not specifically as cover art but as part of a series of collectibles related to his stories that had been originally published by French Disney magazine &quot;Picsou Magazine&quot; in 2004. While the 2008 reprint featured a superior printing quality and the 2008 cover was shaded as usual with North American Disney comics, with the reprinted story itself Gemstone replaced Gladstone Publishing&#x27;s 1994 finer-graded colorization featuring many soft gradients with Egmont&#x27;s European solid-hue color scheme.

<text>Murphy&#x27;s Romance is a 1985 American romantic-comedy film directed by Martin Ritt. The screenplay by Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch was based on the 1980 novella by Max Schott. The film stars Sally Field, James Garner, Brian Kerwin, and Corey Haim, and was produced by Laura Ziskin for Field&#x27;s production company Fogwood Films.

The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Love for the Last Time&quot;, is performed by Carole King.

==Plot summary==
Emma Moriarty is a 33-year-old, divorced mother who moves to a rural Arizona town to make a living by training and boarding horses. She becomes friends with the town&#x27;s pharmacist, Murphy Jones, an idiosyncratic widower. A romance between them seems unlikely because of Murphy&#x27;s age and because Emma allows her ex-husband, Bobby Jack Moriarty, to move back in with her and their 12-year-old son Jake.

Emma struggles to make ends meet, but is helped by Murphy. While refusing to help her outright with charity or personal loan, Murphy gives a part-time job to Jake and buys a horse with her assistance, boarding it with Emma and encouraging others to do the same. He also provides emotional support for Emma and Jake.

A rivalry develops between Murphy and Bobby Jack, who is immature and dishonest. Emma and Murphy fall in love despite Bobby Jack&#x27;s efforts to hamper their romance. Bobby Jack finally leaves town after an 18-year-old he had a fling with appears at the ranch with their newborn twin sons. With him gone, Murphy and Emma are free to pursue a relationship.

==Cast==
==Production==
Columbia did not want to make the picture at all because it had no &quot;sex or violence&quot; in it. However, Columbia agreed because of the success of &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979), with the same star (Field), director, and screenwriting team (Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch), and with Field&#x27;s new production company Fogwood Films producing. Columbia then wanted Marlon Brando, or someone with &quot;greater box-office allure&quot;, to play the part of Murphy. Field and Ritt fought Columbia to cast Garner, whom then studio viewed at that point as primarily a television actor, despite having enjoyed a flourishing film career in the 1950s and 60s and having co-starred in the box-office hit &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; in 1982.

When Ritt gave the Max Schott story to Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, the same married screenplay team that worked on &quot;Hud&quot; (1963) with Ritt and Paul Newman, they wanted Newman to be in &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot;. Field had worked successfully with Newman in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, but Newman declined the project, and Garner was the only other actor that Ritt and Field had asked.

Part of the deal from the studio, which at that time was owned by The Coca-Cola Company, included an eight-line sequence of Field and Garner saying the word &quot;Coke&quot;, and having Coke products and signs appear prominently in the film.

On the A&amp;E television program &quot;Biography&quot; of Garner, &quot;James Garner: Hollywood Maverick&quot;, Field reported that her on-screen kiss with Garner was the best cinematic kiss she had experienced.

Filming took place on location in Florence, Arizona, and the town&#x27;s preserved Main Street appears throughout the movie.

The film was scheduled for general release during the weekend for 1985 Christmas Day, but Columbia moved it to the weekends of January 17 and January 31, 1986, to avoid competing with the holiday lineup of films. It did a limited, selected, release for the film on December 25, 1985, so that it would qualify for that year&#x27;s Academy Awards.

The screenplay is very different from the Max Schott novella. In the Schott story, Murphy and Emma stay just platonic friends. Murphy marries someone else, and then tries to find Emma a suitable husband.

The film was one of the final titles to be released on the now defunct CED Videodisc format in 1986.

==Reception==
Reviews were generally favorable. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars (out of 4), stating &quot;Much depends on exactly what Emma and Murphy say to each other, and how they say it, and what they don&#x27;t say. The movie gets it all right.&quot; The film holds a rating of 74% on review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Murphy&#x27;s Romance&quot; received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (James Garner) and for Best Cinematography (William A. Fraker).
