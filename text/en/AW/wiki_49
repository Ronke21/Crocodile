<text>Alternative country (commonly abbreviated to alt-country; also known as alternative country rock, insurgent country, [[Americana (music)|Americana]], or y&#x27;allternative) is a loosely defined subgenre of country music and/or country rock that includes acts that differ significantly in style from mainstream country music, mainstream country rock, and country pop. Alternative country artists are often influenced by alternative rock. Most frequently, the term has been used to describe certain country music and country rock bands and artists that are also defined as or have incorporated influences from alternative rock, indie rock, punk rock, heartland rock, Southern rock, progressive country, outlaw country, neotraditional country, Texas country, Red Dirt, roots rock, indie folk, folk rock, rockabilly, bluegrass, and honky tonk.

==Definitions and characteristics==

In the 1990s, the term &quot;alternative country&quot;, paralleling alternative rock, began to be used to describe a diverse group of musicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. Many eschewed the increasingly polished production values and pop sensibilities of the Nashville-dominated industry for a more lo-fi sound, frequently infused with a strong punk and rock and roll aesthetic. Lyrics may be bleak or socially aware, but also more heartfelt and less likely to use the clichés sometimes used by mainstream country musicians. In other respects, the musical styles of artists that fall within this genre often have little in common, ranging from traditional American folk music and bluegrass, through rockabilly and honky-tonk, to music that is indistinguishable from mainstream rock or country. This already broad labeling has been further confused by alternative country artists disavowing the movement, mainstream artists declaring they are part of it, and retroactive claims that past or veteran musicians are alternative country. &quot;No Depression&quot;, the best-known magazine dedicated to the genre, declared that it covered &quot;alternative-country music (whatever that is)&quot;.

==History==
Alternative country drew on traditional American country music, the music of working people, preserved and celebrated by practitioners such as Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and the Carter Family, often cited as major influences. Another major influence was country rock, the result of fusing country music with a rock &amp; roll sound. The third factor was punk rock, which supplied an energy and DIY attitude.
Attempts to combine punk and country had been pioneered by a number of bands prior to 1990, including Nashville&#x27;s Jason and the Scorchers, San Francisco’s American Music Club, and the Minneapolis-based band the Jayhawks, along with the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk scene with bands such as the Long Ryders and X. However, the “alt country” label did not gain popularity among music journalists until the release of Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s 1990 LP &quot;No Depression&quot;, which has been credited as being the first &quot;alt-country&quot; album. It is also the namesake of the online notice board and eventually magazine that underpinned the movement. They released three more influential albums, signing to a major label, before they broke up in 1994, with members and figures associated with them going on to form three major bands in the genre: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets. Bottle Rockets signed, along with acts like Freakwater, Old 97&#x27;s and Robbie Fulks, to the Chicago-based indie label, Bloodshot, who pioneered a version of the genre under the name &quot;insurgent country&quot;. The bands Blue Mountain, Whiskeytown, Blood Oranges and Drive-By Truckers further developed this tradition before most began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s.

<text>The Nashville sound is a subgenre of American country music that originated in the 1950s in Nashville, Tennessee. It replaced the dominance of the rough honky tonk music with &quot;smooth strings and choruses&quot;, &quot;sophisticated background vocals&quot; and &quot;smooth tempos&quot; associated with traditional pop. It was an attempt &quot;to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

==Origins==
The Nashville sound was pioneered by staff at RCA Victor, Columbia Records and Decca Records in Nashville, Tennessee. RCA Victor manager, producer and musician Chet Atkins, and producers Steve Sholes, Owen Bradley and Bob Ferguson, and recording engineer Bill Porter invented the form by replacing elements of the popular honky tonk style (fiddles, steel guitar, nasal lead vocals) with &quot;smooth&quot; elements from 1950s pop music (string sections, background vocals, crooning lead vocals), and using &quot;slick&quot; production, and pop music structures. The producers relied on a small group of studio musicians known as the Nashville A-Team, whose quick adaptability and creative input made them vital to the hit-making process. The Anita Kerr Quartet was the main vocal backing group in the early 1960s.

The term &quot;Nashville sound&quot; was first mentioned in an article about Jim Reeves in 1958 in the Music Reporter and again in 1960 in a &quot;Time&quot; article about Reeves. Other observers have identified several recordings that helped establish the early Nashville sound. The country historian Rich Kienzle identified that &quot;Gone&quot;, a Ferlin Husky hit recorded in November 1956, as a possible precursor. The writer Colin Escott argued that Reeves&#x27; &quot;Four Walls&quot;, recorded February 1957, as the &quot;first &#x27;Nashville sound&#x27; record&quot;, and Chet Atkins, the RCA Victor producer and guitarist most often credited with being the sound&#x27;s primary artistic creator, pointed to his production of Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Oh Lonesome Me&quot; later the same year. In an essay published in &quot;Heartaches by the Number: Country Music&#x27;s 500 Greatest Singles&quot;, David Cantwell argues that Elvis Presley&#x27;s rock and roll recording of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; in July 1956 was the record that sparked the beginning of the era now called the Nashville sound. 

Regarding the Nashville sound, the record producer Owen Bradley stated 

Bradley Studios, RCA Studio B and later RCA Studio A, located directly center of Music Row, were considered pivotal as well as essential locations to the development of the Nashville sound musical techniques. RCA Studio A specifically was designed and built to incorporate these techniques and was designed by RCA&#x27;s sound engineer John E. Volkmann. In 1960, &quot;Time&quot; reported that Nashville had &quot;nosed out Hollywood as the nation&#x27;s second biggest (after New York) record-producing center.&quot;

==Countrypolitan==

In the early 1960s, the Nashville sound began to be challenged by the rival Bakersfield sound on the country side and by the British Invasion on the pop side; compounding these problems were the sudden deaths, in separate airplane crashes, of Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves, two of the Nashville sound&#x27;s biggest stars. Nashville&#x27;s pop song structure became more pronounced, and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan: a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often background vocals provided by a choir. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and its music sold well through the later 1960s into the mid-1970s. Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill (who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette&#x27;s early career) and Glenn Sutton. Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette, Charlie Rich, and Charley Pride, along with Los Angeles–based singers Lynn Anderson and Glen Campbell. George Jones&#x27;s style of the era successfully fused the countrypolitan sound with the honky-tonk style that had made him famous.

The Bakersfield sound, and later outlaw country, dominated country music among aficionados while countrypolitan reigned on the pop charts.

Upon being asked what the Nashville sound was, Chet Atkins put his hand into his pocket, shook his loose change, and said &quot;That&#x27;s what it is. It&#x27;s the sound of money.&quot;

==Country pop==

By the late 1970s and 1980s, many pop music singers picked up the countrypolitan style and created what is known as country pop, the fusion of country music and pop music.

<text>Esau is the elder son of Isaac in the Hebrew Bible. He is mentioned in the Book of Genesis and by the prophets Obadiah and Malachi. The story of Esau and Jacob reflects the historical relationship between Israel and Edom, aiming to explain why Israel, despite being a younger kingdom, dominated Edom. The Christian New Testament alludes to him in the Epistle to the Romans and in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Esau is the progenitor of the Edomites and the elder brother of Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelites. Jacob and Esau were the sons of Isaac and Rebecca, and the grandsons of Abraham and Sarah. Of the twins, Esau was the first to be born with Jacob following, holding his heel. Isaac was sixty years old when the boys were born.

Esau, a &quot;man of the field&quot;, became a hunter who had &quot;rough&quot; qualities that distinguished him from his twin brother. Among these qualities were his redness and noticeable hairiness. Jacob was a plain or simple man, depending on the translation of the Hebrew word &quot;tam&quot; (which also means &quot;relatively perfect man&quot;). Jacob&#x27;s color was not mentioned. Throughout Genesis, Esau is frequently shown as being supplanted by his younger twin, Jacob (Israel).

According to the Muslim tradition, the prophet Yaqub, or Israel, was the favorite of his mother, and his twin brother &quot;Esau&quot; was the favorite of his father, prophet Ishaq, and he is mentioned in the &quot;Story of Ya&#x27;qub&quot; in Qisas al-Anbiya.

==In Genesis==

The story of Esau and Jacob reflects the historical relationship between Israel and Edom, aiming to explain why Israel, despite being a younger kingdom, dominated Edom.

===Birth===
Genesis 25:25 narrates Esau&#x27;s birth, &quot;Now the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.&quot; The meaning of the word &quot;esau&quot; itself is not entirely certain. Others have noted the similarity to . The name &quot;Edom&quot; () is also attributed to Esau, meaning &quot;red&quot;; the same color is used to describe the color of his hair. Genesis parallels his redness to the &quot;red lentil pottage&quot; that he sold his birthright for. Esau became the progenitor of the Edomites in Mount Seir.

===Birthright===

In Genesis, Esau returned to his twin brother Jacob, famished from the fields. He begs Jacob to give him some &quot;red pottage&quot; (a play on his nickname, &quot;Edom&quot;.) This refers to his red hair. Jacob offers Esau a bowl of lentil stew () in exchange for Esau&#x27;s birthright (), the right to be recognized as firstborn son with authority over the family, and Esau agrees. Thus Jacob acquires Esau&#x27;s birthright. This is the origin of the English phrase &quot;to sell one&#x27;s birthright for a mess of pottage&quot;.

In , Jacob uses deception, motivated by his mother Rebekah, to lay claim to his blind father Isaac&#x27;s blessing that was inherently due to the firstborn, Esau.

In , Rebekah is listening while Isaac speaks to his son Esau. When Esau goes to the field to hunt for venison to bring home, Rebekah says to her son Jacob, &quot;Behold, I heard thy father speak to thy brother Esau, saying: &#x27;Bring me venison and prepare a savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death. Rebekah then instructs Jacob in an elaborate deception through which Jacob pretends to be Esau, in order to steal from Esau his blessing from Isaac and his inheritance—which in theory Esau had already agreed to give to Jacob. Jacob follows through with the plan to steal his brother&#x27;s birthright by bringing the meal his father Isaac requested and pretending to be Esau. Jacob pulled off his disguise by covering himself in hairy kid goat skin so that when his blind father went to touch him, his smooth skin did not give him away as an imposter of his hairy brother. Jacob successfully received his father Isaac&#x27;s blessing. As a result, Jacob became the spiritual leader of the family after Isaac&#x27;s death and the heir of the promises of Abraham ().

When Esau learns of his brother&#x27;s thievery, he is livid and begs his father to undo the blessing. Isaac responds to his eldest son&#x27;s plea by saying that he only had one blessing to give and that he could not reverse the sacred blessing. Esau is furious and vows to kill Jacob (). Once again Rebekah intervenes to save her younger son from being murdered by his elder twin brother, Esau.

Therefore, at Rebekah&#x27;s urging, Jacob flees to a distant land, Paddan-aram (towards Harran) to work for his uncle Laban (). Jacob does not immediately receive his father&#x27;s inheritance after the impersonation aimed at taking it from Esau. Having fled for his life, Jacob has left the wealth of Isaac&#x27;s flocks, land and tents in Esau&#x27;s hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban&#x27;s household. Jacob, who had deceived and cheated his brother, is in turn deceived and cheated by his uncle. Jacob asks to marry Laban&#x27;s daughter Rachel, whom he has met at the well, and Laban agrees, if Jacob will give him seven years of service. Jacob does so, but after the wedding finds that beneath the veil is not Rachel but Leah, Laban&#x27;s elder daughter. He agrees to work another seven years and Jacob and Rachel are finally wed. However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban&#x27;s sons.
 tells of Jacob&#x27;s and Esau&#x27;s eventual reconciliation. Jacob sends multiple waves of gifts to Esau as they approach each other, hoping that Esau will spare his life. Esau refuses the gifts, as he is now very wealthy and does not need them. Jacob bows down before Esau and insists on his receiving the gifts. Esau shows forgiveness in spite of this bitter conflict. He then asks Jacob to follow him to the South but Jacob decides later to move to the North.

===Family===
See: Wives of Esau.

 describes Esau&#x27;s marriage at the age of forty to two Canaanite women: Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. This arrangement grieved his parents. Upon seeing that his brother was blessed and that their father rejected Esau&#x27;s union to Canaanites, Esau went to the house of his uncle Ishmael and married his cousin, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, and sister of Nebaioth. Esau&#x27;s family is again revisited in , this passage names two Canaanite wives; Adhah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, and a third: Bashemath, Ishmael&#x27;s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. Some scholars equate the three wives mentioned in Genesis 26 and 28 with those in Genesis 36. Casting his lot with the Ishmaelites, he was able to drive the Horites out of Mount Seir to settle in that region. According to some views, Esau is considered to be the progenitor not only of the Edomites but of the Kenizzites and the Amalekites as well.

Esau had five sons:
* By Adah: Eliphaz
* By Aholibamah: Jeush, Jaalam, Korah
* By Basemath: Reuel

== Other references ==

===Minor prophet references===
Esau was also known as Edom, the progenitor of the Edomites who were established to the south of the Israelites. They were an ancient enemy nation of Israel. The minor prophets, such as Obadiah, claim that the Edomites participated in the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in the siege of Jerusalem in 587 BCE. Exactly how the Edomites participated is not clear. Psalm 137 (&quot;By the waters of Babylon&quot;) suggests merely that Edom had encouraged the Babylonians: God is asked to &quot;remember against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said &#x27;raze it, raze it to its foundations&#x27;&quot; in Psalm 137:7. However, the prophecy of Obadiah insists on the literal &quot;violence done&quot; by Esau &quot;unto [his] brother Jacob&quot; when the Edomites &quot;entered the gate of my people..., looted his goods..., stood at the parting of the ways to cut off the fugitive... delivered up his survivors on his day of distress&quot;.

By the intertestamental period, Edom had replaced Babylon as the nation that burned the Temple (&quot;Thou hast also vowed to build thy temple, which the Edomites burned when Judah was laid waste by the Chaldees&quot;).

===Jubilees===

In the Book of Jubilees, Esau&#x27;s father, Isaac, compels Esau to swear not to attack or kill Jacob after Isaac has died. However, after the death of Isaac, the sons of Esau convince their father to lead them and hire mercenaries against Jacob to kill Jacob and his family and seize their wealth (especially the portion of Isaac&#x27;s wealth that Isaac had left to Jacob upon his death). &quot;Then Ya&#x27;aqov bent his bow and sent forth the arrow and struck Esau, his brother on his right breast and slew him (Jubilees 38:2) . . . Ya&#x27;aqov buried his brother on the hill which is in Aduram, and he returned to his house (Jubilees 38:9b).&quot;
===New Testament references===
 depicts Esau as unspiritual for thoughtlessly throwing away his birthright. states, &quot;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,&quot; based upon .

===In Islamic tradition===

According to Islamic scholars, the prophet Ayyub was the great-grandson of Esau&#x27;s son Reuel.

== Rabbinic Jewish sources ==
The Targum Pseudo-Jonathan connects the name Esau to the Hebrew &quot;asah&quot;, stating, &quot;because he was born fully completed, with hair of the head, beard, teeth, and molars.&quot; Other traditional sources connect the word with .

Jewish commentaries have a negative view of Esau because of his rivalry with Jacob and likewise viewed the apparent reconciliation between the brothers described in Genesis 32–33 as insincere on Esau&#x27;s part. The midrash says that during Rebecca&#x27;s pregnancy, whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.

He is considered to be a rebellious son who kept a double life until he was fifteen when he sold his birthright to Jacob. According to the Talmud, the sale of the birthright took place immediately after Abraham died. The Talmudic dating would give both Esau and Jacob an age of fifteen at the time. The lentils Jacob was cooking were meant for his father Isaac because lentils are the traditional mourner&#x27;s meal for Jews. On that day before returning, in a rage over the death of Abraham, Esau committed five sins; he raped a betrothed young woman, he committed murder (Nimrod), he denied God, he denied the resurrection of the dead, and he spurned his birthright.

Haman&#x27;s lineage is given in the Targum Sheni as follows: &quot;Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Srach, son of Buza, son of Iphlotas, son of Dyosef, son of Dyosim, son of Prome, son of Ma&#x27;dei, son of Bla&#x27;akan, son of Intimros, son of Haridom, son of Sh&#x27;gar, son of Nigar, son of Farmashta, son of Vayezatha, (son of Agag, son of Sumkei,) son of Amalek, son of the concubine of Eliphaz, firstborn son of Esau&quot;.

According to Rashi, Isaac, when blessing Jacob in Esau&#x27;s place, smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau&#x27;s show of piety.

In Jewish folklore, the Roman emperor Titus was a descendant of Esau.

===Death===

According to the Babylonian Talmud, Esau was killed by Hushim, son of Dan, son of Jacob, because Esau obstructed the burial of Jacob into the cave of Machpelah. When Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. Hushim (who was hard of hearing) did not understand what was going on, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: &quot;Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?&quot; He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau&#x27;s head rolled into the cave. This means that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave.

Jewish sources state that Esau sold his right to be buried in the cave. According to Shemot Rabbah, Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, &quot;My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?&quot; Esau&#x27;s selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot;.

== Reputed grave on the West Bank ==
South of the Palestinian town of Sa&#x27;ir on the West Bank there is a tomb reputed to be that of Esau – &quot;El &#x27;Ais&quot; in his Arab name.

The PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) wrote: 

The SWP stated this identification was false and that Esau&#x27;s tomb was in the Biblical Mount Seir.

<doc id="171111" wikidata="Q1627155" url="?curid=171111" title="Honky-tonk">
<text>A honky-tonk (also called honkatonk, honkey-tonk, honky tonk, or tonk) is either a bar that provides country music for the entertainment of its patrons or the style of music played in such establishments. It can also refer to the type of piano (tack piano) used to play such music. Bars of this kind are common in the South and Southwest United States. Many prominent country music artists such as Jimmie Rodgers, Ernest Tubb, Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Johnny Horton and Merle Haggard began their careers as amateur musicians in honky-tonks.

The origin of the term &quot;honky-tonk&quot; is disputed, originally referring to bawdy variety shows in areas of the old West (Oklahoma, the Indian Territories and mostly Texas) and to the actual theaters showing them.

The first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony; the style evolved in response to an environment in which pianos were often poorly cared for, tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys. This honky-tonk music was an important influence on the boogie-woogie piano style. Before World War II, the music industry began to refer to hillbilly music being played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as &quot;honky-tonk&quot; music. In the 1950s, honky-tonk entered its golden age, with the popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, Faron Young, George Jones, and Hank Williams.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;honky-tonk&quot; is unknown. The earliest known use in print is an article in the &quot;Peoria Journal&quot; dated June 28, 1874, stating, &quot;The police spent a busy day today raiding the bagnios and honkytonks.&quot; 

There are subsequent citations from 1890 in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, 1892 in the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; (Galveston, Texas) (which used the term to refer to an adult establishment in Fort Worth), and in 1894 in &quot;The Daily Ardmoreite&quot; in Oklahoma. Early uses of the term in print mostly appear along a corridor roughly coinciding with cattle drive trails extending from Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, into south central Oklahoma, suggesting that the term may have been a localism spread by cowboys driving cattle to market. The sound of &quot;honky-tonk&quot; (or &quot;honk-a-tonk&quot;) and the types of places that were called honky-tonks suggests that the term may be an onomatopoeic reference to the loud, boisterous music and noise heard at these establishments.

One theory is that the &quot;tonk&quot; portion of the name may have come from the brand name of piano made by William Tonk &amp; Bros., an American manufacturer of large upright pianos (established 1881), which made a piano with the decal &quot;Ernest A. Tonk&quot;. The Tonk brothers, William and Max, established the Tonk Bros. Manufacturing Company in 1873, so such an etymology is possible, however, these pianos were not manufactured until 1889, at which point the term seems to have already been established.

An early source purporting to explain the derivation of the term (spelled &quot;honkatonk&quot;) was an article published in 1900 by the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and widely reprinted in other newspapers. The article, however, reads more like a humorous legend or fable, so its veracity is questionable.

==History==

An article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; of July 28, 1929, with the headline Honky-Tonk&#x27; Origin Told&quot;, which was probably in response to the Sophie Tucker movie musical, &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; (1929), reads:


In this context of the term’s meaning and its possible origin, an example from roughly the same period is the Harvey Oliver Brooks song “They Call Me Sister Honky-Tonk,” sung by Mae West in the 1933 film I’m No Angel.

Honky-tonks were rough establishments, providing country music in the Deep South and Southwest and serving alcoholic beverages to a working-class clientele. Some honky-tonks offered dancing to music played by pianists or small bands, and some were centers of prostitution. Katrina Hazzard-Gordon wrote that the honky-tonk was &quot;the first urban manifestation of the jook&quot;, and that &quot;the name itself became synonymous with a style of music. Related to the classic blues in tonal structure, honky-tonk has a tempo that is slightly stepped up. It is rhythmically suited for many African-American dance.&quot;

As Chris Smith and Charles McCarron wrote in their 1916 hit song &quot;Down in Honky Tonk Town&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s underneath the ground, where all the fun is found.&quot;

===Origins of the establishment===
Although the derivation of the term is unknown, &quot;honky tonk&quot; originally referred to bawdy variety shows in the West (Oklahoma and Indian Territories and Texas) and to the theaters housing them. The earliest mention of them in print refers to them as &quot;variety theaters&quot; and describe the entertainment as &quot;variety shows&quot;. The theaters often had an attached gambling house and always a bar.

In recollections long after the frontiers closed, writers such as Wyatt Earp and E.C. Abbott referred to honky-tonks in the cowtowns of Kansas, Nebraska, and Montana in the 1870s and 1880s. Their recollections contain lurid accounts of the women and violence accompanying the shows. However, in contemporary accounts these were nearly always called hurdy-gurdy shows, possibly derived from the term &quot;hurdy-gurdy&quot;, which was sometimes mistakenly applied to a small, portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers.

As late as 1913, Col. Edwin Emerson, a former Rough Rider commander, hosted a honky-tonk party in New York City. The Rough Riders were recruited from the ranches of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Indian Territories, so the term was still in popular use during the Spanish–American War.

==Music==

The honky-tonk sound has a full rhythm section playing a two-beat rhythm with a crisp backbeat. Steel guitar and fiddle are the dominant instruments.

The first music genre to be commonly known as honky-tonk music was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony; the style evolved in response to an environment in which the pianos were often poorly cared for, tending to be out of tune and having some nonfunctioning keys.

Honky-tonk music influenced the boogie-woogie piano style, as indicated by Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s 1938 record &quot;Honky Tonk Music&quot; and Meade Lux Lewis&#x27;s hit &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues.&quot; Lewis recorded the latter many times from 1927 into the 1950s, and the song was covered by many other musicians, including Oscar Peterson.

The twelve-bar blues instrumental &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; by the Bill Doggett Combo, with a sinuous saxophone line and driving, slow beat, was an early rock and roll hit. New Orleans native Fats Domino was another honky-tonk piano man, whose &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; to New Orleans&quot; were hits on the popular music charts.

In the years before World War II, the music industry began to refer to honky-tonk music played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as &quot;hillbilly music&quot;. More recently, the term has come to refer to the primary sound in country music, developing in Nashville as Western swing became accepted there. Originally, it featured the guitar, fiddle, string bass, and steel guitar (imported from Hawaiian folk music). The vocals were originally rough and nasal, as exemplified by the singer-songwriters Floyd Tillman and Hank Williams, but later developed a clear and sharp sound, such as that of George Jones and Faron Young. Lyrics tended to focus on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity.

Copyrighted and released in 1941, &quot;Walking the Floor Over You&quot;, by Ernest Tubb, his sixth release for Decca, helped establish the honky-tonk style and Tubb as one of its foremost practitioners. Tubb, from Crisp, Texas, was a fan of Jimmie Rodgers and fused Western swing, which had been using electric guitars for years, with other &quot;country&quot; sounds.

He took the sound to Nashville, where he was the first musician to play electric guitar on Grand Ole Opry. In the 1950s, honky tonk entered its golden age, with the popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, Faron Young, George Jones, and Hank Williams. In the mid- to late 1950s, rockabilly (which melded honky-tonk country with rhythm and blues) and the slick country music of the Nashville sound ended honky-tonk&#x27;s initial period of dominance.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; number-one single and gold record &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (1969) was based on the sound of 1940s honky-tonk artists like Hank Williams and referred to the reputation of honky-tonk bars as centres of prostitution. In the 1970s, outlaw country&#x27;s brand of rough honky-tonk was represented by artists such as Gary Stewart, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, David Allan Coe, and Billy Joe Shaver.

<doc id="171118" wikidata="Q38095" url="?curid=171118" title="Galápagos Islands">
<text>The Galápagos Islands () are an archipelago of volcanic islands in the Eastern Pacific, located around the equator, west of the mainland of South America. They form the Galápagos Province of the Republic of Ecuador, with a population of slightly over 33,000 . The province is divided into the cantons of San Cristóbal, Santa Cruz, and Isabela, the three most populated islands in the chain. The Galápagos are famous for their large number of endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin in the 1830s and inspired his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. All of these islands are protected as part of Ecuador&#x27;s Galápagos National Park and Marine Reserve.

Thus far, there is no firm evidence that Polynesians or the Indigenous peoples of South America reached the islands before their accidental discovery by Bishop Tomás de Berlanga in 1535. If some visitors did arrive, poor access to fresh water on the islands seems to have limited settlement. The Spanish Empire similarly ignored the islands, although during the Golden Age of Piracy various pirates used the Galápagos as a base for raiding Spanish shipping along the Peruvian coast. The goats and black and brown rats introduced during this period greatly damaged the existing ecosystems of several islands. British sailors were chiefly responsible for exploring and mapping the area. Darwin&#x27;s voyage on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; was part of an extensive British survey of the coasts of South America. Ecuador, which won its independence from Spain in 1822 and left Gran Colombia in 1830, formally occupied and claimed the islands on 12 February 1832 while the voyage was ongoing. José de Villamil, the founder of the Ecuadorian Navy, led the push to colonize and settle the islands, gradually supplanting the English names of the major islands with Spanish ones. The United States built the islands&#x27; first airport as a base to protect the western approaches of the Panama Canal in the 1930s. After World War II, its facilities were transferred to Ecuador. With the growing importance of ecotourism to the local economy, the airport modernized in the 2010s, using recycled materials for any expansion and shifting entirely to renewable energy sources to handle its roughly 300,000 visitors each year. 

==Names==
The Galápagos or Galapagos Islands are named for their giant tortoises, which were more plentiful at the time of their discovery. The Spanish word derives from a pre-Roman Iberian word meaning &quot;turtle&quot;, the meaning it still has in most dialects. Within Ecuadorian Spanish, however, it is now also used to describe the islands&#x27; large tortoises. The islands&#x27; name is pronounced in most dialects of Spanish but by locals. (The accent over the second A does not change the name&#x27;s pronunciation but moves the stress from the 3rd syllable to the 2nd.) It is usually read in British English and in American English. The name is first attested as the Spanish/Latin hybrid (&quot;Islands of the Turtles&quot;) on the map of the Americas in Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s &quot;Theater of the Lands of the World&quot; (), first published in 1570.

The islands were also previously known as the Enchanted Isles or Islands () from sailors&#x27; difficulty with the winds and currents around them; as the Ecuador Archipelago () or Archipelago of the Equator () following their settlement by Ecuador in 1832; and as the Colon or Columbus Archipelago () in 1892 upon the quadricentennial of Columbus&#x27;s first voyage.

The islands were mapped by the English buccaneer William Ambrosia Cowley in 1684 and by the British captain James Colnett in 1793. The names they chose to honour British kings, nobles, and naval officers of their eras continued to be used for the major islands until recently and are still used for many of the smaller islets. The Spanish names have varied over time, but the current official names have gradually supplanted the English ones for most of the major islands.

==Geology==


Volcanism has been continuous on the Galápagos Islands for at least 20 million years, and perhaps even longer. The mantle plume beneath the east-ward moving Nazca plate (51 km/myr) has given rise to a 3-kilometre-thick platform under the island chain and seamounts. Besides the Galápagos Archipelago, other key tectonic features in the region include the Northern Galápagos volcanic province between the archipelago and the Galápagos Spreading Center (GSC) to the north at the boundary of the Nazca plate and the Cocos plate. This spreading center truncates into the East Pacific Rise on the west and is bounded by the Cocos Ridge and Carnegie Ridge in the east. Furthermore, the Galápagos Hotspot is at the northern boundary of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province while the Easter Hotspot is on the southern boundary.

The Galápagos Archipelago is characterized by numerous contemporaneous volcanoes, some with plume magma sources, others from the asthenosphere, possibly due to the young and thin oceanic crust. The GSC caused structural weaknesses in this thin lithosphere leading to eruptions forming the Galápagos Platform. Fernandina and Isabela in particular are aligned along these weaknesses. Lacking a well-defined rift zone, the islands have a high rate of inflation prior to eruption. Sierra Negra on Isabela Island experienced a uplift between 1992 and 1998, most recent eruption in 2005, while Fernandina on Fernandina Island indicated an uplift of , most recent eruption in 2009. Alcedo on Isabela Island had an uplift of greater than 90 cm, most recent eruption in 1993. Additional characteristics of the Galápagos Archipelago are closer volcano spacing, smaller volcano sizes, and larger calderas. For instance, Isabela Island includes six major volcanoes, Ecuador, Wolf, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul, with most recent eruptions ranging from 1813 to 2008. The neighboring islands of Santiago and Fernandina last erupted in 1906 and 2009, respectively. Overall, the nine active volcanoes in the archipelago have erupted 24 times between 1961 and 2011. The shape of these volcanoes is tall and rounded as opposed to wide and smooth in the Hawaiian Islands. The Galápagos&#x27;s shape is due to the pattern of radial and circumferential fissure, radial on the flanks, but circumferential near the caldera summits. It is the circumferential fissures which give rise to stacks of short lava flows.

The volcanoes at the west end of the archipelago are in general, taller, younger, have well-developed calderas, and are mostly composed of tholeiitic basalt, while those on the east are shorter, older, lack calderas, and have a more diverse composition. The ages of the islands, from west to east are 0.05 Ma for Fernandina, 0.65 Ma for Isabela, 1.10 Ma for Santiago, 1.7 Ma for Santa Cruz, 2.90 Ma for Santa Fe, and 3.2 Ma for San Cristobal. The calderas on Sierra Negra and Alcedo have active fault systems. The Sierra Negra fault is associated with a sill below the caldera. The caldera on Fernandina experienced the largest basaltic volcano collapse in history, with the 1968 phreatomagmatic eruption. Fernandina has also been the most active volcano since 1790, with recent eruptions in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2009, and the entire surface has been covered in numerous flows since 4.3 Ka. The western volcanoes have numerous tuff cones.

==Physical geography==


The islands are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean, off the west coast of South America. The majority of islands are also more broadly part of the South Pacific. The closest land mass is that of mainland Ecuador, the country to which they belong, to the east.

The islands are found at the coordinates 1°40&#x27;N–1°36&#x27;S, 89°16&#x27;–92°01&#x27;W. Straddling the equator, islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemispheres, with Volcán Wolf and Volcán Ecuador on Isla Isabela being directly on the equator. Española Island, the southernmost islet of the archipelago, and Darwin Island, the northernmost one, are spread out over a distance of . The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) considers them wholly within the South Pacific Ocean, however. The Galápagos Archipelago consists of of land spread over of ocean. The largest of the islands, Isabela, measures and makes up close to three-quarters of the total land area of the Galápagos. Volcán Wolf on Isabela is the highest point, with an elevation of above sea level.

The group consists of 18 main islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and islets. The islands are located at the Galápagos triple junction. The archipelago is located on the Nazca plate (a tectonic plate), which is moving east/southeast, diving under the South American plate at a rate of about per year. It is also atop the Galápagos hotspot, a place where the Earth&#x27;s crust is being melted from below by a mantle plume, creating volcanoes. The first islands formed here at least 8 million and possibly up to 90 million years ago.

While the older islands have disappeared below the sea as they moved away from the mantle plume, the youngest islands, Isabela and Fernandina, are still being formed. In April 2009, lava from the volcanic island Fernandina started flowing both towards the island&#x27;s shoreline and into the center caldera.

In late June 2018, Sierra Negra, one of five volcanoes on Isabela and one of the most active in the Galapagos archipelago, began erupting for the first time since 2005. Lava flows made their way to the coastline, prompting the evacuation of about fifty nearby residents and restricting tourist access.

===Main islands===

The 18 main islands (each having a land area at least 1 km2) of the archipelago (with their English names) shown alphabetically:

* Baltra (South Seymour) Island – Baltra is a small flat island located near the centre of the Galápagos. It was created by geological uplift. The island is very arid, and vegetation consists of salt bushes, prickly pear cacti and palo santo trees. Until 1986, Seymour Airport was the only airport serving the Galápagos. Now there are two airports which receive flights from the continent; the other is located on San Cristóbal Island. Private planes flying to Galápagos must fly to Baltra, as it is the only airport with facilities for private planes. On arriving in Baltra, all visitors are immediately transported by bus to one of two docks. The first dock is located in a small bay, where the boats cruising Galápagos await passengers. The second is a ferry dock, which connects Baltra to the island of Santa Cruz. During the 1940s, scientists decided to move 70 of Baltra&#x27;s land iguanas to the neighboring North Seymour Island as part of an experiment. This move proved unexpectedly useful when the native iguanas became extinct on Baltra as a result of the island&#x27;s military occupation in World War II. During the 1980s, iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station as part of a breeding and repopulation project, and in the 1990s, land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. As of 1997, scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra, 13 of which had hatched on the islands.
* Bartolomé (Bartholomew) Island – Bartolomé Island is a volcanic islet just off the east coast of Santiago Island in the Galápagos Islands group. It is one of the younger islands in the Galápagos archipelago. This island, and neighbouring Sulivan Bay on Santiago (James) island, are named after lifelong friend of Charles Darwin, Sir Bartholomew James Sulivan, who was a lieutenant aboard HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;. Today Sulivan Bay is often misspelled Sullivan Bay. This island is one of the few that are home to the Galápagos penguin which is the only wild penguin species to live on the equator. The green turtle is another animal that resides on the island.
* Darwin (Culpepper) Island – This island is named after Charles Darwin. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Here fur seals, frigates, marine iguanas, swallow-tailed gulls, sea lions, whales, marine turtles, and red-footed and Nazca boobies can be seen. The remnants of Darwin&#x27;s Arch, a natural rock arch which would at one time have been part of this larger structure, are located less than a kilometre from the main Darwin Island, and it was a landmark well known to the island&#x27;s few visitors. It collapsed in May 2021. The two remaining stumps are now nicknamed the &quot;Pillars of Evolution&quot;.
*Española (Hood) Island – Its name was given in honor of Spain. It also is known as &quot;Hood&quot;, after Viscount Samuel Hood. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Española is the oldest island at around 3.5 million years, and the southernmost in the group. Due to its remote location, Española has a large number of endemic species. It has its own species of lava lizard, mockingbird, and Galápagos tortoise. Española&#x27;s marine iguanas exhibit a distinctive red coloration change between the breeding season. Española is the only place where the waved albatross nests. Some of the birds have attempted to breed on Genovesa (Tower) Island, but unsuccessfully. Española&#x27;s steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these birds, which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru. Española has two visitor sites. Gardner Bay is a swimming and snorkelling site, and offers a great beach. Punta Suarez has migrant, resident, and endemic wildlife, including brightly colored marine iguanas, Española lava lizards, hood mockingbirds, swallow-tailed gulls, blue-footed boobies, Nazca boobies, red-billed tropicbirds, Galápagos hawks, three species of Darwin&#x27;s finches, and the waved albatross.
* Fernandina (Narborough) Island – The name was given in honor of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, who sponsored the voyage of Columbus. Fernandina has an area of and a maximum altitude of . This is the youngest and westernmost island. On 13 May 2005, a new, very eruptive process began on this island, when an ash and water vapor cloud rose to a height of and lava flows descended the slopes of the volcano on the way to the sea. Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of marine iguanas gather, largely on black lava rocks. The famous flightless cormorants inhabit this island, as do Galápagos penguins, pelicans, Galápagos sea lions and Galápagos fur seals. Different types of lava flows can be compared, and the mangrove forests can be observed.

* Floreana (Charles or Santa María) Island – It was named after Juan José Flores, the first President of Ecuador, during whose administration the government of Ecuador took possession of the archipelago. It is also called Santa Maria, after one of the caravels of Columbus. It has an area of and a maximum elevation of . It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history, and one of the earliest to be inhabited. Flamingos and green sea turtles nest (December to May) on this island. The &quot;patapegada&quot; or Galápagos petrel, a sea bird which spends most of its life away from land, is found here. At Post Office Bay, where 19th-century whalers kept a wooden barrel that served as a post office, mail could be picked up and delivered to its destinations, mainly Europe and the United States, by ships on their way home. At the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot;, an underwater volcanic cone and coral formations are found.
* Genovesa (Tower) Island – The name is derived from Genoa, Italy, the birthplace of Christopher Columbus. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . This island is formed by the remaining edge of a large caldera that is submerged. Its nickname of &quot;the bird island&quot; is clearly justified. At Darwin Bay, frigatebirds and swallow-tailed gulls, the only nocturnal species of gull in the world, can be seen. Red-footed boobies, noddy terns, lava gulls, tropic birds, doves, storm petrels and Darwin finches are also in sight. Prince Philip&#x27;s Steps is a bird-watching plateau with Nazca and red-footed boobies. There is a large Palo Santo forest.

* Isabela (Albemarle) Island – This island was named in honor of Queen Isabella I of Castile. With an area of , it is the largest island of the Galápagos. Its highest point is Volcán Wolf, with an altitude of . The island&#x27;s seahorse shape is the product of the merging of six large volcanoes into a single land mass. On this island, Galápagos penguins, flightless cormorants, marine iguanas, pelicans and Sally Lightfoot crabs abound. At the skirts and calderas of the volcanoes of Isabela, land iguanas and Galápagos tortoises can be observed, as well as Darwin finches, Galápagos hawks, Galápagos doves and very interesting lowland vegetation. The third-largest human settlement of the archipelago, Puerto Villamil, is located at the southeastern tip of the island.
* Marchena (Bindloe) Island – Named after Fray Antonio Marchena, it has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Galapagos hawks and sea lions inhabit this island, and it is home to the Marchena lava lizard, an animal endemic to Marchena.

* North Seymour Island – Its name was given after an English nobleman, Lord Hugh Seymour. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . This island is home to a large population of blue-footed boobies and swallow-tailed gulls. It hosts one of the largest populations of frigate birds. It was formed from geological uplift.
* Pinzón (Duncan) Island – Named after the Pinzón brothers, captains of the Pinta and Niña caravels, it has an area of and a maximum altitude of and has no permanent population. Home to giant Galápagos tortoises of the subspecies Chelonoidis duncanensis and Galápagos sea lions, the island has no visitor facilities and a permit is required for legal visits.
* Pinta (Louis) Island – Named after the Pinta caravel, it has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Sea lions, Galápagos hawks, giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and dolphins can be seen here. Pinta Island was home to the last remaining Pinta tortoise, called Lonesome George. He was moved from Pinta Island to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, where scientists attempted to breed from him. However, Lonesome George died in June 2012 without producing any offspring.
* Rábida (Jervis) Island – It bears the name of the convent of Rábida, where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . The high amount of iron contained in the lava at Rábida gives it a distinctive red colour. White-cheeked pintail ducks live in a saltwater lagoon close to the beach, where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests. Until recently, flamingos were also found in the lagoon, but they have since moved on to other islands, likely due to a lack of food on Rábida. Nine species of finches have been reported in this island.

* San Cristóbal (Chatham) Island – It bears the name of the patron saint of seafarers, &quot;St. Christopher&quot;. Its English name was given after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. It has an area of and its highest point rises to . This is the first island in the Galápagos Archipelago Charles Darwin visited during his voyage on the &quot;Beagle&quot;. This island hosts frigate birds, sea lions, giant tortoises, blue- and red-footed boobies, tropicbirds, marine iguanas, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls. Its vegetation includes &quot;Calandrinia galapagos&quot;, &quot;Lecocarpus darwinii&quot;, and trees such as &quot;Lignum vitae&quot;. The largest freshwater lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in the highlands of San Cristóbal. The capital of the province of Galápagos is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, which lies at the southern tip of the island, and is close to San Cristóbal Airport.

* Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island – Given the name of the Holy Cross in Spanish. It was originally named Norfolk Island by Cowley, but renamed after the British frigate HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; after her visit there in 1812. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Santa Cruz hosts the largest human population in the archipelago, the town of Puerto Ayora. The Charles Darwin Research Station and the headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service are located here. The GNPS and CDRS operate a tortoise breeding centre here, where young tortoises are hatched, reared, and prepared to be reintroduced to their natural habitat. The Highlands of Santa Cruz offer exuberant flora, and are famous for the lava tunnels. Large tortoise populations are found here. Black Turtle Cove is a site surrounded by mangroves, which sea turtles, rays and small sharks sometimes use as a mating area. Cerro Dragón, known for its flamingo lagoon, is also located here, and along the trail one may see land iguanas foraging.
* Santa Fe (Barrington) Island – Named after a city in Spain, it has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Santa Fe hosts a forest of Opuntia cactus, which are the largest of the archipelago, and Palo Santo. Weathered cliffs provide a haven for swallow-tailed gulls, red-billed tropic birds and shearwater petrels. Santa Fe species of land iguanas are often seen, as well as lava lizards.

*Santiago (San Salvador, James) Island – Its name is equivalent to Saint James in English; it is also known as San Salvador, after the first island discovered by Columbus in the Caribbean Sea. This island has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, land and sea turtles, flamingos, dolphins and sharks are found here. Pigs and goats, which were introduced by humans to the islands and have caused great harm to the endemic species, have been eradicated (pigs by 2002; goats by the end of 2006). Darwin finches and Galápagos hawks are usually seen, as well as a colony of fur seals. At Sulivan Bay, a recent (around 100 years ago) pahoehoe lava flow can be observed.
* Wolf (Wenman) Island – This island was named after the German geologist Theodor Wolf. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . Here, fur seals, frigatebirds, Nazca and red-footed boobies, marine iguanas, sharks, whales, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls can be seen. The most famous resident is the vampire finch, which feeds partly on blood pecked from other birds, and is only found on this island.

===Minor islands===

* Daphne Major – A small island directly north of Santa Cruz and directly west of Baltra, this very inaccessible island appears, though unnamed, on Ambrose Cowley&#x27;s 1684 chart. It is important as the location of multidecade finch population studies by Peter and Rosemary Grant.
* South Plaza Island () – It is named in honor of a former president of Ecuador, General Leónidas Plaza. It has an area of and a maximum altitude of . The flora of South Plaza includes &quot;Opuntia&quot; cactus and &quot;Sesuvium&quot; plants, which form a reddish carpet on top of the lava formations. Iguanas (land, marine and some hybrids of both species) are abundant, and large numbers of birds can be observed from the cliffs at the southern part of the island, including tropic birds and swallow-tailed gulls.
*North Plaza Island - This island lies north of South Plaza Island.
* Nameless Island – A small islet used mostly for scuba diving.
* Roca Redonda – An islet approximately northwest of Isabela. Herman Melville devotes the third and fourth sketches of The Encantadas to describing this islet (which he calls &quot;Rock Rodondo&quot;) and the view from it.
* Guy Fawkes Island - A small island of the coast of Santa Cruz. It is an island group composed of two crescent-shaped islets—North Guy Fawkes I. (I. Guy Fawkes Norte) and South Guy Fawkes I. (I. Guy Fawkes Sud)—and two rocks located northwest of Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos Archipelago in Ecuador. The group is uninhabited but sometimes visited by scuba divers.
* Isla Beagle - This small island near to Santiago is largely uninhabited.
* Isla Caldwell - This island is near Floreana and has a length of 3.06 kilometers.
* Isla Campéon - Also known as Champion island, this islet is 1.64 kilometers in length and is one of the last refuges of the Floreana mockingbird.
* Isla Watson - This small islet is one of the many islets of Floreana island. 
* Enderby Island - Besides of Isla Campéon, this island is another place where the Floreana mockingbird lives.
* Gardner Island (Galapagos) - In the Galapagos Islands, there are two places called Gardner Island. There is one island near Española, and one island near Floreana.
* Mosquera Island - Mosquera is one of the smallest islands in the archipelago. Located between North Seymour and Baltra Islands, it consists of many coral reefs, making it a great site for practicing snorkel and observing the marine life.
Mosquera is also home to one of the largest colonies of sea lions in the Galapagos, and there have been occasional orca whale sightings around the islet. As is usual in the archipelago, the islet is shared by many seabirds, marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies and Sally Lightfoot crabs.
* Tortuga Island - Isla Tortuga is unique as the island is in the shape of a crescent. The island is actually a collapsed volcano that is a nesting location for a variety of seabirds such as Frigatebirds and the elusive Red-Billed Tropicbird, among others.
* Isla Los Hermanos - This is a small island off Isabela.
* Isla Sombrero Chino - One of the most recognizable of the Galapagos Islands, Sombrero Chino name means &quot;Chinese Hat.&quot; It&#x27;s easy to see why: this islet off of Santiago is shaped like an old-fashioned Chinaman&#x27;s hat, a gently sloping cone rising out of the clear Galapagos water. Because of its distinctive shape, Sombrero Chino has fascinated visitors as long as they have been coming to Galapagos.
* Daphne Minor - It is very near Daphne Major and share a lot of similarities, as both are tuff cones devoid of trees.
* Las Tintoreras Islet - It is a group of seven small islets to the south of the bay of Puerto Villamil in the island of Isabela, that forms part of the archipelago and national park of the Galapagos Islands, including administratively in the Province Of Galapagos.
* Leon Dormido - This island is located off San Cristobal.Visually striking, the two rocks of Leon Dormindo, which means &quot;Sleeping Lion,&quot; soar to some 450 feet (140 meters) into the air. The mild current between the two rocks creates a hotbed habitat for an extremely diverse group of fish and mammals. 
* Isla Cowley - This small island is very small, located off Isabela.
* Isla El Edén - Eden Island is a sliver of volcanic rock located along the northwest shore of the large Santa Cruz Island. Isla El Edén measures less than 2,000 square feet in diameter. Despite its small size of .01 square miles, it exhibits three distinct landscapes. One is flat, arid and barren. In the middle is a 233 foot cliff.
* Isla Albany - Albany Rock is a small crescent shaped islet located in the northwest of Santiago Island.
* Isla Onslow - It is one of the many islands near Floreana.
* Corona Del Diablo - Corona Del Diablo, also known as the Devil&#x27;s Crown, located off of Floreana Island, not far from the shore, is a ring of uneven rocks that stick out of the water. Its name comes from the fact that it looks almost like an uncomfortable crown, that only the devil could wear.

==Climate==
Although the islands are located on the equator, the Humboldt Current brings cold water to them, causing frequent drizzles during most of the year. The weather is regularly influenced by the El Niño events, which occur every 3 to 7 years and bring warmer sea surface temperatures, a rise in sea level, greater wave action, and a depletion of nutrients in the water. This cycle can greatly affect the precipitation from one year to another. At Charles Darwin Station, the precipitation during the month of March in the particularly wet year of 1969 was , but during March 1970 the next year it was only .

There is also a large range in precipitation from one place to another and across the islands&#x27; two main seasons. The archipelago is mainly characterized by a mixture of a tropical savanna climate and a semi-arid climate, transitioning to a tropical rainforest climate in the northwest. During the rainy season known as the from June to November, the temperature near the sea is around , a steady cool wind blows from south and southeast, frequent drizzles () for days, and dense fog conceals the islands. During the warm season from December to May, the average sea and air temperatures rise to around , there is no wind at all, and the sun shines apart from sporadic strong downpours. Weather also changes as altitude increases on the larger islands. Temperature decreases gradually with altitude, while precipitation increases due to the condensation of moisture from clouds on the slopes. This pattern of generally wet highlands and drier lowlands affects the plant life on the larger islands. The vegetation in the highlands tends to be green and lush, with tropical woodland in places. The lowland areas tend to have arid and semi-arid vegetation, with many thorny shrubs and cacti and areas of barren volcanic rock.

Some islands also fall within the rain shadow of others during some seasons. During March 1969, the precipitation over Charles Darwin Station on the southern coast of Santa Cruz was , while on nearby Baltra Island the precipitation during the same month was only . This is because Baltra is located behind Santa Cruz when the prevailing winds are southerly, causing more moisture to fall on the Santa Cruz highlands.

The following table for the especially wet year of 1969 shows the variation of precipitation in different places of Santa Cruz Island:

==Ecology==

===Terrestrial===

Most of the Galápagos is covered in semi-desert vegetation, including shrublands, grasslands, and dry forest. A few of the islands have high-elevation areas with cooler temperatures and higher rainfall, which are home to humid-climate forests and shrublands, and montane grasslands (&quot;pampas&quot;) at the highest elevations. There are about 500 species of native vascular plants on the islands, including 90 species of ferns. About 180 vascular plant species are endemic.

The islands are well known for their distinctive endemic species, including giant tortoises, finches, flightless cormorants, Galápagos lava lizards and marine iguanas, which evolved to adapt to islands&#x27; environments.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
Whether Polynesians or the indigenous peoples of South America ever made it to the islands is disputed. Oceanic Pacific islands in the same general area as Galápagosincluding Clipperton, Cocos, the Desventuradas, the Juan Fernández Islands, and the Revillagigedoswere all uninhabited when discovered by Europeans, with no evidence to indicate any prehistoric human activity. The easternmost oceanic island in the South Pacific that was discovered with a human population was Easter Island, whose Rapa Nui people are known to be Polynesian rather than South American.

In 1572, the Spanish chronicler Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa claimed that Topa Inca Yupanqui, the second Sapa Inca of the Inca Empire, had visited the archipelago. There is, however, little evidence for this and many experts consider it a far-fetched legend, especially since the Incas were not typically a seafaring people. A 1952 archaeological survey by Thor Heyerdahl and Arne Skjølsvold found potsherds and other artifacts from several sites on the islands that they claimed suggested visitation by South Americans during the pre-Columbian era. The group located an Inca flute and shards from more than 130 pieces of ceramics, later identified as pre-Incan. However, no remains of graves, ceremonial vessels, or buildings have ever been found, suggesting no permanent settlement occurred before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. A 2016 reanalysis of Heyerdahl and Skjølsvold&#x27;s archaeological sites rejected their conclusions. They found thatat all locations excavated by the 1952 surveyartifacts of Indian and European origin were interspersed without the distinct spatial or stratigraphic arrangement that would be expected from independent sequential deposition. (Heyerdahl and Skjølsvold had noted this in their original report while ignoring its implications.) Radiocarbon dates from the sites placed them in the post-Spanish era and preliminary paleoenvironmental analysis showed no disturbance older than 500 years before present, suggesting no evidence from the survey that the islands were visited prior to their Spanish discovery in 1535. The authors suggested that native artifacts found by Heyerdahl and Skjølsvold had probably been brought as mementos or souvenirs at the time of Spanish occupation.

A 2008 report by archeologists from the Australian National University stated that certain AsiaPacific taxa may have been growing in the Galápagos prior to 1535. This opens a direction for future research which might &quot;constitute a strong line of evidence for accidental or deliberate landfall in the Galápagos by a Polynesian vessel&quot;, although the report noted current scholarship finds no evidence that Pacific islands beyond Easter Island &quot;play[ed] a &#x27;stepping stone&#x27; role in the interaction between Amerindians or Polynesians in prehistory&quot;. The lack of fresh water on the islands seems to have limited visits and settlement, if any ever occurred.

===European discovery===

European discovery of the Galápagos Islands is recorded occurring on 10 March 1535, when the Spanish bishop of Panama Tomás de Berlangasailing to Peru to adjudicate a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagrodrifted off course while his ship was becalmed in the Doldrums. They found the islands they visited uninhabited and so arid and barren that two men and ten horses died for lack of fresh water and the rest were forced to subsist on cactus pads. The ship left them unclaimed and unsettled. Berlanga, however, wrote a brief account of the islands, their condition, and their main wildlife for .

The Galápagos Islands first appeared on the maps of Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius around 1570.

===Pirate era===
The first English captain to visit the Galápagos Islands was Richard Hawkins in 1593. Until the early 19th century, the archipelago was often used as a hideout by (mostly English) pirates who attacked Spanish treasure fleets carrying gold, silver, and supplies from Peru to Panama and Spain. The English pirate William Ambrosia Cowley thoroughly mapped the islands in 1684 while sailing on John Cook&#x27;s &quot;Batchelor&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Delight&quot; and John Eaton&#x27;s &quot;Nicholas&quot; as they raided Peruvian shipping. One cargo captured that year was 78 tuns of quince marmalade, whose remains scattered pottery around the islands. Publishing the first thorough chart of the islands, Cowley coined the English names for 16 of the islands, chiefly honoring English royalty, nobles, and Jamaican officials of the era who might provide future patronage. 

In 1793, during the early French Revolutionary Wars, the British captain James Colnett described the flora and fauna of Galápagos and suggested the islands could be used as a base for whalers operating in the Pacific. Colnett improved upon Cowley&#x27;s chart, coining additional names although accidentally transferring Cowley&#x27;s Charles Island from Española to Floreana. Whalers and maritime fur traders killed and captured thousands of the Galápagos tortoises to extract their fat. The tortoises could be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein, as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water. The hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing, and in some cases eliminating, certain species. Along with whalers came the fur-seal hunters, who brought the population of this animal close to extinction.

===19th century===

The first known permanent human resident on Galápagos was Patrick Watkins, an Irish sailor who was marooned on the Floreana from 1807 to 1809. According to later accounts, Watkins managed to survive by hunting, growing vegetables and trading with visiting whalers before stealing a longboat from a whaling ship, impressing five of its crew as his &quot;slaves&quot;, and navigating to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland. Watkins was the only one of the six to survive the journey.

In 1818, the Nantucket whaleship &quot;Globe&quot; under Captain George Washington Gardner discovered a &quot;mother lode&quot; of sperm whales some thousand miles west of the South American coast approximately at the equator. He returned to Nantucket in 1820 with more than 2,000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery. This led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the Galápagos Islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the Offshore Grounds. This led to the establishment in the Galápagos Islands of a kind of unofficial &quot;post office&quot; where whaleships stopped to pick up and drop off letters as well as for provisioning and repairing.

In October 1820, the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot; out of Nantucket stopped at the Galápagos for these purposes on its way to the Offshore Grounds. On Colnett&#x27;s Charles Island, while most of the crew were hunting tortoises one crewmember, English boatsteerer Thomas Chappelfor reasons still unclearlit a fire which quickly burned out of control. Some of the tortoise hunters had a narrow escape and had to run a gauntlet of fire to get back to the ship. Soon almost the entire island was in flames. Crewmembers reported that after a day of sailing away they could still see the flames against the horizon. One crewmember who returned to the Galápagos several years afterward described the entire island as still a blackened wasteland.

Ecuador won its independence from Spain in 1822 and seceded from Gran Colombia in 1830. Gen. José de Villamil, the founder of the Ecuadorian Navy, led the push to colonize and settle the islands before Ecuador&#x27;s neighbors or the European empires could occupy them. He formed the Galapagos Settlement Company in mid-1831 and, with President Juan José Flores&#x27;s support, sent Col. Ignacio Hernández with a dozen craftsmen to begin the settlement on Charles Islandrenamed &quot;Floriana&quot; in the president&#x27;s honourearly the next year. Hernández conducted a formal ceremony of annexation on Floreana on 12 February 1832, now celebrated locally as Galápagos Day or the Day of the Province. (Darwin&#x27;s birthday was the same day, as was Francisco de Orellana&#x27;s arrival at the headwaters of the Amazon River in 1542, celebrated on the mainland as Amazon Day.) Villamil arrived in September and established Haven of Peace ( or ) in the island&#x27;s highlands. The initial colonists who joined him were Ecuadorian soldierschiefly political prisonerswhose death sentences were commuted in exchange for their agreement to permanently settle the islands with their families. They were joined in October by additional artisans and farmers, bringing the population to about 120, at which point Villamil was formally made the area&#x27;s first governor. Villamil&#x27;s lieutenant governor was the Norwegian-born American and Chilean sailor and shipwright Nicholas Oliver Lawson. Haven of Peace was originally successful and peaceful but, after being named a penal colony in March 1833, violence and costs began to rise. Villamil was faced with bankruptcy by 1837 and resigned his post, founding a colony of 21 on Indefatigable Islandrenamed Boliviaand leaving Lawson as its mayor. Gen. Villamil&#x27;s successorsincompetent, strict, or bothprompted a bloody uprising in 1841 that caused most settlers to return to the mainland. Villamil returned to try to rebuild afterwards but was unsuccessful and abandoned the attempt in 1848.
The second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; under captain Robert FitzRoy was undertaken to better survey the coasts and harbours of South America for the British Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic Department. It reached the Galápagos on 15 September 1835 andwhile surveying its islands, channels, and baysthe captain and others on the crew observed the geology, plants, and wildlife on Floreana, Isabela, and Santiago before continuing on their round-the-world expedition on 20 October. The young naturalist Charles Darwin, primarily a geologist at the time, was struck by the many volcanic features they saw, later referring to the archipelago as &quot;that land of craters&quot;. His study of several volcanic formations over the five weeks he stayed in the islands led to several important geological discoveries, including the first correct explanation for how volcanic tuff is formed. Darwin noticed the mockingbirds differed between islands, though he thought the birds now known as Darwin&#x27;s finches were unrelated to each other and did not bother labelling them by island. Acting as governor of the islands while Villamil was on the mainland, Nicholas Lawson met Darwin and the British crew, mentioning in passing that the tortoises of the different islands could be easily identified by their different shells. By the end of his voyage, Darwin was beginning to wonder if the distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might &quot;undermine the stability of Species&quot;. Upon his return to England, analysis of the bird specimens he had collected showed that what had appeared to be many different species were actually finches displaying developments unique to the islands. The voyage became crucial in Darwin&#x27;s development of his theory of evolution of species by natural selection, presented in the 1859 &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

The Englishman William Gurney became mayor of a new settlement on Chatham Island in 1844.

In April 1888 , a Navy-crewed research vessel assigned to the United States Fish Commission, briefly touched eight islands in the Galapagos group for specimens; this included Wreck Bay on Chatham Island (now San Cristóbal Island) on 4 April and Charles Island (now Floreana Island) on 8 April.

José Valdizán and Manuel Julián Cobos tried a new colonization, beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands (&quot;Roccella portentosa&quot;) used as a coloring agent. After the assassination of Valdizán by some of his workers, Cobos brought from the continent to San Cristóbal Island a group of more than a hundred workers, and tried his luck at planting sugar cane. He ruled his plantation with an iron hand, which led to his assassination in 1904. In 1897, Antonio Gil began another plantation on Isabela Island.

Over the course of a whole year, from September 1904, an expedition of the Academy of Sciences of California, led by Rollo Beck, stayed in the Galápagos collecting scientific material on geology, entomology, ornithology, botany, zoology, and herpetology. Another expedition from that Academy was done in 1932 (Templeton Crocker Expedition) to collect insects, fish, shells, fossils, birds, and plants.

===20th century===
For a long time during the early 1900s and at least through 1929, a cash-strapped Ecuador had reached out for potential buyers of the islands to alleviate financial troubles at home. The US had repeatedly expressed its interest in buying the islands for military use as they were positioned strategically guarding the Panama Canal. Besides the United States, Japan, Germany and Chile also expressed interest in establishing bases in the islands at the turn of the century. Chile had previously acquired the Straits of Magellan and Easter Island for strategic reasons and lieutenant Gregorio Santa Cruz argued in 1903 that possessing an island in equatorial waters, like the Galápagos, would be of great benefit since the geopolitical situation of Chile was expected to drastically change when the Panama Canal opened. Another benefit would be to widen the security radius of Chile. Chile was alarmed by the United States plans to establish a Guantanamo-like base in the Galápagos Islands since it would mean that Chile&#x27;s nitrate-rich northern provinces would be within the range of United States Navy. Ecuador&#x27;s staunch resistance to a US purchase or bases in the islands can be credited to Chilean diplomacy, which in turn was informally backed on this issue by Great Britain and Germany.

In the 1920s and 1930s, a small wave of European settlers arrived in the islands. There occurred a series of unsolved disappearances on the island of Floreana in the 1930s among the largely European expatriate residents at the time, which prompted the movies &quot;The Empress of Floreana&quot; and &quot;The Galápagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden&quot;. Ecuadorian laws provided all colonists with the possibility of receiving twenty hectares each of free land, the right to maintain their citizenship, freedom from taxation for the first ten years in Galápagos, and the right to hunt and fish freely on all uninhabited islands where they might settle. The first European colonists to arrive were Norwegians who settled briefly on Floreana, before moving on to San Cristobal and Santa Cruz. A few years later, other colonists from Europe, America and Ecuador started arriving on the islands, seeking a simpler life. Descendants of the Norwegian Kastdalen family and the German Angermeyer still live on the islands.

During World War II, Ecuador authorized the United States to establish a naval base in Baltra Island, and radar stations in other strategic locations. Baltra was established as a United States Army Air Force base. Baltra was given the name of &quot;Beta Base&quot; along with &quot;Alpha Base&quot; in Nicaragua and &quot;Gamma Base&quot; in Salinas (continental Ecuador). The Crews stationed at Baltra and the aforementioned locations established a geographic triangle of protection in charge of patrolling the Pacific for enemy submarines, and also provided protection for the Panama Canal. After the war, the facilities were given to the government of Ecuador. Today, the island continues as an official Ecuadorian military base. The foundations and other remains of the US base can still be seen as one crosses the island.
In 1946, a penal colony was established on Isabela Island, but it was suspended in 1959.

Galápagos National Park was established in 1959, with tourism starting to expand in the 1960s, imposing several restrictions upon the human population already living on the island. However, opportunities in the tourism, fishing, and farming industries attracted a mass of poor fishermen and farmers from mainland Ecuador. In the 1990s and 2000s, violent confrontations between parts of the local population and the Galápagos National Park Service occurred, including capturing and killing giant tortoises and holding staff of the Galápagos National Park Service hostage to obtain higher annual sea cucumber quotas.
===21st century===
In May 2023, Credit Suisse said it would buy Ecuador&#x27;s debt of $1.6 billion in a &quot;Debt-for-nature swap&quot;. It will sell 2035 and 2040 bonds for Galapagos conservation at a reduced issue price. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation insures the deal, which per Reuters was &quot;in the works for more than a year&quot;, predating UBS takeover of Credit Suisse.

==Politics==
The islands are administered as Ecuador&#x27;s Galápagos Province, established by presidential decree on 18 February 1973 during the administration of Guillermo Rodríguez Lara. The province is divided into three cantons, each covering groups of islands. The capital is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno.

==Demographics==
The largest ethnic group is composed of Ecuadorian Mestizos, the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Native Americans, who arrived mainly in the last century from the continental part of Ecuador. Some descendants of the early European and American colonists on the islands also still remain on the islands.

In 1959, approximately 1,000 to 2,000 people called the islands their home. In 1972 a census in the archipelago recorded a population of 3,488. By the 1980s, this number had risen to more than 15,000 people, and in 2010 there were 25,124 people in the Galápagos. 2021 projected population was 40,685.

Five of the islands are inhabited: Baltra, Floreana, Isabela, San Cristóbal, and Santa Cruz.

==Travel==
Options for air travel to the Galápagos are limited to two islands: San Cristobal (San Cristóbal Airport) and Baltra (Seymour Airport). Private aircraft must use Baltra as it is the airport equipped with overnight plane accommodations. Seymour Airport on Baltra was recently renovated (2012–2013) to accommodate larger planes.

Until 1969 the only way to visit was on a private or chartered vessel. There was no regular air service until Forrest Nelson&#x27;s Hotel Galápagos began the first organized tours in April 1969. Soon other travel companies brought in tour ships and yachts, and local fishermen began converting their wooden boats for rudimentary cruising with guests. These vessels were the main source of overnight accommodations in the Galápagos. Today there are about 85 yachts and ships equipped for overnight guests. In 2006 the Baltra military governed island, was opened up to limited overnight camping. Baltra also requires permits by the military government for overnight stays on the beach. Other inhabited islands also allow camping on the beaches designated as &quot;recreational&quot; use to the locals. All of these camping permits are limited to number of people and nights, with most nights not to exceed three.

Land based hotels are opening on the inhabited islands of San Cristobal, Santa Cruz, Floreana and Isabela. By 2012, more than half the visitors to Galápagos made their tours using day boats and these small hotels. Restaurants, easy access and economy make this an attractive travel option.

There are only 116 visitor sites in the Galápagos: 54 land sites and 62 scuba-diving or snorkeling sites. Small groups are allowed to visit in 2- to 4-hour shifts only, to limit impact on the area. All groups are accompanied by licensed guides.

==Environmental protection policy==

 


Though the first protective legislation for the Galápagos was enacted in 1930 and supplemented in 1936, it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna. In 1955, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature organized a fact-finding mission to the Galápagos. Two years later, in 1957, UNESCO, in cooperation with the government of Ecuador, sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station.

In 1959, the centenary year of Charles Darwin&#x27;s publication of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, the Ecuadorian government declared 97.5% of the archipelago&#x27;s land area a national park, excepting areas already colonised. The Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) was founded the same year. The core responsibility of CDF, an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) constituted in Belgium, is to conduct research and provide the research findings to the government for effective management of Galápagos. CDF&#x27;s research efforts began with the establishment of the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island in 1964. During the early years, conservation programs, such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species, were carried out by research station personnel. Now much of that work is accomplished by the Galápagos National Park Service using the research findings and methodologies developed by CDF.

In 1986, the 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 sq mi) of ocean surrounding the islands was declared a marine reserve, second in size only to Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef. In 1990, the archipelago became a whale sanctuary. UNESCO recognized the islands in 1978 as a World Heritage Site and in 1985, as a biosphere reserve. This was later extended in December 2001 to include the marine reserve. In July 2010, the World Heritage Committee agreed to remove the Galápagos Islands from its list of precious sites endangered by environmental threats or overuse.

Noteworthy species include:
* Galápagos dove, &quot;Zenaida galapagoensis&quot;, two subspecies
* Galápagos flycatcher, &quot;Myiarchus magnirostris&quot;
* Galápagos land iguanas, &quot;Conolophus&quot; spp.
* Marine iguana, &quot;Amblyrhynchus cristatus&quot;, the only iguana feeding in the sea
* Galápagos tortoise (Galápagos giant tortoise), &quot;Chelonoidis nigra&quot;, known as in Spanish, it gave the name to the islands
* Galápagos green turtle, &quot;Chelonia mydas agassisi&quot;, a subspecies of the green turtle
* Galápagos racer, &quot;Pseudalsophis biserialis&quot;, an endemic species of snake with two subspecies
* Sea cucumbers, the cause of environmental battles with fishermen over quotas of this expensive Asian delicacy
* Flightless cormorant, &quot;Phalacrocorax harrisi&quot;
* Great frigatebird and magnificent frigatebird
* Blue-footed booby, &quot;Sula nebouxii&quot;, popular among visitors for their large blue feet which they show off in courtship
* Galápagos penguin, &quot;Spheniscus mendiculus&quot;, the only living tropical penguin
* Waved albatross, &quot;Phoebastria irrorata&quot;, the only living tropical albatross
* Galápagos hawk, &quot;Buteo galapagoensis&quot;, the islands&#x27; main scavenger (at the top of the food chain) and &quot;environmental police&quot;
* Four endemic species of Galápagos mockingbirds, the first species Darwin noticed to vary from island to island
* Thirteen endemic species of tanagers, popularly called Darwin&#x27;s finches. Among them is the sharp-beaked ground finch &quot;Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis&quot; which is sometimes called the &quot;vampire finch&quot; for its blood-sucking habits, and the tool-using woodpecker finch, &quot;Camarhynchus pallidus&quot;
* Galápagos sea lions, &quot;Zalophus wollebaeki&quot;, closely related to the California sea lion, but smaller
* Two endemic genera of cacti, each with a single species: &quot;Jasminocereus thouarsii&quot;, the candelabra cactus, and &quot;Brachycereus nesioticus&quot;, the lava cactus

===Environmental threats===

Introduced plants and animals, such as feral goats, cats, and cattle, brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans, represent the main threat to Galápagos. Quick to reproduce and with no natural predators, these alien species decimated the habitats of native species. The native animals, lacking natural predators on the islands, are defenseless to introduced predators.

There are over 700 introduced plant species today. There are only 500 native and endemic species. This difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them. These plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of San Cristobal, Floreana, Isabela and Santa Cruz. Some of the most harmful introduced plants are the guayaba or guava (&quot;Psidium guajava&quot;), avocado (&quot;Persea americana&quot;), cascarilla (&quot;Cinchona pubescens&quot;), balsa (&quot;Ochroma pyramidale&quot;), hill raspberry (&quot;Rubus niveus&quot;), various citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon), floripondio, higuerilla (&quot;Ricinus communis&quot;) trees and the elephant grass, &quot;Pennisetum purpureum&quot;.

Many species were introduced to the Galápagos by pirates. Thor Heyerdahl quoted documents that mention the Viceroy of Peru, knowing that British pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats. Also, when colonization of Floreana by José de Villamil failed, he ordered the goats, donkeys, cattle and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization.

The black rat () attacks small Galápagos tortoises when they leave the nest, so in Pinzón they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50 years; only adults were found on that island. Also, where the black rat is found, the endemic rat has disappeared. Cattle and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for scarce water. In 1959, fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to Pinta island; by 1973, the National Park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals. Goats were also introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971. A goat eradication program, however, cleared the goats from Pinta and Santiago and most of the goat population from Isabela, and, by 2006, all feral pigs, donkeys and non-sterile goats had been eliminated from Santiago and Isabela, the largest islands with the worst problems due to non-native mammals.

Six species of small non-native vertebrates have established self-sufficient populations in Galápagos and may become invasive: Fowler&#x27;s snouted tree frog &quot;Scinax quinquefasciatus&quot;, common house gecko &quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;, mourning gecko &quot;Lepidodactylus lugubris&quot;, dwarf gecko &quot;Gonatodes caudiscutatus&quot;, Peters&#x27; leaf-toed gecko &quot;Phyllodactylus reissii&quot;, and smooth-billed ani &quot;Crotophaga ani&quot;. Domestic fowl &quot;Gallus gallus&quot; holds feral populations, which may have self-sufficient populations, but evidence is unclear.

The fast-growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists, who fear domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic wild bird populations.

The Galápagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities, in addition to other problems of development. The most pressing threat to the Marine Reserve comes from local, mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the Reserve, such as sharks (hammerheads and other species) for their fins, and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season. Development threatens both land and sea species. The growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the Archipelago. The grounding of the oil tanker &quot;Jessica&quot; in 2001 and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention.

In 2007, UNESCO put the Galápagos Islands on their List of World Heritage in Danger because of threats posed by invasive species, unbridled tourism and overfishing.
On 29 July 2010, the World Heritage Committee decided to remove the Galápagos Islands from the list because the Committee found significant progress had been made by Ecuador in addressing these problems.

On 28 January 2008, Galápagos National Park official Victor Carrion announced 53 sea lions (13 pups, 25 youngsters, 9 males and 6 females) were killed at the Galápagos Islands nature reserve on Pinta, with their heads caved in. In 2001, poachers killed 35 male sea lions.

The Galápagos Islands were short-listed as a candidate to be one of the New7Wonders of Nature by the New7Wonders of Nature Foundation. As of February 2009, the archipelago was ranked first in Group B, the category for islands.

The islands&#x27; biodiversity is under threat from several sources. The human population is growing at a rate of 8% per year (1995). Introduced species have caused damage, and in 1996 a US$5 million, five-year eradication plan commenced in an attempt to rid the islands of introduced species such as goats, rats, deer, and donkeys. Except for the rats, the project was essentially completed in 2006. Rats have only been eliminated from the smaller Galápagos Islands of Rábida and Pinzón.

El Niño has adversely affected the marine ecosystem. In January 2001, an oil slick from a stranded tanker threatened the islands, but winds and shifting ocean currents helped disperse the oil before much damage was done. The devastating El Niño of 1982–83 saw almost six times as much rain as normal in the Galapagos and created a wildlife catastrophe. The 1997–98 El Niño adversely affected wildlife in the waters surrounding the islands, as the waters were warmer than normal. Corals and barnacles suffered, hammerhead sharks were driven away, and most of the island&#x27;s seabirds failed to breed in 1997–98. The mortality rate of marine iguanas rose as the green algae they feed on was replaced by inedible red algae. During the 1982–83 El Niño, 70% of the marine iguanas starved to death because of this.

<doc id="171123" wikidata="Q2856113" url="?curid=171123" title="Science Friday">
<text>Science Friday (known as SciFri for short) is a weekly call-in talk show that broadcasts each Friday on public radio stations, distributed by WNYC Studios, and carried on over 470 public radio stations. &quot;SciFri&quot; is hosted by science journalist Ira Flatow and was created and is produced by the Science Friday Initiative. The program is divided into two one-hour programs, with each hour ending with a complete sign-off. The focus of each program is news and information on science, nature, medicine, and technology. The show originated as the Friday episode of the daily call-in talk show &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, but was spun off as a series in its own right when &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; was canceled in June 2013.

The &quot;Science Friday&quot; radio program is produced by the Science Friday Initiative, a 501(c)(3) organization. The Science Friday Initiative is an independently run organization with a governing Board of Directors and Executive Director. In addition to the radio program, the organization creates educational and digital content, finds underwriting for the program, and hosts public science events.

&quot;Science Friday&quot; is also available in a podcasting format and is one of the most popular iTunes downloads, frequently in the top 15 downloads each week. &quot;SciFri&quot; podcasts are downloaded over 23 million times per year.

&quot;SciFri&quot; broadcasts excerpts from the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony on the Friday after Thanksgiving.

==Funding==
The Science Friday Initiative accepts tax-deductible donations on behalf of the radio program.

&quot;Science Friday&quot; is funded by stations fees that broadcast the program, by individual donors, by advertising underwriters, and by foundation grants including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Research Corporation for Science Advancement, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and Heising-Simons Foundation. Formerly the program was supported by the Noyce Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Science Friday has received federal funding from the US National Science Foundation and NASA.

==History==
&quot;SciFri&quot; was created when the National Science Foundation agreed to fund a weekly science talk-show on NPR. After the Gulf War in 1991, NPR created the daily talk show &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, with &quot;Science Friday&quot; originating as the Friday edition of that series. &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; ended its run in 2013, after which &quot;Science Friday&quot; became a standalone series and moved from NPR to Public Radio International in 2014.

&quot;Science Friday&quot; maintained an island (Science Friday Island) in Second Life, including an open-air theater with live audio and video feeds of the broadcast. That venue is no longer in operation.

On November 9, 2012, ScienceFriday, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in New York state court against a long-running Denver radio program, titled &quot;Real Science Friday&quot;, hosted by two young earth creationists including Colorado pastor and radio personality Bob Enyart. The show was re-titled &quot;Real Science Radio&quot;.

On April 11, 2018, distribution of the show changed hands once more when it went from PRI to WNYC Studios.

=== Undiscovered ===
&quot;Science Friday&quot; launched a spinoff podcast in collaboration with WNYC Studios entitled &quot;Undiscovered&quot;, which debuted in early 2017. The show is hosted by Elah Feder and Annie Minoff. The show is about the history of science.

<doc id="171126" wikidata="Q76546" url="?curid=171126" title="Erich Kästner">
<text>Emil Erich Kästner (; 23 February 1899 – 29 July 1974) was a German writer, poet, screenwriter and satirist, known primarily for his humorous, socially astute poems and for children&#x27;s books including &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot; and &quot;Lisa and Lottie&quot;. He received the international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1960 for his autobiography &quot;. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in six separate years.

==Biography==
===Dresden (1899–1919)===

Kästner was born in Dresden, Saxony, and grew up on Königsbrücker Straße in Dresden&#x27;s Äußere Neustadt. Close by, the Erich Kästner Museum was subsequently opened in the Villa Augustin that had belonged to Kästner&#x27;s uncle Franz Augustin.

Kästner&#x27;s father, Emil Richard Kästner, was a master saddlemaker. His mother, Ida Amalia (née Augustin), had been a maidservant, but in her thirties she trained as a hairstylist in order to supplement her husband&#x27;s income. Kästner had a particularly close relationship with his mother. When he was living in Leipzig and Berlin, he wrote her fairly intimate letters and postcards almost every day, and overbearing mothers make regular appearances in his writings. It has been rumored that Erich Kästner&#x27;s natural father was the family&#x27;s Jewish doctor, Emil Zimmermann (1864–1953), but these rumors have never been substantiated. Kästner wrote about his childhood in his autobiography &quot; (1957, translated as &quot;When I Was a Little Boy&quot;). According to Kästner, he did not suffer from being an only child, had many friends, and was not lonely or overindulged.

In 1913, Kästner entered a teacher training school in Dresden. However, he dropped out in 1916 shortly before completing the exams that would have qualified him to teach in state schools. He was drafted into the Royal Saxon Army in 1917 and was trained at a heavy artillery unit in Dresden. Kästner was not sent to the front, but the brutality of the military training he underwent and the death of contemporaries he experienced strongly influenced his later antimilitarism. The merciless drilling he was subjected to by his drill sergeant also caused a lifelong heart condition. Kästner portrays this in his poem &quot;Sergeant Waurich&quot;.

After the end of the war, Kästner went back to school and passed the Abitur exam with distinction, earning a scholarship from the city of Dresden.

===Leipzig (1919–1927)===

In the autumn of 1919, Kästner enrolled at the University of Leipzig to study history, philosophy, German studies, and theater. His studies took him to Rostock and Berlin, and in 1925 he received a doctorate for a thesis on Frederick the Great and German literature. He paid for his studies by working as a journalist and critic for a newspaper, the &quot;Neue Leipziger Zeitung&quot;. However, his increasingly critical reviews, and the &quot;frivolous&quot; publication of his erotic poem &quot;Abendlied des Kammervirtuosen&quot; (Evening Song of the Chamber Virtuoso) with illustrations by Erich Ohser, led to his dismissal in 1927. That same year, he moved to Berlin, although he continued to write for the &quot;Neue Leipziger Zeitung&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Berthold Bürger&quot; (&quot;Bert Citizen&quot;) as a freelance correspondent. Kästner later used several other pseudonyms, including &quot;Melchior Kurtz&quot;, &quot;Peter Flint&quot;, and &quot;Robert Neuner&quot;.

===Berlin (1927–1933)===

Kästner&#x27;s years in Berlin, from 1927 until the end of the Weimar Republic in 1933, were his most productive. He published poems, newspaper columns, articles, and reviews in many of Berlin&#x27;s important periodicals. He was a regular contributor to dailies such as the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; and the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot;, as well as to &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot;. Hans Sarkowicz and Franz Josef Görtz, the editors of his complete works (1998), list over 350 articles written between 1923 and 1933, but he must have written even more, since many texts are known to have been lost when Kästner&#x27;s flat burned down during a bombing raid in February 1944.

Kästner published his first book of poems, &quot;Herz auf Taille&quot;, in 1928, and by 1933 he had published three more collections. His &quot;Gebrauchslyrik&quot; (&quot;Lyrics for Everyday Use&quot;) made him one of the leading figure of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement, which focused on using a sobering, distant and objective style to satirise contemporary society.

In the autumn of 1928, he published his best-known children&#x27;s book, &quot;Emil und die Detektive&quot;, illustrated by Walter Trier. The owner of the Weltbühne publishing house, Edith Jacobsen, had suggested the idea of writing a detective story to Kästner. The book sold two million copies in Germany alone and has since been translated into 59 languages. The novel was unusual in that, in contrast to most children&#x27;s literature of the period, it is set in contemporary Berlin and not in a fairy-tale world. Kästner also refrained from overt moralising, letting the characters&#x27; actions speak for themselves. Its sequel, &quot;Emil und die Drei Zwillinge&quot; (1933; &quot;Emil and the Three Twins&quot;) takes place on the shores of the Baltic. The Emil books may have influenced the creation of other books in the subgenre of literature about child detectives. &quot;Emil und die Detektive&quot; has been adapted for the cinema five times, three of them in Germany: in 1931, 1935 (UK), 1954, 1964 (USA) and 2001.

Kästner followed this success with &quot;Pünktchen und Anton&quot; (1931) and &quot;Das fliegende Klassenzimmer&quot; (1933). Walter Trier&#x27;s illustration significantly contributed to the books&#x27; overwhelming popularity. &quot;Das fliegende Klassenzimmer&quot; has been adapted for the cinema several times: in 1954 by Kurt Hoffmann, in 1973 by Werner Jacobs and in by .

In 1932 Kästner wrote &quot;Der 35. Mai (The 35th of May)&quot;, which is set in a fantasy land entered via a wardrobe and includes futuristic features such as mobile phones.

Gerhard Lamprecht&#x27;s film version of &quot;Emil und die Detektive&quot; (1931) was a great success. Kästner, however, was dissatisfied with the screenplay, and that led him to become a screenwriter for the Babelsberg film studios.

Kästner&#x27;s only major adult novel, &quot;&quot;, was published in 1931. Kästner included rapid cuts and montages in it, in an attempt to mimic cinematic style. Fabian, an unemployed literary expert, experiences the uproariously fast pace of the times as well as the downfall of the Weimar Republic.

From 1927 until 1931, Kästner lived at Prager Straße 17 (today near no. 12) in Berlin–Wilmersdorf and after that, until February 1945, at Roscherstraße 16 in Berlin-Charlottenburg.

===Berlin (1933–1945)===

Kästner was a pacifist and wrote for children because of his belief in the regenerative powers of youth. He resisted the Nazi regime and was one of the signatories to the Urgent Call for Unity. However, unlike many other authors critical of the dictatorship, Kästner did not go into exile. After the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, he visited Merano and Switzerland and met with exiled writers, yet he returned to Berlin, arguing that there he would be better able to chronicle events. It is probable that he also wanted to avoid abandoning his mother. His &quot;Necessary Answer to Superfluous Questions&quot; (&quot;Notwendige Antwort auf überflüssige Fragen&quot;) in &quot;Kurz und Bündig&quot; explains Kästner&#x27;s position:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;I&#x27;m a German from Dresden in Saxony
My homeland won&#x27;t let me go
I&#x27;m like a tree that, grown in Germany,
Will likely wither there also.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Gestapo interrogated Kästner several times, the national writers&#x27; guild expelled him, and the Nazis burned his books as &quot;contrary to the German spirit&quot; during the book burnings of 10 May 1933, instigated by Joseph Goebbels. Kästner witnessed the event in person and later wrote about it. He was denied membership of the new Nazi-controlled national writers&#x27; guild, Reichsverband deutscher Schriftsteller (RDS), because of what its officials called the &quot;culturally Bolshevist attitude in his writings prior to 1933.&quot;

During the Third Reich, Kästner published apolitical novels such as &quot;Drei Männer im Schnee&quot; (&quot;Three Men in the Snow&quot;) (1934) in Switzerland. In 1942, he received a special exemption to write the screenplay for &quot;Münchhausen&quot;, using the pseudonym Berthold Bürger. The film was a prestige project by Ufa Studios to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its establishment, an enterprise backed by Goebbels.

In 1944, Kästner&#x27;s home in Berlin was destroyed during a bombing raid. In early 1945, he and others pretended that they had to travel to the rural community of Mayrhofen in Tyrol for location shooting for a (non-existent) film, &quot;Das falsche Gesicht&quot; (The Wrong Face). The actual purpose of the journey was to avoid the final Soviet assault on Berlin. Kästner had also received a warning that the SS planned to kill him and other Nazi opponents before arrival of the Soviets. He was in Mayrhofen when the war ended. He wrote about this period in a diary published in 1961 under the title &quot;Notabene 45&quot;. Another edition, closer to Kästner&#x27;s original notes, was published in 2006 under the title &quot;Das Blaue Buch&quot; (The Blue Book).

===Kästner and the bombing of Dresden===

In his diary for 1945, published many years later, Kästner describes his shock at arriving in Dresden shortly after the bombing of the city in World War II (February 1945) and finding it a pile of ruins in which he could recognize none of the streets or landmarks among which he had spent his childhood.

His autobiography &quot;Als ich ein kleiner Junge war&quot; includes a lament for Dresden (quoted from the English translation, &quot;When I Was a Little Boy&quot;): &quot;I was born in the most beautiful city in the world. Even if your father, child, was the richest man in the world, he could not take you to see it, because it does not exist any more. ... In a thousand years was her beauty built, in one night was it utterly destroyed.&quot;

===Munich (1945–1974)===

After the end of the war, Kästner moved to Munich, where he became culture editor for the &quot;Neue Zeitung&quot; and publisher of &#x27;, a magazine for children and young people. He was also active in literary cabaret, in productions at the Schaubude (1945–1948) and Die kleine Freiheit (after 1951), and in radio. During this time, he wrote a number of skits, songs, audio plays, speeches, and essays about National Socialism, the war years, and the stark realities of life in post-war Germany. Most notable among these works are &quot;Marschlied 1945&quot; and &quot;Deutsches Ringelspiel&quot;. He also continued to write children&#x27;s books, including &#x27; (&quot;The Animals&#x27; Conference&quot;), a pacifist satire in which the world&#x27;s animals unite to successfully force humans to disarm and make peace. This picture book was made into by Curt Linda. Kästner also renewed his collaboration with Edmund Nick, whom he had met in Leipzig in 1929, when Nick, then Head of the Music Department at Radio Silesia, wrote the music for Kästner&#x27;s radio play &quot;Leben in dieser Zeit&quot;. Nick, now the Musical Director at the Schaubude, set more than 60 of Kästner&#x27;s songs to music.

Kästner&#x27;s optimism in the immediate post-war era gave way to resignation as Germans in the West attempted to normalize their lives following the economic reforms of the early 1950s and the ensuing &quot;economic miracle&quot; (&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;). He became further disillusioned as Chancellor Konrad Adenauer remilitarized West Germany, made it a member of NATO, and rearmed it for possible military conflict with the Warsaw Pact. Kästner remained a pacifist and spoke out at anti-militarist demonstrations against the nuclear weapons in West Germany. Later, he also took firm stand against the Vietnam War. Kästner began to publish less and less, partly because of his increasing alcoholism. He did not join any of the post-war literary movements in West Germany, and in the 1950s and 1960s he came to be perceived mainly as an author of children&#x27;s books.

His novel &quot;Fabian&quot; was made into a movie in 1980, as were several of his children&#x27;s books. The most popular of these adaptations are Disney&#x27;s 1961 American film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; starring Hayley Mills and its 1998 remake starring Lindsay Lohan, both based on his novel &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; (&quot;Lisa and Lottie&quot;). In 1960, Kästner received the Hans Christian Andersen Award for &quot;Als ich ein kleiner Junge war&quot;, his autobiography. The English translation by Florence and Isabel McHugh, published as &quot;When I Was a Little Boy&quot; in 1959, won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1961. 
Kästner received several other awards, including the Filmband in Gold for best screenplay for the German film version of &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; (1950), the literary prize of the city of Munich in 1956, and the Georg Büchner Prize in 1957. The government of West Germany honored Kästner with its order of merit, the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit), in 1959. In 1968 he received the together with the literary prize of the German Masonic Order.

In 1951, Kästner was elected President of the PEN Center of West Germany, and he remained in office until 1961. In 1965 he became President Emeritus. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Internationale Jugendbibliothek, a library in Munich that collects and preserves children&#x27;s and youth books from all over the world. In 1953 he was founding member of IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People).

Kästner never married. He wrote his last two children&#x27;s books, &quot;Der kleine Mann&quot; and &quot;Der kleine Mann und die kleine Miss&quot;, for his son Thomas Kästner, who was born in 1957. Kästner frequently read from his works. In the 1920s, he recorded some of his poems of social criticism and in some of the films based on his books he performed as the narrator, as he did for the first audio production of &quot;Pünktchen und Anton&quot;. Other recordings for Deutsche Grammophon include poems, epigrams, and his version of the folk tale &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;. He also read in theaters, such as the Cuvilliés Theatre in Munich, and for the radio, for which he read &quot;Als ich ein kleiner Junge war&quot; and other works.

Kästner died of esophageal cancer on 29 July 1974 in the Neuperlach Hospital in Munich. He was buried in the St. George cemetery in the Bogenhausen district of Munich. Shortly after his death, the Bavarian Academy of Arts established a literary prize in his name. Many streets in Germany and the asteroid 12318 Kästner are named after him.

<text>The Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) is the third-level military decoration awarded to officers, and since 1993 to other ranks, of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Air Force and other services, and formerly to officers of other Commonwealth countries, for &quot;an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy&quot;.

==History==
The award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF), with the Royal Warrant published on 5 December 1919. It was originally awarded to RAF commissioned and warrant officers, including officers in Commonwealth and allied forces. In March 1941 eligibility was extended to Naval Officers of the Fleet Air Arm, and in November 1942 to Army officers, including Royal Artillery officers serving on attachment to the RAF as pilots-cum-artillery observers. Posthumous awards were permitted from 1979.

Since the 1993 review of the honours system as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in bravery awards, all ranks of all arms of the Armed Forces have been eligible, and the Distinguished Flying Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks, was discontinued. While remaining a reward for &quot;flying in active operations against the enemy&quot;, the requirement was changed from &quot;valour, courage or devotion to duty&quot; to &quot;exemplary gallantry&quot;.

The DFC had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.

The DFC now serves as the third-level award for all ranks of the British Armed Forces for exemplary gallantry in active operations against the enemy in the air, not to the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. Apart from honorary awards to those serving with allied forces, all awards of the DFC are announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;.

A bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a further award, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone to denote the award of each bar.

Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;DFC&quot;.

==Description==
The decoration, designed by Edward Carter Preston, is a cross flory, wide. The horizontal and bottom bars are terminated with bumps, the upper bar with a rose. The decoration&#x27;s face features aeroplane propellers, superimposed on the vertical arms of the cross, and wings on the horizontal arms. In the centre is a laurel wreath around the RAF monogram, surmounted by a heraldic Imperial Crown.

The reverse is plain, except for a central roundel bearing the reigning monarch&#x27;s cypher and the date &#x27;1918&#x27;. Originally awarded unnamed, from 1939 the year of issue was engraved on the reverse lower limb of cross, and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient.

The suspender is straight and decorated with laurel wreaths.

The ribbon bar denoting a further award is silver, with the Royal Air Force eagle in its centre. Bars awarded during World War II have the year of award engraved on the reverse.

The 1.25-inch (32 mm) ribbon was originally white with deep purple broad horizontal stripes, but it was changed in 1919 to the current white with purple broad diagonal stripes.
==Recipients==
===Numbers awarded===
From 1918 to 2017 approximately 22,322 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 1,737 bars have been awarded. The figures to 1979 are laid out in the table below, the dates reflecting the relevant entries in the London Gazette:

In addition, between 1980 and 2017 approximately 80 DFCs have been earned, including awards for the Falklands and the wars in the Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, two second-award, and one third-award bars have been awarded.

<text>The Black Country is an area of England&#x27;s West Midlands. It is mainly urban, covering most of the Dudley and Sandwell metropolitan boroughs, with the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall and the City of Wolverhampton sometimes included. The towns of Dudley and Tipton are generally considered to be the centre.

The road between Wolverhampton and Birmingham was described as &quot;one continuous town&quot; in 1785. The area was one of the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s birthplaces. Either the 30-foot-thick coal seam close to the surface or the mix of coalworks, cokeworks, ironworks, glassworks, brickworks and steelworks (which produced high levels of soot and air pollution at the time) led to the area&#x27;s name, which was first recorded in the 1840s.

== Extent ==
The Black Country has no single set of defined boundaries. Some traditionalists define it as &quot;the area where the coal seam comes to the surface – so West Bromwich, Coseley, Oldbury, Blackheath, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Bilston, Dudley, Tipton, Wednesbury, and parts of Halesowen, Walsall and Smethwick or what used to be known as Warley.&quot; There are records from the 18th century of shallow coal mines in Wolverhampton, however. Others have included areas slightly outside the coal field which were associated with heavy industry.

Bilston-born Samuel Griffiths, in his 1876 &quot;Griffiths Guide to the Iron Trade of Great Britain&quot;, stated &quot;The Black Country commences at Wolverhampton, extends a distance of sixteen miles to Stourbridge, eight miles to West Bromwich, penetrating the northern districts through Willenhall to Bentley, The Birchills, Walsall and Darlaston, Wednesbury, Smethwick and Dudley Port, West Bromwich and Hill Top, Brockmoor, Wordsley and Stourbridge. As the atmosphere becomes purer, we get to the higher ground of Brierley Hill, nevertheless here also, as far as the eye can reach, on all sides, tall chimneys vomit forth great clouds of smoke&quot;.

Today the term commonly refers to the majority of the four metropolitan boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton although it is said that &quot;no two Black Country men or women will agree on where it starts or ends&quot;.

=== Local government ===

Official use of the name came in 1987 with the Black Country Development Corporation, an urban development corporation covering the metropolitan boroughs of Sandwell and Walsall, which was disbanded in 1998. The Black Country Consortium (founded in 1999) and the Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership (founded in 2011) both define the Black Country as the four metropolitan boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton, an approximate area of .

===Cultural and industrial definition===
The borders of the Black Country can be defined by using the special cultural and industrial characteristics of the area. Areas around the canals (the cut) which had mines extracting mineral resources and heavy industry refining these are included in this definition. Cultural parameters include unique or characteristic foods such as groaty pudding, grey peas and bacon, faggots, gammon or pork hocks and pork scratchings; Black Country humour; and the Black Country dialect.

===Geological definitions===

The Black Country Society defines the Black Country&#x27;s borders as the area on the thirty foot coal seam, regardless the depth of the seam. This definition includes West Bromwich and Oldbury, which had many deep pits, and Smethwick. The thick coal that underlies Smethwick was not mined until the 1870s and Smethwick has retained more Victorian character than most West Midland areas. Sandwell Park Colliery&#x27;s pit was located in Smethwick and had &#x27;thick coal&#x27; as shown in written accounts from 1878 and coal was also heavily mined in Hamstead, further east, whose workings extended well under what is now north Birmingham. Smethwick and Dudley Port were described as &quot;a thousand swarming hives of metallurgical industries&quot; by Samuel Griffiths in 1872.

Another geological definition, the seam outcrop definition, only includes areas where the coal seam is shallow, making the soil black at the surface. Some coal mining areas to the east and west of the geologically defined Black Country are therefore excluded by this definition because the coal here is too deep down and does not outcrop. The seam outcrop definition excludes areas in North Worcestershire and South Staffordshire.

== Toponymy ==

The first recorded use of the term &quot;the Black Country&quot; may be from a toast given by a Mr Simpson, town clerk to Lichfield, addressing a Reformer&#x27;s meeting on 24 November 1841, published in the &quot;Staffordshire Advertiser&quot;. He describes going into the &quot;black country&quot; of Staffordshire – Wolverhampton, Bilston and Tipton.

In published literature, the first reference dates from 1846 and occurs in the novel &quot;Colton Green: A Tale of the Black Country&quot; by the Reverend William Gresley, who was then a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral. Gresley&#x27;s opening paragraph starts &quot;On the border of the agricultural part of Staffordshire, just before you enter the dismal region of mines and forges, commonly called the &#x27;Black Country&#x27;, stands the pretty village of Oakthorpe&quot;, &quot;commonly&quot; implying that the term was already in use. He also writes that &quot;the whole country is blackened with smoke by day, and glowing with fires by night&quot;, and that &quot;the &#x27;Black Country&#x27; ... is about twenty miles in length and five in bredth reaching from north to south&quot;.

The phrase was used again, though as a description rather than a proper noun, by the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in an 1849 article on the opening of the South Staffordshire Railway. An 1851 guidebook to the London and North Western Railway included an entire chapter entitled &quot;The Black Country&quot;, including an early description:

This work was also the first to explicitly distinguish the area from nearby Birmingham, noting that &quot;On certain rare holidays these people wash their faces, clothe themselves in decent garments, and, since the opening of the South Staffordshire Railway, take advantage of cheap excursion trains, go down to Birmingham to amuse themselves and make purchases.&quot;

The geologist Joseph Jukes made it clear in 1858 that he felt the meaning of the term was self-explanatory to contemporary visitors, remarking that &quot;It is commonly known in the neighbourhood as the &#x27;Black Country&#x27;, an epithet the appropriateness of which must be acknowledged by anyone who even passes through it on a railway&quot;. Jukes based his Black Country on the seat of the great iron manufacture, which for him was geographically determined by the ironstone tract of the coalfield rather than the thick seam, running from Wolverhampton to Bloxwich, to West Bromwich, to Stourbridge and back to Wolverhampton again. A travelogue published in 1860 made the connection more explicit, calling the name &quot;eminently descriptive, for blackness everywhere prevails; the ground is black, the atmosphere is black, and the underground is honeycombed by mining galleries stretching in utter blackness for many a league&quot;. An alternative theory for the meaning of the name is proposed as having been caused by the darkening of the local soil due to the outcropping coal and the seam near the surface.

It was however the American diplomat and travel writer Elihu Burritt who brought the term &quot;the Black Country&quot; into widespread common usage with the third, longest and most important of the travel books he wrote about Britain for American readers, his 1868 work &quot;Walks in The Black Country and its Green Borderland&quot;. Burritt had been appointed United States consul in Birmingham by Abraham Lincoln in 1864, a role that required him to report regularly on &quot;facts bearing upon the productive capacities, industrial character and natural resources of communities embraced in their Consulate Districts&quot; and as a result travelled widely from his home in Harborne, largely on foot, to explore the local area. Burritt&#x27;s association with Birmingham dated back 20 years and he was highly sympathetic to the industrial and political culture of the town as well as being a friend to many of its leading citizens, so his portrait of the surrounding area was largely positive. He was the author of the famous early description of the Black Country as &quot;black by day and red by night&quot;, adding appreciatively that it &quot;cannot be matched, for vast and varied production, by any other space of equal radius on the surface of the globe&quot;. Burritt used the term to refer to a wider area than its common modern usage, however, devoting the first third of the book to Birmingham, which he described as &quot;the capital, manufacturing centre, and growth of the Black Country&quot;, and writing &quot;plant, in imagination, one foot of your compass at the Town Hall in Birmingham, and with the other sweep a circle of twenty miles [30 km] radius, and you will have, &#x27;the Black Country&quot; (this area includes Coventry, Kidderminster and Lichfield).

==History==
A few Black Country places such as Wolverhampton, Bilston and Wednesfield are mentioned in Anglo-Saxon charters and chronicles and the forerunners of a number of Black Country towns and villages such as Cradley, Dudley, Smethwick, and Halesowen are included in the Domesday Book of 1086. At this early date, the area was mostly rural. A monastery was founded in Wolverhampton in the Anglo-Saxon period and a castle and priory was built at Dudley during the period of Norman rule. Another religious house, Premonstratensian Abbey of Halesowen, was founded in the early 13th century. A number of Black Country villages developed into market towns and boroughs in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, notably Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Coal mining was carried out for several centuries in the Black Country, starting from medieval times, and metalworking was important in the Black Country area as early as the 16th century spurred on by the presence of iron ore and coal in a seam thick, the thickest seam in Great Britain, which outcropped in various places. The first recorded blast furnace in the Black Country was built at West Bromwich in the early 1560s. Many people had an agricultural smallholding and supplemented their income by working as nailers or smiths, an example of a phenomenon known to economic historians as proto-industrialisation. In 1583, the accounts of the building of Henry VIII&#x27;s Nonsuch Palace record that nails were supplied by Reynolde Warde of Dudley at a cost of 11s 4d per thousand. By the 1620s &quot;Within ten miles [16 km] of Dudley Castle there were 20,000 smiths of all sorts&quot;.

In the early 17th century, Dud Dudley, a natural son of the Baron of Dudley, experimented with making iron using coal rather than charcoal. Two patents were granted for the process: one in 1621 to Lord Dudley and one in 1638 to Dud Dudley and three others. In his work &quot;Metallum Martis&quot;, published in 1665, he claimed to have &quot;made Iron to profit with Pit-cole&quot;. However, considerable doubt has been cast on this claim by later writers.

An important development in the early 17th century was the introduction of the slitting mill to the Midlands area. In the Black Country, the establishment of this device was associated with Richard Foley, son of a Dudley nailer, who built a slitting mill near Kinver in 1628. The slitting mill made it much simpler to produce nail rods from iron bar.

Another development of the early 17th century was the introduction of glass making to the Stourbridge area. One attraction of the region for glass makers was the local deposits of fireclay, a material suitable for making the pots in which glass was melted.

In 1642 at the start of the Civil War, Charles I failed to capture the two arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, which although in cities loyal to Parliament were located in counties loyal to him. As he had failed to capture the arsenals, Charles did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, or shot; all these the Black Country could and did provide. From Stourbridge came shot, from Dudley cannon. Numerous small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of Worcestershire turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It was said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, Robert Porter, who manufactured swords in Digbeth, Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for &quot;that man of blood&quot; (a Puritan nickname for King Charles), or any of his adherents. As an offset to this sword-cutler and men like him in Birmingham, the Royalists had among their adherents Dud Dudley, now a Colonel in the Royalist army, who had experience in iron making, and who claimed he could turn out &quot;all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts&quot;, both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way.

In 1712, a Newcomen Engine was constructed near Dudley and used to pump water from coal mines belonging to Lord Dudley. This is the earliest documented working steam engine.
An important milestone in the establishment of Black Country industry came when John Wilkinson set up an iron works at Bradley near Bilston. In 1757 he started making iron there by coke-smelting rather than using charcoal. His example was followed by others and iron making spread rapidly across the Black Country. Another important development of the 18th century was the construction of canals to link the Black Country mines industries to the rest of the country. Between 1768 and 1772 a canal was constructed by James Brindley starting in Birmingham through the heart of the Black Country and eventually leading to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.
In the middle of the 18th century, Bilston became well known for the craft of enamelling. Items produced included decorative containers such as patch-boxes, snuff boxes and bonbonnieres.

The iron industry grew during the 19th century, peaking around 1850–1860. In 1863, there were 200 blast furnaces in the Black Country, of which 110 were in blast. Two years later it was recorded that there were 2,116 puddling furnaces, which converted pig-iron into wrought iron, in the Black Country. In 1864 the first Black Country plant capable of producing mild steel by the Bessemer process was constructed at the Old Park Works in Wednesbury. In 1882, another Bessemer-style steel works was constructed at Spring Vale in Bilston by the Staffordshire Steel and Ingot Iron Company, a development followed by the construction of an open-hearth steelworks at the Round Oak works of the Earl of Dudley in Brierley Hill, which produced its first steel in 1894.

By the 19th century or early 20th century, many villages had their characteristic manufacture, but earlier occupations were less concentrated. Some of these concentrations are less ancient than sometimes supposed. For example, chain making in Cradley Heath seems only to have begun in about the 1820s, and the Lye holloware industry is even more recent.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, coal and limestone were worked only on a modest scale for local consumption, but during the Industrial Revolution by the opening of canals, such as the Birmingham Canal Navigations, Stourbridge Canal and the Dudley Canal (the Dudley Canal Line No 1 and the Dudley Tunnel) opened up the mineral wealth of the area to exploitation. Advances in the use of coke for the production of iron enabled iron production (hitherto limited by the supply of charcoal) to expand rapidly.

By Victorian times, the Black Country was one of the most heavily industrialised areas in Britain, and it became known for its pollution, particularly from iron and coal industries and their many associated smaller businesses. Industrialisation led to the expansion of local railways and coal mine lines. The line running from Stourbridge to Walsall via Dudley Port and Wednesbury closed in the 1960s, but the Birmingham to Wolverhampton line via Tipton is still a major transport route.

The anchors and chains for the ill-fated liner RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; were made in the Black Country at Netherton. Three anchors and accompanying chains were manufactured; and the set weighed in at 100 tons. The centre anchor alone weighed 12 tons and was pulled through Netherton on its journey to the ship by 20 Shire horses.

In 1913, the Black Country was the location of arguably one of the most important strikes in British trade union history when the workers employed in the area&#x27;s steel tube trade came out for two months in a successful demand for a 23 shilling minimum weekly wage for unskilled workers, giving them pay parity with their counterparts in nearby Birmingham. This action commenced on 9 May in Wednesbury, at the Old Patent tube works of John Russell &amp; Co. Ltd., and within weeks upwards of 40,000 workers across the Black Country had joined the dispute. Notable figures in the labour movement, including a key proponent of Syndicalism, Tom Mann, visited the area to support the workers and Jack Beard and Julia Varley of the Workers&#x27; Union were active in organising the strike. During this confrontation with employers represented by the Midlands Employers&#x27; Federation, a body founded by Dudley Docker, the Asquith Government&#x27;s armaments programme was jeopardised, especially its procurement of naval equipment and other industrial essentials such as steel tubing, nuts and bolts, destroyer parts, etc. This was of national significance at a time when Britain and Germany were engaged in the Anglo-German naval arms race that preceded the outbreak of the First World War. Following a ballot of the union membership, a settlement of the dispute was reached on 11 July after arbitration by government officials from the Board of Trade led by the Chief Industrial Commissioner Sir George Askwith, 1st Baron Askwith. One of the important consequences of the strike was the growth of organised labour across the Black Country, which was notable because until this point the area&#x27;s workforce had effectively eschewed trade unionism.

The 20th century saw a decline in coal mining in the Black Country, with the last colliery in the region – Baggeridge Colliery near Sedgley – closing on 2 March 1968, marking the end of an era after some 300 years of mass coal mining in the region, though a small number of open cast mines remained in use for a few years afterwards. Other industries thrived, however. Manufacturers like Rubery Owen, Chance Bros, Wilkins and Mitchell, GKN, John Thompson (company) and many more prospered from the post-war boom in Britain, with the West Midlands motor industry being a key driver of the economy. Wages rose faster than the national average, and unemployment remained low into the late 1970s. It was only in the late 1970s and 1980s, as global shocks and political change affected British industry, that the region began to become deindustrialised, with the years 1979-1982 witnessing the closure of large employers such as Bilston Steel Works, Round Oak, Patent Shaft Steelworks, Rubery Owen, Birmid Industries and others in quick succession. The population of the Black Country changed from one of the most prosperous industrial working-class regions in the country, to one of the most deprived.

As the heavy industry that had named the region faded away, in the 1970s a museum, called the Black Country Living Museum started to take shape on derelict land near to Dudley. Today this museum demonstrates Black Country crafts and industry from days gone by and includes many original buildings which have been transported and reconstructed at the site.

==Geology and landscape==

The history of industry in the Black Country is connected directly to its underlying geology. Much of the region lies upon an exposed coalfield forming the southern part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield where mining has taken place since the Middle Ages. There are, in fact several coal seams, some of which were given names by the miners. The top, thin coal seam is known as &quot;Broach Coal&quot;. Beneath this lies successively the &quot;Thick Coal&quot;, &quot;Heathen Coal&quot;, &quot;Stinking Coal&quot;, &quot;Bottom Coal&quot; and &quot;Singing Coal&quot; seams. Other seams also exist. The Thick Coal seam was also known as the &quot;Thirty Foot&quot; or &quot;Ten Yard&quot; seam and is made up of a number of beds that have come together to form one thick seam. Interspersed with the coal seams are deposits of iron ore and fireclay. The Black Country coal field is bounded on the north by the Bentley Fault, to the north of which lies the Cannock Chase Coalfield. Around the exposed coalfield, separated by geological faults, lies a concealed coalfield where the coal lies at much greater depth. A mine was sunk between 1870 and 1874 over the eastern boundary of the then known coal field in Smethwick and coal was discovered at a depth of over 400 yards. In the last decade of the 19th century, coal was discovered beyond the western boundary fault at Baggeridge at a depth of around 600 yards.

A broken ridge runs across the Black Country in a north-westerly direction through Dudley, Wrens Nest and Sedgley, separating the Black Country into two regions. This ridge forms part of a major watershed of England with streams to the north taking water to the Tame and then via the Trent into the North Sea whilst to the south of the ridge, water flows into the Stour and thence to the Severn and the Bristol Channel.

At Dudley and Wrens Nest, limestone was mined. This rock formation was formed in the Silurian period and contains many fossils. One particular fossilized creature, the trilobite &quot;Calymene blumenbachii&quot;, was so common that it became known as the &quot;Dudley Bug&quot; or &quot;Dudley Locust&quot; and was incorporated into the coat-of-arms of the County Borough of Dudley.

At a number of places, notably the Rowley Hills and at Barrow Hill, a hard igneous rock is found. The rock, known as dolerite, used to be quarried and used for road construction.

==Symbols==
In recent years the Black Country has seen the adoption of symbols and emblems with which to represent itself. The first of these to be registered was the Black Country tartan in 2009, designed by Philip Tibbetts from Halesowen.

In 2008 the idea of a flag for the region was first raised. After four years of campaigning a competition was successfully organised with the Black Country Living Museum. This resulted in the adoption of the Flag of the Black Country as designed by Gracie Sheppard of Redhill School in Stourbridge and was registered with the Flag Institute in July 2012.

The flag was unveiled at the museum on 14 July 2012 as part of celebration in honour of the 300th anniversary of the erection of the first Newcomen atmospheric engine. Following this it was agreed by the museum and Black Country society for 14 July to be recognised as Black Country Day to celebrate the area&#x27;s role in the Industrial Revolution. The day was marked by Department for Communities and Local Government in 2013 and following calls to do more in 2014 more events were planned around the region.

Black Country Day takes place on 14 July each year. Originally in March, the day was later moved to 14 July—the anniversary of the invention of the Newcomen steam engine—and now coincides with a wider series of events throughout the month aimed at promoting Black Country Culture called the Black Country Festival.

The Black Country Anthem was written by James Stevens and is performed by Black Country band The Empty Can. The idea for the anthem was raised in 2013 by James Stevens and Steven Edwards who wanted the region to have an official anthem to accompany the Black Country flag &amp; Black Country Day.

==Economy==
The heavy industry which once dominated the Black Country has now largely gone. The 20th century saw a decline in coal mining and the industry finally came to an end in 1968 with the closure of Baggeridge Colliery near Sedgley. Clean air legislation has meant that the Black Country is no longer black. The area still maintains some manufacturing, but on a much smaller scale than historically. Chainmaking is still a viable industry in the Cradley Heath area where the majority of the chain for the Ministry of Defence and the Admiralty fleet is made in modern factories.

Much but not all of the area now suffers from high unemployment and parts of it are amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK. This is particularly true in parts of the metropolitan boroughs of Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. According to the Government&#x27;s 2007 Index of Deprivation (ID 2007), Sandwell is the third most deprived authority in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, and the 14th most deprived of the UK&#x27;s 354 districts. Wolverhampton is the fourth most deprived district in the West Midlands, and the 28th most deprived nationally. Walsall is the fifth most deprived district in the West Midlands region, and the 45th most deprived in the country.
Dudley fares better, but still has pockets of deprivation. Overall, Dudley is the 100th most deprived district of the UK, but the second most affluent of the seven metropolitan districts of the West Midlands, with Solihull coming top. It also benefits from tourism due to the popularity of the Black Country Living Museum, Dudley Zoo and Dudley Castle.

As with many urban areas in the UK, there is also a significant ethnic minority population in parts: in Sandwell, 22.6 per cent of the population is from ethnic minorities, and in Wolverhampton the figure is 23.5 per cent. However, in Walsall 84.6 per cent of the population is described as white, while in Dudley 92 per cent of the population is white. Resistance to mass immigration in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s led to the slogan &quot;Keep the Black Country white!&quot;.

The Black Country suffered its biggest economic blows in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when unemployment soared largely because of the closure of historic large factories including the Round Oak Steel Works at Brierley Hill and the Patent Shaft steel plant at Wednesbury. Unemployment rose drastically across the country during this period as a result of Conservative Prime Minister Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies; later, in an implicit acknowledgement of the social problems this had caused, these areas were designated as Enterprise Zones, and some redevelopment occurred. Round Oak and the surrounding farmland was developed as the Merry Hill Shopping Centre and Waterfront commercial and leisure complex, while the Patent Shaft site was developed as an industrial estate.

Unemployment in Brierley Hill peaked at more than 25% – around double the national average at the time – during the first half of the 1980s following the closure of Round Oak Steel Works, giving it one of the worst unemployment rates of any town in Britain. The Merry Hill development between 1985 and 1990 managed to reduce the local area&#x27;s unemployment dramatically, however.

The Black Country Living Museum in Dudley recreates life in the Black Country in the early 20th century, and is a popular tourist attraction. On 17 February 2012 the museum&#x27;s collection in its entirety was awarded Designation by Arts Council England (ACE). Designation is a mark of distinction that celebrates unique collections of national and international importance.

The four metropolitan boroughs of the Black Country form part of the Birmingham metropolitan economy, the second largest in the UK.

In 2011, the government announced the creation of the Black Country Enterprise Zone. The zone includes 5 sites in Wolverhampton and 14 in Darlaston. The i54 business park in Wolverhampton is the largest of the 19 sites; its tenants include Jaguar Land Rover. The largest site in Darlaston is that of the former IMI James Bridge Copper Works.

The four boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton and Walsall submitted a joint bid in late 2015 to become a UNESCO Global Geopark. The Geopark would increase the area&#x27;s prospects as a tourism destination thereby supporting the local economy. To this end numerous &#x27;geosites&#x27; were subsequently identified, leaflets published and public events organised. As of 2017, UNESCO had given the aspirant geopark its initial backing pending further assessment. Confirmation of the Black Country as a UNESCO Global Geopark was announced on 10 July 2020.

==Dialect and accent==


The traditional Black Country dialect, known as &quot;Black Country Spake&quot; (as in &quot;Where&#x27;s our Spake Gone&quot;, a 2014–2016 lottery-funded project to preserve and document the dialect) preserves many archaic traits of Early Modern English and even Middle English and can be very confusing for outsiders. &quot;Thee&quot;, &quot;thy&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; are still in use, as is the case in parts of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire.

&quot;&#x27;Ow bist,&quot; or &quot;Ow bist gooin&quot; (How are you/ How are you going), to which typical responses would be &quot;bostin&#x27;, ah kid&quot; (bostin&#x27; means &quot;busting&quot;, as in breaking, and is similar in usage to &quot;smashing&quot;; and &quot;ah kid&quot; (our kid) is a term of endearment) or &quot;&#x27;bay too bad,&quot; or even &quot;bay three bad&quot; (&quot;I be not too bad&quot;/ I&#x27;m not too bad).

Ain&#x27;t is in common use as when &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen her&quot; becomes &quot;I ain&#x27;t sid &#x27;er&quot;. However, this is often shortened even further to &quot;ay&quot;.

Black Country dialect often uses &quot;ar&quot; where other parts of England use &quot;yes&quot; (this is common as far away as Yorkshire). Similarly, the local version of &quot;you&quot; is pronounced .

The local pronunciation includes &quot;goo&quot; (elsewhere &quot;go&quot;) or &quot;gewin&#x27;&quot; is similar to that elsewhere in the Midlands. It is quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say &quot;&#x27;agooin&#x27;&quot; where others say &quot;going.&quot; A woman is a &quot;wench&quot;, a man is a &quot;mon&quot;, a nurse is a &quot;nuss&quot; and home is &quot;wum&quot;. An apple is an &quot;opple&quot;.

Other examples are &quot;code&quot; for the word cold, and &quot;goost&quot; for the word ghost. A sofa becomes a &quot;sofie&quot;, and a fag (cigarette), a &quot;fake&quot;. Seen becomes &quot;sid&quot;.
Put together, &quot;Ah just sid a goost, so Ah&#x27;m a gooin to sit on mah sofie and &#x27;ave a fake&quot; (I have just seen a ghost, so I am going to sit upon my sofa and have a cigarette)

Food may be called &quot;fittle&quot; (after victuals or &quot;vittles&quot;), so &quot;bostin fittle&quot; is &quot;good food&quot;.

One participant in the &quot;Where&#x27;s our Spake Gone&quot; project related the following: &quot;Day say yom call oos rabbits up ere. I say we day, dey say yow say &quot;Tah rah rabbits&quot;. We&#x27;m say tah-ra a bit, &#x27;n to dem, it sound like we&#x27;m calling dem rabbits.&quot; (&quot;They say you call us rabbits there, I said we don&#x27;t, (but) they say you say &quot;tah rah rabbits&quot;. We say &quot;tah rah a bit&quot; (tah rah for a little while) and to them, it sounds like we are calling them rabbits.&quot;)
==Depiction in art or literature==
From the 19th century onwards, the area gained widespread notoriety for its hellish appearance, a depiction that made its way into the published works of the time. Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, written in 1841, described how the area&#x27;s local factory chimneys &quot;&quot;Poured out their plague of smoke, obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air&quot;.&quot; In 1862, Elihu Burritt, the American Consul in Birmingham, described the region as &quot;black by day and red by night&quot;, because of the smoke and grime generated by the intense manufacturing activity and the glow from furnaces at night. Early 20th century representations of the region can be found in the Mercian novels of Francis Brett Young, most notably &quot;My Brother Jonathan&quot; (1928).

Carol Thompson the curator &quot;The Making of Mordor&quot; at Wolverhampton Art Gallery in the last quarter of 2014 stated that J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s description of the grim region of Mordor &quot;resonates strongly with contemporary accounts of the Black Country&quot;, in his famed novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Indeed, in the Elvish Sindarin language, &quot;Mor-Dor&quot; means &quot;Dark&quot; (or &quot;Black&quot;) &quot;Land&quot;.

==Brewing==

The Black Country is notable for its small breweries and brewpubs which continued brewing their own beer alongside the larger breweries which opened in the Industrial Revolution. Small breweries and brewpubs in the Black Country include Bathams in Brierley Hill, Holdens in Woodsetton, Sarah Hughes in Sedgley, Black Country Ales in Lower Gornal and the Old Swan Inn (Ma Pardoe&#x27;s) in Netherton. They produce light and dark mild ales, as well as malt-accented bitters and seasonal strong ales.

==Media==
The Black Country is served by the regional television services - BBC West Midlands, ITV Central and Made in Birmingham. Three region wide radio stations that broadcast to the area are BBC Radio WM, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire. Both Free Radio (formerly BRMB (Birmingham and Beacon Radio Wolverhampton) and Greatest Hits Radio Black Country and Shropshire (formerly Beacon 303, Radio WABC, Classic Gold Digital, Gold and Free Radio 80s) have broadcast since 1976 from transmitters at Turner&#x27;s Hill and Sedgley, with the studios which were previously located in Wolverhampton being moved to Oldbury and Birmingham respectively.

The area also has three other radio stations which only officially cover part of the region. Black Country Radio (born from a merger of 102.5 The Bridge and BCCR) who are based in Brierley Hill, and Ambur Radio who broadcast from Walsall.

The &quot;Express and Star&quot; is one of the region&#x27;s two daily newspapers, publishing eleven local editions from its Wolverhampton headquarters and its five district offices (for example the Dudley edition is considerably different in content from the Wolverhampton or Stafford editions). It is the biggest selling regional paper in the UK. Incidentally, the &quot;Express and Star&quot;, traditionally a Black Country paper, has expanded to the point where they sell copies from vendors in Birmingham city centre.

&quot;The Black Country Mail&quot; – a local edition of the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; – is the region&#x27;s other daily newspaper. Its regional base is in Walsall town centre.

Established in 1973, from a site in High Street, Cradley Heath, the &quot;Black Country Bugle&quot; has also contributed to the region&#x27;s history. It started as a fortnightly publication, but due to its widespread appeal, now appears on a weekly basis. It is now located above the Dudley Archives and Local History Centre on Tipton Road, Dudley.

<text>The Tupi people, a subdivision of the Tupi-Guarani linguistic families, were one of the largest groups of indigenous peoples in Brazil before its colonization. Scholars believe that while they first settled in the Amazon rainforest, from about 2,900 years ago the Tupi started to migrate southward and gradually occupied the Atlantic coast of Southeast Brazil.

Many Tupi people today are merged with the Guaraní people, forming the Tupi–Guarani languages. Guarani languages are linguistically different from the Tupian languages.

==History==

The Tupi people inhabited 3/4 of all of Brazil&#x27;s coast when the Portuguese first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated at 1 million people, nearly equal to the population of Portugal at the time. They were divided into tribes, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some examples of these tribes are: &quot;Tupiniquim&quot;, &quot;Tupinambá&quot;, &quot;Potiguara&quot;, &quot;Tabajara&quot;, &quot;Caetés&quot;, &quot;Temiminó&quot;, &quot;Tamoios&quot;. The Tupi were adept agriculturalists; they grew cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, tobacco, squash, cotton and many others. There was not a unified Tupi identity despite the fact that they spoke a common language.

===European colonization===
Upon discovering the existence of the Tupi people, it was assumed by Portuguese settlers that they lacked any sort of religion, a belief that began the process of assimilating the Tupi to Christianity. The settlers began erecting villages for the Tupi, known as aldeias, with the intention of more disciplined religious conversion and institutionalization of European customs. Aside from being assimilated, the Tupi were found to be of use to the Portuguese, who required laborers for cultivating and shipping their exports. This use in harvesting resources led to their eventual enslavement and in turn, the spread of fatal European diseases on the plantations they worked at. This combination of factors nearly led to their complete annihilation, with the exception of a few isolated communities. The remnants of these tribes are today confined to indigenous territories or acculturated to some degree into the dominant society.

===Religion===
As Eduardo Navarro explains in his &quot;Dicionário de Tupi Antigo&quot; (2013), the different Tupi peoples believed they descended from a mythological character called Tupi. Because of this, many Tupi tribes had ethnonyms that began with &quot;tupi&quot;, such as the Tupinambá, the Tupiniquim, the Tupiguaé and the Tupiminó. However, the main cult among the Tupi who inhabited the coast of Brazil in the 16th century was not that of Tupi, but that of . Tupã, the thunder, was not actually a god, but rather a manifestation of the god . Precisely because Tupã did not have his own rite, the Catholic priests who sought to spread Christianity among the Indians chose Tupã as a symbol for the Christian god, in order to facilitate the understanding of Christianity by the Indians, grafting Christian principles onto the figure of Tupã. At the same time, they associated Jurupari with the Christian devil, in order to discourage his worship among the Tupi Indians.

===Cannibalism===
According to primary source accounts by primarily European writers, the Tupi were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars the Tupi would normally try to capture their enemies to kill later in cannibalistic rituals.
The warriors captured from other Tupi tribes were eaten as it was believed by them that this would lead to their strength being absorbed and digested; thus, in fear of absorbing weakness, they chose only to sacrifice warriors perceived to be strong and brave. For the Tupi warriors, even when prisoners, it was a great honor to die valiantly during battle or to display courage during the festivities leading to the sacrifice. The Tupi have also been documented to eat the remains of dead relatives as a form of honoring them.

The practice of cannibalism among the Tupi was made famous in Europe by Hans Staden, a German soldier, mariner, and mercenary, traveling to Brazil to seek a fortune, who was captured by the Tupi in 1552. In his account published in 1557, he tells that the Tupi carried him to their village where it was claimed he was to be devoured at the next festivity. There, he allegedly won the friendship of a powerful chief, whom he cured of a disease, and his life was spared.

Cannibalistic rituals among Tupi and other tribes in Brazil decreased steadily after European contact and religious intervention. When Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Santa Catarina in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalistic practices in the name of the King of Spain.

Because our understanding of Tupi cannibalism relies mostly on primary source accounts of primarily European writers, the very existence of cannibalism has been disputed by some in academic circles. William Arens seeks to discredit Staden&#x27;s and other writers&#x27; accounts of cannibalism in his book &quot;The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology &amp; Anthropophagy&quot;, where he claims that when concerning the Tupinambá, &quot;rather than dealing with an instance of serial documentation of cannibalism, we are more likely confronting only one source of dubious testimony which has been incorporated almost verbatim into the written reports of others claiming to be eyewitnesses&quot;.

Most Brazilian scholars, however, attest to the cultural centrality of cannibalism in Tupian culture. Anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro who had deeply studied the historical accounts about the Tupi, reported that the Ka&#x27;apor people of the Tupi-Guaraní linguistic and cultural family confirmed that their ancestors had practiced anthropophagical rituals similar to the ones described in the 16th century. Other Brazilian scholars have criticized Arens for what they perceived as historical negationism, and for ignoring important sources (Jesuit letters) and historical and anthropological studies (Viveiros de Castro, Florestan Fernandes, Estevão Pinto, Hélène Clastres), many of them dealing directly with indigenous peoples, that point to the direction of anthropophagy being well established as a social and cultural practice. He was particularly criticized for trying to discredit the association of the Tupi with savagery, not by realizing that the Europeans failed to comprehend the meaning of traditional practices such as cannibalism, but by promptly negating their existence altogether.

===Race-mixing and &quot;Cunhadismo&quot;===

Many indigenous peoples were important for the formation of the Brazilian people, but the main group was the Tupi. When the Portuguese explorers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, the Tupi were the first indigenous group to have contact with them. Soon, a process of mixing between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Portuguese colonists rarely brought women, making the native women the &quot;breeding matrix of the Brazilian people&quot;. When the first Europeans arrived, the phenomenon of &quot;cunhadismo&quot; (from Portuguese &quot;cunhado&quot;, &quot;brother in law&quot;) began to spread by the colony. &quot;Cunhadismo&quot; was an old native tradition of incorporating strangers to their community. The Natives offered the Portuguese an Indigenous girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Natives of the tribe. Polygyny, a common practice among South American Indigenous people, was quickly adopted by European settlers. This way, a single European man could have dozens of indigenous wives (&quot;temericós&quot;).

&quot;Cunhadismo&quot; was used as recruitment of labour. The Portuguese could have many &quot;temericós&quot; and thus a huge number of Indigenous relatives who were induced to work for him, especially to cut pau-brasil and take it to the ships on the coast. In the process, a large mixed-race (mameluco) population was formed, which in fact occupied Brazil. Without the practice of &quot;cunhadismo&quot;, the Portuguese colonization was impractical. The number of Portuguese men in Brazil was very small and Portuguese women were even fewer in number. The proliferation of mixed-race people in the wombs of indigenous women provided for the occupation of the territory and the consolidation of the Portuguese presence in the region.

===Influence in Brazil===
Although the Tupi population largely disappeared because of European diseases to which they had no resistance or because of slavery, a large population of maternal Tupi ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory, taking the ancient traditions to several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that the features of the first Brazilians were much more Tupi than Portuguese, and even the language that they spoke was a Tupi-based language, named Nheengatu or Língua Geral, a lingua franca in Brazil until the 18th century. The region of São Paulo was the biggest in the proliferation of Mamelucos, who in the 17th century under the name of Bandeirantes, spread throughout the Brazilian territory, from the Amazon rainforest to the extreme South. They were responsible for the major expansion of the Iberian culture in the interior of Brazil. They acculturated the indigenous tribes who lived in isolation, and took the language of the colonizer, which was not Portuguese yet, but Nheengatu itself, to the most inhospitable corners of the colony. Nheengatu is still spoken in certain regions of the Amazon, although the Tupi-speaking Natives did not live there. The Nheengatu language, as in other regions of the country, was introduced there by Bandeirantes from São Paulo in the 17th century. The way of life of the &quot;Old&quot; &quot;Paulistas&quot; could almost be confused with the Natives. Within the family, only Nheengatu was spoken. Agriculture, hunting, fishing and gathering of fruits were also based on indigenous traditions. What differentiated the &quot;Old Paulistas&quot; from the Tupi was the use of clothes, salt, metal tools, weapons and other European items.

When these areas of large Tupi influence started to be integrated into the market economy, Brazilian society gradually started to lose its Tupi characteristics. The Portuguese language became dominant and Língua Geral virtually disappeared. The rustic indigenous techniques of production were replaced by European ones, in order to elevate the capacity of exportation. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi. Some examples of Portuguese words that came from Tupi are: &quot;mingau, mirim, soco, cutucar, tiquinho, perereca, tatu&quot;. The names of several local fauna – such as &quot;arara&quot; (&quot;macaw&quot;), &quot;jacaré&quot; (&quot;South American alligator&quot;), &quot;tucano&quot; (&quot;toucan&quot;) – and flora – e.g. &quot;mandioca&quot; (&quot;manioc&quot;) and &quot;abacaxi&quot; (&quot;pineapple&quot;) – are also derived from the Tupi language. A number of places and cities in modern Brazil are named in Tupi (&quot;Itaquaquecetuba,&quot; &quot;Pindamonhangaba,&quot; &quot;Caruaru&quot;, &quot;Ipanema&quot;). Anthroponyms include &quot;Ubirajara&quot;, &quot;Ubiratã&quot;, &quot;Moema&quot;, &quot;Jussara&quot;, &quot;Jurema&quot;, &quot;Janaína&quot;. Tupi surnames do exist, but they do not imply any real Tupi ancestry; rather they were adopted as a manner to display Brazilian nationalism.

The &quot;Tupinambá&quot; tribe is fictitiously portrayed in Nelson Pereira dos Santos&#x27; satirical 1971 film &quot;How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman&quot; (&quot;Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês&quot;). Its name is also adapted by science: &quot;Tupinambis&quot; is a genus of tegus, arguably the best-known lizards of Brazil.

The large offshore Tupi oil field discovered off the coast of Brazil in 2006 was named in honor of the Tupi people.

The Guaraní are a different native group that inhabits southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and northern Argentina and speaks the distinct Guaraní languages, but these are in the same language family as Tupi.

==Legacy==

The Tupi people had a great cultural influence on the countries they inhabited. Innumerable people, streets, neighborhoods, cities, rivers, animals, fruits, plants, football clubs, companies in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay are named in Guarani.

<text>John Amos Comenius (; ; ; ; Latinized: &quot;Ioannes Amos Comenius&quot;; 28 March 1592 – 15 November 1670) was a Czech philosopher, pedagogue and theologian who is considered the father of modern education. He served as the last bishop of the Unity of the Brethren (direct predecessor of the Moravian Church) before becoming a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book &quot;Didactica Magna&quot;. As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century.

Comenius introduced a number of educational concepts and innovations including pictorial textbooks written in native languages instead of Latin, teaching based in gradual development from simple to more comprehensive concepts, lifelong learning with a focus on logical thinking over dull memorization, equal opportunity for impoverished children, education for women, and universal and practical instruction. He also believed heavily in the connection between nature, religion, and knowledge, in which he stated that knowledge is born from nature and nature from God. 

Being lifelong proud of his origin from Moravia, he nevertheless for most of his life – mainly due to the difficult wartime circumstances in the homeland and fear from religious persecution – lived and worked as an exile in various regions of the Holy Roman Empire and other countries: Sweden, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Transylvania, England, the Netherlands and Hungary. He turned down an offer to immigrate to the New England Colonies and take up the presidency of the newly founded Harvard University.

==Life and work==

John Amos Comenius was born in 1592 in the Margraviate of Moravia in the Bohemian Crown. His exact birthplace is uncertain and possibilities include Uherský Brod (as on his gravestone in Naarden), Nivnice, and Komňa (the village from which he took his surname, which means &quot;man from Komňa&quot;), all these localities being situated in the Uherské Hradiště District of today&#x27;s Czech Republic. John was the youngest child and only son of Martin Komenský (died ca. 1602–4) and his wife Anna Chmelová. His grandfather, whose name was Jan (János) Szeges, was of Hungarian origin. He began to use the surname Komenský after leaving Komňa to live in Uherský Brod. Martin and Anna Komenský belonged to the Bohemian Brethren, a pre-Reformation Protestant denomination, and Comenius later became one of its leaders. His parents and two of his four sisters died in 1604 and John, still a child, went to live with his aunt in Strážnice.

Owing to his impoverished circumstances he was unable to begin his formal education until his later teens. He was 16 when he entered the Latin school in Přerov, returning there later as a teacher 1614–1618. He continued his studies at the Herborn Academy (1611–1613) and at the University of Heidelberg (1613–1614). In 1612 he read the Rosicrucian manifesto &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot;. Comenius was also greatly influenced by the Irish Jesuit William Bathe as well as by his teachers Johann Piscator, Heinrich Gutberleth, and particularly Heinrich Alsted. The Herborn Academy maintained the principle that every theory has to be functional in practical use, therefore it has to be didactic (i.e. morally instructive). In the course of his studies, Comenius also became acquainted with the educational reforms of Ratichius and with the report of these reforms issued by the universities of Jena and Giessen.

Comenius became rector of a school in Přerov. In 1616 he was ordained into the ministry of the Bohemian Brethren and four years later became pastor and rector at Fulnek, one of the denomination&#x27;s most flourishing churches. Throughout his life this pastoral activity was his most immediate concern. In consequence of the religious wars, in 1621 he lost all his property, including his writings. In 1627 he led the Brethren into exile when the Habsburg Counter-Reformation persecuted the Protestants in Bohemia. In 1628 he corresponded with Johann Valentin Andreae.

He produced the book &quot;Janua linguarum reserata&quot;, or &quot;The Gate of Languages Unlocked&quot;, which brought him to prominence. However, as the Unity became an important target of the Counter Reformation politics, he was forced into exile even as his fame grew across Europe. Comenius took refuge in Leszno (Lissa) in Poland, where he was head of the gymnasium school and was furthermores given charge of the Bohemian and Moravian churches.

In 1638 Comenius responded to a request by the government of Sweden and traveled there to draw up a scheme for the management of that country&#x27;s schools.

After his religious duties, Comenius&#x27;s second great interest was in furthering the Baconian attempt at the organization of all human knowledge. He became one of the leaders in the encyclopaedia or pansophic movement of the seventeenth century, and, in fact, was inclined to sacrifice his more practical educational interests and opportunities for these more imposing but somewhat visionary projects. In 1639, Comenius published his &quot;Pansophiae Prodromus&quot;, and in the following year his English friend Samuel Hartlib published, without his consent, the plan of the pansophic work as outlined by Comenius. These pansophic ideas find partial expression in the textbooks he produced from time to time. In these, he attempts to organize the entire field of human knowledge so as to bring it, in outline, within the grasp of every child. Comenius also attempted to design a language in which false statements could not be expressed.
In 1641, Comenius responded to a request from the English Long Parliament and joined a commission there established to reform the system of public education. The English Civil War interfered with the latter project. According to Cotton Mather, Comenius was asked by Winthrop to be the President of Harvard University. The Winthrop in question was more plausibly John Winthrop the Younger than his father, since Winthrop junior was in England. However, instead Comenius moved in 1642 to Sweden. to work with Queen Christina (reigned 1632–1654) and the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (in office 1612–1654) at the task of reorganizing the Swedish schools. The same year he then moved to Elbląg (Elbing) in Poland and in 1648 to England, this time with the assistance of Samuel Hartlib, who came originally from Elbląg. In 1650 Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, widow of George I Rákóczi Prince of Transylvania invited Comenius to Sárospatak. There he remained as a professor at the first Hungarian Protestant College until 1654, writing some of his most important works in this period.

Comenius subsequently returned to Leszno. During the Deluge in 1655, he declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side, prompting Polish Catholic partisans in 1656 to burn his house, his manuscripts, and the school&#x27;s printing press. The manuscript of &quot;Pansophia&quot; was destroyed in the fire. From Leszno he fled to take refuge in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He lived in the Huis met de Hoofden and taught his grandson Johann Theodor Jablonski as well as the young patricians Pieter de Graeff and Nicolaas Witsen.

In 1659, Comenius produced a new edition of the 1618 Bohemian Brethren hymnal, &quot;Kancionál, to jest kniha žalmů a písní duchovních&quot; containing 606 texts and 406 melodies. In addition to addressing the psalms and hymns, his revision greatly expanded the number of hymns and added a new introduction. This edition was reissued several times into the nineteenth century. His texts in Czech were notable poetic compositions, but he used tunes from other sources. He also edited the German hymnal &quot;Kirchen-, Haus- und Hertzens-Musica&quot; (Amsterdam, 1661), which had been published under the title &quot;Kirchengesänge&quot; since 1566. In other writings, Comenius addresses both instrumental and vocal music in many places, although he dedicated no treatise to the topic. Sometimes he follows the medieval mathematical conception of music, but in other places he links music with grammar, rhetoric, and politics. Musical practice, both instrumental and vocal, played an important role in his system of education.

It was in Amsterdam that Comenius would die, in 1670. For unknown reasons he was buried in Naarden, where visitors can see his grave in the mausoleum, located in the Kloosterstraat, devoted to him. Next to the mausoleum is the Comenius Museum.

==Educational influence==

For the greater part of the eighteenth century and early part of the nineteenth, there was little recognition of his relationship to the advance in educational thought and practice. However, the importance of the Comenian influence in education has been recognized since the middle of the nineteenth century. The practical educational influence of Comenius was threefold. 

He was first a teacher and an organizer of schools, not only among his own people, but later in Sweden, and to a slight extent in Holland. In his &quot;Didactica Magna&quot; (Great Didactic), he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of the existing American system of kindergarten, elementary school, secondary school, college, and university.

The second influence was in formulating the general theory of education. In this respect, he is the forerunner of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Fröbel, etc., and is the first to formulate the idea of &quot;education according to nature,&quot; which became consequential during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. The influence of Comenius on education is comparable with that of his contemporaries, Bacon and Descartes, on science and philosophy. In fact, he was largely influenced by the works of these two men. This comparison is largely due to the fact that he first applied or attempted to apply in a systematic manner the principles of thought and investigation, newly formulated by those philosophers, to the organization of education in all its aspects. The summary of this attempt is given in the &quot;Didactica Magna&quot;, completed about 1631, though not published until several years later.

The third aspect of influence was on the subject matter and method of education, exerted through a series of textbooks of an entirely new nature. The first-published of these was the &quot;Janua Linguarum Reserata&quot; (The Gate of Tongues Unlocked), issued in 1631. This was followed by a more elementary text, the &quot;Vestibulum&quot;, a more advanced one, the &quot;Atrium&quot;, and others. The &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot;, published in 1658, became one of the most renowned and widely circulated school books over the next century. It was also the first successful application of illustrations to the work of teaching youth (though not the first illustrated book for children, per se).
The educational writings of Comenius comprise more than forty titles. These texts were all based on the same fundamental ideas: (1) learning foreign languages through the vernacular; (2) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words; (3) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects; (4) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment, physical and social, as well as instruction in religious, moral, and classical subjects; (5) making this acquisition of a compendium of knowledge a pleasure rather than a task; and (6) making instruction universal &quot;to all men and from all points of view&quot;.

==Theology==

John Amos Comenius was a bishop of the Unity of the Brethren church that had its roots in the teaching of Czech reformer Jan Hus. One of his most famous theological works is the &quot;Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart&quot;. The book represents his thinking about the world being full of various useless things and complex labyrinths, and that the true peace of mind and soul can be found only in one&#x27;s heart where Christ the Saviour should dwell and rule. This teaching is also repeated in one of his last works, &quot;Unum Necessarium&quot; (Only One is Needed), where he shows various labyrinths and problems in the world and provides simple solutions to various situations. In this book he also admits that his former believing in prophecies and revelations of those days was his personal labyrinth where he got lost many times. He was greatly influenced by Boehme.

In his &quot;Synopsis physicae ad lumen divinum reformatae&quot;, Comenius gives a physical theory of his own, said to be taken from the Book of Genesis. He was also famous for his prophecies and the support he gave to visionaries. In his &quot;Lux in tenebris&quot; he published the visions of Christopher Kotterus, Mikuláš Drabík (lat. &quot;Nicolaus Drabicius&quot;) and Kristina Poniatowska. Attempting to interpret the Book of Revelation, he promised the millennium in 1672 and guaranteed miraculous assistance to those who would undertake the destruction of the Pope and the house of Austria, even venturing to prophesy that Oliver Cromwell, Gustavus Adolphus, and George I Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, would perform the task. He also wrote to Louis XIV of France, informing him that the empire of the world should be his reward if he would overthrow the enemies of God.

==Family==
One of his daughters, Elisabeth, married Peter Figulus from Jablonné nad Orlicí. Their son, Daniel Ernst Jablonski (1660–1741), Comenius&#x27;s grandson, later went to Berlin in 1693; there he became the highest official pastor at the court of King Frederick I of Prussia (reigned 1701–1713). There he became acquainted with Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700–1760). Zinzendorf was among the foremost successors to Comenius as a bishop (1737–1760) in the renewed Moravian Brethren&#x27;s Church.

==Legacy==
The Comenius Medal, a UNESCO award honouring outstanding achievements in the fields of education research and innovation, commemorates Comenius. Peter Drucker hailed Comenius as the inventor of textbooks and primers.

===Czech Republic===

During the 19th-century Czech National Revival, Czechs idealised Comenius as a symbol of the Czech nation. This image persists to the present day.

The Czech Republic celebrates 28 March, the birthday of Comenius, as Teachers&#x27; Day. The University of Jan Amos Komenský was founded in Prague in 2001, offering bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and graduate degree programmes. Gate to Languages, a project of lifelong education, taking place in the Czech Republic from October 2005 to June 2007 and aimed at language education of teachers, was named after his book &quot;Janua linguarum reserata&quot; (Gate to Languages Unlocked). Comenius is pictured on the 200 Czech koruna banknote.

Asteroid 1861 Komenský, discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, is named in his honor.

===Elsewhere in Europe===
In Leszno, Poland, a local college is named after him. There is also square of his name nearby post Unity&#x27;s of the Brethren church.
In Poland, the Comenius Foundation is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the provision of equal opportunities to children under 10 years of age.
In Sárospatak, Hungary, a teacher&#x27;s college is named after him, which belongs to the University of Miskolc. Comenius&#x27; name has been given to primary schools in several German cities, including Bonn, Grafing, and Deggendorf. In Skopje, North Macedonia the Czechoslovak government built a school after a catastrophic 1963 earthquake and named it after Comenius (Jan Amos Komenski in Macedonian). In 1919 Comenius University was founded by an act of parliament in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, now in Slovakia. It was the first university with courses in Slovak. 

The Comenius tower in Luxembourg was completed in 2008 as an addition to the headquarters of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The building houses many of the institution&#x27;s translation services.

The Italian film director Roberto Rossellini took Comenius, and especially his theory of &quot;direct vision&quot;, as his model in the development of his didactic theories, which Rossellini hoped would usher the world into a utopian future.

Comenius is a European Union school partnership program. In the United Kingdom, the University of Sheffield&#x27;s Western Bank Library holds the largest collection of Comenius manuscripts outside of the Czech Republic.

He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Church in Germany on 16 November.

===United States===
In 1892, educators in many places celebrated the 300th anniversary of Comenius. Comenius Hall was built as the principal classroom and faculty office building on Moravian College&#x27;s campus in Pennsylvania, and the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed. The education department at Salem College in North Carolina has an annual &quot;Comenius Symposium&quot; dedicated in his honor; the subjects usually deal with modern issues in education. The Comenius Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity which uses film and documentary production to further faith, learning, and love.

<text>A public utility company (usually just utility) is an organization that maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to statewide government monopolies.

Public utilities are meant to supply goods and services that are considered essential; water, gas, electricity, telephone, waste disposal, and other communication systems represent much of the public utility market. The transmission lines used in the transportation of electricity, or natural gas pipelines, have natural monopoly characteristics. A monopoly can occur when it finds the best way to minimize its costs through economies of scale to the point where other companies cannot compete with it. For example, if many companies are already offering electricity, the additional installation of a power plant will only disadvantage the consumer as prices could be increased. If the infrastructure already exists in a given area, minimal benefit is gained through competing. In other words, these industries are characterized by &quot;economies of scale&quot; in production. Though it can be mentioned that these natural monopolies are handled or watched by a public utilities commission, or an institution that represents the government.

There are many different types of public utilities. Some, especially large companies, offer multiple products, such as electricity and natural gas. Other companies specialize in one specific product, such as water. Modern public utilities may also be partially (or completely) sourced from clean and renewable energy in order to produce sustainable electricity. Of these, wind turbines and solar panels are those used most frequently.

Whether broadband internet access should be a public utility is a question that was being discussed with the rise of internet usage. This is a question that was being asked due to the telephone service being considered a public utility. Since arguably broadband internet access has taken over telephone service, perhaps it should be a public utility. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States in 2015 made their stance on this issue clear. Due to the telephone service having been considered a public utility, the FCC made broadband internet access a public utility in the United States.

==Management==
Public utilities have historically been considered to be a natural monopoly. This school of thought holds that the most cost-efficient way of doing business is through a single firm because these are capital-intensive businesses with unusually large economies of scale and high fixed costs associated with building and operating the infrastructure, e.g. power plants, telephone lines and water treatment facilities. However, over the past several decades, traditional public utilities&#x27; monopoly position has eroded. For instance, wholesale electricity generation markets, electric transmission networks, electricity retailing and customer choice, telecommunications, some types of public transit and postal services have become competitive in some countries and the trend towards liberalization, deregulation and privatization of public utilities is growing. However, the infrastructure used to distribute most utility products and services has remained largely monopolistic.

Key players in the public utility sector include:
* Generators produce or collect the specific product to be used by customers: for example, electricity or water.
* Network operators (grid operators, regional network operators, and distribution network operators) sell access to their networks to retail service providers, who deliver the product to the end user.
* Traders and marketers buy and sell the actual product and create further complex structured products, combined services and derivatives products. Depending on the product structure, these companies may provide utilities and businesses with a reliable supply of a product like electricity at a stable, predictable price, or a shorter term supply at a more volatile price.
* Service providers and retailers are the last segment in the supply chain, selling directly to the final consumer. In some markets, final consumers can choose their own retail service provider.

Public utilities must pursue the following objective given the social responsibility their services attribute to them:
* Ensuring services are of the highest quality and responsive to the needs and wishes of patients;
* Ensuring that health services are effectively targeted so as to improve the health of local populations;
* Improving the efficiency of the services so the volume of well-targeted effective services is the widest, given the available resources.

The management of public utilities continues to be important for local and general governments. By creating, expanding, and improving upon public utilities, a governmental body may attempt to improve its image or attract investment. Traditionally, public services have been provided by public legal entities, which operate much like corporations, but differ in that profit is not necessary for a functional business. A significant factor in government ownership has been to reduce the risk that an activity, if left to private initiative, may be considered not sufficiently profitable and neglected. Many utilities are essential for human life, national defense, or commerce, and the risk of public harm with mismanagement is considerably greater than with other goods. The principle of universality of utilities maintains that these services are best owned by, and operating for, the public. The government and the society itself would like to see these services being economically accessible to all or most of the population. Furthermore, other economic reasons based the idea: public services need huge investments in infrastructures, crucial for competitiveness but with a slow return of capital; last, technical difficulties can occur in the management of plurality of networks, example in the city subsoil.

Public pressure for renewable energy as a replacement for legacy fossil fuel power has steadily increased since the 1980s. As the technology needed to source the necessary amount of energy from renewable sources is still under study, public energy policy has been focused on short term alternatives such as natural gas (which still produces substantial carbon dioxide) or nuclear power. In 2021 a power and utilities industry outlook report by Deloitte identified a number of trends for the utilities industry:
* Enhanced competition, sparked by regulations such as FERC&#x27;s Order 2222 that open up the market to smaller, innovative firms using renewable energy sources, like wind or solar power
* Expansions in infrastructure, to manage new renewable energy sources
* Greater electrification of transportation, and longer-range batteries for cars and trucks
* Oil companies and other traditional-energy players entering the renewable-energy field
* A greater emphasis on disaster readiness

== Finance ==
Issues faced by public utilities include:
* Service area: regulators need to balance the economic needs of the companies and the social equity needed to guarantee to everyone the access to primary services.
* Autonomy: Economic efficiency requires that markets be left to work by themselves with little intervention. Such instances are often not equitable for some consumers that might be priced out of the market.
* Pricing: Equity requires that all citizens get the service at a fair price.

Alternative pricing methods include:
* Average production costs: the utility calculates the break-even point and then set the prices equal to average costs. The equity issue is basically overcome since most of the market is being served. As a defect regulated firms do not have incentives to minimize costs.
* Rate of return regulation: regulators let the firms set and charge any price, as long as the rate of return on invested capital does not exceed a certain rate. This method is flexible and allows for pricing freedom, forcing regulators to monitor prices. The drawback is that this method could lead to overcapitalization. For example, if the rate of return is set at five percent, then the firm can charge a higher price simply by investing more in capital than what it is actually needed (i.e., 5% of $10 million is greater than 5% of $6 million).
* Price cap regulation: regulators directly set a limit on the maximum price. This method can result in a loss of service area. One benefit of this method is that it gives firms an incentive to seek cost-reducing technologies as a strategy to increase utility profits.

Utility stocks are considered stable investments because they typically provide regular dividends to shareholders and have more stable demand. Even in periods of economic downturns characterized by low interest rates, such stocks are attractive because dividend yields are usually greater than those of other stocks, so the utility sector is often part of a long-term buy-and-hold strategy.

Utilities require expensive critical infrastructure which needs regular maintenance and replacement. Consequently, the industry is capital intensive, requiring regular access to the capital markets for external financing. A utility&#x27;s capital structure may have a significant debt component, which exposes the company to interest rate risk. Should rates rise, the company must offer higher yields to attract bond investors, driving up the utility&#x27;s interest expenses. If the company&#x27;s debt load and interest expense becomes too large, its credit rating will deteriorate, further increasing the cost of capital and potentially limiting access to the capital markets.

==By country==

=== Kazakhstan ===
Public utilities in Kazakhstan include heating, water supply, sewerage, electricity and communications systems.

==== Heating systems ====
* They are mainly represented by centralized networks, with the exception of some rural areas.
* Various types of fuels are used, including coal, natural gas and fuel oil.
* Many systems need to be upgraded to increase their efficiency and reduce their environmental impact.

==== Water supply systems ====
* They provide the population with drinking and industrial water.
* The sources of water are rivers, lakes and groundwater.
* The level of water quality in some regions is of concern.
* It is necessary to increase the efficiency of water resources use and improve water quality.

==== Sewerage systems ====
* Wastewater is diverted from residential and industrial facilities.
* The level of wastewater treatment in some regions does not meet modern standards.
* Sewerage systems need to be expanded and upgraded to protect the environment.

==== Power supply ====
* It is provided by power plants running on various types of fuels, including coal, natural gas, hydropower and nuclear energy.
* There are problems with power outages, especially in rural areas.
* It is necessary to modernize the power grid and increase their efficiency.
* The heating, water supply and sewerage systems of Kazakhstan, although functioning, require urgent modernization. The technical capabilities of these networks are becoming outdated, which leads to an increase in operating costs and a decrease in their reliability.

A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) notes that additional investments are needed to improve the efficiency and reliability of these systems.

The analysis conducted by the EBRD revealed a number of problems faced by heating, water supply and sewerage systems in Kazakhstan.
* Outdated technologies: In many cases, the infrastructure has exhausted its resource and needs to be replaced.
* Low energy efficiency: Existing systems consume a lot of energy, which leads to unjustified costs.
* Unreliability: Worn-out networks often fail, which leads to interruptions in the supply of water and heat, as well as leaks.

The report also provides examples of cities where networks are being upgraded with the support of the EBRD. These projects demonstrate how the introduction of modern technologies can improve the efficiency, reliability and environmental friendliness of heating, water supply and sewerage systems.

Upgrading infrastructure is not just a matter of convenience. It is of vital importance for public health, environmental protection and ensuring the sustainable development of the economy of Kazakhstan.

In most cases, public utilities in Kazakhstan are state-owned, which means that their activities are directly regulated by akimats. This creates a system with an administrative nature of relations, where the authorities have the authority to issue mandatory instructions for these companies.

===== The influence of the state on the activity =====
Proponents of such a system emphasize that it allows the authorities to directly influence the commercial activities of public utilities, ensuring their compliance with state interests. This can be expressed in:
* Tariff control: Akimats can set tariffs for housing and communal services, making them accessible to the public.
* Ensuring the quality of services: The State can influence the standards of service by ensuring the provision of public services of appropriate quality.
* Implementation of social programs: Public utilities can participate in social programs aimed at supporting vulnerable segments of the population.

===== Limitations of State control =====
However, such a system has its drawbacks. Excessive government intervention can lead to:
* Reduced efficiency: Bureaucratic procedures and restrictions in decision-making can slow down the work of enterprises and hinder the introduction of innovations.
* Unreasonable expenses: Administrative barriers and inefficient management can lead to an increase in inappropriate expenses.
* Limiting investments: The uncertainty of government policy and the risks of interference from akimats may deter potential investors.

Resource efficiency:

Despite these limitations, utilities within the framework of this system can demonstrate high efficiency in the use of labor resources and management costs.

Residents of Kazakhstan receive water, sewerage and heating from companies recognized by the state as natural monopolies. This means that there is no competition in these areas, and tariffs are set by a special state body – the Committee for Regulation of Natural Monopolies, Competition and Consumer Protection (CRNM and CP).

In order to ensure the smooth operation of public utilities, the state also controls the investment programs of monopolistic companies. This is handled by the Committee on Construction and Housing and Communal Services. Such a system allows you to regulate prices for utilities and direct investments to infrastructure development. However, this system also has its disadvantages. For example, the lack of competition can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of monopolistic companies.

To protect the interests of consumers from unjustified overpricing and substandard service, there are special regulatory bodies whose powers are regulated by the Law &quot;On Natural Monopolies&quot; and other regulatory acts.

Main functions:
* Investment promotion: Development of tariff calculation methods that are attractive to both consumers and private investors interested in investing in the modernization of public infrastructure.
* Control over the use of funds from IFIs: Determining the specifics of regulating the activities of natural monopolies that attract financing from international financial institutions (IFIs). This allows you to track the intended use of borrowed funds.
* Formation of a transparent tariff policy: Establishment of rules obliging monopolistic companies to publicly disclose information about tariffs, as well as infrastructure development plans.
* Analysis of investment programs: Evaluation of investment programs of natural monopolies, approval of development plans and control over their implementation.

Interaction at different levels:

It is important to note that the powers to regulate the activities of natural monopolies are distributed between federal and local authorities.  Effective coordination of their actions is necessary to ensure coordinated work and achieve common goals.

As a result, the activities of the regulatory authorities of natural monopolies are aimed at ensuring a balance between the interests of consumers, utility companies and the state.

==== The EBRD ====
2017 was marked by a new round of cooperation between Kazakhstan and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The parties signed a three-year agreement with the aim of working together to modernize the country&#x27;s infrastructure.

As part of this agreement, the EBRD will allocate funds for the implementation of a number of important projects aimed at:
* Improving urban infrastructure: Upgrading water supply, sewerage, heating and other vital facilities will be a priority.
* Optimization of customs procedures: Joint efforts will be made to simplify customs processes, which should lead to stimulating trade and accelerating economic growth.

In addition to these two key areas, the EBRD will continue to support other initiatives aimed at improving the well-being of citizens of Kazakhstan.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the state, private firms, and charities ran the traditional public utilities. For instance, the Sanitary Districts were established in England and Wales in 1875 and in Ireland in 1878.

The term can refer to the set of services provided by various organizations that are used in everyday life by the public, such as: electricity generation, electricity retailing, electricity supplies, natural gas supplies, water supplies, sewage works, sewage systems and broadband internet services. They are regulated by Ofgem, Ofwat, Ofcom, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland and the Utility Regulator in the United Kingdom, and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the Commission for Communications Regulation in the Republic of Ireland. Disabled community transport services may occasionally be included within the definition. They were mostly privatised in the UK during the 1980s.

===United States===

The first public utility in the United States was a grist mill erected on Mother Brook in Dedham, Massachusetts, in 1640.

In the U.S., public utilities provide services at the consumer level, be it residential, commercial, or industrial consumer. Utilities, merchant power producers and very large consumers buy and sell bulk electricity at the wholesale level through a network of regional transmission organizations (RTO) and independent system operators (ISO) within one of three grids, the Eastern Interconnection, the Texas Interconnection, which is a single ISO, and the Western Interconnection.

U.S. utilities historically operated with a high degree of financial leverage and low interest coverage ratios compared to industrial companies. Investors accepted these credit characteristics because of the regulation of the industry and the belief that there was minimal bankruptcy risk because of the essential services they provide. In recent decades several high-profile utility company bankruptcies have challenged this perception.

====Monopoly vs. competition====
Public utilities were historically regarded as natural monopolies because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. Once assets such as power plants or transmission lines are in place, the cost of adding another customer is small, and duplication of facilities would be wasteful. As a result, utilities were either government monopolies, or if investor-owned, regulated by a public utilities commission.

In the electric utility industry, the monopoly approach began to change in the 1990s. In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued its Order No. 888, which mandated that electric utilities open access to their transmission systems to enhance competition and &quot;functionally unbundle&quot; their transmission service from their other operations. The order also promoted the role of an independent system operator to manage power flow on the electric grid. Later, FERC Order No. 889 established an electronic information system called OASIS (open access same-time information system) which would give new users of transmission lines access to the same information available to the owner of the network. The result of these and other regulatory rulings was the eventual restructuring of the traditional monopoly-regulated regime to one in which all bulk power sellers could compete. A further step in industry restructuring, &quot;customer choice&quot;, followed in some 19 states, giving retail electric customers the option to be served by non-utility retail power marketers.

====Ownership structure====
Public utilities can be privately owned or publicly owned. Publicly owned utilities include cooperative and municipal utilities. Municipal utilities may actually include territories outside of city limits or may not even serve the entire city. Cooperative utilities are owned by the customers they serve. They are usually found in rural areas. Publicly owned utilities are non-profit. Private utilities, also called investor-owned utilities, are owned by investors, and operate for profit, often referred to as a rate of return.

====Regulation====
A public utilities commission is a governmental agency in a particular jurisdiction that regulates the commercial activities related to associated electric, natural gas, telecommunications, water, railroad, rail transit, and/or passenger transportation companies. For example, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the Public Utility Commission of Texas regulate the utility companies in California and Texas, respectively, on behalf of their citizens and ratepayers (customers). These public utility commissions (PUCs) are typically composed of commissioners, who are appointed by their respective governors, and dedicated staff that implement and enforce rules and regulations, approve or deny rate increases, and monitor/report on relevant activities.

Ratemaking practice in the U.S. holds that rates paid by a utility&#x27;s customers should be set at a level which assures that the utility can provide reliable service at reasonable cost.

Over the years, various changes have dramatically re-shaped the mission and focus of many public utility commissions. Their focus has typically shifted from the up-front regulation of rates and services to the oversight of competitive marketplaces and enforcement of regulatory compliance.

<text>Sir Ian Holm Cuthbert (12 September 1931 – 19 June 2020) was an English actor. After graduating from RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) and beginning his career on the British stage as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he became a successful and prolific performer on television and in film. He received numerous accolades including two BAFTA Awards and a Tony Award, along with a nomination for an Academy Award. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for services to drama.

Holm won the 1967 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor for his performance as Lenny in the Harold Pinter play &quot;The Homecoming&quot;. He won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance in the title role in the 1998 West End production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. For his television roles he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for King Lear, and the HBO film &quot;The Last of the Blonde Bombshells&quot; (2003).

Holm gained acclaim for his role in &quot;The Bofors Gun&quot; (1968), winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and won a second BAFTA Award for his role as athletics trainer Sam Mussabini in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981). Other notable films he appeared in include &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;Dreamchild&quot; (1985), &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991), &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). He played Napoleon three separate times. He gained wider appreciation for his role as the elderly Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy.

==Early life and education==
Ian Holm Cuthbert was born on 12 September 1931 in Goodmayes, Essex, to Scottish parents, James Cuthbert and his wife Jean (née Holm). His father was a psychiatrist who worked as the superintendent of the West Ham Corporation Mental Hospital and was one of the pioneers of electric shock therapy; his mother was a nurse. He had an older brother, who died when Ian was 12 years old. Holm was educated at the independent Chigwell School in Essex. His parents retired to Mortehoe in Devon and then to Worthing, where he joined an amateur dramatic society.

A chance encounter with Henry Baynton, a well-known provincial Shakespearean actor, helped Holm train for admission to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he secured a place from 1950. His studies were interrupted a year later when he was called up for National Service in the British Army, during which he was posted to Klagenfurt, Austria, and attained the rank of Lance Corporal. They were interrupted a second time when he volunteered to go on an acting tour of the United States in 1952. Holm graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1953. 

He made his stage debut in 1954, at Stratford-upon-Avon, playing a spear carrier in a staging of &quot;Othello&quot;. Two years later, he made his London stage debut in &quot;Love Affair&quot;.

== Career ==

Holm was an established actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company before he gained notice in television and film. He began in 1954 with minor roles, progressing to Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;. In 1965, he played Richard III in the BBC serialisation of &quot;The Wars of The Roses&quot;, based on the RSC production of the plays. He gained acclaim for his role in the 1968 film &quot;The Bofors Gun&quot;, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. In 1969, he appeared in &quot;Moonlight on the Highway&quot;. He took on minor roles in films such as &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1972) and &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972).

In 1967 Holm won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play as Lenny in &quot;The Homecoming&quot; by Harold Pinter. Holm appeared in the 1977 television mini-series &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; as the Sadducee Zerah, and as the villain in &quot;March or Die&quot;. The following year he played J. M. Barrie in the award-winning BBC mini-series &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, In 1981, he played Frodo Baggins in the BBC radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Holm&#x27;s first film role to gain much notice was that of Ash, the &quot;calm, technocratic&quot; science officer – later revealed to be an android – in Ridley Scott&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979). His portrayal of the running coach Sam Mussabini in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) earned him a special award at the Cannes Film Festival, a BAFTA award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In the 1980s, Holm played in &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;&quot; (1984) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). He played Lewis Carroll, the author of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, in &quot;Dreamchild&quot; (1985).

In 1989, Holm was nominated for a BAFTA award for the television series &quot;Game, Set and Match&quot;. Based on the novels by Len Deighton, this tells the story of an intelligence officer (Holm) who finds a security leak at the heart of his network. He continued to perform Shakespeare in films. He appeared with Kenneth Branagh in &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989) and as Polonius to Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990).
Holm was reunited with Branagh in &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994), playing the father of Branagh&#x27;s Victor Frankenstein.

Holm raised his profile in 1997 with two prominent roles, as the priest Vito Cornelius in Luc Besson&#x27;s sci-fi &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and the lawyer Mitchell Stephens in &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;. In 2001 he starred in &quot;From Hell&quot; as the physician Sir William Withey Gull. The same year, he followed up his radio role as Frodo by appearing as Frodo&#x27;s older cousin Bilbo Baggins in the blockbuster film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. This brought him wider fame, somewhat overshadowing the rest of his acting career. He returned for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), for which he shared a SAG award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. He later reprised his role as the elderly Bilbo Baggins in the films &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;. Martin Freeman portrayed the young Bilbo in those films.

Holm was nominated for an Emmy Award twice, for a PBS broadcast of a National Theatre production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, in 1999; and for a supporting role in the HBO film &quot;The Last of the Blonde Bombshells&quot; opposite Judi Dench, in 2001. He voiced Chef Skinner in the Pixar animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007). He appeared in two David Cronenberg films: &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991) and &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (1999). His acting was admired by Harold Pinter: the playwright once said: &quot;He puts on my shoe, and it fits!&quot; Holm played Lenny in both the London and New York City premieres of Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot;; the BBC wrote that he &quot;electrified audiences&quot; in the play. He played Napoleon Bonaparte three times: in the television mini-series &quot;Napoleon and Love&quot; (1974), Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;. Holm received royal recognition for his contributions: he was made CBE in 1989 and knighted in 1998.

== Personal life ==
Holm was married four times: to Lynn Mary Shaw in 1955 (divorced 1965); to Sophie Baker in 1982 (divorced 1986); to the actress Penelope Wilton, in Wiltshire, in 1991 (divorced 2002); and to the artist Sophie de Stempel in 2003. He had five children.

Holm and Wilton appeared together in the BBC miniseries &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1993). His last wife, Sophie de Stempel, was a protégée and a life model of Lucian Freud, as well as an artist in her own right.

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 by Queen Elizabeth II.

Holm was treated for prostate cancer in 2001. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2007.

==Death==
Holm died in hospital in London on 19 June 2020 at the age of 88. According to Alex Irwin, Holm&#x27;s agent, his death was related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His remains are interred on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Posthumous image use==
With the consent of his heirs, the role of android Rook was generated from Holm&#x27;s archive data and computer-generated imagery for the 2024 film &quot;&quot;, the identical model to Ash, the character of the first &quot;Alien&quot; film, he played in 1979.

<text>Guava ( ) is a common tropical fruit cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions. The common guava &quot;Psidium guajava&quot; (lemon guava, apple guava) is a small tree in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), native to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. The name guava is also given to some other species in the genus &quot;Psidium&quot; such as strawberry guava (&quot;Psidium cattleyanum&quot;) and to the pineapple guava, &quot;Feijoa sellowiana&quot;. In 2019, 55 million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide, led by India with 45% of the total. Botanically, guavas are berries.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;guava&quot; appears to have been in use since the mid-16th century. The name derived from the Taíno, a language of the Arawaks as for &quot;guava tree&quot; via the Spanish for . It has been adapted in many European and Asian languages, having a similar form.

== Origin and distribution ==
Guavas originated from an area thought to extend from Mexico, Central America or northern South America throughout the Caribbean region. Archaeological sites in Peru yielded evidence of guava cultivation as early as 2500 BC.

Guava was adopted as a crop in subtropical and tropical Asia, parts of the United States (from Tennessee and North Carolina, southward, as well as the west and Hawaii), tropical Africa, and Oceania. Guavas were introduced to Florida, US in the 19th century and are grown there as far north as Sarasota, Chipley, Waldo and Fort Pierce. However, they are a primary host of the Caribbean fruit fly and must be protected against infestation in areas of Florida where this pest is present.

Guavas are cultivated in several tropical and subtropical countries. Several species are grown commercially; apple guava and its cultivars are those most commonly traded internationally. Guavas also grow in southwestern Europe, specifically the Costa del Sol on Málaga, (Spain) and Greece where guavas have been commercially grown since the middle of the 20th century and they proliferate as cultivars. Mature trees of most species are fairly cold-hardy and can survive temperatures slightly colder than for short periods of time, but younger plants will likely freeze to the ground.

Guavas are of interest to home growers in subtropical areas as one of the few tropical fruits that can grow to fruiting size in pots indoors. When grown from seed, guava trees can bear fruit in two years, and can continue to do so for forty years.

== Types ==
The most frequently eaten species, and the one often simply referred to as &quot;the guava&quot;, is the apple guava (&quot;Psidium guajava&quot;). Guavas are typical Myrtoideae, with tough dark heavy leaves that are opposite, simple, elliptic to ovate, and long. The flowers are white, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruits are many-seeded berries.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Psidium&quot; species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, mainly moths like the Ello Sphinx (&quot;Erinnyis ello&quot;), &quot;Eupseudosoma aberrans&quot;, &quot;E. involutum&quot;, and &quot;Hypercompe icasia&quot;. Mites, like &quot;Pronematus pruni&quot; and &quot;Tydeus munsteri&quot;, are known to be crop pests of the apple guava (&quot;P. guajava&quot;) and perhaps other species. The bacterium &quot;Erwinia psidii&quot; causes rot diseases of the apple guava.

The fruit is cultivated and favored by humans, and many other animals such as birds consume it, readily dispersing the seeds in their droppings. In Hawaii, strawberry guava (&quot;P. littorale&quot;) has become an aggressive invasive species threatening extinction to more than 100 other plant species. By contrast, several guava species have become rare due to habitat destruction and at least one (Jamaican guava, &quot;P. dumetorum&quot;), is already extinct.

Guava wood is used for meat smoking in Hawaii, and is used at barbecue competitions across the United States. In Cuba and Mexico, the leaves are used in barbecues.

== Fruit ==
Guava fruits, usually long, are round or oval depending on the species. They have a pronounced and typical fragrance, similar to lemon rind but less sharp. The outer skin may be rough, often with a bitter taste, or soft and sweet. Varying between species, the skin can be any thickness, is usually green before maturity, but may be yellow, maroon, or green when ripe. The pulp inside may be sweet or sour and off-white (&quot;white&quot; guavas) to deep pink (&quot;red&quot; guavas). The seeds in the central pulp vary in number and hardness, depending on species.

== Production ==
In 2022, world production of guavas was 59 million tonnes, led by India with 44% of the total (table; mangoes and mangosteens included). Secondary producers were Indonesia and China.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
In Mexico and other Latin American countries, the beverage agua fresca is often made with guava. The entire fruit is a key ingredient in punch, and the juice is often used in culinary sauces (hot or cold), ales, candies, dried snacks, fruit bars, and desserts, or dipped in chamoy. &quot;Pulque de guayaba&quot; (&quot;guayaba&quot; is Spanish for guava) is a common alcoholic beverage in these regions.

In many countries, guava is eaten raw, typically cut into quarters or eaten like an apple; it is also eaten with a pinch of salt and pepper, cayenne powder or a mix of spices (masala). In the Philippines, ripe guava is used in cooking &quot;sinigang&quot;. Guava is a snack in Cuba as &quot;pastelitos de guayaba&quot;; and in Taiwan, sold on many street corners and night markets during hot weather, accompanied by packets of dried plum powder mixed with sugar and salt for dipping. In east Asia, guava is commonly eaten with sweet and sour dried plum powder mixtures. Guava juice is consumed in many countries. The fruit is also often included in fruit salads.

Because of its high level of pectin, guavas are extensively used to make candies, preserves, jellies, jams, and marmalades (such as Brazilian &quot;goiabada&quot; and Colombian and Venezuelan &quot;bocadillo&quot;), and as a marmalade jam served on toast.

Red guavas can be used as the base of salted products such as sauces, substituting for tomatoes, especially to minimize the acidity. A drink may be made from an infusion of guava fruits and leaves, which in Brazil is called &quot;chá-de-goiabeira&quot;, i.e., &quot;tea&quot; of guava tree leaves.

== Nutrition ==
A raw common guava is 81% water, 14% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 0.5% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw guava supplies of food energy and is a rich source of dietary fiber and vitamin C (275% of the Daily Value, DV), with moderate levels of folic acid (12% DV) and potassium (14% DV, table). Raw guava contains lycopene (table).

== Phytochemicals ==
Guava leaves contain both carotenoids and polyphenols, such as (+)-gallocatechin and leucocyanidin. As some of these phytochemicals produce the fruit skin and flesh color, guavas that are red-orange tend to have more polyphenol and carotenoid content than yellow-green ones.

===Seed oil ===
Guava seed oil may be used for culinary or cosmetics products. It is rich in linoleic acid.

== Folk medicine ==
Since the 1950s, guavas – particularly the leaves – have been studied for their constituents, potential biological properties and history in folk medicine.

== Parasites ==
Guavas are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies like &quot;A. suspensa&quot;, which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled guavas. The larvae of these flies then consume the fruit until they can proceed into the pupa stage. This parasitism has led to millions in economic losses for nations in Central America.

Fungal pathogens, &quot;Neopestalotiopsis&quot; and &quot;Pestalotiopsis&quot; species are causal agents of guava scab in Colombia.

==Propagation==

Air layering is an effective method for propagating guava plant. It allows for the production of new plants while maintaining the parent plant’s characteristics. This technique involves selecting a healthy branch making a small incision on the branch, and applying rooting hormone to encourage root development. The branch is then wrapped in moist peat moss and covered with plastic to help retain moisture. After several weeks, roots will form, and then a new plant can be severed from the parent and transplanted into soil. This method is particularly beneficial for guava due to its high success rate and ability to produce fruit-bearing plants quickly.

<doc id="171143" wikidata="Q1273624" url="?curid=171143" title="Greeklish">
<text>Greeklish, a portmanteau of the words Greek and English, also known as Grenglish, Latinoellinika/Λατινοελληνικά or [[ASCII]] Greek, is the Greek language written using the Latin script. Unlike standardized systems of Romanization of Greek, as used internationally for purposes such as rendering Greek proper names or place names, or for bibliographic purposes, the term &quot;Greeklish&quot; mainly refers to informal, ad-hoc practices of writing Greek text in environments where the use of the Greek alphabet is technically impossible or cumbersome, especially in electronic media. Greeklish was commonly used on the Internet when Greek people communicate by forum, e-mail, IRC, instant messaging and occasionally on SMS, mainly because older operating systems did not support non-Latin writing systems, or in a unicode form like UTF-8. Nowadays most Greek language content appears in the Greek alphabet.

Sometimes, the term Greeklish is also used informally for a non-standard language variety used by bilingual speakers of English and Greek, i.e. Greek with heavy macaronic or code-switching admixture of English words, or vice versa.

==History==
Some older traditions of using the Latin alphabet for Greek existed in earlier centuries. The term frankolevantinika properly refers to the use of the Latin script to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism. (&quot;Frankos&quot; is an older Greek term for Roman Catholic.) This usage was routine in the Venetian-ruled Greece and in Venetian Crete in the early modern era. Indeed, the autograph manuscripts of several Greek literary works of the Renaissance are in Latin script (e.g. the comedy &quot;Fortounatos&quot; by Markos Antonios Foskolos, 1655). This convention was also known as frankochiotika/φραγκοχιώτικα, &quot;Frankish/Catholic Chiot&quot;, alluding to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios.

==Orthographic and phonetic Greeklish==
Greeklish may be orthographic or phonetic. In orthographic use, the intent is to reproduce Greek orthography closely: there is a one-to-one mapping between Greek and Latin letters, and digraphs are avoided, with occasional use of punctuation or numerals resembling Greek letters rather than Latin digraphs. While letters are in the first instance chosen for phonetic similarity, visual equivalence, and corresponding keyboard keys, are used when phonetically similar letters are exhausted. Thus, psi (ψ) may be written as ps, 4 or y; xi (ξ) as ks, x or 3; and theta (θ) as th or 8.

In phonetic use, there is no concern to reproduce Greek orthography, and the Greeklish is a phonetic transcription (usually with English phonetic norms, sometimes with other languages&#x27; like German) of Greek words — although often there is a mixture of the two. In particular, iotacism is preserved: the various letters and digraphs now pronounced as /i/ are transcribed as i, and not differentiated as they are in an orthographic scheme (e.g. h, i, u, ei, oi for η ι υ ει οι). In a phonetic scheme, xi is usually x or ks or 3; ks or 3 is used if x has been chosen, following orthographic norms, for chi (χ). Psi and theta will usually be the digraphs ps and th. 3 is often used to represent xi (ξ) because of the similar shape of the number 3 to the original letter albeit mirrored.

An example of orthographic Greeklish could be the word &quot;plateia&quot;, which in Greek means &quot;square&quot; and using the Greek alphabet is spelled &quot;πλατεία&quot;. The word &quot;plateia&quot; derives from the exact replacement of each Greek letter with its Latin respective: π=p, λ=l, α=a, τ=t, ε=e, ι=i, α=a.

An example of phonetic Greeklish could be the same word, &quot;square&quot;, written like this: &quot;platia&quot;. The reason the same word is, in this occasion, written without the letter &quot;e&quot;, is the fact that, phonetically, the word &quot;square&quot; in Greek sounds exactly like this: &quot;platia&quot; (since -&quot;εί&quot;- is now pronounced /i/, as an instance of iotacism), but not for the phonology and the historical or learned pronunciation of the Ancient Greek language (where it was &quot;plateia&quot;).

The most extreme case of orthographic Greeklish, which achieves the greater optical resemblance to the Greek prototypes, is perhaps the so-called &quot;byzantine&quot; or &quot;arabesque&quot; or &quot;calligraphic/artistic&quot; Greeklish introduced in the Hellas mailing list by the mathematician George Baloglou. Main characteristics of Baloglou&#x27;s &quot;byzantine&quot; is the distinction of σ and ς (σ=c ς=s), the distinction of lower and upper letters, such as π=n, Π=TT or 5, θ=8, Θ=0 or Q, ψ=y, Ψ=4, and the unusual, but with great resemblance with the Greek prototype, transliterations σ=c, π=n ρ=p Ρ=P.

Since there were many relevant differences both in the written and in the spoken language—such as in the grammar, orthography and phonology of Greek- at the time of the Ancient Greek, the Koine, Jewish Koine, Medieval and Modern, thus the same word across the history may change outstandingly and therefore have multiple choices of &quot;rendering&quot; (transliteration or transcription) depending on the time on which the referring text was written or translated.

==Books written in Greeklish==
Giannis Androutsopoulos (see references) talks about &quot;Exegesis&quot;, a book in Greeklish that was published by Oxy Publications in 2000. The Greeklish transliteration was based on the Greek translation of the original book written by Astro Teller. A novel about artificial intelligence, it describes a computer program that has acquired a &quot;mind&quot; of its own. The original book was written entirely in the form of e-mail messages, something that prompted Androutsopoulos and his collaborators to publish a version of it in Greeklish.

==Computer usage==
In the past there was a variety of mutually incompatible systems for displaying non-ASCII characters (IBM 437, ELOT 928, ISO 8859-7 plus a few company-specific encodings) and no standard method for typing them on a computer keyboard. This situation was resolved with the introduction of Unicode. Before the introduction of Unicode-compatible software (web servers and clients) many Greek personal or informal web sites were written in Greeklish. This is no longer the case and most (if not all) of the sites with Greek content are written in native Greek.

Almost all electronic mail messaging was also using Greeklish, and only recently, with the introduction of full Unicode compatibility in modern e-mail client software and gradual replacement of older programs, that usage of Greek characters became widespread.

Some Internet Service Providers in Greece use both Greek and Greeklish in their emails. For example, the corporate announcements sent to users via email are usually written in English, Greek, and Greeklish. This is done to ensure that the recipient can understand an important service message even if the settings of their computer for non-ASCII characters don&#x27;t match those of the sender.

==Commercial use==

=== Use in advertisements ===
As of 2008, business advertisements using Greeklish have appeared in Athens Metro and other areas. Companies that have used Greeklish in some of their advertisements include Pizza Hut, Forthnet and Vodafone.

===Use in business communication===
Use of Greeklish for business purposes or business communication is considered as a lack of business ability or respect.

==Current trends==
Around 2004, after most computer software became compatible with Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 systems, use of Greeklish was strongly discouraged in many Greek online Web discussion boards (forums) where Greeklish was in use before. Administrators threatened to ban users who continued to use Greeklish, thus making the use of Greek mandatory; but using Greeklish failed to become a serious reason to get banned. Examples include the Translatum Greek Translation Forum, the Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network Forum, the Venus Project Forum, the adslgr.com Forum, the e-steki.gr forum, the Greek Technological Forum, and the Greek student forum. The reason for this is the fact that text written in Greeklish is considerably less aesthetically pleasing, and also much harder to read, compared to text written in the Greek alphabet. A non-Greek speaker/reader can guess this by this example: &quot;δις ιζ χαρντ του ριντ&quot; would be the way to write &quot;this is hard to read&quot; in English but utilizing the Greek alphabet.

A counterargument used by forum users is that a fair number of users live abroad and access the Internet from computers they don&#x27;t own (university, internet cafes, etc.). There, they are not able to install additional keyboard layouts so they don&#x27;t have the ability to type in Greek, therefore Greeklish is the only option available to them.

On Greek IRC channels and IM applications, most of the time only Greeklish is used because it is simpler to type and typing errors are more easily excused. However, Greeklish has been criticised because the user&#x27;s text bypasses spellcheck, resulting in lowering their ability to write native Greek correctly.

On the Facebook social networking web site there are various groups against the use of &quot;Greeklish&quot;.

Wide use for Greeklish in long texts as of 2010, is unusual.

Another current trend in Greeklish is the introduction of Leet phrasing and vocabulary. Many Leet words or slang have been internalized within the Greek spoken language through Greek gamers online in games such as World of Warcraft.

Examples:

==Examples==

===&quot;Καλημέρα, πώς είστε;&quot; ===
*Greeklish 1: kalimera, pos iste? (phonetic)
*Greeklish 2: kalhmera, pws eiste; (reconciling with spelling rules)
*Baloglou&#x27;s &quot;byzantine&quot; variant: kalhmepa, nws eicte;
*Typing as if the keyboard layout were set to Greek, when it is actually set to US English: Kalhm;era, p;vw e;isteq
*Omitting some vowels, as a form of abbreviation: Klmr ps iste?

==Greeklish-to-Greek conversion==
Since the appearance of Greeklish there have been numerous attempts to develop applications for automatic conversion from Greeklish to Greek. Most of them can cope with only some of Greeklish transliteration patterns and can be found and downloaded from the Internet. The first complete system for automatic transcription of Greeklish into Greek, obtaining correct spelling is &quot;All Greek to Me!&quot;, developed and provided by the Institute for Language and Speech Processing.

The first open online application for the transcription of Greeklish to Greek, was developed by Artificial Intelligence Group at University of Patras, named deGREEKLISH.

An open source Greeklish converter, written in the C# programming language, is available as a stand alone program.

<doc id="171144" wikidata="Q319265" url="?curid=171144" title="Manfred Mann">
<text>Manfred Mann were an English rock band formed in London in 1962. They were named after their keyboardist Manfred Mann, who later led the successful 1970s group Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band. The group had two lead vocalists: Paul Jones from 1962 to 1966 and Mike d&#x27;Abo from 1966 to 1969. Other members of various group line-ups were Mike Hugg, Mike Vickers, Dave Richmond, Tom McGuinness, Jack Bruce (later of Cream) and Klaus Voormann.

Prominent in the Swinging London scene of the 1960s, the group regularly appeared in the UK Singles Chart. Their breakthrough hit &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; (1964) was the theme tune for the ITV pop music show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. The band achieved a UK and US No. 1 hit with &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; (1964), which made them the first southern-England band to top the US charts during the British Invasion. The group scored two more UK No. 1 singles with &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot; (1968).

== History ==

=== Beginnings (1962–1963) ===
The Mann–Hugg Blues Brothers were formed in London in 1962 by keyboard player Manfred Mann and drummer/vibes/piano player Mike Hugg, who had previously been members of a house band in Clacton-on-Sea that also featured Graham Bond. Bringing a shared love of jazz to the British blues boom then sweeping London&#x27;s clubs, the band was completed by Mike Vickers on guitar, alto saxophone and flute, bassist Dave Richmond and Paul Jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist. At one point, the band included Tony Smith on bass guitar, Glyn Thomas on drums, and four brass members. By this time they had changed their name to Manfred Mann &amp; the Manfreds. Gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963, they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound.

After changing their name to Manfred Mann at the behest of their label&#x27;s producer John Burgess, the group signed with His Master&#x27;s Voice in March 1963 and began their recorded output that July with the slow blues instrumental single &quot;Why Should We Not?&quot;, which they performed on their first appearance on television on a New Year&#x27;s Eve show. It failed to chart, as did its follow-up (with vocals), &quot;Cock-a-Hoop&quot;. The overdubbed instrumental soloing on woodwinds, vibes, harmonica and second keyboard lent considerable weight to the group&#x27;s sound, and demonstrated the jazz-inspired technical prowess in which they took pride.

=== Early success (1964–1966) ===
In 1964, the group was asked to provide a new theme tune for the ITV pop music television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; They responded with &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; which, with the help of weekly television exposure, rose to No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. Shortly after &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; was recorded, Richmond left the band, though he would record with them occasionally later. He was replaced by Jones&#x27; friend Tom McGuinness—the first of many changes. After a further self-penned hit, &quot;Hubble Bubble (Toil And Trouble)&quot;, the band struck gold with &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot;, a cover version of the Exciters&#x27; No. 78 Hot 100 hit earlier that year. The track reached the top of the UK, Canadian, and US charts.

With the success of &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; the sound of the group&#x27;s singles moved away from the jazzy, blues-based music of their early years to a pop hybrid that continued to make hit singles from cover material. They hit No. 3 in the UK with another girl-group cover, &quot;Sha La La&quot; (originally by the Shirelles), which also reached No. 12 in the US and Canada, and followed it with the sentimental &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot; (originally by Marie Knight) but both were of a noticeably lighter texture than their earliest output. Meanwhile, B-sides and four-song EPs showcased original material and instrumental solos. The group also returned to jazz and R&amp;B themes on their albums: their first, 1964&#x27;s &quot;The Five Faces of Manfred Mann&quot;, included standards such as &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; while the second and last with this line-up, &quot;Mann Made&quot;, offered several self-composed instrumentals and a version of &quot;Stormy Monday Blues&quot; alongside novelties and pop ballads. With a cover of Maxine Brown&#x27;s &quot;Oh No Not My Baby&quot; began a phase of new depth and sophistication in the arrangements of their singles. The group began its string of successes with Bob Dylan songs with a track on the best-selling EP &quot;The One in the Middle&quot;, &quot;With God on Our Side&quot;, next reaching No. 2 in the UK with &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot;. The EP&#x27;s title track reached the British top ten singles, the last self-written song (by Jones) and the band&#x27;s last R&#x27;n&#x27;B workout to do so. The run climaxed with a second UK No. 1 single, &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot;, produced by John Burgess.

The group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion, and then had taken chart music in their stride—but could not hope to cope with Paul Jones&#x27; projected solo career as singer and actor, and with Mike Vickers&#x27; orchestral and instrumental ambitions. Jones intended to go solo once a replacement could be found, but stayed with the band for another year, during which Vickers left. McGuinness moved to guitar, his original instrument, contributing the distinctive National Steel Guitar to &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; and &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot;, and was replaced on bass by Jack Bruce, who had been playing for the Graham Bond Organisation for some time before a recent brief stint with John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers. In his brief tenure before leaving to form Cream, Bruce played on &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot; and on the EP &quot;Instrumental Asylum&quot; (for which he and wind instrumentalists Henry Lowther and Lyn Dobson were included in the sleeve photo of the group), which began the group&#x27;s experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs. Bruce was replaced by Klaus Voormann. The band changed record companies just afterward, although EMI quickly released an EP of earlier unissued 1963–66 era songs titled &quot;As Was&quot; (a play on the title of their then new 1966 album, &quot;As Is&quot;), a hits compilation titled &quot;Mann Made Hits&quot; (1966), an instrumental compilation that included one unissued track titled &quot;Soul of Mann&quot; (1967), and, most controversially, used session players to complete the unfinished track &quot;You Gave Me Somebody To Love&quot; (c/w &#x27;Poison Ivy&quot;—both sung by Paul Jones) which made No. 36 in the UK singles chart, upsetting the group—hence McGuinness&#x27;s wry comment &quot;Manfreds disown new single&quot; on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label.

=== Mike d&#x27;Abo years (1966–1969) ===
Jones was replaced by Mike d&#x27;Abo in July 1966, and the group switched labels to Fontana Records, where they were produced by Shel Talmy. Their first Fontana single, a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;, released in July, scraped into the UK top ten and reached number one in Sweden. Their new long-player, &quot;As Is&quot;, followed in October; the group&#x27;s increased studio technique sidelined their jazz, soul and blues roots. The next two singles, &quot;Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr James&quot; and &quot;Ha! Ha! Said the Clown&quot;, both reached the Top 5. Another EP set of instrumentals, &quot;Instrumental Assassination&quot;, was released in December. This featured original member Dave Richmond on double bass, but not Mike d&#x27;Abo, suggesting the sessions dated from a little earlier in 1966.

An instrumental version of Tommy Roe&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; only reached No. 36 when issued as a single, and the follow-up, Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;So Long, Dad&quot;, with its intricate keyboard arrangement, missed the top twenty altogether. Thus, 1967 was for the group largely an unsuccessful year in the charts, besides &quot;Ha Ha Said The Clown&quot; which reached the UK singles chart early in 1967. There was no album, as Mann and Hugg explored other avenues of their career, although their record company did compile the UK budget-priced album &quot;What A Mann&quot; (Fontana SFL 13003), a predominantly instrumental set gathering together a few recent singles&#x27; A-sides, B-sides, and instrumental EP tracks.

The following year, 1968, brought two albums: the Mann–Hugg soundtrack to the film &quot;Up the Junction&quot; in February, from which an edited title track coupled with the rare B-side &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was issued as an unsuccessful UK single; and &quot;Mighty Garvey!&quot; in July. They had a resounding success with &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot;, their third UK No. 1 and third hit Dylan song, which also peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 10 in the US.

In June 1968, the following single, John Simon&#x27;s &quot;My Name is Jack&quot;, was recalled when the US company Mercury Records complained about the phrase &quot;Super Spade&quot; in the lyrics, which referred to a Haight-Ashbury drug dealer. The release was delayed by a week until the offending name was re-recorded as &quot;Superman&quot;, but the UK hit single version retained the original lyric. Their December 1968 release, &quot;Fox on the Run&quot;, reached No. 5 in the UK.

Frustrated with the limitations and image of being seen purely as a hit singles band (their last two albums failed to chart), the group split in 1969.

=== Aftermath ===
Mann and Hugg were already writing advertising jingles at the time of the group&#x27;s demise, but continued to work together in a group format with Manfred Mann Chapter Three, an experimental jazz rock band described by Mann as an over-reaction to the hit factory of the Manfred Mann group. For a moment their musical worlds coincided: a TV cigar advertisement, a long track from Chapter Three&#x27;s first album (&quot;Travellin&#x27; Lady&quot;), and &quot;A &quot;B&quot; Side&quot; (the flip of the old group&#x27;s last single) all used the same riff.

However, the new group was short-lived and by 1971 after a second album (and an unreleased, possibly incomplete, third) they had disbanded and Mann had formed a new group. The original line-up of this new group consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (organ, synthesizer and vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals). In its very earliest stages, the band was simply billed as Manfred Mann and thus a continuation of the 1960s group. The quartet (as Manfred Mann) released their first single, Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Please, Mrs. Henry&quot;, in 1971. Their second single, Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;Living Without You&quot;, was also released by under the Manfred Mann name in Europe, but by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band in the US, where the track became a minor chart hit. From 1972 onward, Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band was the name used on all releases by this group, who went on to achieve worldwide success. Manfred Mann (1962–1969), Manfred Mann Chapter Three (1969–1971) and Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band (1971–present) are officially considered three separate bands.

Manfred Mann briefly reformed in June 1983, for an appearance at the Marquee Club in London to help celebrate the club&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

In the 1990s several of the 1960s members reformed as the Manfreds, minus Manfred Mann himself (hence the name), playing most of the old hits and a few jazz instrumentals, with both Paul Jones and Mike d&#x27;Abo fronting the band, either separately or together.

Tom McGuinness formed McGuinness Flint in 1970; they had a few hits before disbanding in 1975. Both Jones and McGuinness have been mainstays of the Blues Band, which they helped form in 1978.

In 2009, the Manfreds (d&#x27;Abo, Hugg, Jones and McGuinness) joined Klaus Voormann in performing a version of &quot;Mighty Quinn&quot; for his first solo collection &quot;A Sideman&#x27;s Journey&quot;, credited to &#x27;Voormann &amp; Friends&#x27;.

<doc id="171148" wikidata="Q173563" url="?curid=171148" title="Jomo Kenyatta">
<text>Jomo Kenyatta (22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first President from 1964 to his death in 1978. He played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and a conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death.
Kenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow&#x27;s Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961.
On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU&#x27;s only rival—Oginga Odinga&#x27;s leftist Kenya People&#x27;s Union—from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country&#x27;s indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya&#x27;s army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War. His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the &quot;Africanisation&quot; of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta&#x27;s son Uhuru later also became president.
Kenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neocolonial, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption.

==Early life==
===Childhood===

A member of the Kikuyu people, Kenyatta was born with the name Kamau in the small rural village of Ngenda. Birth records were not then kept among the Kikuyu, and Kenyatta&#x27;s date of birth is not known. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890 or 1891, although a fuller analysis by Jeremy Murray-Brown suggested a birth . Kenyatta&#x27;s father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They lived in a homestead near River Thiririka, where they raised crops and bred sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate &quot;nyũmba&quot; (hut).

Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was 10 years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood. Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo, shortly before Muigai died. In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui then married her late husband&#x27;s younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta then took the name of Kamau wa Ngengi (&quot;Kamau, son of Ngengi&quot;). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger Muigai—travelled to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a traditional healer.
In November 1909, Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. The missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain&#x27;s civilizing mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught to read and write in English. He also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. He was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. The longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the British missionaries treated them.

Kenyatta&#x27;s academic progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission&#x27;s carpenter. That year, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognized as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both John and Peter after Jesus&#x27; apostles. Forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose Johnstone, the &quot;-stone&quot; chosen as a reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptized as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. He then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.

===Nairobi: 1914–1922===

Kenyatta moved to Thika, where he worked for an engineering firm run by the Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages from a bank in Nairobi, away. Kenyatta left the job when he became seriously ill; he recuperated at a friend&#x27;s house in the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission. At the time, the British Empire was engaged in the First World War, and the British Army had recruited many Kikuyu. One of those who joined was Kongo, who disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like other Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British. Kenyatta lived with the family of an aunt who had married a Maasai chief, adopting Maasai customs and wearing Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt known as &quot;kĩnyata&quot; in the Kikuyu language. At some point, he took to calling himself &quot;Kĩnyata&quot; or &quot;Kenyatta&quot; after this garment.

In 1917, Kenyatta moved to Narok, where he was involved in transporting livestock to Nairobi, before relocating to Nairobi to work in a store selling farming and engineering equipment. In the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school. Several months later he returned to Thika before obtaining employment building houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter&#x27;s case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court. Desiring a wife, Kenyatta entered a relationship with Grace Wahu, who had attended the CMS School in Kabete; she initially moved into Kenyatta&#x27;s family homestead, although she joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out. On 20 November 1920 she gave birth to Kenyatta&#x27;s son, Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking Holy Communion; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with Wahu out of wedlock. The church insisted that a traditional Kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a Christian marriage; this took place on 8 November 1922. Kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in July 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to Holy Communion.

In April 1922, Kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for Cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for Nairobi&#x27;s municipal council. He earned 250/= (£12/10/–, ) a month, a particularly high wage for a native African, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence. Kenyatta lived in the Kilimani neighbourhood of Nairobi, although he financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighborhood. He had sufficient funds that he could lend money to European clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by Nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported British fashions.

===Kikuyu Central Association: 1922–1929===

Anti-imperialist sentiment was on the rise among both native and Indian communities in Kenya following the Irish War of Independence and the Russian October Revolution. Many indigenous Africans resented having to carry &quot;kipande&quot; identity certificates at all times, being forbidden from growing coffee, and paying taxes without political representation. Political upheavals occurred in Kikuyuland—the area inhabited largely by the Kikuyu—following World War I, among them the campaigns of Harry Thuku and the East African Association, resulting in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in March 1922. Kenyatta had not taken part in these events, perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects.

Kenyatta&#x27;s interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with James Beauttah, a senior figure in the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in Pumwani, although this led to no firm involvement at the time. In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, but remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to London as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta—who had a good command of English—go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group&#x27;s secretary.

It is likely that the KCA purchased a motorbike for Kenyatta, which he used to travel around Kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the Meru and Embu, helping to establish new KCA branches. In February 1928, he was part of a KCA party that visited Government House in Nairobi to give evidence in front of the Hilton Young Commission, which was then considering a federation between Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. In June, he was part of a KCA team which appeared before a select committee of the Kenyan Legislative Council to express concerns about the recent introduction of Land Boards. Introduced by the British Governor of Kenya, Edward Grigg, these Land Boards would hold all land in native reserves in trust for each tribal group. Both the KCA and the Kikuyu Association opposed these Land Boards, which treated Kikuyu land as collectively-owned rather than recognising individual Kikuyu land ownership. Also in February, his daughter, Wambui Margaret, was born.
By this point he was increasingly using the name &quot;Kenyatta&quot;, which had a more African appearance than &quot;Johnstone&quot;.

In May 1928, the KCA launched a Kikuyu-language magazine, &quot;Mũigwithania&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;The Reconciler&quot; or &quot;The Unifier&quot;), in which it published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and raise funds for the KCA. Kenyatta was listed as the publication&#x27;s editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating into Kikuyu. Aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism, Kenyatta&#x27;s took a cautious approach to campaigning, and in &quot;Mũigwithania&quot; he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: &quot;The first thing [about the Empire] is that all people are governed justly, big or small—equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered.&quot; This did not prevent Grigg from writing to the authorities in London requesting permission to shut the magazine down.

==Overseas==
===London: 1929–1931===

After the KCA raised sufficient funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta sailed from Mombasa to Britain. Grigg&#x27;s administration could not stop Kenyatta&#x27;s journey but asked London&#x27;s Colonial Office not to meet with him. He initially stayed at the West African Students&#x27; Union premises in West London, where he met Ladipo Solanke. He then lodged with a prostitute; both this and Kenyatta&#x27;s lavish spending brought concern from the Church Mission Society. His landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt. In the city, Kenyatta met with W. McGregor Ross at the Royal Empire Society, Ross briefing him on how to deal with the Colonial Office. Kenyatta became friends with Ross&#x27; family, and accompanied them to social events in Hampstead. He also contacted anti-imperialists active in Britain, including the League Against Imperialism, Fenner Brockway, and Kingsley Martin. Grigg was in London at the same time and, despite his opposition to Kenyatta&#x27;s visit, agreed to meet with him at the Rhodes Trust headquarters in April. At the meeting, Kenyatta raised the land issue and Thuku&#x27;s exile, the atmosphere between the two being friendly. In spite of this, following the meeting, Grigg convinced Special Branch to monitor Kenyatta.

Kenyatta developed contacts with radicals to the left of the Labour Party, including several communists. In the summer of 1929, he left London and traveled by Berlin to Moscow before returning to London in October. Kenyatta was strongly influenced by his time in the Soviet Union. Back in England, he wrote three articles on the Kenyan situation for the Communist Party of Great Britain&#x27;s newspapers, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and &quot;Sunday Worker&quot;. In these, his criticism of British imperialism was far stronger than it had been in &quot;Muĩgwithania&quot;. These communist links concerned many of Kenyatta&#x27;s liberal patrons. In January, Kenyatta met with Drummond Shiels, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, at the House of Commons. Kenyatta told Shiels that he was not affiliated with communist circles and was unaware of the nature of the newspaper which published his articles. Shiels advised Kenyatta to return home to promote Kikuyu involvement in the constitutional process and discourage violence and extremism.
After eighteen months in Europe, Kenyatta had run out of money. The Anti-Slavery Society advanced him funds to pay off his debts and return to Kenya. Although Kenyatta enjoyed life in London and feared arrest if he returned home, he sailed back to Mombasa in September 1930. On his return, his prestige among the Kikuyu was high because of his time spent in Europe.

In his absence, female genital mutilation (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would damage the structure of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of an American missionary, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta met with church representatives. He expressed the view that although personally opposing FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and argued that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through educating people about its harmful effects on women&#x27;s health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later expelled Kenyatta from the church, citing what he deemed dishonesty during the debate. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.

===Return to Europe: 1931–1933===

In May 1931, Kenyatta and Parmenas Githendu Mockerie sailed for Britain, intent on representing the KCA at a Joint Committee of Parliament on the future of East Africa. Kenyatta would not return to Kenya for fifteen years. In Britain, he spent the summer attending an Independent Labour Party summer school and Fabian Society gatherings. In June, he visited Geneva, Switzerland to attend a Save the Children conference on African children. In November, he met the Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi while in London. That month, he enrolled in the Woodbrooke Quaker College in Birmingham, where he remained until the spring of 1932, attaining a certificate in English writing.

In Britain, Kenyatta befriended an Afro-Caribbean Marxist, George Padmore, who was working for the Soviet-run Comintern. Over time, he became Padmore&#x27;s protégé. In late 1932, he joined Padmore in Germany. Before the end of the year, the duo relocated to Moscow, where Kenyatta studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East. There he was taught arithmetic, geography, natural science, and political economy, as well as Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the history of the Marxist-Leninist movement. Many Africans and members of the African diaspora were attracted to the institution because it offered free education and the opportunity to study in an environment where they were treated with dignity, free from the institutionalised racism present in the U.S. and British Empire. Kenyatta complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of English instruction. There is no evidence that he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and one of his fellow students later characterised him as &quot;the biggest reactionary I have ever met.&quot; Kenyatta also visited Siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour.

The emergence of Germany&#x27;s Nazi government shifted political allegiances in Europe; the Soviet Union pursued formal alliances with France and Czechoslovakia, and thus reduced its support for the movement against British and French colonial rule in Africa. As a result, Comintern disbanded the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers, with which both Padmore and Kenyatta were affiliated. Padmore resigned from the Soviet Communist Party in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the Soviet press. Both Padmore and Kenyatta left the Soviet Union, the latter returning to London in August 1933. The British authorities were highly suspicious of Kenyatta&#x27;s time in the Soviet Union, suspecting that he was a Marxist-Leninist, and following his return the MI5 intelligence service intercepted and read all his mail.

Kenyatta continued writing articles, reflecting Padmore&#x27;s influence. Between 1931 and 1937 he wrote several articles for the &quot;Negro Worker&quot; and joined the newspaper&#x27;s editorial board in 1933. He also produced an article for a November 1933 issue of &quot;Labour Monthly&quot;, and in May 1934 had a letter published in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. He also wrote the entry on Kenya for &quot;Negro&quot;, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more radical position than he had in the past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans; figures like Thuku and Jesse Kariuki were far more moderate in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments that he was able to express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.

===University College London and the London School of Economics: 1933–1939===

Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta worked as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his Kikuyu voice recordings assisted Lilias Armstrong&#x27;s production of &quot;The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu&quot;. The book was published under Armstrong&#x27;s name, although Kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a phonetics course from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled by a grant from the International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans in Kenya.
Over the course of his studies, Kenyatta and Malinowski became close friends. Fellow course-mates included the anthropologists Audrey Richards, Lucy Mair, and Elspeth Huxley. Another of his fellow LSE students was Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, who invited Kenyatta to stay with him and his mother, Princess Marie Bonaparte, in Paris during the spring of 1936.

Kenyatta returned to his former dwellings at 95 Cambridge Street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 in rent. This angered Ross and contributed to the breakdown of their friendship. He then rented a Camden Town flat with his friend Dinah Stock, whom he had met at an anti-imperialist rally in Trafalgar Square. Kenyatta socialised at the Student Movement House in Russell Square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended Africans in the city. To earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film &quot;Sanders of the River&quot;, filmed at Shepperton Studios in Autumn 1934. Several other Africans in London criticized him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people. Appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the African-American Paul Robeson.

In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta and other Africans in London; he became the honorary secretary of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia&#x27;s monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him at Waterloo station. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), of which Kenyatta became one of the vice chairs. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB, the Workers&#x27; Educational Association, Indian National Congress of Great Britain, and the League of Coloured Peoples. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.

Kenyatta assembled the essays on Kikuyu society written for Malinowski&#x27;s class and published them as &quot;Facing Mount Kenya&quot; in 1938. Featuring an introduction written by Malinowski, the book reflected Kenyatta&#x27;s desire to use anthropology as a weapon against colonialism. In it, Kenyatta challenged the Eurocentric view of history by presenting an image of a golden African past by emphasising the perceived order, virtue, and self-sufficiency of Kikuyu society. Utilising a functionalist framework, he promoted the idea that traditional Kikuyu society had a cohesion and integrity that was better than anything offered by European colonialism. In this book, Kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group. The book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women.

The book&#x27;s jacket cover featured an image of Kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear. The book was published under the name &quot;Jomo Kenyatta&quot;, the first time that he had done so; the term &quot;Jomo&quot; was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. &quot;Facing Mount Kenya&quot; was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu being primitive savages in need of European civilization it challenged. Murray-Brown later described it as &quot;a propaganda &quot;tour de force&quot;. No other African had made such an uncompromising stand for tribal integrity.&quot; Bodil Folke Frederiksen, a scholar of development studies, referred to it as &quot;probably the most well-known and influential African scholarly work of its time&quot;, while for fellow scholar Simon Gikandi, it was &quot;one of the major texts in what has come to be known as the invention of tradition in colonial Africa&quot;.

===World War II: 1939–1945===

After the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, Kenyatta and Stock moved to the Sussex village of Storrington. Kenyatta remained there for the duration of the war, renting a flat and a small plot of land to grow vegetables and raise chickens. He settled into rural Sussex life, and became a regular at the village pub, where he gained the nickname &quot;Jumbo&quot;. In August 1940, he took a job at a local farm as an agricultural worker—allowing him to evade military conscription—before working in the tomato greenhouses at Lindfield. He attempted to join the local Home Guard, but was turned down. On 11 May 1942 he married an English woman, Edna Grace Clarke, at Chanctonbury Registry Office. In August 1943, their son, Peter Magana, was born.

Intelligence services continued monitoring Kenyatta, noting that he was politically inactive between 1939 and 1944. In Sussex, he wrote an essay for the United Society for Christian Literature, &quot;My People of Kikuyu and the Life of Chief Wangombe&quot;, in which he called for his tribe&#x27;s political independence. He also began—although never finished—a novel partly based on his life experiences. He continued to give lectures around the country, including to groups of East African soldiers stationed in Britain. He became frustrated by the distance between him and Kenya, telling Edna that he felt &quot;like a general separated by 5000 miles from his troops&quot;. While he was absent, Kenya&#x27;s authorities banned the KCA in 1940.

Kenyatta and other senior IASB members began planning the fifth Pan-African Congress, held in Manchester in October 1945. They were assisted by Kwame Nkrumah, a Gold Coast (Ghanaian) who arrived in Britain earlier that year. Kenyatta spoke at the conference, although made no particular impact on the proceedings. Much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous Africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the European imperialists. The conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to African self-rule, Africans &quot;as a last resort, may have to appeal to force in the effort to achieve Freedom&quot;. Kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence. He subsequently authored an IASB pamphlet, &quot;Kenya: The Land of Conflict&quot;, in which he blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial African past.

==Return to Kenya==
===Presidency of the Kenya African Union: 1946–1952===

After British victory in World War II, Kenyatta received a request to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. He decided not to bring Edna—who was pregnant with a second child—with him, aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony&#x27;s racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife, Grace Wahu and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near to where he was born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyatta met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers&#x27; College in Githungui, Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta&#x27;s leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers&#x27; strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange&#x27;s father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.
They had another child, but she died in childbirth. In 1951, he married his fourth wife, Ngina, who was one of the few female students at his college; she then gave birth to a daughter.
In August 1944, the Kenya African Union (KAU) had been founded; at that time it was the only active political outlet for indigenous Africans in the colony. At its June 1947 annual general meeting, KAU&#x27;s President James Gichuru stepped down and Kenyatta was elected as his replacement. Kenyatta began to draw large crowds wherever he travelled in Kikuyuland, and Kikuyu press began describing him as the &quot;Saviour&quot;, &quot;Great Elder&quot;, and &quot;Hero of Our Race&quot;. He was nevertheless aware that to achieve independence, KAU needed the support of other indigenous tribes and ethnic groups. This was made difficult by the fact that many Maasai and Luo—tribes traditionally hostile to the Kikuyu—regarded him as an advocate of Kikuyu dominance. He insisted on intertribal representation on the KAU executive and ensured that party business was conducted in Swahili, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of indigenous Kenyans.

To attract support from Kenya&#x27;s Indian community, he made contact with Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the new Indian republic. Nehru&#x27;s response was supportive, sending a message to Kenya&#x27;s Indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous African population. Relations with the white minority remained strained; for most white Kenyans, Kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the Soviet Union who had the impertinence to marry a white woman. They too increasingly called for further Kenyan autonomy from the British government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia; they viewed Britain&#x27;s newly elected Labour government with great suspicion. The white Electors&#x27; Union put forward a &quot;Kenya Plan&quot; which proposed greater white settlement in Kenya, bringing Tanganyika into the British Empire, and incorporating it within their new British East African Dominion. In April 1950, Kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of KAU and the East African Indian National Congress in which they both expressed opposition to the Kenya Plan.

By 1952, Kenyatta was widely recognized as a national leader, both by his supporters and by his opponents. As KAU leader, he was at pains to oppose all illegal activity, including workers&#x27; strikes. He called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime. He also insisted that in an independent Kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded. Kenyatta&#x27;s gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted with the growth of the Mau Mau Uprising, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the Kikuyu community who did not support them. By 1959, the Mau Mau had killed around 1,880 people. For many young Mau Mau militants, Kenyatta was regarded as a hero, and they included his name in the oaths they gave to the organisation; such oathing was a Kikuyu custom by which individuals pledged allegiance to another. Kenyatta publicly distanced himself from the Mau Mau. In April 1952, he began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much-publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where—in front of 30,000 people—he said that &quot;Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish forever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it.&quot; Despite Kenyatta&#x27;s vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy. At its 1951 AGM, more militant African nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for Kenyan independence within three years. In January 1952, KAU members formed a secret Central Committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a cell structure. Whatever Kenyatta&#x27;s views on these developments, he had little ability to control them. He was increasingly frustrated, and—without the intellectual companionship he experienced in Britain—felt lonely.

===Trial: 1952–1953===

In October 1952, Kenyatta was arrested and driven to Nairobi, where he was taken aboard a plane and flown to Lokitaung, northwest Kenya, one of the most remote locations in the country. From there he wrote to his family to let them know of his situation. Kenya&#x27;s authorities believed that detaining Kenyatta would help quell civil unrest. Many white settlers wanted him exiled, but the government feared this would turn him into a martyr for the anti-colonialist cause. They thought it better that he be convicted and imprisoned, although at the time had nothing to charge him with, and so began searching his personal files for evidence of criminal activity. Eventually, they charged him and five senior KAU members with masterminding the Mau Mau, a proscribed group. The historian John M. Lonsdale stated that Kenyatta had been made a &quot;scapegoat&quot;, while the historian A. B. Assensoh later suggested that the authorities &quot;knew very well&quot; that Kenyatta was not involved in the Mau Mau, but that they were nevertheless committed to silencing his calls for independence.

The trial took place in Kapenguria, a remote area near the Ugandan border that the authorities hoped would not attract crowds or attention. Together, Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei, Achieng Oneko and Kung&#x27;u Karumba—the &quot;Kapenguria Six&quot;—were put on trial. The defendants assembled an international and multiracial team of defence lawyers, including Chaman Lall, H. O. Davies, F. R. S. De Souza, and Dudley Thompson, led by British barrister and Member of Parliament Denis Nowell Pritt. Pritt&#x27;s involvement brought much media attention; during the trial he faced government harassment and was sent death threats. The judge selected, Ransley Thacker, had recently retired from the Supreme Court of Kenya; the government knew he would be sympathetic to their case and gave him £20,000 to oversee it. The trial lasted five months: Rawson Macharia, the main prosecution witness, turned out to have perjured himself; the judge had only recently been awarded an unusually large pension and maintained secret contact with the then colonial Governor Evelyn Baring. The prosecution failed to produce any strong evidence that Kenyatta or the other accused had any involvement in managing the Mau Mau.

In April 1953, Judge Thacker found the defendants guilty. He sentenced them to seven years&#x27; hard labour, to be followed by indefinite restriction preventing them from leaving a given area without permission. In addressing the court, Kenyatta stated that he and the others did not recognise the judge&#x27;s findings; they claimed that the government had used them as scapegoats as a pretext to shut down KAU. The historian Wunyabari O. Maloba later characterised it as &quot;a rigged political trial with a predetermined outcome&quot;. The government followed the verdict with a wider crackdown, banning KAU in June 1953, and closing down most of the independent schools in the country, including Kenyatta&#x27;s. It appropriated his land at Gatundu and demolished his house.

Kenyatta and the others were returned to Lokitaung, where they resided on remand while awaiting the results of the appeal process. Pritt pointed out that Thacker had been appointed magistrate for the wrong district, a technicality voiding the whole trial; the Supreme Court of Kenya concurred and Kenyatta and the others were freed in July 1953, only to be immediately re-arrested. The government took the case to the East African Court of Appeal, which reversed the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in August. The appeals process resumed in October 1953, and in January 1954 the Supreme Court upheld the convictions against all but Oneko. Pritt finally took the case to the Privy Council in London, but they refused his petition without providing an explanation. He later noted that this was despite the fact his case was one of the strongest he had ever presented during his career. According to Murray-Brown, it is likely that political, rather than legal considerations, informed their decision to reject the case.

===Imprisonment: 1954–1961===

During the appeal process, a prison had been built at Lokitaung, where Kenyatta and the four others were then interned. The others were made to break rocks in the hot sun but Kenyatta, because of his age, was instead appointed their cook, preparing a daily diet of beans and posho. In 1955, P. de Robeck became the District Officer, after which Kenyatta and the other inmates were treated more leniently. In April 1954, they had been joined by a captured Mau Mau commander, Waruhiu Itote; Kenyatta befriended him, and gave him English lessons. By 1957, the inmates had formed into two rival cliques, with Kenyatta and Itote on one side and the other KAU members—now calling themselves the &quot;National Democratic Party&quot;—on the other. In one incident, one of his rivals made an unsuccessful attempt to stab Kenyatta at breakfast. Kenyatta&#x27;s health had deteriorated in prison; manacles had caused problems for his feet and he had eczema across his body.

Kenyatta&#x27;s imprisonment transformed him into a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, was the first to publicly call for Kenyatta&#x27;s release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya&#x27;s anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater—a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta&#x27;s plight—released &quot;The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta&quot;, a book which raised the profile of the case. In 1958, Rawson Macharia, the key witness in the state&#x27;s prosecution of Kenyatta, signed an affidavit swearing that his evidence against Kenyatta had been false; this was widely publicised. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had become a symbol of African nationalism across the continent.

His sentence served, in April 1959 Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of Lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961, they had another son, Uhuru, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar. The Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, insisted that it was necessary; in a March 1961 speech, he described Kenyatta an &quot;African leader to darkness and death&quot; and stated that if he were released, violence would erupt.

This indefinite detention was widely interpreted internationally as a reflection of the cruelties of British imperialism. Calls for his release came from the Chinese government, India&#x27;s Nehru, and Tanganyika&#x27;s Prime Minister Julius Nyerere. Kwame Nkrumah—whom Kenyatta had known since the 1940s and who was now President of a newly independent Ghana—personally raised the issue with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and other UK officials, with the Ghanaian government offering Kenyatta asylum in the event of his release. Resolutions calling for his release were produced at the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conferences held in Tunis in 1960 and Cairo in 1961. Internal calls for his release came from Kenyan Asian activists in the Kenya Indian Congress, while a colonial government commissioned poll revealed that most of Kenya&#x27;s indigenous Africans wanted this outcome.

By this point, it was widely accepted that Kenyan independence was inevitable, the British Empire having been dismantled throughout much of Asia and Macmillan having made his &quot;Wind of Change&quot; speech. In January 1960, the British government made its intention to free Kenya apparent. It invited representatives of Kenya&#x27;s anti-colonial movement to discuss the transition at London&#x27;s Lancaster House. An agreement was reached that an election would be called for a new 65-seat Legislative Council, with 33 seats reserved for black Africans, 20 for other ethnic groups, and 12 as &#x27;national members&#x27; elected by a pan-racial electorate. It was clear to all concerned that Kenyatta was going to be the key to the future of Kenyan politics.

After the Lancaster House negotiations, the anti-colonial movement had split into two parties, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by Kikuyu and Luo, and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), which was led largely by members of smaller ethnic groups like the Kalenjin and Maasai. In May 1960, KANU nominated Kenyatta as its president, although the government vetoed it, insisting that he had been an instigator of the Mau Mau. KANU then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless Kenyatta was freed. KANU campaigned on the issue of Kenyatta&#x27;s detainment in the February 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes. KANU nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a KADU-led coalition of smaller parties. Kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although he had refused to back either KANU or KADU, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.

===Preparing for independence: 1961–1963===

Renison decided to release Kenyatta before Kenya achieved independence. He thought public exposure to Kenyatta prior to elections would make the populace less likely to vote for a man Renison regarded as a violent extremist. In April 1961, the government flew Kenyatta to Maralal, where he maintained his innocence of the charges but told reporters that he bore no grudges. He reiterated that he had never supported violence or the illegal oathing system used by the Mau Mau, and denied having ever been a Marxist, stating: &quot;I shall always remain an African Nationalist to the end&quot;. In August, he was moved to Gatundu in Kikuyuland, where he was greeted by a crowd of 10,000. There, the colonial government had built him a new house to replace that they had demolished. Now a free man, he travelled to cities like Nairobi and Mombasa to make public appearances.
After his release, Kenyatta set about trying to ensure that he was the only realistic option as Kenya&#x27;s future leader. In August he met with Renison at Kiambu, and was interviewed by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Face to Face&quot;. In October 1961, Kenyatta formally joined KANU and accepted its presidency. In January 1962 he was elected unopposed as KANU&#x27;s representative for the Fort Hall constituency in the legislative council after its sitting member, Kariuki Njiiri, resigned.
Kenyatta traveled elsewhere in Africa, visiting Tanganyika in October 1961 and Ethiopia in November at the invitation of their governments. A key issue facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, alongside Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region and claimed it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta disagreed, insisting the land remain Kenyan, and stated that Somalis in Kenya should &quot;pack up [their] camels and go to Somalia&quot;. In June 1962, Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.

Kenyatta sought to gain the confidence of the white settler community. In 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country&#x27;s exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; Kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a brain drain and skills shortage that would be detrimental to the economy. He was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing Western investment in Kenya&#x27;s economy. Kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them. He was sufficiently successful that several prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election.

In 1962 he returned to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, KANU and KADU representatives met with British officials to formulate a new constitution. KADU desired a federalist state organised on a system they called &quot;Majimbo&quot; with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central Federal Council of Ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term. Renison&#x27;s administration and most white settlers favoured this system as it would prevent a strong central government implementing radical reform. KANU opposed &quot;Majimbo&quot;, believing that it served entrenched interests and denied equal opportunities across Kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government. At Kenyatta&#x27;s prompting, KANU conceded to some of KADU&#x27;s demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office. The new constitution divided Kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and a lower house. It was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several KANU politicians being given ministerial posts. Kenyatta accepted a minor position, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning.

The British government considered Renison too ill at ease with indigenous Africans to oversee the transition to independence and thus replaced him with Malcolm MacDonald as Governor of Kenya in January 1963. MacDonald and Kenyatta developed a strong friendship; the Briton referred to the latter as &quot;the wisest and perhaps strongest as well as most popular potential Prime Minister of the independent nation to be&quot;. MacDonald sped up plans for Kenyan independence, believing that the longer the wait, the greater the opportunity for radicalisation among African nationalists. An election was scheduled for May, with self-government in June, followed by full independence in December 1964.

==Leadership==
===Premiership: 1963–1964===

The May 1963 general election pitted Kenyatta&#x27;s KANU against KADU, the Akamba People&#x27;s Party, and various independent candidates. KANU was victorious with 83 seats out of 124 in the House of Representatives; a KANU majority government replaced the pre-existing coalition. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta was sworn in as prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta&#x27;s government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the Prime Minister, exile being the punishment. Kenyatta&#x27;s personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi&#x27;s Delamere Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country&#x27;s National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta&#x27;s speeches under the title of &quot;Harambee!&quot;.
Kenya&#x27;s first cabinet included not only Kikuyu but also members of the Luo, Kamba, Kisii, and Maragoli tribal groups. In June 1963, Kenyatta met with Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio discussed the possibility of merging their three nations (plus Zanzibar) into a single East African Federation, agreeing that this would be accomplished by the end of the year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. Many radical voices in Kenya urged him to pursue the project; in May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.

Continuing to emphasize good relations with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country&#x27;s independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. Throughout Kenyatta&#x27;s rule, many of these individuals remained out of work, unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.

A celebration to mark independence was held in a specially constructed stadium on 12 December 1963. During the ceremony, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh—representing the British monarchy—formally handed over control of the country to Kenyatta. Also in attendance were leading figures from the Mau Mau. In a speech, Kenyatta described it as &quot;the greatest day in Kenya&#x27;s history and the happiest day in my life.&quot; He had flown Edna and Peter over for the ceremony, and in Kenya they were welcomed into Kenyatta&#x27;s family by his other wives.

Disputes with Somalia over the Northern Frontier District (NFD) continued; for much of Kenyatta&#x27;s rule, Somalia remained the major threat to his government. To deal with sporadic violence in the region by Somali &quot;shifta&quot; guerrillas, Kenyatta sent soldiers into the region in December 1963 and gave them broad powers of arrest and seizure in the NFD in September 1964. British troops were assigned to assist the Kenyan Army in the region. Kenyatta also faced domestic opposition: in January 1964, sections of the army launched a mutiny in Nairobi, and Kenyatta called on the British Army to put down the rebellion. Similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighboring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny. He publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasising the need for law and order in Kenya. To prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises. Kenyatta also wanted to contain parliamentary opposition and at Kenyatta&#x27;s prompting, in November 1964 KADU officially dissolved and its representatives joined KANU. Two of the senior members of KADU, Ronald Ngala and Daniel arap Moi, subsequently became some of Kenyatta&#x27;s most loyal supporters. Kenya therefore became a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state.

===Presidency: 1964–1978===

In December 1964, Kenya was officially proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its executive president, combining the roles of head of state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, several constitutional amendments enhanced the president&#x27;s power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if he thought the security of the state was threatened. Seeking the support of Kenya&#x27;s second largest ethnic group, the Luo, Kenyatta appointed the Luo Oginga Odinga as his vice president. The Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of population—still held most of the country&#x27;s important government and administrative positions. This contributed to a perception among many Kenyans that independence had simply seen the dominance of a British elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite.

Kenyatta&#x27;s calls to forgive and forget the past were a keystone of his government. He preserved some elements of the old colonial order, particularly in relation to law and order. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta&#x27;s top officials. Kenyatta&#x27;s government nevertheless rejected the idea that the European and Asian minorities could be permitted dual citizenship, expecting these communities to offer total loyalty to the independent Kenyan state. His administration pressured whites-only social clubs to adopt multi-racial entry policies, and in 1964 schools formerly reserved for European pupils were opened to Africans and Asians.

Kenyatta&#x27;s government believed it necessary to cultivate a united Kenyan national culture. To this end, it made efforts to assert the dignity of indigenous African cultures which missionaries and colonial authorities had belittled as &quot;primitive&quot;. An East African Literature Bureau was created to publish the work of indigenous writers. The Kenya Cultural Centre supported indigenous art and music, and hundreds of traditional music and dance groups were formed; Kenyatta personally insisted that such performances were held at all national celebrations. Support was given to the preservation of historic and cultural monuments, while street names referencing colonial figures were renamed and symbols of colonialism—like the statue of British settler Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere in Nairobi city centre—were removed. The government encouraged the use of Swahili as a national language, although English remained the main medium for parliamentary debates and the language of instruction in schools and universities. The historian Robert M. Maxon nevertheless suggested that &quot;no national culture emerged during the Kenyatta era&quot;, most artistic and cultural expressions reflecting particular ethnic groups rather than a broader sense of Kenyanness, while Western culture remained heavily influential over the country&#x27;s elites.

====Economic policy====

Independent Kenya had an economy heavily molded by colonial rule; agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods. Under Kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by multinational corporations and foreign capital. Kenyatta&#x27;s economic policy was capitalist and entrepreneurial, with no serious socialist policies being pursued; its focus was on achieving economic growth as opposed to equitable redistribution. The government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that Kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development. Under Kenyatta, Western companies regarded Kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment; between 1964 and 1970, large-scale foreign investment and industry in Kenya nearly doubled.
In contrast to his economic policies, Kenyatta publicly claimed he would create a democratic socialist state with an equitable distribution of economic and social development. In 1965, when Thomas Mboya was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a session paper titled &quot;African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya&quot;, in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an &quot;African socialist&quot; economic model. The session proposed a mixed economy with an important role for private capital, with Kenyatta&#x27;s government specifying that it would only consider nationalisation in instances where national security was at risk. Left-wing critics highlighted that the image of &quot;African socialism&quot; portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy.

Kenya&#x27;s agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by Europeans and its commerce and trade by Asians; one of Kenyatta&#x27;s most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control. There was growing black resentment towards the Asian domination of the small business sector, with Kenyatta&#x27;s government putting pressure on Asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with African-owned counterparts. The 1965 session paper promised an &quot;Africanization&quot; of the Kenyan economy, with the government increasingly pushing for &quot;black capitalism&quot;. The government established the Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the Kenya National Assurance Company. In 1965, the government established the Kenya National Trading Corporation to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities, while the Trade Licensing Act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade. During the 1970s, this expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles. Many Asians who had retained British citizenship were affected by these measures. Between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of Kenyan Asians migrated to Britain; in February 1968 large numbers migrated quickly before a legal change revoked their right to do so. Kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving: &quot;Kenya&#x27;s identity as an African country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals.&quot;

Under Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community. Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel. Other businesses they were involved with included ruby mining in Tsavo National Park, the casino business, the charcoal trade—which was causing significant deforestation—and the ivory trade. The Kenyan press, which was largely loyal to Kenyatta, did not delve into this issue; it was only after his death that publications appeared revealing the scale of his personal enrichment. Kenyan corruption and Kenyatta&#x27;s role in it was better known in Britain, although many of his British friends—including McDonald and Brockway—chose to believe Kenyatta was not personally involved.

Despite Kenyatta&#x27;s shortcomings on economic policy, compared with the economic performance of the vast majority of countries in independent Africa, Kenya&#x27;s economic success during Kenyatta&#x27;s tenure was outstanding. During the years following its independence in December, 1963, Kenya attained such a high rate of economic growth that it came to be widely regarded as something of an economic &quot;miracle.&quot; According to World Bank figures, Kenya&#x27;s economy attained an average growth rate of 6.4 percent per year from 1965 to 1980. Among the 40 or more independent countries in sub-Saharan Africa, only 3 exceeded that growth rate; Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Botswana. Kenyatta&#x27;s success can be attributed to his focus on the agricultural sector, particularly on cash crops such as tea and coffee.

====Land, healthcare, and education reform====

The question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in Kenya, having been a major grievance against the British colonialists. As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, Britain&#x27;s government agreed to provide Kenya with £27 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population. To ease this transition, Kenyatta made Bruce McKenzie, a white farmer, the Minister of Agriculture and Land. Kenyatta&#x27;s government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians. The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders. In this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party&#x27;s chief constituency. Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu. Kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including Kenyans from different parts of the country. Voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the MP Jean-Marie Seroney censured the sale of historically Nandi lands in the Rift to non-Nandi, describing the settlement schemes as &quot;Kenyatta&#x27;s colonization of the rift&quot;.

In part fuelled by high rural unemployment, Kenya witnessed growing rural-to-urban migration under Kenyatta&#x27;s government. This exacerbated urban unemployment and housing shortages, with squatter settlements and slums growing up and urban crime rates rising. Kenyatta was concerned by this, and promoted the reversal of this rural-to-urban migration, but in this was unsuccessful. Kenyatta&#x27;s government was eager to control the country&#x27;s trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT&#x27;s permission. There were also measures to Africanise the civil service, which by mid-1967 had become 91% African. During the 1960s and 1970s the public sector grew faster than the private sector. The growth in the public sector contributed to the significant expansion of the indigenous middle class in Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya.
The government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities. In June 1963, Kenyatta ordered the Ominda Commission to determine a framework for meeting Kenya&#x27;s educational needs. Their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in Kenya but argued that the government&#x27;s emphasis should be on secondary and higher education to facilitate the training of indigenous African personnel to take over the civil service and other jobs requiring such an education. Between 1964 and 1966, the number of primary schools grew by 11.6%, and the number of secondary schools by 80%. By the time of Kenyatta&#x27;s death, Kenya&#x27;s first universities—the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta University—had been established. Although Kenyatta died without having attained the goal of free, universal primary education in Kenya, the country had made significant advances in that direction, with 85% of Kenyan children in primary education, and within a decade of independence had trained sufficient numbers of indigenous Africans to take over the civil service.

Another priority for Kenyatta&#x27;s government was improving access to healthcare services. It stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care. In the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions. In 1965, the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children. By Kenyatta&#x27;s death, the majority of Kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period. Before independence, the average life expectancy in Kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second-highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. This improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, Kenya&#x27;s population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time. This put a severe strain on social services; Kenyatta&#x27;s government promoted family planning projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.

====Foreign policy====

In part due to his advanced years, Kenyatta rarely traveled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta&#x27;s cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity&#x27;s Conciliation Commission on the Congo.

Facing the pressures of the Cold War, Kenyatta officially pursued a policy of &quot;positive non-alignment&quot;. In reality, his foreign policy was pro-Western and in particular pro-British. Kenya became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority apartheid regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia. Britain remained one of Kenya&#x27;s foremost sources of foreign trade; British aid to Kenya was among the highest in Africa. In 1964, Kenya and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, one of only two military alliances Kenyatta&#x27;s government made; the British Special Air Service trained Kenyatta&#x27;s own bodyguards. Commentators argued that Britain&#x27;s relationship with Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya was a neo-colonial one, with the British having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence. The historian Poppy Cullen nevertheless noted that there was no &quot;dictatorial neo-colonial control&quot; in Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya.
Although many white Kenyans accepted Kenyatta&#x27;s rule, he remained opposed by white far-right activists; while in London at the July 1964 Commonwealth Conference, he was assaulted by Martin Webster, a British neo-Nazi, at the London Hilton Hotel. Kenyatta&#x27;s relationship with the United States was also warm; the United States Agency for International Development played a key role in helping respond to a maize shortage in Kambaland in 1965. Kenyatta also maintained a warm relationship with Israel, including when other East African nations endorsed Arab hostility to the state; he for instance permitted Israeli jets to refuel in Kenya on their way back from the Entebbe raid. In turn, in 1976 the Israelis warned of a plot by the Palestinian Liberation Army to assassinate him, a threat he took seriously.

Kenyatta and his government were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that &quot;it is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests. That is why we reject Communism.&quot; His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that &quot;Africa is ripe for revolution&quot; was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d&#x27;Affairs &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an educational organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.

====Dissent and the one-party state====

Kenyatta made clear his desire for Kenya to become a one-party state, regarding this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In the first five years of independence, he consolidated control of the central government, removing the autonomy of Kenya&#x27;s provinces to prevent the entrenchment of ethnic power bases. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist quicker economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations, and in 1969 passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which terminated grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.

A major focus for Kenyatta during the first three and a half years of Kenya&#x27;s independence were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta&#x27;s government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Kenyatta condemned the assassination of the prominent leftist politician, although UK intelligence agencies believed that his own bodyguard had orchestrated the murder. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga&#x27;s post—that of party vice president—was divided among eight different politicians, greatly limiting his power and ending his position as Kenyatta&#x27;s automatic successor. Between 1964 and 1966, Kenyatta and other KANU conservatives had been deliberately trying to push Odinga to resign from the party. Under growing pressure, in 1966 Odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he became head of the new Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). In its manifesto, the KPU stated that it would pursue &quot;truly socialist policies&quot; like the nationalisation of public utilities; it claimed Kenyatta&#x27;s government &quot;want[ed] to build a capitalist system in the image of Western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that.&quot; The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country&#x27;s two party system.

The new party was a direct challenge to Kenyatta&#x27;s rule, and he regarded it as a communist-inspired plot to oust him. Soon after the KPU&#x27;s creation, the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution to ensure that the defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta&#x27;s government officially disavowed this violence. KANU retained the support of all national newspapers and the government-owned radio and television stations. Of the 29 defectors, only nine were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as vice president by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.
In July 1969, Mboya—a prominent and popular Luo KANU politician—was assassinated by a Kikuyu. Kenyatta had reportedly been concerned that Mboya, with U.S. backing, could remove him from the presidency, and across Kenya there were suspicions voiced that Kenyatta&#x27;s government was responsible for Mboya&#x27;s death. The killing sparked tensions between the Kikuyu and other ethnic groups across the country, with riots breaking out in Nairobi. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, to open a hospital. On being greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans, he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta&#x27;s bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response to the rise of KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a Kikuyu cultural tradition in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many Kenyans were pressured or forced to swear oaths, something condemned by the country&#x27;s Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundu.

Kenyatta&#x27;s government resorted to un-democratic measures to restrict the opposition. It used laws on detention and deportation to perpetuate its political hold. In 1966, it passed the Public Security (Detained and Restricted Persons) Regulations, allowing the authorities to arrest and detain anyone &quot;for the preservation of public security&quot; without putting them on trial. In October 1969 the government banned the KPU, and arrested Odinga before putting him under indefinite detainment. With the organised opposition eliminated, from 1969, Kenya was once again a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state. The December 1969 general election—in which all candidates were from the ruling KANU—resulted in Kenyatta&#x27;s government remaining in power, but many members of his government lost their parliamentary seats to rivals from within the party. Over coming years, many other political and intellectual figures considered hostile to Kenyatta&#x27;s rule were detained or imprisoned, including Seroney, Flomena Chelagat, George Anyona, Martin Shikuku, and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o. Other political figures who were critical of Kenyatta&#x27;s administration, including Ronald Ngala and Josiah Mwangi Kariuki, were killed in incidents that many speculated were government assassinations.

===Illness and death===

For many years, Kenyatta had suffered health problems. He had a mild stroke in 1966, and a second in May 1968. He suffered from gout and heart problems, all of which he sought to keep hidden from the public. By 1970, he was increasingly feeble and senile, and by 1975 Kenyatta had—according to Maloba—&quot;in effect ceased to actively govern&quot;. Four Kikuyu politicians—Koinange, James Gichuru, Njoroge Mungai, and Charles Njonjo—formed his inner circle of associates, and he was rarely seen in public without one of them present. This clique faced opposition from KANU back-benchers spearheaded by Josiah Mwangi Kariuki. In March 1975 Kariuki was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered, and his body was dumped in the Ngong Hills. After Kariuki&#x27;s murder, Maloba noted, there was a &quot;noticeable erosion&quot; of support for Kenyatta and his government. Thenceforth, when the president spoke to crowds, they no longer applauded his statements.

In 1977, Kenyatta had several further strokes or heart attacks. On 22 August 1978, he died of a heart attack in the State House, Mombasa. The Kenyan government had been preparing for Kenyatta&#x27;s death since at least his 1968 stroke; it had requested British assistance in organising his state funeral as a result of the UK&#x27;s longstanding experience in this area. McKenzie had been employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta&#x27;s death. Britain&#x27;s heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya. African heads of state also attended, including Nyerere, Idi Amin, Kenneth Kaunda, and Hastings Banda, as did India&#x27;s Morarji Desai and Pakistan&#x27;s Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. His body was buried in a mausoleum in the grounds of the Parliament Buildings in Nairobi.

Kenyatta&#x27;s succession had been an issue of debate since independence, and Kenyatta had not unreservedly nominated a successor. The Kikuyu clique surrounding him had sought to amend the constitution to prevent vice president Moi—who was from the Kalenjin people rather than the Kikuyu—from automatically becoming acting president, but their attempts failed amid sustained popular and parliamentary opposition. After Kenyatta&#x27;s death, the transition of power proved smooth, surprising many international commentators. As vice president, Moi was sworn in as acting president for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta—&quot;I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him&quot;—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, land grabbing, and capitalistic ethos that had characterised Kenyatta&#x27;s period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasizing a closer link to the poor. In 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a &quot;de jure&quot; one-party state.

==Political ideology==

Kenyatta was an African nationalist, and was committed to the belief that European colonial rule in Africa must end. Like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of Africa had been used not for the benefit of Africa&#x27;s population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their European homelands. For Kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya&#x27;s white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta&#x27;s &quot;basic philosophy&quot; throughout his life was that &quot;all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes&quot;. Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that &quot;I have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace.&quot; This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda&#x27;s ideology of &quot;African humanism&quot;.

Murray-Brown noted that &quot;Kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments&quot;, while the historian William R. Ochieng observed that &quot;Kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy&quot;. Similarly, Assensoh noted that Kenyatta was &quot;not interested in social philosophies and slogans&quot;. Several commentators and biographers described him as being politically conservative, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology. He pursued, according to Maloba, &quot;a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics&quot;.

Kenyatta biographer Guy Arnold described the Kenyan leader as &quot;a pragmatist and a moderate&quot;, noting that his only &quot;radicalism&quot; came in the form of his &quot;nationalist attack&quot; on imperialism. Arnold also noted that Kenyatta &quot;absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking&quot;. Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in &quot;the importance of authority and tradition&quot;, and that he displayed &quot;a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work&quot;. Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.

===Views on Pan-Africanism and socialism===

While in Britain, Kenyatta made political alliances with individuals committed to Marxism and to radical Pan-Africanism, the idea that African countries should politically unify; some commentators have posthumously characterised Kenyatta as a Pan-Africanist. Maloba observed that during the colonial period Kenyatta had embraced &quot;radical Pan African activism&quot; which differed sharply from the &quot;deliberate conservative positions, especially on the question of African liberation&quot; that he espoused while Kenya&#x27;s leader. As leader of Kenya, Kenyatta published two collected volumes of his speeches: &quot;Harambee&quot; and &quot;Suffering Without Bitterness&quot;. The material included in these publications was carefully selected so as to avoid mention of the radicalism he exhibited while in Britain during the 1930s.

Kenyatta had been exposed to Marxist-Leninist ideas through his friendship with Padmore and the time spent in the Soviet Union, but had also been exposed to Western forms of liberal democratic government through his many years in Britain. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934. As Kenya&#x27;s leader, Kenyatta rejected the idea that Marxism offered a useful framework for analysing his country&#x27;s socio-economic situation. The academics Bruce J. Berman and John M. Lonsdale argued that Marxist frameworks for analysing society influenced some of his beliefs, such as his view that British colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed. Kenyatta nevertheless disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta&#x27;s Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and T. Ras Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive.

Assensoh suggested that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but &quot;became a victim of capitalist circumstances&quot;; conversely, Savage stated that &quot;Kenyatta&#x27;s direction was hardly towards the creation of a radical new socialist society&quot;, and Ochieng called him &quot;an African capitalist&quot;. When in power, Kenyatta displayed a preoccupation with individual and &quot;mbari&quot; land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation. According to Maloba, Kenyatta&#x27;s government &quot;sought to project capitalism as an African ideology, and communism (or socialism) as alien and dangerous&quot;.

==Personality and personal life==

Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he &quot;liked being at the centre of life&quot;, and was always &quot;a rebel at heart&quot; who enjoyed &quot;earthly pleasures&quot;. One of Kenyatta&#x27;s fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as &quot;a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving&quot;. Kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in London took to wearing a fez and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane. He adopted his surname, &quot;Kenyatta&quot;, after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life. As President he collected a variety of expensive cars.

Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to &quot;appear all things to all men&quot;, also displaying a &quot;consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself&quot;, for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union both from members of the British Labour Party and from Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyatta&#x27;s appearance in 1920s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as &quot;an agreeable if somewhat seedy &#x27;Europeanized&#x27; native&quot; and to indigenous Africans as &quot;a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations&quot;.

Simon Gikandi argued that Kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an &quot;Afro-Victorian&quot;, someone whose identity had been shaped &quot;by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions&quot;, especially those of the Victorian era. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivated the image of a &quot;colonial gentleman&quot;; in England, he displayed &quot;pleasant manners&quot; and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could &quot;mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially.&quot; The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city&#x27;s Pan-Africanist movement, he was &quot;the most relaxed, sophisticated and &#x27;westernized&#x27; of the lot of us&quot;. As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as &quot;home&quot; on several occasions. Berman and Lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with &quot;a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard&quot;. Gikandi argued that Kenyatta&#x27;s &quot;identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit&quot;.

Kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor. He had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be &quot;quite unscrupulous, even brutal&quot; in using others to get what he wanted, but he never displayed any physical cruelty or nihilism. Kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white Europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white English woman. He told his daughter &quot;the English are wonderful people to live with in England.&quot; He welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a Kenya in which indigenous Africans, Europeans, Arabs, and Indians could all regard themselves as Kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully. Despite this, Kenyatta exhibited a general dislike of Indians, believing that they exploited indigenous Africans in Kenya.
Kenyatta was a polygamist. He viewed monogamy through an anthropological lens as an interesting Western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life. Murray-Brown characterized Kenyatta as an &quot;affectionate father&quot; to his children, but one who was frequently absent. Kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with Grace Wahu: son Peter Muigai Kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter Margaret Kenyatta (born 1928). Margaret served as mayor of Nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as Kenya&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations from 1976 to 1986. Of these children, it was Margaret who was Kenyatta&#x27;s closest confidante.

During his trial, Kenyatta described himself as a Christian saying, &quot;I do not follow any particular denomination. I believe in Christianity as a whole.&quot; Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta&#x27;s adherence to Christianity was &quot;desultory&quot;. While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta read up on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was &quot;not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible&quot;. Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In &quot;Facing Mount Kenya&quot;, he challenged the missionaries&#x27; dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call &quot;ancestor communion&quot;. In that book&#x27;s dedication, Kenyatta invoked &quot;ancestral spirits&quot; as part of &quot;the Fight for African Freedom.&quot;

==Legacy==

Within Kenya, Kenyatta came to be regarded as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot;, and was given the unofficial title of &quot;Mzee&quot;, a Swahili term meaning &quot;grand old man&quot;. From 1963 until his death, a cult of personality surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked Kenyan nationalism with Kenyatta&#x27;s own personality. This use of Kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names. He came to be regarded as a father figure not only by Kikuyu and Kenyans, but by Africans more widely.

After 1963, Maloba noted, Kenyatta became &quot;about the most admired post-independence African leader&quot; on the world stage, one who Western countries hailed as a &quot;beloved elder statesman.&quot; His opinions were &quot;most valued&quot; both by conservative African politicians and by Western leaders. On becoming Kenya&#x27;s leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the West, and some pro-Western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both Pope Paul VI and from the South Korean government.

In 1974, Arnold referred to Kenyatta as &quot;one of the outstanding African leaders now living&quot;, someone who had become &quot;synonymous with Kenya&quot;. He added that Kenyatta had been &quot;one of the shrewdest politicians&quot; on the continent, regarded as &quot;one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 1945&quot;. Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as &quot;one of the greatest men of the twentieth century&quot;, having been &quot;a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom&quot; whose &quot;brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya&quot;. In 2018, Maloba described him as &quot;one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism&quot;. In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a &quot;pioneer&quot; for being one of the first Kikuyu to write and publish; &quot;his representational achievement was unique&quot;.

===Domestic influence and posthumous assessment===

Maxon noted that in the areas of health and education, Kenya under Kenyatta &quot;achieved more in a decade and a half than the colonial state had accomplished in the preceding six decades.&quot; By the time of Kenyatta&#x27;s death, Kenya had gained higher life expectancy rates than most of Sub-Saharan Africa. There had been an expansion in primary, secondary, and higher education, and the country had taken what Maxon called &quot;giant steps&quot; toward achieving its goal of universal primary education for Kenyan children. Another significant success had been in dismantling the colonial-era system of racial segregation in schools, public facilities, and social clubs peacefully and with minimal disruption.
During much of his life, Kenya&#x27;s white settlers had regarded Kenyatta as a malcontent and an agitator; for them, he was a figure of hatred and fear. As noted by Arnold, &quot;no figure in the whole of British Africa, with the possible exception of [Nkrumah], excited among the settlers and the colonial authorities alike so many expressions of anger, denigration and fury as did Kenyatta.&quot; As the historian Keith Kyle put it, for many whites Kenyatta was &quot;Satan Incarnate&quot;. This white animosity reached its apogee between 1950 and 1952. By 1964, this image had largely shifted, and many white settlers referred to him as &quot;Good Old Mzee&quot;. Murray-Brown expressed the view that for many, Kenyatta&#x27;s &quot;message of reconciliation, &#x27;to forgive and forget&#x27;, was perhaps his greatest contribution to his country and to history.&quot;

To Ochieng, Kenyatta was &quot;a personification of conservative social forces and tendencies&quot; in Kenya. Towards the end of his presidency, many younger Kenyans—while respecting Kenyatta&#x27;s role in attaining independence—regarded him as a reactionary. Those desiring a radical transformation of Kenyan society often compared Kenyatta&#x27;s Kenya unfavourably with its southern neighbour, Julius Nyerere&#x27;s Tanzania. The criticisms that leftists like Odinga made of Kenyatta&#x27;s leadership were similar to those that the intellectual Frantz Fanon had made of post-colonial leaders throughout Africa. Drawing upon Marxist theory, Jay O&#x27;Brien, for instance, argued that Kenyatta had come to power &quot;as a representative of a would-be bourgeoisie&quot;, a coalition of &quot;relatively privileged petty bourgeois African elements&quot; who wanted simply to replace the British colonialists and &quot;Asian commercial bourgeoisie&quot; with themselves. He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.

Providing a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o stated that &quot;here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion&quot;. Ngũgĩ saw Kenyatta as a &quot;twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Zedong, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-shek, a Park Chung Hee, or a Pinochet.&quot; Ngũgĩ was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics. In other areas Kenyatta&#x27;s government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women&#x27;s rights in Kenya.

Assensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with the Ghanaian, Kwame Nkrumah. Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for &quot;initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom&quot;, but at the same time both were &quot;often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.&quot;
In 1991, the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid &quot;the groundwork&quot; for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s.

In its 2013 report, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya accused Kenyatta of using his authority as president to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya. The Kenyatta family is among Kenya&#x27;s biggest landowners.
During the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, where under Kenyatta&#x27;s government they had not regained the land taken by European settlers and more of it had been sold to those regarded as &quot;foreigners&quot;—Kenyans from other tribes. Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyatta&#x27;s patronage in these areas. The violence continued sporadically until 1996, with an estimated 1500 killed and 300,000 displaced in the Rift Valley.

<text>Pacifica Foundation is an American nonprofit organization that owns five independently operated, non-commercial, listener-supported radio stations known for their progressive/liberal political orientation. Its national headquarters adjoins station KPFK in North Hollywood, California.

Pacifica Foundation also operates the Pacifica Network, a program service supplying over 200 affiliated stations with various programs, primarily news and public affairs. It was the first public radio network in the United States and it is also one of the world&#x27;s oldest listener-funded radio network. Programs such as &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and &quot;Free Speech Radio News&quot; have been some of its most popular productions.

==Early history==

Pacifica was founded in 1946 by pacifists E. John Lewis and Lewis Hill. During World War II, both of them had filed for conscientious objector status. After the war, Lewis, Hill and a small group of former conscientious objectors created the Pacifica Foundation in the town of Pacifica, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their first station, KPFA in Berkeley, commenced broadcasting in 1949. By 1977, the network had added WBAI in New York City, KPFK in Los Angeles, WPFW in Washington, DC, and KPFT in Houston.

===FCC v. Pacifica Foundation===

In 1973, one of Pacifica&#x27;s stations, WBAI, broadcast comedian George Carlin&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Words&quot; routine uncensored. Following a listener complaint, Pacifica received a letter of reprimand from the FCC, censuring them for allegedly violating broadcast regulations which prohibited airing indecent material. The foundation took the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation and lost in a 5–4 decision. This became a landmark moment in the history of free speech, and the case continues to define the power of the government over broadcast material it calls indecent.

==Governance==
===Pacifica National Board===
===Local Station Boards===
In two years during a three-year cycle, subscribers and station staff at each station vote to elect the Local Station Board, as required by the Pacifica Foundation bylaws. The local station boards have support and advisory duties for their station. They also elect members from their body to serve on the Pacifica Foundation&#x27;s national board of directors. The full local station board meets monthly, and committees of the local station board meet on both regular and ad hoc bases.

==Internal conflicts==
=== 1990s–2002 ===
For most of its history, Pacifica gave each of its stations independent control of programming. During the 1990s, a major controversy arose over rumors that the Pacifica National Board and national staff were attempting to centralize control of content, to increase audience. The rumors included accusations that the board proposed changing the network&#x27;s funding model away from a reliance exclusively on listener donations and toward a mix of listener donations and corporate foundation funding similar to that of NPR. There were also accusations that the Board was considering selling both KPFA and WBAI in New York City, which operate on commercial-band FM frequencies (94.1 and 99.5, respectively) worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

This led to years of conflict, including court cases, public demonstrations, firings and strikes of station staff, whose common plight inspired creation of Radio4all.net to preserve what they saw as the original spirit of Pacifica. Many listeners of the individual stations, especially KPFA and WBAI, objected to what they saw as an attempt to tone down the overtly left-leaning political content on Pacifica stations. The controversy included highly publicized ideologically-charged disputes between grassroots listener organizations and Mary Frances Berry, a former chairperson of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who chaired Pacifica&#x27;s national board at the time.

The board eventually was embroiled in counter-lawsuits by board members and listener-sponsors and, after global settlement of the lawsuits in November 2001, an interim board was formed to craft new bylaws, which it did in two tumultuous years of national debates among thousands of listener-sponsors and activists, finally giving listener-sponsors the right and responsibility to elect new Local Station Boards at each of the five Pacifica stations. These local boards in turn elect the national board of directors. Aside from some minor changes, the same 2003 bylaws remain in effect today.

=== 2002–2009 ===
Pacifica National News director Dan Coughlin (director) was voted Interim Executive Director of the network in 2002 (the &quot;Interim&quot; was later dropped). The years of internal legal battles and financial mismanagement had taken a toll. In 2005, Coughlin resigned, the network was still largely disorganized, and Pacifica reverted to operating with an interim executive director for most of the year.

In January 2006, Pacifica hired Greg Guma as the next executive director of the Pacifica Foundation. By the end of the year, the Foundation had fully recovered its financial health and had launched two new national programs: &quot;Informativo Pacifica&quot;, a daily Spanish Language newscast, and &quot;From the Vault&quot;, a weekly program drawn from Pacifica&#x27;s extensive audio archives. Pacifica also produced &quot;Informed Dissent&quot;, a ten-week series for the 2006 mid-term elections that drew from talent across the network. Guma left his post in September 2007.

Pacifica&#x27;s National Board unanimously chose former KPFA general manager Nicole Sawaya as the next executive director. Sawaya had been among the staff members fired by the national board in 1999 amidst Pacifica&#x27;s internal crisis. Sawaya began her tenure as executive director in mid-November 2007, but abruptly changed her mind two weeks later. Pacifica historian Matthew Lasar said she &quot;found the level of internecine dysfunction at Pacifica overwhelming, and fled her job.&quot; The Pacifica National Board spent the next several months negotiating with her, and Sawaya resumed her job on March 5, 2008. She resigned effective September 30, citing &quot;dysfunctional&quot; governance and &quot;shoddy and opaque&quot; business practices that had plunged the organization into a financial crisis.

Sawaya&#x27;s departure was followed by major staff layoffs. In 2009, Pacifica Board chair Grace Aaron became interim executive director, former board member LaVarn Williams replaced Lonnie Hicks as chief financial officer, and the national office took control of WBAI in New York. Aaron appointed Williams acting GM of WBAI in May, and Hicks filed a lawsuit against the foundation alleging that he was dismissed because he is African American and a whistleblower.

===Financial situation in the 2010s===
On August 9, 2013, Pacifica interim executive director Summer Reese announced that due to financial problems, Pacifica-owned radio station WBAI-FM in New York was laying off about two-thirds of its staff, effective August 12, 2013. The entire news department was reportedly included in the layoff.

After Pacifica&#x27;s board of directors completed the 2016 board year with the exclusion of 75% of WBAI&#x27;s board representation, it then moved to decertify Pacifica&#x27;s 2016 board elections, which had been won handily by the independent faction not in power. The new 2017 board of directors replaced interim executive director Lydia Brazon with KPFT director Bill Crosier and reinstated WBAI&#x27;s delegation.

On Friday, October 6, 2017, Pacifica lost a $1.8 million settlement over what they claimed was price gouging by Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT), which had been raising antenna rental charges for WBAI at 9% per year for the last 12 years under a 15-year lease WBAI signed in 2005 that did not expire until 2020. The rent was set at more than half a million dollars annually, which Pacifica claimed was approximately 4 times the current market rent for Midtown Manhattan antenna rentals. Pacifica Radio&#x27;s WBAI has housed its transmitter on the Empire State Building since 1966. The 9% annual rental increases were facilitated by the destruction of the twin towers on September 11, 2001, which dramatically reduced space available for comparable antennas. The ruling encumbered all of Pacifica&#x27;s assets including KPFA and KPFB in Berkeley, KPFK in Los Angeles, WPFW in Washington, DC, and KPFT in Houston in addition to WBAI in New York City but does not affect the assets of any of its affiliates. On April 6, 2018, The Pacifica Foundation announced the settlement on a series of agreements that release WBAI, the organization&#x27;s New York radio station, from a court judgment as well as the last two years of its lease at the Empire State Building as of May 31, 2018. The Foundation later completed an agreement to relocate its transmission facility to a new site nearby.

On October 8, 2019, it was announced that WBAI&#x27;s local operations were abruptly shut down. Their programming was superseded by Pacifica Across America: a compilation of work from sister stations and other sources; &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; continued to be broadcast.

The 2019 WBAI shutdown was litigated in the fall of 2019. The New York State Supreme Court ruled in November 2019 that the WBAI shutdown by then-executive director John Vernile was executed &quot;ultra vires&quot; (without the proper authority) and ordered the station re-opened.

==Programs==
===&quot;Democracy Now!&quot;===
A show that for years has been considered the flagship of Pacifica Radio&#x27;s national programming is &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, an independent news organization that covers democracy, human rights and justice issues, and questions the motives of U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Hosted by Amy Goodman and Juan González, this program is a compilation of news, interviews, and documentaries. &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; is heard and seen on more than 700 radio and TV stations across the U.S. including public-access television stations and satellite television channels Free Speech TV and Link TV. WDEV, based in Waterbury, Vermont, is the only commercial radio station in the U.S. that carries the program—even though it is also heard in north-central Vermont over Pacifica affiliate WGDR in Plainfield and its sister station, WGDH in Hardwick.

In 2002, as Pacifica implemented its new listener-sponsor-accountability structure and as Pacifica and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; settled outstanding disputes from previous years, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; spun off with substantial funding from Pacifica to become an independent production.

===Other Pacifica programming: 2000-2006===
The Pacifica network, in addition to extensive community-based productions at its various stations around the United States, also featured a daily newscast &quot;Free Speech Radio News&quot; from 2003-2013. &quot;FSRN&quot; was a radio program founded by Pacifica Reporters Against Censorship, a group of mostly &quot;Pacifica Network News&quot; reporters who went on strike against the Pacifica board policies of the late 1990s. &quot;FSRN&quot; was primarily funded by Pacifica, and includes headlines and news features produced by reporters based around the U.S. and in scores of countries around the world. In September 2013, the board of directors of FSRN issued a lay-off notice to all staff, and confirmed that their last broadcast would take place on September 27, 2013. The board cited financial difficulties as the reason for the decision.

In 2006, Pacifica added two new national programs: &quot;From the Vault&quot; from the Pacifica Radio Archives, a weekly program that thematically repackages archival material, making it relevant to contemporary listeners; and &quot;Informativo Pacifica&quot;, based at KPFK in Los Angeles, a daily Spanish-language newscast that includes reporters from the U.S. and many Latin American countries.

===Initiatives 2007-2008===
* In 2007, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that it would accept new applications for non-commercial radio licenses for the first time in more than a decade. In response, Pacifica joined forces with other advocates for independent media in the &quot;Radio for People&quot; campaign, helping local groups apply for these full-power licenses.
* Pacifica has expanded its schedule of national special broadcasts, distributing more audio documentaries, covering the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales hearings live, and sending production teams to the United States Social Forum and the National Conference for Media Reform.
* Pacifica expanded its offerings in multiple media platforms, using &quot;Web 2.0&quot; technology. In September 2007, one interactive website, KPFA&#x27;s Warcomeshome.org, began to offer hard-hitting stories from reporter Aaron Glantz about the human costs of the Iraq War, as well as innovative ways of contributing to, and distributing information about, the impact of the conflict.
* Pacifica suspended regular programming for three days to air a live broadcast of the Iraq War Winter Soldier event in Silver Spring, Maryland from March 14 through March 16, 2008. The broadcast was co-anchored by journalist Aaron Glantz and KPFA Morning Show host Aimee Allison.

===Recent programming===
Local Pacifica stations produce many programs that are available to network stations and affiliates. These include: &quot;Sprouts&quot;, a weekly showcase of producers and stations around the network, often in documentary format; &quot;Explorations in Science&quot; with Dr. Michio Kaku, a weekly radio program on science, politics, and the environment; Dennis Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoints&quot;, a daily drive-time public affairs program; &quot;Against The Grain&quot; a progressive and radical commentary program; and many other regular programs.

Pacifica also produces a wide variety of special broadcasts, including live coverage of major U.S. Congressional hearings, national mobilizations against war, and other important events, such as the United States Social Forum. Special programs also include news documentaries, holidays and commemorations, and archival audio from the Pacifica Radio Archives.

Pacifica distributes program content via the Audioport system.

==Pacifica Radio Archives==
The Pacifica Radio Archives, housed at station KPFK in Los Angeles, is the oldest public radio archive in the United States documenting more than five decades of grassroots political, cultural, and performing arts history. The archive includes recordings of interviews with John Coltrane, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry, and Langston Hughes, among many others. The Pacifica Radio Archives were featured in their own 30-minute slot on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s (now defunct) &quot;Up All Night&quot; program.

<text>John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1 April 1647 (O.S.) – 26 July 1680 (O.S.)) was an English poet and courtier of King Charles II&#x27;s Restoration court, who reacted against the &quot;spiritual authoritarianism&quot; of the Puritan era. Rochester embodied this new era, and he became as well known for his rakish lifestyle as for his poetry, although the two were often interlinked. He died as a result of a sexually transmitted infection at the age of 33.

Rochester was described by his contemporary Andrew Marvell as &quot;the best English satirist&quot;, and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits. His poetry was widely censored during the Victorian era, but enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards, with reappraisals from noted literary figures such as Graham Greene and Ezra Pound. The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked Rochester&#x27;s libertinism to Hobbesian materialism.

During his lifetime Rochester was best known for &quot;A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind&quot; and it remains among his best-known works today.

==Life==

===Upbringing and teens===
John Wilmot was born at Ditchley House in Oxfordshire on 1 April 1647. His father, Henry, Viscount Wilmot, was created Earl of Rochester in 1652 for his military service to Charles II during the King&#x27;s exile under the Commonwealth. Paul Davis describes Henry as &quot;a Cavalier legend, a dashing bon vivant and war-hero who single-handedly engineered the future Charles II&#x27;s escape to the Continent (including the famous concealment in an oak tree) after the disastrous battle of Worcester in 1651&quot;. His mother, Anne St. John, was a strong-willed Puritan from a noble Wiltshire family.

From the age of seven, Rochester was privately tutored, two years later attending the grammar school in nearby Burford. His father died in 1658, and John Wilmot inherited the title of the Earl of Rochester in April of that year. In January 1660, Rochester was admitted as a Fellow commoner to Wadham College, Oxford, a new and comparatively poor college. Whilst there, it is said, the 13-year-old &quot;grew debauched&quot;. In September 1661 he was awarded an honorary M.A. by the newly elected chancellor of the university, Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, a family friend.
As an act of gratitude towards the son of Henry Wilmot, Charles II conferred on Rochester an annual pension of £500. In November 1661 Charles sent Rochester on a three-year Grand Tour of France and Italy, and appointed the physician Andrew Balfour as his governor. This exposed him to an unusual degree to European (especially French) writing and thought. In 1664 Rochester returned to London, and made his formal début at the Restoration court on Christmas Day.

It has been suggested by a number of scholars that the King took a paternal role in Rochester&#x27;s life. Charles II suggested a marriage between Rochester and the wealthy heiress Elizabeth Malet. Her relatives opposed marriage to the impoverished Rochester, who conspired with his mother to abduct Elizabeth. Samuel Pepys described the attempted abduction in his diary on 28 May 1665:
Thence to my Lady Sandwich&#x27;s, where, to my shame, I had not been a great while before. Here, [I told] her a story of my Lord Rochester&#x27;s running away on Friday night last with Mrs. Mallett, the great beauty and fortune of the North, who had supped at White Hall with Mrs. Stewart, and was going home to her lodgings with her grandfather, my Lord Haly, by coach; and was at Charing Cross seized on by both horse and foot men, and forcibly taken from him, and put into a coach with six horses, and two women provided to receive her, and carried away. Upon immediate pursuit, my Lord of Rochester (for whom the King had spoke to the lady often, but with no successe ) was taken at Uxbridge; but the lady is not yet heard of, and the King mighty angry, and the Lord sent to the Tower.

18-year-old Rochester spent three weeks in the Tower, and was released only after he wrote a penitent apology to the King.

Rochester attempted to redeem himself by volunteering for the navy in the Second Dutch War in the winter of 1665, serving under the Earl of Sandwich. His courage at the Battle of Vågen, serving on board the ship of Thomas Teddeman, made him a war hero. Pleased with his conduct, Charles appointed Rochester a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in March 1666, which granted him prime lodgings in Whitehall and a pension of £1,000 a year. The role encompassed, one week in every four, Rochester helping the King to dress and undress, serve his meals when dining in private, and sleeping at the foot of the King&#x27;s bed. In the summer of 1666, Rochester returned to sea, serving aboard under Edward Spragge. He again showed extraordinary courage in battle, including rowing between vessels under heavy cannon fire, to deliver Spragge&#x27;s messages around the fleet.

Upon returning from sea, Rochester resumed his courtship of Elizabeth Malet. Defying her family&#x27;s wishes, Malet eloped with Rochester again in January 1667, and they were married at the Knightsbridge chapel. They had four children: Lady Anne Wilmot (1669–1703), Charles Wilmot (1671–1681), Lady Elizabeth Wilmot (1674–1757) and Lady Malet Wilmot (1676–1708/1709).

In October 1667, the monarch granted Rochester special licence to enter the House of Lords early, despite his being seven months underage. The act was an attempt by the King to bolster his number of supporters among the Lords.

Teenage actress Nell Gwyn &quot;almost certainly&quot; took him as her lover; she was later to become the mistress of Charles II. Gwyn remained a lifelong friend and political associate, and her relationship with the King gave Rochester influence and status within the Court.

===Twenties and last years===

Rochester&#x27;s life was divided between domesticity in the country and a riotous existence at court, where he was renowned for drunkenness, vivacious conversation, and &quot;extravagant frolics&quot; as part of the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; (as Andrew Marvell described them). The &quot;Merry Gang&quot; flourished for about 15 years after 1665 and included Henry Jermyn; Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset; John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave; Henry Killigrew; Sir Charles Sedley; the playwrights William Wycherley and George Etherege; and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Gilbert Burnet wrote of him that, &quot;For five years together he was continually Drunk ... [and] not ... perfectly Master of himself ... [which] led him to ... do many wild and unaccountable things.&quot; Pepys&#x27;s Diary records one such occasion on 16 February 1669 when Rochester was invited to dine with the King and the Dutch ambassador:

His actions were considered an offence against the King, or a , and he was banned from the court, although the King soon called for his return.

In 1673, Rochester began to train Elizabeth Barry as an actress. She went on to become the most famous actress of her age. He took her as his mistress in 1675. The relationship lasted for around five years, and produced a daughter, before descending into acrimony after Rochester began to resent her success. Rochester wrote afterwards, &quot;With what face can I incline/To damn you to be only mine? ... Live up to thy mighty mind/And be the mistress of mankind&quot;.
When the King&#x27;s advisor and friend of Rochester, George Villiers, lost power in 1673, Rochester&#x27;s standing fell as well. At the Christmas festivities at Whitehall of that year, Rochester delivered a satire to Charles II, &quot;In the Isle of Britain&quot; – which criticized the King for being obsessed with sex at the expense of his kingdom. Charles&#x27;s reaction to this satirical portrayal resulted in Rochester&#x27;s exile from the court until February. During this time Rochester dwelt at his estate in Adderbury. Despite this, in February 1674, after much petitioning by Rochester, the King appointed him Ranger of Woodstock Park.

In June 1675 &quot;Lord Rochester in a frolick after a rant did ... beat downe the dyill (i.e. sundial) which stood in the middle of the Privie Garding, which was esteemed the rarest in Europ&quot;. John Aubrey learned what Rochester said on this occasion when he came in from his &quot;revells&quot; with Charles Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, and Fleetwood Sheppard to see the object: What ... doest thou stand here to fuck time?&#x27; Dash they fell to worke&quot;. It has been speculated that the comment refers not to the dial itself, which was not phallic in appearance, but a painting of the King next to the dial that featured his phallic sceptre. Rochester fled the court again.

Rochester fell into disfavour again in 1676. During a late-night scuffle with the night watch, one of Rochester&#x27;s companions, Roger Downes, was killed by a pike-thrust. Rochester was reported to have fled the scene of the incident, and his standing with the monarch reached an all-time low. Following this incident, Rochester briefly fled to Tower Hill, where he impersonated a mountebank &quot;Doctor Bendo&quot;. Under this persona, he claimed skill in treating &quot;barrenness&quot; (infertility), and other gynaecological disorders. Gilbert Burnet wryly noted that Rochester&#x27;s practice was &quot;not without success&quot;, implying his intercession of himself as a surreptitious sperm donor. On occasion, Rochester also assumed the role of the grave and matronly Mrs. Bendo, presumably so that he could inspect young women privately without arousing their husbands&#x27; suspicions.

===Death===
By the age of 33, Rochester was dying from what is usually described as the effects of tertiary syphilis, gonorrohea, or other venereal diseases, combined with the effects of alcoholism. Carol Richards has disputed this, arguing that it is more likely that he died of renal failure due to chronic nephritis (Bright&#x27;s disease). His mother arranged for him to be attended in his final weeks by her religious associates, particularly Gilbert Burnet, later Bishop of Salisbury.

After hearing of Burnet&#x27;s departure from his side, Rochester muttered his last words: &quot;Has my friend left me? Then I shall die shortly&quot;. In the early morning of 26 July 1680, Rochester died &quot;without a shudder or a sound&quot;. He was buried at Spelsbury church in Oxfordshire.

A deathbed renunciation of libertinism and conversion to Anglican Christianity, &quot;Some Passages of the Life and Death of the Honourable John Wilmot Earl of Rochester&quot;, was published by Reverend Burnet. Because this account appears in Burnet&#x27;s own writings, its accuracy has been disputed by some scholars, who accuse Burnet with having shaped the account of Rochester&#x27;s denunciation of libertinism to enhance his own reputation. On the other hand, Graham Greene, in his biography of Wilmot, calls Burnet&#x27;s book &quot;convincing&quot;.

==Works==

Rochester&#x27;s poetic work varies widely in form, genre, and content. He was part of a &quot;mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease&quot;, who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts, rather than in publication. As a consequence, some of Rochester&#x27;s work deals with topical concerns, such as satires of courtly affairs in libels, to parodies of the styles of his contemporaries, such as Sir Carr Scrope. He is also notable for his impromptus, one of which is a teasing epigram on King Charles II:

To which Charles supposedly replied, &quot;That&#x27;s true, for my words are my own, but my actions are those of my ministers&quot;.

Rochester&#x27;s poetry displays a range of learning and influences. These included imitations of Malherbe, Ronsard, and Boileau. He also translated or adapted from classical authors such as Petronius, Lucretius, Ovid, Anacreon, Horace, and Seneca.

Rochester&#x27;s writings were at once admired and infamous. &quot;A Satyr Against Mankind&quot; (1675), one of the few poems he published (in a broadside in 1679), is a scathing denunciation of rationalism and optimism that contrasts human perfidy with animal wisdom.

The majority of his poetry was not published under his name until after his death. Because most of his poems circulated only in manuscript form during his lifetime, it is likely that much of his writing does not survive. Burnet claimed that Rochester&#x27;s conversion experience led him to ask that &quot;all his profane and lewd writings&quot; be burned; it is unclear how much, if any, of Rochester&#x27;s writing was destroyed.

Rochester was also interested in the theatre. In addition to an interest in actresses, he wrote an adaptation of Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Valentinian&quot; (1685), a scene for Sir Robert Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of China&quot;, a prologue to Elkanah Settle&#x27;s &quot;The Empress of Morocco&quot; (1673), and epilogues to Sir Francis Fane&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Dark&quot; (1675), Charles Davenant&#x27;s &quot;Circe, a Tragedy&quot; (1677). The best-known dramatic work attributed to Rochester, &quot;Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery&quot;, has never been successfully proven to be written by him. Posthumous printings of &quot;Sodom&quot;, however, gave rise to prosecutions for obscenity, and were destroyed. On 16 December 2004 one of the few surviving copies of &quot;Sodom&quot; was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s for £45,600.

&quot;[Rochester&#x27;s] letters to his wife and to his friend Henry Savile ... show an admirable mastery of easy, colloquial prose.&quot;

Scholarship has identified approximately 75 authentic Rochester poems.
Three major critical editions of Rochester in the twentieth century have taken very different approaches to authenticating and organising his canon. David Vieth&#x27;s 1968 edition adopts a heavily biographical organisation, modernising spellings and heading the sections of his book &quot;Prentice Work&quot;, &quot;Early Maturity&quot;, &quot;Tragic Maturity&quot;, and &quot;Disillusionment and Death&quot;. Keith Walker&#x27;s 1984 edition takes a genre-based approach, returning to the older spellings and accidentals in an effort to present documents closer to those a seventeenth-century audience would have received. Harold Love&#x27;s Oxford University Press edition of 1999, now the scholarly standard, notes the variorum history conscientiously, but arranges works in genre sections ordered from the private to the public.

==Reception and influence==
Rochester was the model for a number of rake heroes in plays of the period, such as Don John in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;The Libertine&quot; (1675) and Dorimant in George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode&quot; (1676). Meanwhile he was eulogised by his contemporaries such as Aphra Behn and Andrew Marvell, who described him as &quot;the only man in England that had the true vein of satire&quot;. Daniel Defoe quoted him in &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, and discussed him in other works. Voltaire, who spoke of Rochester as &quot;the man of genius, the great poet&quot;, admired his satire for its &quot;energy and fire&quot; and translated some lines into French to &quot;display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast&quot;.

By the 1750s, Rochester&#x27;s reputation suffered as the liberality of the Restoration era subsided; Samuel Johnson characterised him as a worthless and dissolute rake. Horace Walpole described him as &quot;a man whom the muses were fond to inspire but ashamed to avow&quot;. Despite this general disdain for Rochester, William Hazlitt commented that his &quot;verses cut and sparkle like diamonds&quot; while his &quot;epigrams were the bitterest, the least laboured, and the truest, that ever were written&quot;. Referring to Rochester&#x27;s perspective, Hazlitt wrote that &quot;his contempt for everything that others respect almost amounts to sublimity&quot;. Meanwhile, Goethe quoted &quot;A Satyr against Reason and Mankind&quot; in English in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;. Despite this, Rochester&#x27;s work was largely ignored throughout the Victorian era.

Rochester&#x27;s reputation would not begin to revive until the 1920s. Ezra Pound, in his &quot;ABC of Reading&quot;, compared Rochester&#x27;s poetry favourably to better-known figures such as Alexander Pope and John Milton. Graham Greene characterised Rochester as a &quot;spoiled Puritan&quot;. Although F. R. Leavis argued that &quot;Rochester is not a great poet of any kind&quot;, William Empson admired him. More recently, Germaine Greer has questioned the validity of the appraisal of Rochester as a drunken rake, and hailed the sensitivity of some of his lyrics.

Rochester was listed #6 in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s &quot;Top 30 chart of London&#x27;s most erotic writers&quot;. Tom Morris, the associate director, of the National Theatre said, &quot;Rochester reminds me of an unhinged poacher, moving noiselessly through the night and shooting every convention that moves. Bishop Burnett, who coached him to an implausible death-bed repentance, said that he was unable to express any feeling without oaths and obscenities. He seemed like a punk in a frock coat. But once the straw dolls have been slain, Rochester celebrates in a sexual landscape all of his own.&quot;

==In popular culture==

A play, &quot;The Libertine&quot; (1994), was written by Stephen Jeffreys, and staged by the Royal Court Theatre. The 2004 film &quot;The Libertine&quot;, based on Jeffreys&#x27; play, starred Johnny Depp as Rochester, Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry, John Malkovich as King Charles II and Rosamund Pike as Elizabeth Malet. Michael Nyman set to music an excerpt of Rochester&#x27;s poem &quot;Signor Dildo&quot; for the film.
The play &quot;The Ministry of Pleasure&quot; by Craig Baxter also dramatises Wilmot&#x27;s life and was produced at the Latchmere Theatre, London in 2004.

Rochester is the central character in Anna Lieff Saxby&#x27;s 1996 erotic novella, &quot;No Paradise but Pleasure&quot;.

The story of Lord Rochester&#x27;s life in Susan Cooper-Bridgewater&#x27;s historical fiction &quot;Of Ink, Wit and Intrigue – Lord Rochester in Chains of Quicksilver&quot;, 2014. 

Nick Cave&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;There She Goes, My Beautiful World&quot;, from the album &quot;Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;, includes the lines &quot;John Wilmot penned his poetry / Riddled with the pox&quot;.

Germaine Greer published a piece called &quot;Doomed to Sincerity&quot; about the life of the Earl.

<text>Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group that aims to influence decisions within political, economic, and social institutions. Advocacy includes activities and publications to influence public policy, laws and budgets by using facts, their relationships, the media, and messaging to educate government officials and the public. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes, including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on a specific issue or specific piece of legislation. Research has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States and Canada are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.

== Forms ==

There are several forms of advocacy, each representing a different approach in a way to initiate changes in the society. One of the most popular forms is social justice advocacy. Cohen, de la Vega, and Watson (2001) state that this definition does not encompass the notions of power relations, people&#x27;s participation, and a vision of a just society as promoted by social justice advocates. For them, advocacy represents the series of actions taken and issues highlighted to change the &quot;what is&quot; into a &quot;what should be&quot;, considering that this &quot;what should be&quot; is a more decent and a more just society Those actions, which vary with the political, economic and social environment in which they are conducted, have several points in common. For instance, they:

* Question the way policy is administered
* Participate in the agenda-setting as they raise significant issues
* Target political systems &quot;because those systems are not responding to people&#x27;s needs&quot;
* Are inclusive and engaging
* Propose policy solutions
* Open up space for public argumentation

Other forms of advocacy include:

* Budget advocacy: another aspect of advocacy that ensures proactive engagement of Civil Society Organizations with the government budget to make the government more accountable to the people and promote transparency. Budget advocacy also enables citizens and social action groups to compel the government to be more alert to the needs and aspirations of people in general and the deprived sections of the community.
* Bureaucratic advocacy: people considered &quot;experts&quot; have more chance to succeed at presenting their issues to decision-makers. They use bureaucratic advocacy to influence the agenda, although at a slower pace.
* Express versus issue advocacy: These two types of advocacy when grouped together usually refers to a debate in the United States whether a group is expressly making their desire known that voters should cast ballots in a particular way, or whether a group has a long-term issue that isn&#x27;t campaign and election season specific.
* Health, environment and climate change negotiations advocacy: supports and promotes patients&#x27; health care rights as well as enhance community health and policy initiatives that focus on the availability, safety and quality of care.
* Ideological advocacy: in this approach, groups fight, sometimes during protests, to advance their ideas in the decision-making circles. 
* Interest-group advocacy: lobbying is the main tool used by interest groups doing mass advocacy. It is a form of action that does not always succeed at influencing political decision-makers as it requires resources and organization to be effective.
* Legislative advocacy: the &quot;reliance on the state or federal legislative process&quot; as part of a strategy to create change.
* Mass advocacy: any type of action taken by large groups (petitions, demonstrations, etc.)
* Media advocacy: &quot;the strategic use of the mass media as a resource to advance a social or public policy initiative&quot; (Jernigan and Wright, 1996). In Canada, for example, the Manitoba Public Insurance campaigns illustrate how media advocacy was used to fight alcohol and tobacco-related health issues. We can also consider the role of health advocacy and the media in &quot;the enactment of municipal smoking bylaws in Canada between 1970 and 1995.&quot;
* Special education advocacy: advocacy with a &quot;specific focus on the educational rights of students with disabilities.&quot; 
Different contexts in which advocacy is used:
* In a legal/law context: An &quot;advocate&quot; is the title of a specific person who is authorized/appointed in some way to speak on behalf of a person in a legal process. 
* In a political context: An &quot;advocacy group&quot; is an organized collection of people who seek to influence political decisions and policy, without seeking election to public office. 
* In a social care context: Both terms (and more specific ones such as &quot;independent advocacy&quot;) are used in the UK in the context of a network of interconnected organisations and projects which seek to benefit people who are in difficulty (primarily in the context of disability and mental health).
* In the context of inclusion: Citizen Advocacy organisations (or programmes) seek to cause benefit by reconnecting people who have become isolated. Their practice was defined in two key documents: CAPE, and Learning from Citizen Advocacy Programs.

=== Tactics ===
Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink have observed four types of advocacy tactics:
# Information politics: quickly and credibly generating politically usable information and moving it to where it will have the most impact.
# Symbolic politics: calling upon symbols, actions, or stories that make sense of a situation for an audience that is frequently far away. 
# Leverage politics: calling upon powerful actors to affect a situation where weaker members of a network are unlikely to have influence.
# Accountability politics: efforts to hold powerful actors to their previously stated policies or principles.
These tactics have been also observed within advocacy organizations outside the USA.

===Use of the Internet===
Groups involved in advocacy work have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of advocacy-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, suggesting that social media are beneficial to the advocacy community.

=== Other examples ===
Advocacy activities may include conducting an exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief.

== Topics ==

People advocate for a large number and variety of topics. Some of these are clear-cut social issues that are universally agreed to be problematic and worth solving, such as human trafficking. Others—such as abortion—are much more divisive and inspire strongly held opinions on both sides. There may never be a consensus on this latter type of issues, but intense advocacy is likely to remain. In the United States, any issue of widespread debate and deeply divided opinion can be referred to as a social issue. The Library of Congress has assembled an extensive list of social issues in the United States, ranging from vast ones like abortion to same-sex marriage to smaller ones like hacking and academic cheating.

Topics that appear to involve advancing a certain positive ideal are often known as causes. A particular cause may be very expansive in nature — for instance, increasing liberty or fixing a broken political system. For instance in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama utilized such a meaning when he said, &quot;this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause.&quot; Change.org and Causes are two popular websites that allow people to organize around a common cause.

Topics upon which there is universal agreement that they need to be solved include, for example, human trafficking, poverty, water and sanitation as a human right.

&quot;Social issues&quot; as referred to in the United States also include topics (also known as &quot;causes&quot;) intended by their advocates to advance certain ideals (such as equality) include: civil rights, LGBT rights, women&#x27;s rights, environmentalism, and veganism.

== Transnational advocacy ==
Advocates and advocacy groups represent a wide range of categories and support several issues as listed on worldadvocacy.com. The Advocacy Institute, a US-based global organization, is dedicated to strengthening the capacity of political, social, and economic justice advocates to influence and change public policy.

The phenomenon of globalization draws a special attention to advocacy beyond countries’ borders. The core existence of networks such as World Advocacy or the Advocacy Institute demonstrates the increasing importance of transnational advocacy and international advocacy. Transnational advocacy networks are more likely to emerge around issues where external influence is necessary to ease the communication between internal groups and their own government. Groups of advocates willing to further their mission also tend to promote networks and to meet with their internal counterparts to exchange ideas.

Transnational advocacy is increasingly playing a role in advocacy for migrants rights, and migrant advocacy organizations have strategically called upon governments and international organizations for leverage.

Transnational advocates spend time with local interest groups in order to better understand their views and wishes.

<text>John Lloyd Stephens (November 28, 1805October 13, 1852) was an American explorer, writer, and diplomat. He was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of Maya civilization throughout Middle America and in the planning of the Panama railroad.

==Early life==
John Lloyd Stephens was born November 28, 1805, in the township of Shrewsbury, New Jersey. He was the second son of Benjamin Stephens, a successful New Jersey merchant, and Clemence Lloyd, daughter of an eminent local judge. The following year the family moved to New York City. There Stephens received an education in the Classics at two privately tutored schools. At the age of 13, he enrolled at Columbia College, graduating at the top of his class four years later in 1822.

After studying law with an attorney for a year, he attended the Litchfield Law School. He passed the bar exam after completing his course of study and practiced in New York City.

Stephens embarked on a journey through Europe in 1834 and went on to Egypt and the Levant, returning home in 1836. He later wrote several popular books about his travels and explorations.

==Politics==
He was recommended for the post of Minister to the Netherlands in 1837, but President Martin Van Buren nominated Harmanus Bleecker, who served until 1842. In 1846 Stephens was a delegate to the state constitutional convention, where he was responsible for the introduction and adoption of a conciliation court (small claims court).

==Mesoamerican studies==
Stephens read with interest early accounts of ruined cities of Mesoamerica by such writers and explorers as Alexander von Humboldt and Juan Galindo. In 1839, President Martin Van Buren commissioned Stephens as Special Ambassador to Central America. While there the government of the Federal Republic of Central America fell apart in civil war. He later published an account of the events he witnessed in &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatán&quot;.

Stephens and his traveling companion, architect, and draftsman Frederick Catherwood first came across Maya ruins at Copán, having landed in British Honduras (now Belize). They were astonished at their findings and spent two weeks mapping the site. Stephens surmised that it must have been built by some long-forgotten people, as he could not imagine it was the native Mayans. However, Catherwood noted the facial resemblance to modern Mayans. Stephens was able to buy the city of Copan for a sum of $50 and had dreams of floating it down the river and into museums in the United States.

They went on to Palenque, Quiriguá and Uxmal. They reached Palenque on May 11, 1840, and left in early June. While there, they documented the Temple of the Inscriptions, the Temple of the Cross, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Foliated Cross. They continued investigating Maya ruins with a return trip to Yucatán in October 1841. According to Stephens&#x27;s book about the trip, they visited a total of 44 Mayan sites such as Chichen Itza, Izamal, Kabah, the gateway at Labná, Mayapan, Sayil, Tulum, Uxmal, and Xtampak. In Uxmal, they documented the Governor&#x27;s House, the Nunnery Quadrangle, and the Pyramid of the Magician. Catherwood also drew a famous view of the well at Bolonchén.

Catherwood&#x27;s drawings and lithographs showed, without question, the Maya to have been the authors of some of the most artistic and intellectual works of pre-Columbian America. Besides large constructions, they produced works of artistic refinement such as stone and plaster sculptures, frescoes, painted pottery, and bas-reliefs in wood. As a result of their explorations, Stephens and Catherwood argued convincingly that the Mayans built the ancient Central American cities in contrast to the theory that ethnic groups from European or Asian civilizations had built them.

Stephens&#x27;s books served to inspire Edgar Allan Poe, who reviewed three of Stephens&#x27;s books for the &quot;New York Review&quot; and &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

==Panama Railroad Company==

At the time England enjoyed a monopoly over the ocean navigation to and from the United States. Stephens obtained a charter from the state of New York and incorporated the Ocean Steam Navigation Company. The company acquired two steamships, the &quot;Washington&quot; and the &quot;Hermann&quot; which made journeys to Europe.

After the Panama Railroad Company was founded in 1849, Stephens visited Panama and New Granada to make arrangements for the laying of the railroad. On his way to Bogotá, the capital of New Granada, he fell off his mule and sustained severe injuries from which he never fully recovered. He returned to the United States and was appointed the first president of the railroad. He remained company president and driving force of the project until his death in 1852.

== Personal life ==
In 1841, Stephens was elected to the American Philosophical Society. While in Panama, he was struck down by malaria in the spring of 1852. He recovered sufficiently to return to New York, only to have a recurrence of the disease. He died October 13, 1852. He was buried at New York City Marble Cemetery.

==Legacy ==
Stephens is the subject of the following works: &quot;Maya Explorer&quot; by Victor Wolfgang von Hagen, first published in 1947, and &quot;Jungle of Stone&quot; by William Carlsen (2016).

<doc id="171160" wikidata="Q498375" url="?curid=171160" title="Porco Rosso">
<text>is a 1992 Japanese animated adventure fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, based on his 1989 manga &quot;Hikōtei Jidai&quot;. The film stars the voices of Shūichirō Moriyama, Tokiko Kato, Akemi Okamura and Akio Ōtsuka. It was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toho. The score was composed by Joe Hisaishi.

The plot revolves around an Italian World War I ex-fighter ace, now living as a freelance bounty hunter chasing &quot;air pirates&quot; in the Adriatic Sea. However, an unusual curse has transformed him into an anthropomorphic pig. Once called Marco Pagot (Marco Rossolini in the American version), he is now known to the world as &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, Italian for &quot;Red Pig&quot;.

A first English-dubbed version was made for Japan Airlines and included in the Ghibli LD Box Set and on the first Region 2 DVD releases in 2002. The film was later redubbed by Walt Disney Home Entertainment and released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States and Canada on February 22, 2005. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on November 21, 2017, under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.

==Plot==

In 1929, Italian World War I fighter ace and bounty hunter Porco Rosso, cursed to have a pig&#x27;s head, defends an ocean liner from airborne pirates. He dines at his friend Gina&#x27;s Hotel Adriano.

The pirates contract American ace Curtis to assist their attacks. Curtis falls in love with Gina but she loves Porco. While Porco is flying to Milan to have his red seaplane serviced, Curtis shoots him down. Porco survives and continues the trip by train with his damaged plane, to Gina&#x27;s irritation. She reminds him there is a warrant for his arrest in Italy.

Porco meets his mechanic Piccolo in Milan. Piccolo&#x27;s sons have emigrated so the work will be done by his young granddaughter Fio. Once Porco&#x27;s plane is finished, Fio joins him on his flight home as cover should the secret police arrest them. They can claim that Porco took Fio hostage to force Piccolo to help. The new fascist government is hiring pirates for their own use, putting Porco out of business.

Curtis proposes to Gina but she says she is waiting for Porco. Porco and Fio are ambushed by the pirates, and Curtis challenges Porco to a duel. Fio declares that if Porco wins, Curtis must pay his debts owed to Piccolo&#x27;s company, and if Curtis wins, he may marry her.

While Porco is preparing shells, Fio glimpses his true face. Porco tells Fio a story from World War I. Just after Gina&#x27;s wedding to Porco&#x27;s pilot friend Bellini, their squadron was attacked. Porco entered a cloud to evade his pursuers. He blacked out then awakened to complete stillness above the clouds. The airmen who died in the dogfight—Bellini included—rose out of the cloud to fly up towards a band of thousands of planes flying together. After offering in vain to die in Bellini&#x27;s place for Gina&#x27;s sake, he awakened again flying alone low over the sea. He concludes that he is meant to &quot;fly solo&quot;. Fio rebukes him and kisses his cheek.

Curtis and Porco&#x27;s dogfight devolves into a boxing match when both planes&#x27; guns jam. Porco accuses Curtis of being a womanizer; Curtis responds that Porco is worse; Fio adores him, and Gina is waiting on him to the exclusion of any other, but he does not reciprocate. The combatants knock each other out and fall into the shallow water. Gina calls out to Porco, who rises first and is declared the winner. She warns that the Italian air force is on its way, and invites everyone to regroup at her hotel. Porco requests Gina look after Fio and turns away. Fio gives Porco a kiss.

Porco volunteers to lead the air force away and invites Curtis to join him. As they walk to their planes, Curtis catches a glimpse of Porco&#x27;s face and says he has changed; he asks to get a better look and is refused. As she flies in a jet seaplane, Fio narrates the epilogue: Porco outflew the Italian air force and remained at large; Fio became president of the Piccolo aircraft company; Curtis became a famous actor, and the pirates continued to attend the Hotel Adriano in their old age. She says that whether Gina&#x27;s hope for Porco Rosso was ever realized is their secret. A red seaplane is docked by Gina&#x27;s garden as Fio flies over the hotel.

==Cast==


The French dub of the film stars Jean Reno as Porco.

==Production==
The film was originally planned as a short in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s manga &quot;The Age of the Flying Boat&quot;, but grew into a feature-length film. The outbreak of war in Yugoslavia cast a shadow over production and prompted a more serious tone for the film, which had been set in Dalmatia. The airline remained a major investor in the film and showed it as an in-flight film well before its theatrical release. Due to this, the opening text introducing the film appears simultaneously in Japanese, Italian, Korean, English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, French, and German. Telecom Animation Film Co., Ltd. helped animate the film.

As with Miyazaki&#x27;s other films, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack. For the soundtrack, Tokiko Kato performs &quot;The Time of Cherries&quot; as well as an original song, &quot;Once in a While, Talk of the Old Days&quot;.

==History, geography and politics==

Marco is an Italian hero from the First World War and is shown fighting against Austro-Hungarian fighter planes in a flashback sequence. The story is set in Northern Italy, including Milan, and the Italian and Croatian Adriatic Sea east coast. Some locations resemble certain islands of the Italian Lakes. The concealed beach Porco uses as a hideout bears a strong resemblance to Stiniva Beach, on the southern side of the Croatian island of Vis.

Miyazaki shed light on the political context of the making of the film in an interview with &quot;Empire&quot;. He reflects that the conflicts that broke out during the film&#x27;s production (such as those in Dubrovnik and elsewhere) made &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; a much more complicated and difficult film.

Evident historical and political realism aside, at least one scholar has argued that the film&#x27;s more overt historical references can be understood as representative of &quot;wakon yōsai&quot; (; &quot;Japanese spirit, Western learning&quot;)—a tendency, since the Meiji period, for Japanese artists to paint Europe as spectacular, while simultaneously maintaining the distance necessary to preserve a distinct sense of Japanese identity. &quot;In Porco Rosso,&quot; states academic Chris Wood, &quot;Europe is tamed, rendered as a charming site of pleasurable consumption, made distant and viewed through a tourist gaze.&quot;

==Homage to early aviation==
The fictional &quot;Piccolo&quot; aircraft company depicted in the film is based on the Italian aircraft manufacturers Caproni and Piaggio. The jet shown in the last scene is very similar in concept to the Caproni C-22J, an aircraft designed by Carlo Ferrarin, a designer for Caproni, whose name is notably used in the film for Marco&#x27;s Air Force pilot friend. The jet-amphibian also has a V-tail, slightly reminiscent of the Magister jet trainer. The Savoia-Marchetti S.55, Fiat C.R.20 and Macchi M.39 are featured in the movie.

Porco&#x27;s air-force friend Ferrarin was inspired by the Italian Air Force pilot Arturo Ferrarin who flew with an Ansaldo SVA.9 from Rome to Tokyo in 1920. Additionally, the Caproni Ca.309 light reconnaissance aircraft, known as the &quot;Ghibli&quot;, was the namesake for Miyazaki&#x27;s and Takahata&#x27;s animation studio.

Porco&#x27;s plane is named after the Savoia S.21, but is based on the Macchi M.33. While in Piccolo&#x27;s engine shop, the engine to be used in Porco&#x27;s rebuilt Savoia S.21 also has the word &quot;Ghibli&quot; visible on its rocker covers—in design it is a narrow-angle V-12 engine, similar in form to racing engines of the period. Piccolo mentions that it was used in a racing aeroplane for the Schneider Trophy race in the year before.

In the early 1930s, Italian seaplane designers set world speed records (such as the Macchi M.C.72 designed by the Italian airplane designer Mario Castoldi). One of the test pilots killed during the attempt to set the speed record was named Bellini, the name given to Porco&#x27;s pilot friend in the film. Italian top fighter aces Francesco Baracca and Adriano Visconti also appear in the film.

Marco Pagot, the real name of the main character, is also a homage to the Pagot brothers, pioneers of Italian animation (Nino and Toni Pagot were the authors of the first Italian animated feature film, &quot;The Dynamite Brothers&quot;, and Nino&#x27;s son and daughter Marco and Gi Pagot were Miyazaki&#x27;s collaborators in the production of &quot;Sherlock Hound&quot;).

Meanwhile, the character of Curtis is likely to have been named after the American aviation pioneer Glenn Hammond Curtiss who, along with the Wright Brothers, founded the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Curtis&#x27; airplane is a Curtiss R3C, which was built for the 1925 Schneider Cup race (which Porco refers to when he first meets Curtis). His character is also an oblique reference to Ronald Reagan, in that his ambitions lie not only in Hollywood, but also the Presidency. The rest of Curtis&#x27; character appears to come directly from the adventure film heroes portrayed by Errol Flynn at this time—indeed, they share a jaw line—including his buccaneering derring-do, willingness to fight, and overall demeanour combined with romantic ardour.
In 2017, Miyazaki and producer Toshio Suzuki collaborated with Setouchi Seaplanes, a Japanese company flying Kodiak 100 seaplanes in Japan&#x27;s Seto Inland Sea area, to design a special edition &quot;L’ala Rossa&quot; livery for Kodiak 100-0143.

Miyazaki revisited the theme of aviation history in his 2013 film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;.

==Release==
The film was released in Japan on July 18, 1992, by Toho and was released on VHS by Tokuma Shoten in 1993. The movie was later reissued on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Studios Japan) on April 23, 1999, and was released on DVD on December 18, 2002. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on November 6, 2013, with a reissue of the DVD following on July 16, 2014.

Japan Airlines commissioned an English dub that was produced in Japan in 1992 for viewing on international flights. The dub was supervised by Ward Sexton, who also starred as Porco. Although Sexton felt the project was too big for an English-speaking cast in Japan, Studio Ghibli insisted he be in charge. The dub was included in the 1996 Ghibli ga Ippai Laserdisc Box Set and on the 2002 Japanese DVD release of the film, both of which are out of print.

Walt Disney Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on February 22, 2005, and on Blu-ray on February 3, 2015, both with a new English dub featuring the voices of Michael Keaton, Cary Elwes, Susan Egan, and Kimberly Williams-Paisley, which is included on most international releases as well as the 2014 Japanese DVD reissue. This dub was supervised by Tony Bancroft and written by frequent Ghibli dub screenwriters Don and Cindy Hewitt. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on November 21, 2017, under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.

Wilson McLachlan, of the &quot;Left Field Cinema&quot;, considered it &quot;the most underrated film from the Studio Ghibli catalogue.&quot; Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Miyazaki smooshes fantasy and history into a pastel-pretty yarn as irresistible as his feminism.&quot; Robert Pardi of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, stating: &quot;Miyazaki pays homage to Hollywood’s wartime adventure films in this masterwork built around the adventures of a high-flying pig ... This animated feature&#x27;s visual splendor is matched by a droll screenplay that takes a sty-side view of heroism ... Seamlessly adapted for American audiences by Donald H. Davis and Cindy Hewitt Davis, this spoof/pastiche of old-movie cliches also soars as a paean to the redeeming power of friendship and loyalty.&quot;

==Possible sequel==
In 2011, Miyazaki said that he wanted to make a follow-up anime to the 1992 original film if his next few films following &quot;Ponyo&quot; were successful. The film&#x27;s working name was &quot;Porco Rosso: The Last Sortie&quot;; it was to have been set during the Spanish Civil War with Porco appearing as a veteran pilot. Miyazaki was to create the sequel, although the studio has since indicated that the sequel is not in their current plans.

<text>The Autochrome Lumière was an early color photography process patented in 1903 by the Lumière brothers in France and first marketed in 1907. Autochrome was an additive color &quot;mosaic screen plate&quot; process. It was one of the principal color photography processes in use before the advent of subtractive color film in the mid-1930s. A competing process was that of the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky.

Prior to the Lumière brothers, Louis Ducos du Hauron utilized the separation technique to create colour images on paper with screen plates, producing natural colours through superimposition, which would become the foundation of all commercial colour photography. Descendants of photographer Antoine Lumière, inventors Louis and Auguste Lumière utilized Du Hauron&#x27;s (1869) technique, which had already been improved upon by other inventors such as John Joly (1894) and James William McDonough (1896), making it possible to print photographic images in colour. One of the most broadly used forms of colour photography in the early twentieth century, autochrome was recognized for its aesthetic appeal.


== Structure and use ==

Autochrome is an additive color &quot;mosaic screen plate&quot; process. The medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange, green, and blue-violet (a variant of the standard red, green, and blue additive colors); the grains of starch act as color filters. Lampblack fills the spaces between grains, and a black-and-white panchromatic silver halide emulsion is coated on top of the filter layer.

Unlike ordinary black-and-white plates, the Autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion. The use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light, parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive. Because of the light loss due to all the filtering, Autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films, which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects. The plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency that is, the plate was first developed into a negative image but not &quot;fixed&quot;, then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed, then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed, producing a positive image.

The luminance filter (silver halide layer) and the mosaic chrominance filter (the colored potato starch grain layer) remained precisely aligned and were distributed together, so that light was filtered in situ. Each starch grain remained in alignment with the corresponding microscopic area of silver halide emulsion coated over it. When the finished image was viewed by transmitted light, each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter, allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain, recreating the original proportions of the three colors. At normal viewing distances, the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye, reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains.

== Manufacturing techniques ==
To create the Autochrome color filter mosaic, a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer. The dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye. They were then spread onto the adhesive, creating a layer with approximately 4,000,000 grains per square inch but only one grain thick. The exact means by which significant gaps and overlapping grains were avoided still remains unclear. It was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion, because the grains would be flattened slightly, making them more transparent, and pressed into more intimate contact with each other, reducing wasted space between them. As it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once, a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time. Lampblack was used to block up the slight spaces that remained. The plate was then coated with shellac to protect the moisture-vulnerable grains and dyes from the water-based gelatin emulsion, which was coated onto the plate after the shellac had dried. The resulting finished plate was cut up into smaller plates of the desired size, which were packaged in boxes of four. Each plate was accompanied by a thin piece of cardboard colored black on the side facing the emulsion. This was to be retained when loading and exposing the plate and served both to protect the delicate emulsion and to inhibit halation.

The 1906 U.S. patent describes the process more generally: the grains can be orange, violet, and green, or red, yellow, and blue (or &quot;any number of colors&quot;), optionally with black powder filling the gaps. Experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues, including the addition of screen plates, a yellow filter designed to balance the blue, and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light.

== Viewing techniques ==
Because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished Autochrome image very dark overall, bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results.

Stereoscopic Autochromes were especially popular, the combined color and depth proving to be a bewitching experience to early 20th-century eyes. Usually of a small size, they were most commonly viewed in a small hand-held box-type stereoscope. Larger, non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a diascope, which was a folding case with the Autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side, and a mirror framed into the other side. The user would place the diascope near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the Autochrome, and the resulting back-lit, dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror. Slide projectors, then known as magic lanterns and stereopticons, were a less common but especially effective display technique, more suitable for public exhibitions. Projection required an extremely bright and therefore hot light source (a carbon arc or a 500-watt bulb were typical) and could visibly &quot;fry&quot; the plate if continued for more than two or three minutes, causing serious damage to the color. Many surviving Autochromes suffer from such &quot;tanning&quot; and conventional projection is not a recommended means of displaying these irreplaceable images today.

However, a projector-like optical system (i.e., using condenser lenses for illumination, with a viewing lens in place of the projection lens), employing daylight (not direct sunlight) for the light source, can produce comparably excellent visual results—although for only one viewer at a time—without the hazards of actual projection.

The use of a &quot;light box&quot; or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing Autochromes, can damage the plates as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation. The slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering (the effect seen through a glass of water into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed) is exacerbated, and the use of artificial light—especially fluorescent light—upsets the color rendition of a system which the Lumière Brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight.Making modern film or digital copies of Autochromes introduces other problems, because a color system based on red, green, and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange, green, and blue-violet system, providing further opportunities for color degradation. Vintage reproductions of Autochromes in old books and magazines have often been noticeably hand-adjusted by the photoengravers in an effort to compensate for some of the difficulties of reproduction, and as a result, they sometimes look more like hand-colored photographs than &quot;natural color&quot; ones. In short, it is very difficult to form an accurate impression of the appearance of any Autochrome image without seeing the original &quot;in person&quot; and correctly illuminated.

The lamination of the grains, varnish, and emulsion makes autochrome plates susceptible to deterioration with each layer being vulnerable to changes in environment such as moisture, oxidation, cracking, or flaking as well as physical damage from handling; solutions involve conservative lighting conditions, chemical-free materials, medium-range humidity control of between 63 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit in a well integrated preservation plan.

== Artistic considerations ==
If an Autochrome was well made and has been well preserved, color values can be very good. The dyed starch grains are somewhat coarse, giving a hazy, pointillist effect, with faint stray colors often visible, especially in open light areas such as skies. The smaller the image, the more noticeable these effects are. Autochrome has been touted as &quot;the colour of dreams.&quot; The resulting &quot;dream-like&quot; impressionist quality may have been one reason behind the enduring popularity of the medium even after more starkly realistic color processes had become available.

Although difficult to manufacture and fairly expensive, Autochromes were relatively easy to use and were immensely popular among enthusiastic amateur photographers, at least among those who could bear the cost and were willing to sacrifice the convenience of black and white hand-held snapshots.&quot; Autochromes failed to sustain the initial interest of more serious &quot;artistic&quot; practitioners, largely due to their inflexibility. Not only did the need for diascopes and projectors make them extremely difficult to publicly exhibit, they allowed little in the way of the manipulation much loved by &quot;aficionados&quot; of the then-popular Pictorialist approach.

== Advent of film-based versions ==

Autochromes continued to be produced as glass plates into the 1930s, when film-based versions were introduced, first Lumière Filmcolor sheet film in 1931, then Lumicolor roll film in 1933. Although these soon completely replaced glass plate Autochromes, their triumph was short-lived, as Kodak and Agfa soon began to produce multi-layer subtractive color films (Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu respectively). Nevertheless, the Lumière products had a devoted following, above all in France, and their use persisted long after modern color films had become available. The final version, Alticolor, was introduced in 1952 and discontinued in 1955, marking the end of the nearly fifty-year-long public life of the Autochrome.

== Important autochrome collections ==
Between 1909 and 1931, a collection of 72,000 autochrome photographs, documenting life at the time in 50 countries around the world, was created by French banker Albert Kahn. The collection, one of the largest of its kind, is housed in The Albert Kahn Museum (Musée Albert-Kahn) on the outskirts of Paris. A new compilation of images from the Albert Kahn collection was published in 2008.
The National Geographic Society made extensive use of autochromes and other mosaic color screen plates for over twenty years. 15,000 original Autochrome plates are still preserved in the Society&#x27;s archives. The collection contains unique photographs, including numerous autochromes from Paris by Auguste Léon from 1925 and by W. Robert Moore from 1936 just before WWII.

In the U.S. Library of Congress&#x27;s huge collection of American Pictorialist photographer Arnold Genthe&#x27;s work, 384 of his autochrome plates were among the holdings as of 1955.

The George Eastman Museum in Rochester, N.Y. has an extensive collection of early colour photography, including Louise Ducos Du Hauron&#x27;s earliest autochrome images and materials used by the Lumière brothers.

Bassetlaw Museum in Retford, Nottinghamshire holds a collection of over 700 autochromes by Stephen Pegler. This includes a collection of over 100 plates purchased by the museum in 2017 thanks to the generosity of local individuals and organisations. The images cover a range of subjects from still lifes, posed studies, local people and landscapes, and his travels abroad, and were taken between 1910 and the early 1930s. The Pegler collection of autochromes is thought to be the largest collection of autochromes by one photographer in Britain today.

The Royal Horticultural Society, UK has among the earliest colour photographs of plants and gardens taken by amateur photographer William Van Sommer (1859–1941), including of RHS Garden Wisley taken around 1913.

==Commercial use==
One of the first books published with color photography used this technique. The 12 volumes of &quot;Luther Burbank: His Methods and Discoveries, Their Practical Application&quot; included 1,260 color photographs and a chapter on how this process worked.

In the early 1900s Ethel Standiford-Mehling was an experimental photographer and artist and owner of the Standiford Studio in Louisville, Kentucky. She was commissioned by Louisville artist and art patron Eleanor Belknap Humphrey to create an autochrome diascope of her two oldest children. Both the autochrome photograph of the Humphrey children and the diascope mirror viewing device, which closes into itself in a leather-bound case similar in size and appearance to a book, are well preserved and still viewable in 2015. Ethel Standiford-Mehling later moved her Louisville enterprise Standiford Studios to Cleveland, Ohio, and it is not known if any other examples of her autochrome diascopes still exist.

Vladimír Jindřich Bufka was a pioneer and popularizer of Autochrome in Bohemia.

== Neo-Autochromists ==

There has been a revival of interest in the process by some, including a few groups in France working with original Lumière machinery and notes. One such recreation is a series of images from 2008 by the French photographer Frédéric Mocellin.
The British multimedia artist Stuart Humphryes has helped popularise the medium via his autochrome enhancement work in magazines, newspapers, and online platforms, with over 200,000 followers on his autochrome enhancement Twitter feed

*The 2006 film &quot;The Illusionist&quot; tried to recreate the look of Autochrome, although apparently basing that &quot;look&quot; on published reproductions rather than on actual Autochrome plates.
*Modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a Bayer filter, which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an Autochrome plate—by breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements. In physical arrangement, however, the Bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the Autochrome era, such as the Paget and Finlay plates.

<text>Hayley Dee Westenra (born 10 April 1987) is a New Zealand classical crossover singer. Her first internationally released album, &quot;Pure&quot;, reached number one on the UK classical charts in 2003 and has sold more than two million copies worldwide, making it one of the fastest selling albums in her country&#x27;s history.

She is one of the youngest UNICEF Ambassadors to date.

Westenra has sung in English, Māori, Irish, Welsh, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Portuguese, Latin, Japanese, Standard Mandarin Chinese, Catalan, and Taiwanese Hokkien.

==Early life==
Westenra was born on 10 April 1987 at Christchurch Women&#x27;s Hospital in Christchurch, New Zealand. Her parents, Gerald and Jill Westenra, have other children. Sophie is an academic and teaches law at Oxford. Westenra&#x27;s grandmother Shirley Ireland was a singer, and her grandfather was a pianist who also played the piano accordion. She has Irish, Dutch and English heritage.

She began performing at age six in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher said she was &quot;pitch perfect&quot; and encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; soon after she learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, and was often given male parts. Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour.

==Career==
===2000–2002: Debut===
At the age of 12, Westenra entered a professional recording studio to record &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;, a demo album originally created for friends and family, with 70 copies made; they soon made 1000 more copies, and attracted attention from a journalist with Canterbury Television, who asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as &quot;My Gift to You&quot;, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Malvina Major.

===2003–2004: &quot;Pure&quot;===
Westenra attracted worldwide attention when she signed with Decca Records and recorded &quot;Pure&quot;, a CD of classical, light pop, and traditional Māori songs. &quot;Pure&quot; became the fastest-selling international debut album in the history of the UK classical chart, with 19,068 copies purchased in its first week alone, quickly reached No. 1 on the British charts, and entered the UK Album Chart at number 8. Over two million copies of &quot;Pure&quot; have been sold to date. In New Zealand, &quot;Pure&quot; has been certified 12 times platinum, making her the best-selling artist, regardless of genre, in the country&#x27;s history. In 2004 Westenra recorded the end-title song for the Disney movie &quot;Mulan II&quot;. They also featured her in the national Radio Disney music education tour for middle-school students. Later that year, she was featured in the song &quot;Bridal Ballad&quot; recorded for the movie &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

Westenra was the 2004 Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards winner of &quot;Highest Selling New Zealand Album&quot; and &quot;International Achievement Award&quot;. On 20 February 2004, Prime Minister Helen Clark awarded her for being the first New Zealand artist to receive the tenfold platinum status in the New Zealand market, where she held the number one artist position for 18 weeks. She has won two Japanese Grammies for her work (Song of the Year, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and Album of the Year, &quot;Pure&quot;). Her version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was used as the theme song for the popular Japanese drama, &quot;Shiroi Kyotō&quot; (The White Tower). Westenra met the cast of the series during a promotional tour of Japan in October 2003.

Also in 2004, she began her world tour of New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the UK and the US, performing in a concert in November for Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Charles, Prince of Wales, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and President George W. Bush. In her autobiography, she remembered feeling more nervous in an audition where she sight read to Andrew Lloyd Webber an unreleased piece that he had written.

After her world tour, Westenra recorded a live DVD, &quot;Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand&quot;, featuring duets with baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes and soprano Sophie Westenra in St. James Theatre. David Horn, the producer of her live TV special, which aired on the PBS program &quot;Great Performances&quot;, said, &quot;Her singing is so gorgeous, it&#x27;s reminiscent of the great boy-soprano sound of Anglican church choirs.&quot; She joined the Boston Pops Orchestra as guest soloist for their Christmas tour at the end of 2004.
===2005–2007: &quot;Odyssey&quot;; touring with Il Divo; &quot;Treasure&quot;; and Celtic Woman===
On 5 September 2006, Westenra was named as one of the ten outstanding young people in the world by the Junior Chamber International, becoming the first New Zealander so honoured. On 13 November 2006, she participated in the dedication of the New Zealand War Memorial in London, performing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, the national anthems of the UK and New Zealand. Three of Westenra&#x27;s great-uncles served in World War II; one was killed.

In August 2006, Westenra joined Celtic Woman and is featured on their second major DVD/CD album, &quot;Celtic Woman: A New Journey&quot;, which was released 30 January 2007 and immediately hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 music chart at number four. She toured with the group in the United States in 2007, with scheduled appearances in 88 venues across the country; the tour ended in June. During this time, Westenra alternated with Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, who had recently returned from maternity leave, to maintain a five-member line-up. She considered that the toughest tour she had been on to date, and wrote in her second biography that she preferred having control of her own schedule as a solo performer. 
Westenra&#x27;s third international album, &quot;Treasure&quot;, was released on 26 February 2007 in the UK. All the songs on this CD were chosen by Westenra, who gave her record company &quot;no say in the matter.&quot; She said, &quot;I basically didn&#x27;t let them in on what I was recording until the last minute so they had no choice. I didn&#x27;t give them much room to disagree.&quot;

Tracks on this album include &quot;E Pari Ra&quot;, &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, &quot;Let Me Lie&quot;, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, and &quot;Abide with Me&quot;. Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name &quot;Celtic Treasure&quot;. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: &quot;I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there&#x27;s even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like &quot;Danny Boy&quot; from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It&#x27;s this legacy of music that she&#x27;s been passing down to me since my childhood, and it&#x27;s many of these beautiful old songs that I&#x27;ve explored here on my album.&quot;

On the day before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 2007, she performed as part of Celtic Woman for President George W. Bush at the White House. She had plans to present the president with a petition to place a mandatory carbon cap on the United States. The goal of the petition was compliance with the commitment made by President Bill Clinton in previous years to follow the Kyoto Protocol.

Also in 2007, Westenra&#x27;s vocals were featured in the soundtracks of the movie &quot;Flood&quot; and the television series, &quot;Jekyll&quot;, composed by Debbie Wiseman, in the UK. In November 2007, Westenra successfully staged a Japan &quot;Treasure&quot; concert tour in Fukuoka, Sapporo, Tokyo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Yokohama, Hiroshima.

<doc id="171163" wikidata="Q572180" url="?curid=171163" title="The Book of Five Rings">
<text>is a text on &quot;kenjutsu&quot; and the martial arts in general, written by the Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi around 1645. Many translations have been made, and it has garnered broad attention in East Asia and throughout the world. For instance, some foreign business leaders find its discussion of conflict to be relevant to their work. The modern-day Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy.

Musashi establishes a &quot;no-nonsense&quot; theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one&#x27;s opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on-one duel or a massive battle. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to &quot;investigate this thoroughly&quot; through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading.

Musashi describes and advocates a two-sword fencing style (&quot;nitōjutsu&quot;): that is, wielding both &quot;katana&quot; and &quot;wakizashi&quot;, contrary to the more traditional method of wielding the katana two-handed. However, he only explicitly describes wielding two swords in a section on fighting against many adversaries. The stories of his many duels rarely refer to Musashi himself wielding two swords, although, since they are mostly oral traditions, their details may be inaccurate. Musashi states within the volume that one should train with a long sword in each hand, thereby training the body and improving one&#x27;s ability to use two blades simultaneously.

== The five books ==


&quot;Go Rin No Sho&quot; are the teachings which Musashi preached to his students in his own dōjō. Though ideas are taken from other sources, the text is predominantly seminal. The five &quot;books&quot; refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle, just as there are different physical elements in life, as described by Buddhism, Shinto, and other Eastern religions. The five books below are Musashi&#x27;s descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements.

The term &quot;Ichi School&quot; refers to &quot;Niten No Ichi Ryu&quot; or &quot;Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;Two Heavens, One School&quot;. Alternative translations include: &quot;Two Swords, One Spirit&quot;, and &quot;Two Swords, One Entity&quot;. The translation, &quot;Two Swords, One Dragon&quot; was thought to be a misinterpretation of the Kanji word &quot;Ryu&quot;.

* The Book of Earth chapter serves as an introduction, and metaphorically discusses martial arts, leadership, and training as building a house.
* The Book of Water chapter describes Musashi&#x27;s style, &quot;Ni-ten ichi-ryu&quot;, or &quot;Two Heavens, One Style&quot;. It describes some basic technique and fundamental principles.
* The Book of Fire chapter refers to the heat of battle, and discusses matters such as different types of timing.
* The Book of Wind chapter is something of a pun, since the Japanese character for &quot;wind&quot; can also mean &quot;style&quot; (such as, of martial arts). It discusses what Musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting.
* The Book of the Void chapter is a short epilogue, describing, in more esoteric terms, Musashi&#x27;s (probably) Zen-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset.

=== The Book of Earth===

The Earth book, according to &quot;Go Rin No Sho&quot;, refers expressly to the strategy taught by Musashi at the Ichi School. It is said to be how to distinguish the Way through &quot;Sword-Fencing&quot;, or &quot;Swordsmanship&quot;. The idea of strategy would be encouraged to be very astute in their study and strategy:

Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things. As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground... These things cannot be explained in detail. From one thing, know ten thousand things. When you attain the Way of Strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see. You must study hard.

Upon their mastery of the strategy and timing listed in the five books, Musashi states that people will be able to defeat ten men as easily as they could defeat one, and asks: &quot;When you have reached this point, will it not mean that you are invincible?&quot;

The strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics, such as indoor weapons. Musashi states that the use of glaive-like naginata and spears are purely for the field, whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments, such as on horseback or in fierce battle.

Musashi also remarks on the gun as having no equal on the battlefield, until swords clash, when it becomes useless. He does note that the gun had the disadvantage of being unable to see a bullet and adjust aim as one would with a bow. He writes: &quot;The bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle, especially battles on a moor, as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen. However, it is unsatisfactory in sieges, or when the enemy is more than forty yards away. For this reason there are nowadays few traditional schools of archery. There is little use for this kind of skill.&quot;

One of the principles of the Niten Ichi-ryū is that one should be versed in many weaponry skills. Musashi indicates that during battle one should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly, since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in one&#x27;s style after countless uses of the same weapon.

Timing, as explained by Musashi, is the core principle in strategy which is listed in &quot;Earth&quot;. The idea of timing as explained within the book is that one must be able to adapt one&#x27;s strategy to timing with your skill, in that one must know when to attack and when not to attack.

In &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; he writes on timing:

Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in rhythm only if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts, shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and abilities there is timing... There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, in his thriving and declining, in his harmony and discord. Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and fall of capital. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this. In strategy there are various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing, first seeing the distance timing and the background timing. This is the main thing in strategy. It is especially important to know the background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.

The Book of Earth ends with nine basic principles – the &quot;ground&quot; upon which the samurai must rely. These are &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;worldly,&quot; each intended to help develop an understanding of strategy (while the other books focus on tactics and movement). These rules are for his students, and are complemented by the 21 &quot;spiritual principles&quot; for all to follow, which are found in the &quot;Dokkōdō&quot; (Musashi&#x27;s final work). The principles are:

# &quot;Do not think dishonestly.&quot;
# &quot;The Way is in training.&quot;
# &quot;Become acquainted with every art.&quot;
# &quot;Know the Ways of all professions.&quot;
# &quot;Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters.&quot;
# &quot;Develop an intuitive judgement and understanding for everything.&quot;
# &quot;Perceive those things which cannot be seen.&quot;
# &quot;Pay attention even to trifles.&quot;
# &quot;Do nothing which is of no use.&quot;

=== The Book of Water ===

The water book concerns strategy, spirituality and philosophy. The meaning of &quot;water&quot; in relation to life is &quot;flexibility&quot;. Water demonstrates natural flexibility as it changes to conform with the boundaries which contain it, seeking the most efficient and productive path. So also should one possess the ability to change in accordance with one&#x27;s own situation to easily shift between disciplines, methods, and options when presented with new information. A person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility.

The spiritual bearing in strategy, which Musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of, or in formulation of a battle. Being a Buddhist, most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness, tranquility and spiritual balance:

In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm.

This balance refers to what could be thought of as yin and yang within one person. The over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by Musashi, as it would be seen to reveal one&#x27;s spirituality to one&#x27;s enemy. The idea is that a perfectly balanced spirit is also a perfectly balanced physical presence, and neither creates weakness nor reveals it to an enemy.

During battle, the spirituality and balance is something of which Musashi notes that one should take advantage. Since small people know the spirituality of big people, they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other. This is something which seems easy, but it is said to change when one is on the battlefield, as then one must know to both adjust one&#x27;s spiritual balance according to the surrounding environment, and to perceive the balance of others to take advantage accordingly.

Just as one&#x27;s spirit should be balanced, one&#x27;s various techniques be honed to a perfectly balanced demeanor. In terms of stance, much like balance within the trooper, Musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy, or battle: &quot;Adopt a stance with the head erect, neither hanging down, nor looking up, nor twisted.&quot; This is part of what Musashi notes as &quot;wedging in&quot;.

In regards to the gaze of someone, he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably, which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect. He notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy, as well as being able to see things which are close, such as the technique of an enemy. It is also used to perceive things far away, such as arriving troops or enemies, as that is the precursor to battle. One can then change one&#x27;s actions according to what one sees.

==== Attitudes of swordsmanship ====

# Upper
# Middle
# Lower
# Right Side
# Left Side

The five attitudes of swordsmanship are referred to as the five classifications of areas for attack on the human body. These are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy, and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where, for any reason, they should not be able to strike them, and adjust accordingly.

Your attitude should be large or small according to the situation. Upper, Lower and Middle attitudes are decisive. Left Side and Right Side attitudes are fluid. Left and Right attitudes should be used if there is an obstruction overhead or to one side. The decision to use Left or Right depends on the place.

As each is thought of as an attitude, it could be thought of that Musashi means to practice with each &quot;attitude&quot; so that you do not become over-reliant upon one, something which Musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique.

&quot;No Attitude&quot; refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the &quot;Five Attitudes&quot; and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique, as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes. This is similar to taking chances as opposed to making chances.

The attitude of &quot;Existing – Non Existing&quot;, mixes the Five Attitudes with the Attitude of &quot;No Attitude&quot;, meaning that the user of the longsword uses the techniques and principles of both at whichever moment is most opportune.

&quot;In-One Timing&quot; refers to the technique of biding one&#x27;s time until a suitable gap can be found in the enemies&#x27; defense, to which one will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy. Although this is said to be difficult, Musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses. It is rumored that Musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a &quot;bokken&quot;, but there are no descriptions mentioning &quot;In one&quot; timing.

&quot;Abdomen Timing of Two&quot; refers to feinting an attack, then striking an enemy as they are retreating from the attack, hitting them in the abdomen with the correct timing of either two moves or two seconds. Although the technique seems relatively simple, Musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly.

&quot;No Design, No Conception&quot; refers to &quot;When word and actions are spontaneously the same&quot;. Aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning, the technique is relatively simple to explain: if you are in a deadlock with the enemy, using the force from the cut, you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the &quot;Void Book&quot; to knock the enemy over.

This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must train hard to understand it.

&quot;Flowing Water Cut&quot; technique is relevant to a fight with an enemy of a similar level in swordsmanship. When attacking fast, Musashi notes that one will always be at stalemate, so like stagnant water, one must cut as slowly as possible with the long sword. At the beginning of this technique, both combatants will be searching for an opening within each other&#x27;s defense. When the opponent either tries to push off the sword, or to hasten back as to disengage it, you must first expand your whole body and your mind. By moving your body first and then that of your sword, you will be able to strike powerfully and broadly with a movement that seems to reflect the natural flow of water. Ease and confidence will be attained when this technique is continuously practiced upon.

&quot;Continuous Cut&quot; refers to when you are again faced with stalemate within a duel, where your swords are clasped together. In one motion, when your sword springs away from theirs, Musashi says to use a continuous motion to slash their head, body, and legs.

&quot;Fire and Stone&#x27;s Cut&quot; refers to when swords clash together. Without raising the sword, cut as strongly as possible. This means cutting quickly with hands, body, and legs.

&quot;Red Leaves Cut&quot; refers to knocking down the enemy&#x27;s long sword in the spirit of the &quot;No Design, No Conception&quot; cut.

=== The Book of Fire ===

The &quot;Fire Book&quot; refers to fighting methods unlike the specific fighting techniques listed in the &quot;Water Book&quot;. It goes into a broader scope in terms of hints as to assess a situation, as well as specific situational instructions.

He notes obvious advantages of armor and preparedness before a duel or battle as it applies to one man or a whole group of men:

As one man can defeat ten men, so can one thousand men defeat ten thousand. However, you can become a master of strategy by training alone with a sword, so that you can understand the enemy&#x27;s stratagems, his strength and resources, and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to beat ten thousand enemies.

The dependence of location according to the &quot;Go Rin No Sho&quot; is crucial. You must be in a place where man-made objects such as buildings, towers, castles, and such do not obstruct your view, as well as facing or standing in a position where the sun or moon does not affect your vision. This is purely so that your vision is focused on nothing but the enemy, and thus there is more concentration upon the enemy&#x27;s stratagems. Musashi also seems to note the age old strategy of the High Ground:

You must look down on the enemy, and take up your attitude on slightly higher places.

Other kinds of tactics which of Musashi tells are way of ensuring that the enemy is at a disadvantage. Forcing yourself on the non-dominant side of a trooper is one way because the left side is difficult for a right-handed soldier. Other disadvantages, such as forcing enemies into footholds, swamps, ditches, and other difficult terrain, force the enemy to be uncertain of his situation.

These things cannot be clearly explained in words. You must research what is written here. In these three ways of forestalling, you must judge the situation. This does not mean that you always attack first; but if the enemy attacks first you can lead him around. In strategy, you have effectively won when you forestall the enemy, so you must train well to attain this.

&quot;Ken No Sen&quot; (Attacking) is the most obvious method of forestalling an enemy because a head-on collision forces both parties to a standstill. Although it is not mentioned, Musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper.

As the name suggests, &quot;Tai No Sen&quot; (Waiting for the Initiative) is invented for very opportunistic and decided battles between parties. The main idea being to feign weakness as to open a weak spot, or Achilles&#x27; heel, in the opposing force, and then regrouping to exploit such a hole by attacking deep within the enemy&#x27;s party. Although it is not mentioned, this would most likely be to kill the officer of the highest rank as an attempt to remove the tactical centre of a group of soldiers. A method particularly useful for Musashi or others, if attacking a general directly would signal the end of the battle upon his defeat.

Only a small amount of text is written about &quot;Tai Tai No Sen&quot; (Accompanying and Forestalling). Albeit very confusing, the idea of Tai Tai No Sen is circumventing an ambush or quick attack from the enemy by taking the initiative and attacking in full force. Musashi admits himself that this is a difficult thing to explain.

Although there are other methods, they are mostly situational methods relating to the crossing of rough terrain, and battling within such rough terrain. Although it spreads over two or more paragraphs, most information is common sense, relating to caution and avoidance of such situations.

The idea of timing, as with singular battles, is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants. However, the type of timing in this instance is somewhat different from the timing noted in &quot;The Ground Book&quot; since this variety of timing requires looking at the various physical factors which affect an enemy during battle, such as determining if strength is waning or rising within a group of troopers.

The idea of treading down the sword is a very simple technique. Squashing an enemy&#x27;s attack before it starts by using a form of charging and then attacking under the veil of gunpowder smoke, and arrow fire, the initial attacks used when starting battles can be highly effective. Individually, it refers to attacking the enemy&#x27;s sword, breaking it, removing it from play, and a technique of controlling it through direct blade on blade contact.

Just as Musashi mentions in his philosophical style, there is a cause for a collapse. As there is collapse within an enemy, such as waning in his numbers, Musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage.

He notes that an enemy&#x27;s formation can fall if they lose rhythm. It was known that in such battles, drummers drummed a tune for their other fellow soldiers to march to; and, if the rhythm was lost, it led to a &quot;collapse when their rhythm becomes deranged&quot;.

=== The Book of Wind ===
Whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today, this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time. The broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding one&#x27;s own way is to understand the way of one&#x27;s opponent as precisely as possible.

Musashi notes that although most schools have secret and ancient strategies, most forms are derivative of other martial arts. Their similarities and differences evolved through situational factors, such as indoor or outdoor dueling, and the style adapted to the school. He indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own, and, in a way, he does not see parallels to his own creation and work. However, he still admits that without basic understanding of these alternate techniques, one will not be able to learn &quot;Ni Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;, probably for reasons of finding the wrongs in other techniques, and righting them within yourself in &quot;Ni Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;.

The main difference that Musashi notes between the Ichi School and other strategists and schools is that other schools do not teach the &quot;broader&quot; meaning of strategy. There is a strategy above sword-fencing: &quot;Some of the world&#x27;s strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing, and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body.&quot; The book has many paragraphs on the subject of other schools&#x27; techniques, and much of the text lists the ways that other schools do not conform to the ideals which he himself writes about in the &quot;Book of Five Rings&quot;, such as footwork, sight, and over-reliance or over-familiarity with a weapon.

=== The Book of Void ===

Although short, the void book lists, philosophically, the nature of both human knowledge and other things. The void book expressly deals with &quot;That which cannot be seen&quot;.

By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist.

The &quot;Book of Nothing&quot;, according to Musashi, is the true meaning of the strategy of &quot;Ni Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;. It seems very esoteric in nature because he emphasizes that people must learn to perceive that which they cannot understand or comprehend. He notes that in this Void, what can be comprehended are things which we do and see, such as the way of the warrior, martial arts, and &quot;Ni Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;. At the same time, in the Void, things we do not do or see (which he calls &quot;Spirit&quot;) are part of the information which we perceive on a conscious level, but with which we have no physical relationship. It is arguable whether Musashi is referring to religious spirituality or if he is actually explaining a way to live a life and to process thoughts.

In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.

In the above quote, Musashi speaks of &quot;virtue and no evil&quot;. This may mean &quot;goodness and banishment of evil&quot; or &quot;purpose and non-existence of good and evil&quot;, and the exact meaning is open to debate.

Since Musashi is drawing upon classical Buddhist Five Element theory, Void in this case refers to Sunyata (in Pali), sometimes translated as &quot;Emptiness&quot;, or &quot;ether&quot;. Void, as such, is also empty of the sense of self (anatta), good and evil, wanting and non-wanting, and is the spiritual dynamic that forms the jumping off point to satori, enlightenment. Emptiness, and the establishing of the conditions that allow it to arise, is a common theme in Zen Buddhist meditation practice, which informed the perspective of the author.

<text>Clyfford Still (November 30, 1904 – June 23, 1980) was an American painter, and one of the leading figures in the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, who developed a new, powerful approach to painting in the years immediately following World War II. Still has been credited with laying the groundwork for the movement, as his shift from representational to abstract painting occurred between 1938 and 1942, earlier than his colleagues like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, who continued to paint in figurative-surrealist styles well into the 1940s.

==Biography==
Still was born in 1904 in Grandin, North Dakota and spent his childhood in Spokane, Washington and Bow Island in southern Alberta, Canada. In 1925 he visited New York, briefly studying at the Art Students League. He attended Spokane University from 1926 to 1927 and returned in 1931 with a fellowship, graduating in 1933. That fall, he became a teaching fellow, then faculty member at Washington State College (now Washington State University), where he obtained his Master of Fine Arts degree in 1935 and taught until 1941. He spent the summers of 1934 and 1935 at the Trask Foundation (now Yaddo) in Saratoga Springs, New York.

In 1937, along with Washington State colleague Worth Griffin, Still co-founded the Nespelem Art Colony that produced hundreds of portraits and landscapes depicting Colville Indian Reservation Native American life over the course of four summers.

In 1941 Still relocated to the San Francisco Bay area where he worked in various war industries while pursuing painting. He had his first solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) in 1943. He taught at the Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), now Virginia Commonwealth University, from 1943 to 1945, then went to New York City.

Mark Rothko, whom Still had met in California in 1943, introduced him to Peggy Guggenheim, who gave him a solo exhibition at her gallery, The Art of This Century Gallery, in early 1946. The following year Guggenheim closed her gallery and Still, along with Rothko and other Abstract Expressionists, joined the Betty Parsons gallery.

Still returned to San Francisco, where he became a highly influential professor at the California School of Fine Arts (now San Francisco Art Institute), teaching there from 1946 to 1950. He encouraged some of his students to open a gallery called Metart, which was short-lived but influential. In 1950, he moved to New York City, where he lived most of the decade, the height of Abstract Expressionism, but also a time when he became increasingly critical of the art world. In the early 1950s, Still severed ties with commercial galleries. In 1961 he moved to a 22-acre farm near Westminster, Maryland, removing himself further from the art world. Still used a barn on the property as a studio during the warm weather months. In 1966, Still and his second wife purchased a 4,300-square-foot house at 312 Church Street in New Windsor, Maryland, about eight miles from their farm, where he lived until his death.

==Family life==
Still married Lillian August Battan &quot;circa&quot; 1930. They had two daughters, born in 1939 and 1942. The couple separated in the late 1940s and divorced in 1954. In 1957, Still married Patricia Alice Garske, who had been one of his students at Washington State and was sixteen years his junior.

==Paintings==

Having developed his signature style in San Francisco between 1946 and 1950 while teaching at the California School of Fine Arts, Still is considered one of the foremost Color Field painters – his non-figurative paintings are non-objective, and largely concerned with juxtaposing different colors and surfaces in a variety of formations. Unlike Mark Rothko or Barnett Newman, who organized their colors in a relatively simple way (Rothko in the form of nebulous rectangles, Newman in thin lines on vast fields of color), Still&#x27;s arrangements are less regular. In fact, he was one of the few painters who combined practices of Color Field paintings with that of Gestural, Action Paintings. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been &quot;torn&quot; off the painting, revealing the colors underneath. Another point of departure with Newman and Rothko is the way the paint is laid on the canvas; while Rothko and Newman used fairly flat colors and relatively thin paint, Still uses a thick impasto, causing subtle variety and shades that shimmer across the painting surfaces. His large mature works recall natural forms and natural phenomena at their most intense and mysterious; ancient stalagmites, caverns, foliage, seen both in darkness and in light lend poetic richness and depth to his work. By 1947, he had begun working in the format that he would intensify and refine throughout the rest of his career – a large-scale color field applied with palette knives. Among Still&#x27;s well known paintings is &quot;1957-D No. 1,&quot; 1957 (right), which is mainly black and yellow with patches of white and a small amount of red. These four colors, and variations on them (purples, dark blues) are predominant in his work, although there is a tendency for his paintings to use darker shades.

==Exhibitions==
In 1943, Still&#x27;s first solo show took place at the San Francisco Museum of Art. In 1947, Jermayne MacAgy, assistant director of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, gave him a solo show there. The artist then declined all public exhibitions from 1952 to 1959. A first comprehensive Still retrospective took place at the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, in 1959. Later solo exhibitions of Still&#x27;s paintings were presented by the Institute of Contemporary Art of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1963 and at the Marlborough-Gerson gallery, New York, in 1969 to 1970. In 1975, a permanent installation of a group of his works opened at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 1979, New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the largest survey of Still&#x27;s art to date and the largest presentation afforded by this institution to the work of a living artist.

==Awards==
Still received the Award of Merit for Painting in 1972 from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he became a member in 1978, and the Skowhegan Medal for Painting in 1975.

==Estate and museum==
Still wrote a will in 1978 that left a portion of his work, along with his archives, to his wife Patricia and stated: &quot;I give and bequeath all the remaining works of art executed by me in my collection to an American city that will agree to build or assign and maintain permanent quarters exclusively for these works of art and assure their physical survival with the explicit requirement that none of these works of art will be sold, given, or exchanged but are to be retained in the place described above exclusively assigned to them in perpetuity for exhibition and study.&quot; After Still&#x27;s death in 1980, the Still collection of approximately 2,400 works was sealed off completely from public and scholarly access for more than twenty years.
In August 2004, the City of Denver, Colorado announced it had been chosen by Patricia Still to receive the artworks contained within the Clyfford Still Estate (roughly 825 paintings on canvas and 1575 works on paper – drawings and limited-edition fine-art prints). The Clyfford Still Museum, an independent nonprofit organization, opened under the directorship of Dean Sobel in November 2011. The museum also houses the complete Still archives of sketchbooks, journals, notebooks, the artist&#x27;s library, and other archival materials, inherited upon Patricia Still&#x27;s death in 2005.

The building was designed by Allied Works Architecture, led by Brad Cloepfil. The museum is recognized as a successful implementation of contemporary architecture and an icon for the city of Denver. From January 24 to April 17, 2016, the Denver Art Museum hosted a temporary exhibit called &quot;Case Work&quot;, which showcased the design process used for this museum and other major works by Allied and Cloepfil. After Denver, the exhibit was planned to show at the Portland Art Museum and then embark on a two-year international tour.

In March 2011, a Maryland court with jurisdiction over Patricia Still&#x27;s estate ruled that four of Still&#x27;s works could be sold before they officially became part of the museum&#x27;s collection. In November 2011, Sotheby&#x27;s in New York sold the four works; &quot;PH-351&quot; (1940) for US$1.2 million, &quot;1947-Y-No. 2&quot; (1947) for US$31.4 million, &quot;1949-A-No. 1&quot; (1949) for US$61.7 million and &quot;PH-1033&quot; (1976) for US$19.6 million. The proceeds from the sales, US$114 million, went to the Clyfford Still Museum &quot;to support its endowment and collection-related expenses.&quot; In the decade prior to the sale, only 11 of Still&#x27;s works came up at auction. The Clyfford Still Museum opened on November 18, 2011.

In December 2011, a visitor to the museum was accused of causing $10,000 worth of damage to Still&#x27;s &quot;1957-J no.2&quot; oil painting.

In 2013, the Clyfford Still Museum Research Center was launched. Its aim is to explore the period of art and history in which the abstract painter worked. Plans include a fellowship program, cross-disciplinary scholarly publications, and research symposia.

==Quotes==

===From Still===

&quot;I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s intolerable to be stopped by a frame&#x27;s edge.&quot;

&quot;I am not interested in illustrating my time. A man&#x27;s &#x27;time&#x27; limits him, it does not truly liberate him. Our age – it is one of science, of mechanism, of power and death. I see no point in adding to its mechanism of power and death. I see no point in adding to its mammoth arrogance the compliment of a graphic homage.&quot;

&quot;How can we live and die and never know the difference?&quot;

===From others===

*&quot;Still makes the rest of us look academic.&quot; --Jackson Pollock
*&quot;His show (at Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s The Art of This Century Gallery in 1946), of all those early shows [Pollock, Rothko, Motherwell], was the most original. A bolt out of the blue. Most of us were still working through images ... Still had none.&quot;--Robert Motherwell
*&quot;When I first saw a 1948 painting of Still&#x27;s ... I was impressed as never before by how estranging and upsetting genuine originality in art can be.&quot;--Clement Greenberg, art critic; &quot;American-Type Painting&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, 1955, p. 58.
*&quot;It was in the mid-1940s that Still asserted himself as one of the most formally inventive artists of his generation.&quot;
:--John Golding, art historian; &quot;Paths to the Absolute&quot;, 2000, Princeton University Press
*&quot;With their crude palette-knifed and troweled surfaces, their immense space, their strong color, their relentless vertical and horizontal expansiveness, Still&#x27;s abstract works project a forcefulness perhaps unequaled in Abstract Expressionist painting.&quot;
:--Stephen Polcari, art historian; &quot;Abstract Expressionism and the Modern Experience&quot;, 1991, Cambridge University Press
*&quot;A singular talent whose dimension will not be fully known in his own lifetime.&quot;--Robert Hughes, former &quot;Time&quot; art critic; &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Prairie Coriolanus&quot;, February 9, 1976

<text>Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world&#x27;s ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation&#x27;s capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.

The name &quot;Nepal&quot; is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley&#x27;s traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world&#x27;s last Hindu monarchy.

The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a federal parliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal Initiative.

== Etymology ==
Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as &quot;Nepal&quot;. The precise origin of the term &quot;Nepāl&quot; is uncertain. &quot;Nepal&quot; appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century AD. An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.

According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called &quot;Ne&quot;, referred to variously as &quot;Ne Muni&quot; or &quot;Nemi&quot;. According to &quot;Pashupati Purāna&quot;, as a place protected by &quot;Ne&quot;, the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as &quot;Nepāl&quot;. According to &quot;Nepāl Mahātmya&quot;, &quot;Nemi&quot; was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati. According to Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that &quot;Adi-Buddha&quot; &quot;Ne&quot; would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of &quot;Ne&quot;, the valley would be called &quot;Nepāl&quot;. According to &quot;Gopalarājvamshāvali&quot;, the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled , Nepal is named after &quot;Nepa&quot; the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which &quot;Nepa&quot; discovered the &quot;Jyotirlinga&quot; of &quot;Pashupatināth&quot; upon investigation, was also named &quot;Ne&quot;.

The &quot;Ne Muni&quot; etymology was rightly dismissed by the early European visitors. Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen proposed that &quot;Nepāla&quot; was a compound of &quot;Nipa&quot; (foot of a mountain) and &quot;-ala&quot; (short suffix for &quot;alaya&quot; meaning abode), and so &quot;Nepāla&quot; meant &quot;abode at the foot of the mountain&quot;. Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen&#x27;s theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either &quot;Newara&quot; is a vulgarism of sanskritic &quot;Nepala,&quot; or &quot;Nepala&quot; is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic; his view has found some support though it does not answer the question of etymology. It has also been proposed that &quot;Nepa&quot; is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of &quot;Ne&quot; (cattle) and &quot;Pa&quot; (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were &quot;Gopalas&quot; (cowherds) and &quot;Mahispalas&quot; (buffalo-herds). Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed &quot;Nepal&quot; originated from Tibeto-Burman roots – &quot;Ne,&quot; of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and &quot;pala&quot; or &quot;bal&quot;, whose meaning is lost entirely.

== History ==
=== Ancient Nepal ===
By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.

After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan. These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in South Asia. Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district. The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border. By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both. Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.

By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic &quot;Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa&quot; and in the post-Vedic &quot;Atharvashirsha&quot; Upanishad. The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name &#x27;Nepal&#x27;. The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts. According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his daughter, Sita.

Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483 BC). Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet, and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha&#x27;s birthplace, the inscriptions on which mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal. Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha&#x27;s visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.

In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty came into power 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; Nepal&#x27;s history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them. In 641, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal. Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire. The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period.

=== Medieval Nepal ===
In the 11th century, a powerful empire of Khas people emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and Uttarakhand of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated , literally 22 states as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; their language, later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India.

In south-eastern Nepal, Simraungarh annexed Mithila around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years, even ruling over Kathmandu for a time. After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the Sens of Makawanpur. In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and Bengal.
In the Kathmandu valley, the Mallas, who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, Jayasthiti Malla introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four Varna system of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to Kirkpatrick, extended from Digarchi or Sigatse in Tibet to Tirhut and Gaya in India. In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern state.

Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century, Nepal remains largely untouched by the Muslim invasion of India that began in the 11th century. The Mughal period saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 &quot;Chaubisi&quot; states. There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by British rule. Gorkha, one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills.

=== Unification, expansion and consolidation (1768–1951) ===
In the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the Battle of Kirtipur, he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.
The Gorkha control reached its height when the Kumaon and Garhwal Kingdoms in the west to Sikkim in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with Tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the Qing Emperor of China to start the Sino-Nepali War compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north. The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the East India Company over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepali War (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of Gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the Sugauli Treaty, under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands.

Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the Kot massacre; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the Rana dynasty, and came to be known as Jung Bahadur Rana. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as &quot;Naya Muluk&quot;, new country). In 1923, the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.

The Hindu practice of Sati, in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her husband, was banned in 1919, and slavery was officially abolished in 1924. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, , economic exploitation and religious persecution.

=== Contemporary history ===
In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of Indian Independence Movement which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India&#x27;s support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, Nepali Congress was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a &quot;partyless&quot; Panchayat system was made to govern Nepal. The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled. The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy censorship. In 1990, the People&#x27;s Movement forced King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy.

In 1996, the Maoist Party started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people&#x27;s republic. This led to the long Nepalese Civil War and more than 16,000 deaths. With the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a massacre in the royal palace, King Birendra&#x27;s brother Gyanendra inherited the throne in 2001 and subsequently assumed full executive powers aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself.

The Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful democratic revolution of 2006; Nepal became a secular state, and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a federal republic, ending its time-honoured status as the world&#x27;s only Hindu kingdom. After a decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly elections, the new constitution was promulgated on 20 September 2015, making Nepal a federal democratic republic divided into seven provinces.
== Geography ==
Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about long and wide, with an area of . It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E. Nepal&#x27;s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth&#x27;s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas. The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world&#x27;s deepest gorges. Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the -long Himalayas, with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.
Nepal is divided into three principal physiographic belts known as &quot;Himal&quot;–&quot;Pahad&quot;–&quot;Terai&quot;. Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including height Mount Everest (&quot;Sagarmāthā&quot; in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world&#x27;s &quot;eight-thousanders&quot; are in Nepal or on its border with Tibet: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu. Pahad is the mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from in altitude, with progression from subtropical climates below to alpine climates above . The Lower Himalayan Range, reaching , is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and &quot;hills&quot; alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above and very low above , where snow occasionally falls in winter. The southern lowland plains or &quot;Terai&quot; bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Terai is the lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Koshi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of the foothills called Sivalik Hills or Churia Range, cresting at , marks the limits of the Gangetic Plain. Broad, low valleys called Inner Terai Valleys () lie north of these foothills in several places.
The Indian plate continues to move north relative to Asia at about per year. This makes Nepal an earthquake-prone zone, and periodic earthquakes that have devastating consequences present a significant hurdle to development. Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment, which flows to the Indian Ocean. Saptakoshi, in particular, carries a huge amount of silt out of Nepal but sees extreme drop in Gradient in Bihar, causing severe floods and course changes, and is, therefore, known as the sorrow of Bihar. Severe flooding and landslides cause deaths and disease, destroy farmlands and cripple the transport infrastructure of the country, during the monsoon season each year.

Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below , the temperate zone , the cold zone , the subarctic zone , and the Arctic zone above . Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. The Himalayas block cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and form the northern limits of the monsoon wind patterns.

=== Biodiversity ===

Nepal contains a disproportionately large diversity of plants and animals, relative to its size. Nepal, in its entirety, forms the western portion of the eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, with notable biocultural diversity. The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal (60 m from sea level in the Terai plains, to 8,848 m Mount Everest) result in a variety of biomes. The Eastern half of Nepal is richer in biodiversity as it receives more rain, compared to western parts, where arctic desert-type conditions are more common at higher elevations. Nepal is a habitat for 4.0% of all mammal species, 8.9% of bird species, 1.0% of reptile species, 2.5% of amphibian species, 1.9% of fish species, 3.7% of butterfly species, 0.5% of moth species and 0.4% of spider species. In its 35 forest-types and 118 ecosystems, Nepal harbours 2% of the flowering plant species, 3% of pteridophytes and 6% of bryophytes.
Nepal&#x27;s forest cover is , 40.36% of the country&#x27;s total land area, with an additional 4.38% of scrubland, for a total forested area of 44.74%, an increase of 5% since the turn of the millennium. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.23/10, ranking it 45th globally out of 172 countries. In the southern plains, Terai–Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion contains some of the world&#x27;s tallest grasses as well as &quot;Sal&quot; forests, tropical evergreen forests and tropical riverine deciduous forests. In the lower hills (700 m – 2,000 m), subtropical and temperate deciduous mixed forests containing mostly S&quot;al&quot; (in the lower altitudes), &quot;Chilaune&quot; and &quot;Katus&quot;, as well as subtropical pine forest dominated by chir pine are common. The middle hills (2,000 m – 3,000 m) are dominated by oak and rhododendron. Subalpine coniferous forests cover the 3,000 m to 3,500 m range, dominated by oak (particularly in the west), Eastern Himalayan fir, Himalayan pine and Himalayan hemlock; rhododendron is common as well. Above 3,500 m in the west and 4,000 m in the east, coniferous trees give way to rhododendron-dominated alpine shrubs and meadows.

Among the notable trees, are the astringent &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, or &quot;neem&quot;, which is widely used in traditional herbal medicine, and the luxuriant &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;, or &quot;peepal&quot;, which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro, and under which Gautam Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.
Most of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest of the lower Himalayan region is descended from the Tethyan Tertiary flora. As the Indian Plate collided with Eurasia forming and raising the Himalayas, the arid and semi-arid Mediterranean flora was pushed up and adapted to the more alpine climate over the next 40–50 million years. The Himalayan biodiversity hotspot was the site of mass exchange and intermingling of the Indian and Eurasian species in the neogene. One mammal species (Himalayan field mouse), two each of bird and reptile species, nine amphibia, eight fish and 29 butterfly species are endemic to Nepal.

Nepal contains 107 IUCN-designated threatened species, 88 of them animal species, 18 plant species and one species of &quot;fungi or protist&quot; group. These include the endangered Bengal tiger, the red panda, the Asiatic elephant, the Himalayan musk deer, the wild water buffalo and the South Asian river dolphin, as well as the critically endangered gharial, the Bengal florican, and the white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle. The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Nepali wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1973 with the enactment of &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973&quot;, was substantially expanded. &quot;Vulture restaurants&quot; coupled with a ban on veterinary usage of diclofenac has seen a rise in the number of white-rumped vultures. The community forestry programme which has seen a third of the country&#x27;s population directly participate in managing a quarter of the total forested area has helped the local economies while reducing human-wildlife conflict. The breeding programmes coupled with community-assisted military patrols, and a crackdown on poaching and smuggling, has seen poaching of critically endangered tigers and elephants as well as vulnerable rhinos, among others, go down to effectively zero, and their numbers have steadily increased. Nepal has ten national parks, three wildlife reserves, one hunting reserve, three Conservation Areas and eleven buffer zones, covering a total area of , or 19.67% of the total land area, while ten wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. Nepal has consistently been ranked as one of the most polluted countries in the world.

== Politics and government ==
===Politics===

Nepal is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. Nepal has been referred as the &#x27;Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal&#x27; since 2015. It has seven national political parties recognised in the federal parliament: Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist), Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, People&#x27;s Socialist Party and Janamat Party. Of the two major parties which both officially espouse democratic socialism, CPN(UML) is considered leftist while Nepali Congress is considered centrist. During most of the brief periods of democratic exercise in the 1950s and the 1990s, Nepali Congress held majority of seats in parliament; CPN (UML) was its competitor in the 1990s. After the Maoists entered the political process in 2006, they emerged as the third largest party. In the aftermath of the 2017 elections, the first one according to the new constitution, NCP, formed by the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) had become the ruling party at the federal level and in six out of seven provinces. After the 2022 general election, the House of Representatives of 2nd Federal parliament was formed as hung parliament and a coalition government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal was formed in December 2022. On 15 July 2024, K. P. Sharma Oli was sworn in as Nepali Prime minister for fourth time. New coalition was formed between Nepali Congress, led by Sher Bahadur Deuba, and UML, led by Oli. The party leaders will take turns as prime ministers for 18 months each until the next general elections in 2027.
In the 1930s, a vibrant underground political movement arose in the capital, birthing Nepal Praja Parishad in 1936, which was dissolved seven years later, following the execution of the four great martyrs. Around the same time, Nepalis involved in the Indian independence movement started organizing into political parties, leading to the birth of Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal. As communism was trying to find its footing, Nepali Congress was successful in overthrowing the Rana regime in 1951 and enjoyed the overwhelming support of the electorate. In the partyless Panchayat system initiated in 1962 by King Mahendra, monarchy loyalists took turns leading the government; political leaders remained underground, exiled or in prison. A communist insurgency was crushed in its cradle in the 1970s, which led to the eventual coalescence of hitherto scattered communist factions under the United Left Front.

After the joint civil resistance launched by the United Left Front and Nepali Congress overthrew the Panchayat in 1990, the Front became CPN (UML), adopted multi-party democracy, and in the brief period, it was in government, introduced welfare programmes that remain popular. After the Maoist Party joined mainstream politics, in the aftermath of the peaceful revolution of 2006, it also adopted multi-party democracy as its official line. The transition period between 2006 and 2015 saw sustained protests from the newly formed ethnocentric nationalist movements, principal among them the Madhes Movement.

=== Government ===

Nepal is governed according to the Constitution of Nepal. It defines Nepal as having multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural characteristics with common aspirations of people living in diverse geographical regions, and being committed to and united by a bond of allegiance to the national independence, territorial integrity, national interest, and prosperity of Nepal.

The Government of Nepal has three branches:
* Executive: The form of governance is a multi-party, competitive, federal democratic republican parliamentary system based on plurality. The President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority in the House of Representatives as Prime Minister, who forms the Council of ministers that exercises the executive power.
* Legislature: The Legislature of Nepal, called the Federal Parliament, consists of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly. The House of Representatives consists of 275 members elected through a mixed electoral system and has a term of five years. The National Assembly, consisting of 59 members elected by provincial electoral colleges, is a permanent house; a third of its members are elected every two years for a six-year term.
* Judiciary: Nepal has a unitary three-tier independent judiciary that comprises the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, headed by the Chief Justice, seven High Courts, one in each province, the highest court at the provincial level, and 77 district courts, one in each district. The municipal councils can convene local judicial bodies to resolve disputes and render non-binding verdicts in cases not involving actionable crime. The actions and proceedings of the local judicial bodies may be guided and countermanded by the district courts.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Nepal is a federal republic comprising 7 provinces. Each province is composed of 8 to 14 districts. The districts, in turn, comprise local units known as urban and rural municipalities. There is a total of 753 local units which includes 6 metropolitan municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan municipalities and 276 municipalities for a total of 293 urban municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities. Each local unit is composed of wards. There are 6,743 wards in total.

The local governments enjoy executive and legislative as well as limited judicial powers in their local jurisdiction. The provinces have unicameral parliamentary Westminster system of governance. The local and provincial governments exercise some absolute powers and some powers shared with provincial or federal government. The district coordination committee, a committee composed of all elected officials from the local governments in the district, has a very limited role.

=== Laws and law enforcement ===

The Constitution of Nepal is the supreme law of the land, and any other laws contradicting it are automatically invalid to the extent of the contradiction. The specific legal provisions are codified as Civil Code and Criminal Code, accompanied by Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code respectively. The Supreme Court is the highest authority in the interpretation of laws and it can direct the parliament to amend or enact new laws as required. The death penalty has been abolished. It recognises marital rape and supports abortion rights. Owing to a rise in sex-selective abortion, however, constraints have been introduced. Nepal is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Conventions/Treaties on the prohibition of Biological, Chemical and Nuclear weapons, International Labour Organization Fundamental Conventions, Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Paris climate accord. Some legal provisions, guided by socio-economic, cultural and religious sensibilities, remain discriminatory. There is gender-based discrimination against foreign nationals married to Nepali citizens. Paternal lineage of a person is valued and required in legal documents. Many laws remain unenforced in practice.
Nepal Police is the primary law enforcement agency. It is an independent organisation under the command of the Inspector General, who is appointed by and reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In addition to maintaining law and order, it is responsible for the management of road traffic, which is undertaken by Nepal Traffic Police. Nepal Armed Police Force, a separate paramilitary police organisation, works in cooperation with Nepal police in routine security matters; it is intended for crowd control, counter-insurgency and anti-terrorism actions, and other internal matters where the use of force may be necessary. The Crime Investigation Department of Nepal Police specialises in criminal investigation and forensic analysis. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority is an independent investigative agency that investigates and prosecutes cases related to corruption, bribery and abuses of authority. At 2.16 per 100,000 in 2016, Nepal&#x27;s intentional homicide rate is much lower than average; police data indicates a steady increase in the crime rate in recent years. Nepal was ranked 76 out of 163 countries in the Global Peace Index (GPI) in 2019. Nepal&#x27;s passport has consistently been ranked among the weakest in the world.

=== Foreign relations ===
Nepal depends on diplomacy for national defence. It maintains a policy of neutrality between its neighbours, has amicable relations with other countries in the region, and has a policy of non-alignment at the global stage. Nepal is a member of SAARC, UN, WTO, BIMSTEC and ACD, among others. It has bilateral diplomatic relations with 167 countries and the EU, has embassies in 30 countries and six consulates, while 25 countries maintain embassies in Nepal, and more than 80 others maintain non-residential diplomatic missions. Nepal is one of the major contributors to the UN peacekeeping missions, having contributed more than 119,000 personnel to 42 missions since 1958. Nepali people have a reputation for honesty, loyalty and bravery, which has led to them serving as legendary Gurkha warriors in the Indian and British armies for the last 200 years, with service in both world wars, India-Pakistan wars as well as Afghanistan and Iraq, though Nepal was not directly involved in any of those conflicts, and winning the highest military awards, including the Victoria Cross and the Param Vir Chakra.
Nepal pursues a policy of &quot;balanced relations&quot; with the two giant immediate neighbours, India and China; the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship with India provides for a much closer relationship. Nepal and India share an open border with free movement of people, religious, cultural and marital ties. India is Nepal&#x27;s largest trading partner, which it depends upon for all of its oil and gas, and a number of essential goods. Nepalis can own property in India, while Indians are free to live and work in Nepal. Relations between India and Nepal, though very close, have faced difficulties stemming from territorial disputes, economics, and the problems inherent in big power-small power relations. Nepal established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 August 1955, and signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1960; relations since have been based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Nepal maintains neutrality in conflicts between China and India. It remains firmly committed to the One China Policy and is known to curb anti-China activities from the Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Citizens of both countries can cross the border and travel as far as 30 km without a visa. China is viewed favourably in Nepal owing to the absence of any border disputes or serious interference in internal politics, coupled with its assistance in infrastructure development and aid during emergencies; favourability has increased since China helped Nepal during the 2015 economic blockade imposed by India. Subsequently, China granted Nepal access to its ports for third-country trade, and Nepal joined China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative.

Nepal emphasises greater cooperation in South Asia and actively pushed for the establishment of SAARC, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the permanent secretariat of which, is hosted in Kathmandu. Nepal was one of the first countries to recognise an independent Bangladesh, and the two countries seek to enhance greater cooperation, on trade and water management; seaports in Bangladesh, being closer, are seen as viable alternatives to India&#x27;s monopoly on Nepal&#x27;s third-country trade. Nepal was the first South Asian country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, and the countries enjoy a strong relationship; it recognises the rights of the Palestinians, having voted in favour of its recognition at the UN and against the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. Countries that Nepal maintains a close relationship with, include the most generous donors and development partners—the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Japan and Norway, among others.

===Military and intelligence===
The President is the supreme commander of the Nepali Army; its routine management is handled by the Ministry of Defence. The military expenditure for 2018 was $398.5 million, around 1.4% of GDP. An almost exclusively ground infantry force, Nepal Army numbers at less than one hundred thousand; recruitment is voluntary. It has few aircraft, mainly helicopters, primarily used for transport, patrol, and search and rescue. Directorate of Military Intelligence under Nepal Army serves as the military intelligence agency; National Investigation Department tasked with national and international intelligence gathering, is independent. Nepal Army is primarily used for routine security of critical assets, an anti-poaching patrol of national parks, counterinsurgency, and search and rescue during natural disasters; it also undertakes major construction projects. There are no discriminatory policies on recruitment into the army, but it is dominated by men from elite Pahari warrior castes.

== Economy ==
Nepal is one of the least developed countries, which ranks 165th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 162nd in GDP per capita at PPP. Nepal&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion. Nepal has consistently been ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world. Nepal has been a member of WTO since 23 April 2004.

The 16.8-million-worker Nepali labour force is the 37th largest in the world. The primary sector makes up 27.59% of GDP, the secondary sector 14.6%, and the tertiary sector 57.81%.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Accounts of Nepal 2018/19&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal&#x27;s foreign exchange remittances of US$8.1 billion in 2018, the 19th largest in the world and constituting 28.0% of GDP, were contributed to its economy by millions of workers primarily in India, the Middle East and East Asia, almost all of them unskilled labourers. Major agricultural products include cereals (barley, maize, millet, paddy and wheat), oilseed, potato, pulses, sugarcane, jute, tobacco, milk and water buffalo meat. Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, cigarettes, cement, brick, as well as small rice, jute, sugar and oilseed mills. Nepal&#x27;s international trade greatly expanded in 1951 with the establishment of democracy; liberalisation began in 1985 and picked up pace after 1990. By the fiscal year 2016/17, Nepal&#x27;s foreign trade amounted Rs 1.06 trillion, a twenty-three folds increase from Rs 45.6 billion in 1990/91. More than 60% of Nepal&#x27;s trade is with India. Major exports include readymade garment, carpet, pulses, handicrafts, leather, medicinal herbs, and paper products, which account for 90% of the total. Major imports include various finished and semi-finished goods, raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemical fertilisers, electrical and electronic devices, petroleum products, gold, and readymade garments. Inflation was at 4.5% in 2019. Foreign exchange reserves were at US$9.5 billion in July 2019, equivalent to 7.8 months of imports.

Nepal has made significant progress in poverty reduction bringing the population below the international poverty line (US$1.90 per person per day) from 15% in 2010 to just 9.3% in 2018, although vulnerability remains extremely high, with almost 32% of the population living on between US$1.90 and US$3.20 per person per day. Nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Under the current trend, Nepal is expected to eradicate poverty within 20 years. The agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable as it is highly dependent on the monsoon rains, with just 28% of the arable land being irrigated, . Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18%, and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6%. Private investment, consumption, tourism and agriculture are the principal contributors to economic growth.

The government&#x27;s budget is about $13.71 billion (FY 2019/20); expenditure of infrastructure development budget, most of it contributed by foreign aid, usually fails to meet the target. The country receives foreign aid from the UK, India, Japan, the US, the EU, China, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. The Nepali rupee has been tied to the Indian rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Per capita income is $1,004. The distribution of wealth among the Nepalis is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%. European Union (EU) (46.13%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners; they mainly buy Nepali ready-made garments (RMG). Nepal&#x27;s import partners include India (47.5%), the United Arab Emirates (11.2%), China (10.7%), Saudi Arabia (4.9%), and Singapore (4%).

Besides having landlocked, rugged geography, few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure, the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the country&#x27;s economic growth and development. Debt bondage even involving debtors&#x27; children has been a persistent social problem in the western hills and the Terai, with an estimated 234,600 people or 0.82% of the population considered as enslaved, by The Global Slavery Index in 2016.

In 2022, Nepal limited import of non-essential goods after its foreign currency reserves dropped. COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in tourism spending and the money sent home by Nepalis working abroad, which in turn lowered country&#x27;s foreign currency reserve.

===Tourism===
Tourism is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in Nepal, employing more than a million people and contributing 7.9% of the total GDP. The number of international visitors crossed one million in 2018 for the first time (not counting Indian tourists arriving by land). Nepal&#x27;s share of visitors to South Asia is about 6%, and they spend much less on average, with Nepal sharing 1.7% of the earnings. Premier destinations include Pokhara, the Annapurna trekking circuit and the four UNESCO world heritage sites—Lumbini, Sagarmatha National Park (home to Mount Everest), seven sites in the Kathmandu Valley collectively listed as one, and Chitwan National Park. Most of Nepal&#x27;s mountaineering earning comes from Mount Everest, which is more accessible from the Nepalese side.

Nepal officially opened to westerners in 1951 and became a popular destination at the end of the hippie trail in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry, disrupted by the civil war in the 1990s, has since recovered but faces challenges to growth, owing to a lack of proper facilities for high-end tourism termed the &quot;infrastructure bottleneck&quot;, mounting issues facing Nepal Airlines, and a handful of destinations properly developed and marketed. The home-stay tourism, in which cultural and eco-tourists stay as paying guests in the homes of indigenous people, has seen some success.

===Foreign employment===

The rate of unemployment and underemployment exceeds half of the working-age population, driving millions to seek employment abroad, mainly in India, the Gulf, and East Asia. Mostly unskilled, uneducated, and indebted to loan sharks, these workers are swindled by the manpower companies and sent to exploitative employers or war-ridden countries under fraudulent contracts. They have their passports seized, to be returned when the employer grants them leave or terminates their contracts. Most do not get paid minimum wage, and many are forced to forfeit all or part of the wages. Many Nepalis work in extremely unsafe conditions; an average of two workers die each day. Due to restrictions placed on women, many depend on traffickers to get out of the country, and end up victims of violence and abuse. Many Nepalese are believed to be working under slavery-like conditions, and Nepal spends billions of rupees rescuing stranded workers, on remuneration to the indebted families of the dead, and in legal costs for those arrested in foreign countries. Though millions have raised themselves out of poverty, due to a lack of entrepreneurial skills, the remittance is largely spent on real estate and consumption.

== Infrastructure ==

===Energy===

The bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%). Most of the final energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years. Except for some lignite deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits. All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country&#x27;s total export revenue. Only about 1% of the energy need is fulfilled by electricity. The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country&#x27;s topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects. Estimates put Nepal&#x27;s economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW. Nepal has been able to exploit only about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much as 650 MW from India to meet the demands. Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and setbacks. Nepal&#x27;s electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas. The position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand.

===Transportation===
Nepal remains isolated from the world&#x27;s major land, air and sea transport routes, although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways; flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. , there were just over of paved roads, of unpaved roads, and just of railway line in the south. , all district headquarters (except Simikot) had been connected to the road network. Most of the rural roads are not operable during the rainy season; even national highways regularly become inoperable. Nepal depends almost entirely on assistance from countries like China, India and Japan, for building, maintenance and expansion of the road network. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. The national carrier, Nepal Airlines, is in poor shape due to mismanagement and corruption, and has been blacklisted by the EU. Internally, the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets, schools, and health clinics a challenge. Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia.

===Communication===
According to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS August 2019 report, voice telephony subscription rate was at 2.70% of total population for fixed phones and 138.59% for mobile; 98% of all voice telephony was through mobile phones. Similarly, while an estimated 14.52% had access to fixed broadband, an additional 52.71% were accessing the internet using their mobile data subscriptions; almost 15 million of them with 3G or better. The mobile voice telephony and broadband market was dominated by two telecommunications companies, the state-owned Nepal Telecom (55%) and the private multinational, Ncell (40%). Of the 21% market share enjoyed by fixed broadband, around 25% was again shared by Nepal Telecom, with the rest going to the private Internet Service Providers. Although there is high disparity in penetration rate between the rural and urban areas, mobile service has reached 75 districts of the country covering 90% of land area, and broadband access is expected to reach 90% of the population by 2020.

===Media===

, the state operates three television stations as well as national and regional radio stations. There are 117 private TV channels and 736 FM radio stations licensed for operation, at least 314 of them, community radio stations. According to the 2011 census, the percentage of households possessing radio was 50.82%, television 36.45%, cable TV 19.33%, and computer 7.28%. According to the Press Council Nepal classification, of the 833 publications producing original content, ten national dailies and weeklies are rated A+ class. In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nepal at 106th in the world in terms of press freedom.

== Demographics ==
The citizens of Nepal are known as Nepali or Nepalese. The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet and North Burma, and the Chinese province of Yunnan via Assam. Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of the eastern region, Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, aboriginal Tharus of the Terai plains and the Khas Pahari people of the far-western hills. Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the Terai in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands, and the northern mountains are sparsely populated.

Nepal is a multicultural and multiethnic country, home to 125 distinct ethnic groups, speaking 123 different mother tongues and following a number of indigenous and folk religions in addition to Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. According to the 2011 census, Nepal&#x27;s population was 26.5 million, almost a threefold increase from nine million in 1950. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9 million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male labourers employed overseas. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio to 94.2 from 99.8 for 2001. The annual population growth rate was 1.35% between 2001 and 2011, compared to an average of 2.25% between 1961 and 2001; also attributed to the absentee population.

Nepal is one of the ten least urbanised, and the ten fastest urbanizing countries in the world. , an estimated 18.3% of the population lived in urban areas. Urbanisation rate is high in the Terai, doon valleys of the inner Terai and valleys of the middle hills, but low in the high Himalayas. Similarly, the rate is higher in central and eastern Nepal compared to further west. The capital, Kathmandu, nicknamed the &quot;City of temples&quot;, is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart. Other large cities in Nepal include Pokhara, Biratnagar, Lalitpur, Bharatpur, Birgunj, Dharan, Hetauda and Nepalgunj. Congestion, pollution and drinking water shortage are some of the major problems facing the rapidly growing cities, most prominently the Kathmandu Valley.
=== Largest cities ===
=== Language ===
Nepal&#x27;s diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and various indigenous language isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri (6.0%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Bajjika (3%) and Magar (3.0%), Doteli (3.0%), Urdu (2.6%), Awadhi (1.89%), and Sunwar. Nepal is home to at least four indigenous sign languages.

Descendent of Sanskrit, Nepali is written in Devanagari script. It is the official language and serves as &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages Maithili, Awadhi and Bhojpuri are spoken in the southern Terai region; Urdu is common among Nepali Muslims. Varieties of Tibetan are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet.

=== Religion ===
Nepal is a secular country, as declared by the Constitution of Nepal 2012 (Part 1, Article 4), where secularism &#x27;means religious, cultural freedom, along with the protection of religion, culture handed down from time immemorial ()&#x27;. The 2011 census reported that the religion with the largest number of followers in Nepal was Hinduism (81.3% of the population), followed by Buddhism (9%); the remaining were Islam (4.4%), Kirant (3.1%), Christianity (1.4%) and &quot;Prakriti&quot; or nature worship (0.5%). By percentage of population, Nepal has the largest population of Hindus in the world. Nepal was officially a Hindu Kingdom until recently, and Shiva was considered the guardian deity of the country. Although many government policies throughout history have disregarded or marginalised minority religions, Nepalese societies generally enjoy religious tolerance and harmony among all religions, with only isolated incidents of religiously motivated violence. Nepal&#x27;s constitution does not give anyone the right to convert any person to another religion. Nepal also passed a more stringent anti-conversion law on 2017. Nepal has the second-largest number of Hindus in the world after India.

=== Education ===

Nepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools. By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools. The overall literacy rate (for population age five years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011. The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017, yet enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 –12), and around 12% at the tertiary level. Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate, girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education. Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies. Nepal was ranked 109th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

Lack of proper infrastructures and teaching materials, and a high student-to-teacher ratio, as well as politicisation of school management committees and partisan unionisation among both students and teachers, present a hurdle to progress. Free basic education is guaranteed in the constitution but the programme lacks funding for effective implementation. Government has scholarship programmes for girls and disabled students as well as the children of martyrs, marginalised communities and the poor. Tens of thousands of Nepali students leave the country every year in search of better education and work, with half of them never returning.

=== Health ===

Health care services in Nepal are provided by both the public and private sectors. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 71 years as of 2017, 153rd highest in the world, up from 54 years in the 1990s and 35 years in 1950. Two-thirds of all deaths are due to non-communicable diseases; heart disease is the leading cause of death. While sedentary lifestyle, imbalanced diet and consumption of tobacco and alcohol has contributed in the rise of non-communicable diseases, many lose their life to communicable and treatable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition due to a lack of education, awareness and access to healthcare services.

Nepal has made great progress in maternal and child health. 95% of children have access to iodised salt, and 86% of children aged 6 – 59 months receive Vitamin A prophylaxis. Stunting, underweight and wasting has been reduced significantly; malnutrition, at 43% among children under five, is extremely high. Anemia in women and children increased between 2011 and 2016, reaching 41% and 53% respectively. Low birth weight is at 27% while breastfeeding is at 65%. Nepal has reduced maternal mortality rate to 229, from 901 in 1990; infant mortality is down to 32.2 per thousand live births compared to 139.8 in 1990. Contraceptive prevalence rate is 53% but the disparity rate between rural and urban areas is high due to a lack of awareness and easy access.

Progress in health is driven by strong government initiative in cooperation with NGOs and INGOs. Public health centres provide 72 essential medicines free of cost. In addition, the public health insurance plan initiated in 2016 which covers health treatments of up to Rs 50,000 for five members of a family, for a premium of Rs 2500 per year, has seen limited success, and is expected to expand. By paying stipends for four antenatal visits to health centres and hospitalised delivery, Nepal decreased home-births from 81% in 2006 to 41% in 2016. School meal programmes have improved education as well as nutrition metrics among children. Toilet building subsidies under the ambitious &quot;one household-one toilet&quot; programme has seen toilet prevalence rate reach 99% in 2019, from just 6% in 1990.

===Immigrants and refugees===

Nepal has a long tradition of accepting immigrants and refugees. In modern times, Tibetans and Bhutanese have constituted a majority of refugees in Nepal. Tibetan refugees began arriving in 1959, and many more cross into Nepal every year. The Bhutanese Lhotsampa refugees began arriving in the 1980s and numbered more than 110,000 by the 2000s. Most of them have been resettled in third countries. In late 2018, Nepal had a total of 20,800 confirmed refugees, 64% of them Tibetan and 31% Bhutanese. Economic immigrants, and refugees fleeing persecution or war, from neighbouring countries, Africa and the Middle East, termed &quot;urban refugees&quot; because they live in apartments in the cities instead of refugee camps, lack official recognition; the government facilitates their resettlement in third countries.

Around 2,000 immigrants, half of them Chinese, applied for a work permit in 2018/19. The government lacks data on Indian immigrants as they do not require permits to live and work in Nepal; Government of India puts the number of Non-Resident Indians in the country at 600,000.

== Culture ==


===Society===
Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as &quot;jātis&quot;, or &quot;castes&quot;. Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963 and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance.

Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18.

Many Nepali festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Gadhimai festival, Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Chhath, Maghi, Sakela, Holi, and the Nepali new year.

Gadhimai festival is a Hindu festival held every five years in Nepal at the Gadhimai Temple and has been described as the world&#x27;s bloodiest festival. The event involves large-scale slaughter of animals and birds, including buffaloes, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, pigeons, pigs, rats and white mice, with the goal of pleasing goddess Gadhimai. Critics say the festival ritual is barbaric, unsanitary and wasteful, but Hindu devotees insist it has deep religious significance.

Dashain is a major Hindu religious festival in Nepal. Driven by the belief that offerings of fresh blood will appease goddess Durga, thousands of buffaloes, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens and ducks are slaughtered during the festival. Numerous animal welfare activists have expressed their concerns over the issue of animal cruelty and mass slaughter. The Nepali government have tried to ban the filming of the animal sacrifices. An animal welfare group who witnessed the festival said &quot;We have been violently and physically assaulted. Our equipment and cameras have been ripped from our hands and smashed into pieces.&quot; They also said they saw festival goers defecating in public and they had to walk among human faeces. In another case Nepali people carrying machetes chased animal welfare activists down the street.

Witch-hunts are still occurring in Nepal in the twenty-first century. The victims are usually poor elderly women, free-spirited young women, widows, women of lower castes, or any possible combination of the above. The perpetrators are usually neighbours or residents of the same village, and occasionally family or close relatives. Politicians, teachers, police officers, army officers and other respected members of the community have also been implicated in various incidents. Execution may be carried out by burning alive. Many victims succumb to their injuries from torture and assault. Non-murderous witch-hunts usually include beating and feeding of excrement.

===Symbols===
The emblem of Nepal depicts the snowy Himalayas, the forested hills, and the fertile Terai, supported by a wreath of rhododendrons, with the national flag at the crest and in the foreground, a plain white map of Nepal below it, and a man&#x27;s and woman&#x27;s right hands joined to signify gender equality. At the bottom is the national motto, a Sanskrit quote of patriotism attributed in Nepali folklore to Lord Rama, written in Devanagari script—&quot;Mother and motherland are greater than heaven&quot;.

Nepal&#x27;s flag is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape. The constitution contains instructions for a Geometric Construction of the double-pennant flag. According to its official description, the crimson in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the rhododendron. The flag&#x27;s blue border signifies Nepali people&#x27;s desire for peace. The moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepalis, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors.

The president is the symbol of national unity. The martyrs are the symbols of patriotism. Commanders of the Anglo-Nepalese war, Amar Singh Thapa, Bhakti Thapa, and Balbhadra Kunwar are considered war heroes. A special designation of &quot;National hero&quot; has been conferred to 16 people from Nepal&#x27;s history for their exceptional contributions to the prestige of Nepal. Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of modern Nepal, is held in high regard and considered &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; by many.

===Art and architecture===
The oldest known examples of architecture in Nepal are stupas of early Buddhist constructions in and around Kapilvastu in south-western Nepal, and those constructed by Ashoka in the Kathmandu Valley BC. The characteristic architecture associated exclusively with Nepal was developed and refined by Newa artisans of the Kathmandu Valley starting no later than the Lichchhavi period. A Tang dynasty Chinese travel book, probably based on records from , describes contemporary Nepali architecture, predominantly built with wood, as rich in artistry, as well as wood and metal sculpture. It describes a magnificent seven-storied pagoda in the middle of a palace, with copper-tiled roofs, its balustrade, grills, columns and beams set about with fine and precious stones, and four golden sculptures of Makaras in the four corners of the base spouting water from their mouths like a fountain, supplied by copper pipes connected to the runnels at the top of the tower. Later Chinese chronicles describe Nepal&#x27;s king&#x27;s palace as an immense structure with many roofs, suggesting that the Chinese were not yet familiar with the pagoda architecture, which has now become one of the chief characteristics of Chinese architecture.

A typical pagoda temple is built with wood, every piece of it finely carved with geometrical patterns or images of gods, goddesses, mythical beings and beasts. The roofs usually tiled with clay, and sometimes gold plated, diminish in proportion successively until the topmost roof is reached which is itself ensigned by a golden finial. The base is usually composed of rectangular terraces of finely carved stone; the entrance is usually guarded by stone sculptures of conventional figures. Bronze and copper craftsmanship observable in the sculpture of deities and beasts, decorations of doors and windows and the finials of buildings, as well as items of everyday use is found to be of equal splendour. The most well-developed of Nepali painting traditions is the thanka or paubha painting tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, practised in Nepal by the Buddhist monks and Newar artisans. Changu Narayan Temple, built 4th century AD has probably the finest of Nepali woodcraft; the Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares are the culmination of Nepali art and architecture, showcasing Nepali wood, metal and stone craftsmanship refined over two millennia.

The &quot;ankhijhyal&quot; window, that allow a one-way view of the outside world, is an example of unique Nepali woodcraft, found in building structures, domestic and public alike, ancient and modern. Many cultures paint the walls of their homes with regular patterns, figures of gods and beasts and religious symbols; others paint their walls plain, often with clay or chernozem contrasted with yellow soil or limestone. The roofs of religious as well as domestic structures project considerably, presumably to provide protection from the sun and the rain. The timber of domestic structures are finely carved as with their religious counterparts.

=== Looting of the cultural heritage of Nepal ===
Cultural looting is a crisis in Nepal despite efforts to combat it. Volunteers working for the Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign have helped recover artifacts. In 2022 Barakat Gallery&#x27;s London branch relinquished 16th-century carved wooden Torana, a ceremonial gateway, and the 17th-century stone statue of a kneeling devotee, both taken from sacred sites near Kathmandu. In 2023 Nepalese artifacts suspected of having been looted were found in the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Rubin Museum and other museums, and turned up in auctions at Christie&#x27;s, Bonhams and other auction houses.

===Literature and the performing arts===
Nepal&#x27;s literature was closely intertwined with that of the rest of South Asia until its unification into a modern kingdom. Literary works, which were written in Sanskrit by Brahmin priests educated and sometimes also based in Varanasi, included religious texts and other fantasies involving kings, gods and demons. The oldest extant Nepali language text is dated to the 13th century but except for the epigraphic material, Nepali language literature older than the 17th century have not been found. Newar literature dates back almost 500 years. The modern history of Nepali literature begins with Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814–1868), who for the first time composed major and influential works in Nepali, the language accessible to the masses, most prominently, the Bhanubhakta Ramayana, a translation of the ancient Hindu epic. By the end of the nineteenth century, Motiram Bhatta had published print editions of the works of Acharya, and through his efforts, single-handedly popularised and propelled Nepali language literature into modernity. By the mid-twentieth century, Nepali literature was no longer limited to the Hindu literary traditions. Influenced by western literary traditions, writers in this period started producing literary works addressing the contemporary social problems, while many others continued to enrich Nepali poetic traditions with authentic Nepali poetry. Newar literature also emerged as a premier literary tradition. After the advent of democracy in 1951, Nepali literature flourished. Literary works in many other languages began to be produced. Nepali literature continued to modernise, and in recent years, has been strongly influenced by the post civil-war Nepali experience as well as global literary traditions.

Maruni, Lakhey, Sakela, Kauda and Tamang Selo are some examples of the traditional Nepali music and dance in the hilly regions of Nepal.

Nepali film industry is known as &quot;Kollywood&quot;.

Nepal Academy is the foremost institution for the promotion of arts and culture in Nepal, established in 1957.

===Clothing===

The most widely worn traditional dress in Nepal, for both women and men, from ancient times until the advent of modern times, was draped. For women, it eventually took the form of a sari, a single long piece of cloth, famously six yards long, and of width spanning the lower body. The sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end, wrapped around the lower body, and then over the shoulder. In its more modern form, it has been used to cover the head, and sometimes the face, as a veil, particularly in the Terai. It has been combined with an underskirt, or the petticoat, and tucked in the waistband for more secure fastening. It is worn with a blouse, or cholo, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari&#x27;s end, passing over the shoulder, now serving to obscure the upper body&#x27;s contours, and to cover the midriff. Cholo-sari has become the attire of choice for formal occasions, official environs and festive gatherings. In its more traditional form, as part of traditional dresses and as worn in daily life while performing household chores or labour, it takes the form of a or , usually shorter than a sari in length as well as breadth, and all of it wrapped around the lower body.

For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment. It too is tied around the waist and wrapped. Among the Aryans, it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back. Dhoti or its variants, usually worn over a langauti, constitute the lower-body garment in the traditional clothing of Tharus, Gurungs and Magars as well as the Madhesi people, among others. Other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are patukas (a length of cloth wrapped tightly over the waist by both sexes as a waistband, a part of most traditional Nepali costumes, usually with a khukuri tucked into it when worn by men), scarves like and and shawls like the newar &quot;ga&quot; and Tibetan khata, ghumtos (the wedding veils) and various kinds of turbans (scarves worn around the head as a part of a tradition, or to keep off the sun or the cold, called a pheta, pagri or sirpau).

Until the beginning of the first millennium AD, the ordinary dress of people in South Asia was entirely unstitched. The arrival of the Kushans from Central Asia, AD, popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of Central Asia. The simplest form of sewn clothing, Bhoto (a rudimentary vest), is a universal unisex clothing for children, and traditionally the only clothing children wear until they come of age and are given adult garb, sometimes in a ceremonial rite of passage, such as the gunyu-choli ceremony for Hindu girls. Men continue to wear bhoto through adulthood. Upper body garment for men is usually a vest such as the &quot;bhoto&quot;, or a shirt similar to the &quot;kurta&quot;, such as &quot;daura&quot;, a closed-necked double-breasted long shirt with five pleats and eight strings that serve to tie it around the body. &quot;Suruwal&quot;, simply translated as a pair of trousers, is an alternative to and, more recently, replacement for &quot;dhoti&quot;, (Magars) or (Tharus); it is traditionally much wider above the knees but tapers below, to fit tightly at the ankles, and is tied to the waist with a drawstring. Modern cholos worn with sarees are usually half-sleeved and single-breasted, and do not cover the midriff. The traditional one called the chaubandi cholo, like the daura, is full-sleeved, double-breasted with pleats and strings, and extends down to the patuka, covering the midriff.

Daura-Suruwal and Gunyu-Cholo were the national dresses for men and women respectively until 2011 when they were removed to eliminate favouritism. Traditional dresses of many pahari ethnic groups are Daura-Suruwal or similar, with patuka, a dhaka topi and a coat for men, and Gunyu-cholo or similar, with patuka and sometimes a scarf for women. For many other groups, men&#x27;s traditional dresses consist of a shirt or a vest, paired with a &quot;dhoti&quot;, or . In the high Himalayas, the traditional dresses are largely influenced by Tibetan culture. Sherpa women wear the chuba with the pangi apron, while Sherpa men wear shirts with stiff high collar and long sleeves called tetung under the chuba. Tibetan Xamo Gyaise hats of the Sherpas, dhaka topi of pahari men and tamang round caps are among the more distinctive headwears.

Married Hindu women wear , , and red bangles. Jewellery of gold and silver, and sometimes precious stones, are common. Gold jewellery includes and worn with the by the Hindus, (a huge gold flower worn on the head) and Nessey (huge flattened gold earrings) worn by the Limbus, and , and worn by the Magars. Tharu women can wear as much as six kilograms of silver in jewellery, which includes worn on the head, the forehead, and and around the neck.

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in Nepal. Increasingly, in urban settings, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, transformed instead into one for formal occasions. The traditional kurta suruwal is rarely worn by younger women, who increasingly favour jeans. The &quot;dhoti&quot; has largely been reduced to the liturgical vestment of shamans and Hindu priests.

=== Cuisine ===
Nepali cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. With diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit. The Columbian exchange brought potatoes, tomatoes, maize, peanuts, cashew nuts, pineapples, guavas, and most notably, chilli peppers, to South Asia; all became staples. Cereals grown in Nepal, their times and regions of planting, correspond strongly to the timing of monsoons and variations in altitude. Rice and wheat are mostly cultivated in the terai plains and well-irrigated valleys; maize, millet, barley and buckwheat mostly in the less fertile and drier hills.

A typical Nepali meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion, complemented with flavourful, savoury dishes. The latter include lentils, pulses and vegetables, spiced commonly with ginger and garlic, and more discerningly with combinations of coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon, jimbu and others. This is typically on a platter, or thali, with a central place for the cooked cereal and small bowls for the flavourful accompaniments. They are combined either by actual mixing—for example, rice and lentils—or in the folding of one—such as bread—around the other, such as cooked vegetables. &quot;Dal-bhat&quot; centred around steamed rice is the most common example. as well as dairy and sometimes meat. Unleavened flat bread made from wheat flour called chapati occasionally replaces rice, particularly in the Terai, while Dhindo, prepared by boiling corn, millet or buckwheat flour in water, continuously stirring and adding flour until thick, almost solid consistency is reached, is the main substitute in the hills and mountains. Tsampa, flour made from roasted barley or naked barley, is the main staple in the high himalayas. Throughout Nepal, fermented, then sun-dried, leafy greens called &quot;Gundruk&quot;, are both a delicacy and a vital substitute for fresh vegetables in the winter.
A notable feature of Nepali food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents. The appearance of &quot;ahimsa&quot;, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in South Asian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of Nepal&#x27;s Hindu and Buddhist populations, as well as among Jains. Among these groups, strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat. Though per capita meat consumption is low in Nepal, the proportion of vegetarianism is not high as in India, due to the prevalence of Shaktism, of which animal sacrifice is a prominent feature.
Nepali cuisines possess their own distinctive qualities to distinguish these hybrid cuisines from both their northern and southern neighbours. Nepali cuisines, with generally tomato-based, leaner curries, are lighter than their cream-based Indian counterparts, and Nepali momo dumplings are heavily spiced compared to their northern counterparts. Newar cuisine, one of the richest and most influential in Nepal, is more elaborate and diverse than most, as Newar culture developed in the highly fertile and prosperous Kathmandu valley. A typical Newar cuisine can comprise more than a dozen dishes of cereals, meat, vegetable curries, chutneys and pickles. Kwanti (sprouted beans soup), chhwela (ground beef), chatamari (rice flour crepe), bara (fried lentil cake), kachila (marinated raw minced beef), samaybaji (centred around flattened rice), and are among the more widely recognised. Juju dhau, a sweet yoghurt originating in Bhaktapur, is also famous. Thakali cuisine is another well-known food tradition which seamlessly melds the Tibetan and the Indian with variety in ingredients, especially the herbs and spices. In the Terai, Bagiya is a rice flour dumpling with sweets inside, popular among the Tharu and Maithil people. Various communities in the Terai make (sun-dried small fish mixed with taro leaves) and biriya (lentil paste mixed with taro leaves) to stock for the monsoon floods. , , and are among the sweet delicacies. Rice pulau or sweet rice porridge called are usually the main dish in feasts. Tea and buttermilk (fermented milk leftover from churning butter from yoghurt) are common non-alcoholic drinks. Almost all janajati communities have their own traditional methods of brewing alcohol. Raksi (traditional distilled alcohol), jaand (rice beer), tongba (millet beer) and chyaang are the most well-known.

=== Sports and recreation ===
Nepali indigenous sports, like dandi biyo and kabaddi which were considered the unofficial national sports until recently, are still popular in rural areas. Despite efforts, standardisation and development of dandi biyo has not been achieved, while Kabaddi, as a professional sport, is still in its infancy in Nepal. Bagh-chal, an ancient board game that is thought to have originated in Nepal, can be played on chalk-drawn boards, with pebbles, and is still popular today. Ludo, snakes and ladders and carrom are popular pastimes. Chess is also played. Volleyball was declared as the national sport of Nepal in 2017. Popular children&#x27;s games include versions of tag, knucklebones, hopscotch, Duck, duck, goose and lagori, while marbles, top, hoop rolling and gully cricket are also popular among boys. Rubber bands, or ranger bands cut from tubes in bike tyres, make a multi-purpose sporting equipment for Nepali children, which may be bunched or chained together, and used to play dodgeball, cat&#x27;s cradle, jianzi and a variety of skipping rope games.

Football and cricket are popular professional sports. Nepal is competitive in football in the South Asia region but has never won the SAFF championships, but has had some success in South Asian Games. It usually ranks in the bottom quarter in the FIFA World Rankings. Nepal has had some success in cricket and holds ODI status, consistently ranking in the Top 20 in the ICC ODI and T20I rankings. Nepal has had some success in athletics and martial arts, having won many medals at the South Asian Games and some at the Asian games. Nepal has never won an olympic medal. Sports like basketball, volleyball, futsal, wrestling, competitive bodybuilding and badminton are also gaining in popularity. Women in football, cricket, athletics, martial arts, badminton and swimming have found some success. Nepal also fields players and national teams in several tournaments for disabled individuals, most notably in men&#x27;s as well as women&#x27;s blind cricket.

The only international stadium in the country is the multi-purpose Dasarath Stadium where the men and women national football teams play their home matches. Since the formation of the national team, Nepal has played its home matches of cricket at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground. Nepal police, Armed police force and Nepal army are the most prolific producers of national players, and aspiring players are known to join armed forces, for the better sporting opportunities they can provide. Nepali sports is hindered by a lack of infrastructure, funding, corruption, nepotism and political interference. Very few players are able to make a living as professional sportspeople.
