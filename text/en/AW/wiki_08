<text>Davie Allan is an American guitarist best known for his work on soundtracks to various teen and biker movies in the 1960s. Allan&#x27;s backing band is almost always the Arrows (i.e., Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows), although the Arrows have never had a stable lineup.

==Biography==
Allan grew up in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California, and learned to play guitar as a teenager. His career as a musician began when he teamed up with Mike Curb, a friend he met in the choir at Grant High School in Valley Glen, California, to form an instrumental surf combo. In 1963, Curb founded Curb Records, the first of many labels he would run, and released the first Davie Allan single, “War Path”. Allan participated in recording a number of other singles for Curb&#x27;s label, under group names like the Sudells, the Heyburners, and the Zanies.

In 1964, Curb founded Sidewalk Records (which was distributed by Capitol subsidiary Tower Records), brought Allan with him as a session musician, and secured a recording contract for the newly formed Arrows. Curb had also made a deal to supply Roger Corman&#x27;s American International Pictures with soundtracks. Allan had come to Corman&#x27;s attention from his playing on the soundtrack of &quot;Skaterdater&quot;.

==Davie Allan and The Arrows==
Early Davie Allan and The Arrows tracks were stereotypical instrumental surf numbers, with clear-as-a-bell guitar sounds and light, crisp drum work. Though these sides were good musically, and modestly successful commercially (“Apache &#x27;65” became a local radio hit), Allan would find his greatest success when his sound mutated soon thereafter.

When Curb assigned soundtrack duties for biker film &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; to Allan and the Arrows, it would prove a breakthrough success. The song from the film&#x27;s opening, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Theme&quot;, an aggressive, repetitive and very catchy instrumental showcasing Allan&#x27;s new fuzz (heavily distorted) guitar sound became their biggest hit (it was also one of the first songs Eddie Van Halen learned to play on brother Alex&#x27;s guitar). The song stayed on the Billboard charts for 17 weeks (it peaked at #37) (#36 in Canada). The single, backed with “Bongo Party”, and the soundtrack album both sold well. Rumors have stated that the melody in &quot;Blues&#x27; Theme&quot; was stolen from Louie Shelton&#x27;s guitar lick in &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;, but &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot; was recorded on July 25, 1966, while &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; debuted in the theaters on July 20, 1966.

Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows went on to record a number of other soundtracks for similar AIP films over the next few years, like &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;, and &quot;The Born Losers&quot;, as well as several studio albums. All contained quality material, but none would prove as successful as &quot;Blue&#x27;s Theme&quot;.

By the time Tower Records and Sidewalk Records were dissolved in 1968, Allan had his name on some 14 albums and a prolific string of singles. Allan cut a few singles for MGM Records in the early &#x27;70s, continuing his association with Curb, but after that his career faltered.

==Career revival==
Beginning with the &quot;Loud, Loose and Savage&quot; album in 1994, a compilation of tracks recorded over the previous 10 years, Allan (with all-new Arrows in tow) began a bid to revive his career. The album was well received by critics, and since then he has released several more albums, including a collaboration with the &quot;Phantom Surfers&quot;, &quot;Ramonetures&quot;, an album of instrumental versions of Ramones songs, done Ventures-style. A follow-up album by the Ramonetures features Ventures-infused instrumental covers of songs by X. Featuring the playing of DJ Bonebrake and Billy Zoom of X, the album&#x27;s title &quot;Johnny Walk Don&#x27;t Run Paulene&quot; is a portmanteau of well known songs by X (&quot;Johnny hit &amp; run Paulene&quot;) and the Ventures (&quot;Walk don&#x27;t run&quot;). 

The band Danzig recorded a cover of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot;, which is the lead track on the covers album Skeletons. Singer Glenn Danzig has said he had been wanting to cover the song since 1979, and so the version is in the style of his band of that era, the Misfits.

==Musical legacy==

Allan&#x27;s most notable contribution is from popularizing the fuzz guitar sound using the then recently invented fuzzbox which made its popular debut on &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. While Link Wray was the pioneer of guitar distortion, Allan pushed it to a new level, distorting his signal so much as to give his guitar tone a buzzing, grinding quality: &quot;fuzzy&quot;. Guitar sounds along similar lines would become a staple of 1970s rock and Allan&#x27;s penchant for extreme, heavy, noisy guitar work displayed on tracks like &quot;Devil&#x27;s Rumble&quot;, &quot;Cycle-Delic&quot; and &quot;King Fuzz&quot; presaged 1980s acts like Sonic Youth.

<text>A vineyard ( , ) is a plantation of grape-bearing vines. Many vineyards exist for winemaking; others for the production of raisins, table grapes, and non-alcoholic grape juice. The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture. Vineyards are often characterised by their , a French term loosely translating as &quot;a sense of place&quot; that refers to the specific geographical and geological characteristics of grapevine plantations, which may be imparted to the wine itself.

==History==
The earliest evidence of wine production dates from between 6000 and 5000 BC. Wine making technology improved considerably with the ancient Greeks but it was not until the end of the Roman Empire that cultivation techniques as we know them were common throughout Europe.

In medieval Europe the Catholic Church was a staunch supporter of wine, which was necessary for the celebration of the Mass. During the lengthy instability of the Middle Ages, the monasteries maintained and developed viticultural practices, having the resources, security, stability and interest in improving the quality of their vines. They owned and tended the best vineyards in Europe, and &quot;vinum theologium&quot; was considered superior to all others.

European vineyards were planted with a wide variety of the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grape. In the late 19th century, the entire species was nearly destroyed in an event known as the Great French Wine Blight, in which the grape pest &quot;phylloxera&quot;, an insect related to aphids, was accidentally introduced to Europe from North America. Native American grapevines include varieties such as &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot;, which are resistant to the insect. &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; varieties were saved by being grafted onto the rootstock of Native American varieties, although there is still no remedy for &quot;phylloxera&quot;, which remains a danger to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.
== Modern practices ==


The quest for vineyard efficiency has produced a bewildering range of systems and techniques in recent years. Due to the often much more fertile New World growing conditions, attention has focussed heavily on managing the vine&#x27;s more vigorous growth. Innovation in &quot;palissage&quot; (training of the vine, usually along a trellis, and often referred to as &quot;canopy management&quot;) and pruning and thinning methods (which aim to optimize the Leaf Area/Fruit (LA/F) ratio relative to a vineyard&#x27;s microclimate) have largely replaced more general, traditional concepts like &quot;yield per unit area&quot; in favor of &quot;maximizing yield of desired quality&quot;. Many of these new techniques have since been adopted in place of traditional practice in the more progressive of the so-called &quot;Old World&quot; vineyards.

Other recent practices include spraying water on vines to protect them from sub-zero temperatures, new grafting techniques, soil slotting, and mechanical harvesting. Such technique have made possible the development of wine industries in New World countries such as Canada. Today there is increasing interest in developing organic, ecologically sensitive and sustainable vineyards. Biodynamic wine has become increasingly popular in viticulture. The use of drip irrigation in recent years has expanded vineyards into areas which were previously unplantable.

For well over half a century, New York&#x27;s Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and California State University, Fresno, among others, have been conducting scientific experiments to improve viticulture and educate practitioners. The research includes developing improved grape varieties and investigating pest control. The International Grape Genome Program is a multi-national effort to discover a genetic means to improving quality, increasing yield and providing a &quot;natural&quot; resistance to pests.

The implementation of mechanical harvesting is often stimulated by changes in labor laws, labor shortages, and bureaucratic complications. It can be expensive to hire labor for short periods of time, which does not square well with the need to reduce production costs and harvest quickly, often at night. However, very small vineyards, incompatible widths between rows of grape vines and steep terrain hinder the employment of machine harvesting even more than the resistance of traditional views which reject such harvesting.

== Current trends ==
Numbers of New World vineyard plantings have been increasing almost as fast as European vineyards are being uprooted. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of U.S. vineyards increased from , while Australian vineyard numbers more than doubled from and Chilean vineyards grew from . The size of individual vineyards in the New World is significant. Europe&#x27;s 1.6 million vineyards are an average of each, while the average Australian vineyard is , providing considerable economies of scale. Exports to Europe from New World growers increased by 54% in the six years up to 2006.

There have also been significant changes in the kinds of grapes that are grown. For example, in Chile, large areas of low-quality grapes have been replaced with such grapes as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.

In Argentina, due to an economic down-turn, acreage of Malbec was significantly reduced in the 1980s, but in the 1990s, during the quality revolution incited by Malbec Pioneer Nicolás Catena Zapata, growers started planting more Malbec, most notably in higher altitudes where cooler temperatures and more intense sunlight yield more concentrated yet smoother and more complex malbecs. Grape changes are often in response to changing consumer demand but sometimes result from vine pull schemes designed to promote vineyard change. Alternatively, the development of &quot;T&quot; budding now permits the grafting of a different grape variety onto existing rootstock in the vineyard, making it possible to switch varieties within a two-year period.

Local legislation often dictates which varieties are selected, how they are grown, whether vineyards can be irrigated and exactly when grapes can be harvested, all of which in serves to reinforce tradition. Changes in the law can also change which grapes are planted. For example, during Prohibition in the U.S. (1920–1933), vineyards in California expanded sevenfold to meet the increasing demand for home brewing. However, they were largely planted in varieties with tough skins that could be transported across the country to home wine-makers and the resulting wine was of a low quality.
According to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, in April 2015, China () overtook France () in terms of land devoted to vineyards, in second place behind Spain (), the world&#x27;s largest producer.

==Terroir==

Terroir refers to the combination of natural factors associated with any particular vineyard. These factors include things such as soil, underlying rock, altitude, slope of hill or terrain, orientation toward the sun, and microclimate (typical rain, winds, humidity, temperature variations, etc.). No two vineyards have exactly the same terroir, although any difference in the resulting wine may be virtually undetectable.

Vineyards are often located on hillsides and planted in soil that is of only marginal value to other plants. A common saying is that &quot;the worse the soil, the better the wine.&quot; Planting on hillsides, especially those facing north (in the southern hemisphere) or south (in the northern hemisphere), is most often in an attempt to maximize the amount of sunlight that falls on the vineyard. For this reason, some of the best wines come from vineyards planted on quite steep hills, conditions which would make most other agricultural products uneconomic. The stereotypical vineyard site for wine grapes (in the Northern hemisphere) is a hillside in a dry climate with a southern exposure, good drainage to reduce unnecessary water uptake, and balanced pruning to force the vine to put more of its energy into the fruit, rather than foliage.

The terroir philosophy is predominantly French in origin, the flavour and character of the place defining the individuality and the special attributes of wines and combined with hundreds of years of the finest wine making traditions, terroir gives wines their distinctive taste and signature. However, wildfires in California and Australia have also influenced the character of vineyard plantations and grapes in those areas.

==Vignette==
A vignette is a 500-square-metre vineyard which is part of a larger consolidated vineyard. Investors purchase a piece of land within a vineyard, and outsource the grape maintenance and production operations to an outside grape grower or wine producers. Because they are contracting under a co-operative structure, they benefit from economies of scale and hence cheaper labour and operational costs.

<doc id="167278" wikidata="Q346785" url="?curid=167278" title="Dick Dale">
<text>Richard Anthony Monsour (May 4, 1937 – March 16, 2019), known professionally as Dick Dale, was an American rock guitarist. He was a pioneer of surf music, drawing on Middle Eastern music scales and experimenting with reverb. Dale was known as &quot;The King of the Surf Guitar&quot;, which was also the title of his second studio album.

Dale was one of the most influential guitarists of all time and especially of the early 1960s. Most of the leading bands in surf music, such as The Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and The Trashmen, were influenced by Dale&#x27;s music, and often included recordings of Dale&#x27;s songs in their albums. His style and music influenced guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Eddie Van Halen and Brian May.

He has been credited with popularizing tremolo picking on electric guitar, a technique that is now widely used in many musical genres (such as extreme metal, jazz fusion, etc.). His speedy single-note staccato picking technique was unrivaled until guitarists like Eddie Van Halen entered the music scene.

He is cited as one of the fathers of heavy metal for pushing the limits of amplification. Working together with Leo Fender, Dale helped to develop new equipment that was capable of producing thick and previously unheard volumes including the first-ever 100-watt guitar amplifier. Dale also pioneered the use of portable reverb effects.

The use of his recording of &quot;Misirlou&quot; by Quentin Tarantino in the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; led to his return in the 1990s, marked by four albums and world tours. He was also nominated for a Grammy in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category for the song &quot;Pipeline&quot; with Stevie Ray Vaughan. In &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;, Dale was ranked 31st in 2003 and 74th in the 2011 revision.

==Early life==
Dick Dale was born Richard Anthony Monsour in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 4, 1937. He was of Lebanese descent from his father, James, and of Polish-Belarusian descent from his mother, Sophia &quot;Fern&quot; (née Danksewicz). His family subsequently moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, which at the time had a significant Lebanese population in the neighborhood of Quincy Point. He learned the piano when he was nine after listening to his aunt playing it. He was given a trumpet in seventh grade, and later acquired a ukulele (for $6 part exchange), after having become influenced by Hank Williams. The first song he played on the ukulele was &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;. He was also influenced musically by his uncle, who taught him how to play the tarabaki and could play the oud.

Dale then bought a guitar from a friend for $8, paying him back in installments. He learned to play the instrument, using both lead and rhythm styles, so that the guitar filled the place of drums. His early tarabaki drumming later influenced his guitar playing, particularly his rapid alternate picking technique. Dale referred to this as &quot;the pulsation&quot;, noting all instruments he played derived from the tarabaki. He was raised in Quincy until he completed the eleventh grade at Quincy High School in 1954, when his father, a machinist, took a job working for Hughes Aircraft Company in the Southern California aerospace industry. The family moved to El Segundo, California. Dale spent his senior year at and graduated from Washington Senior High School. He learned to surf at the age of 17. As a Lebanese-American, he retained a strong interest in Arabic music, which later played a major role in his development of surf music.

==Career==
===1960s===
Dale began playing in local country western rockabilly bars where he met Texas Tiny in 1955, who gave him the name &quot;Dick Dale&quot; because he thought it was a good name for a country singer.
Dale employed non-Western scales in his playing. He regularly used reverb, which became a trademark of surf guitar. Being lefthanded, Dale would become known for his unorthodox method of playing a right-handed guitar upside-down, doing so (like Albert King) without restringing the guitar (while Hendrix, by comparison, would restring his guitar). Even after he acquired a proper left-handed guitar, Dale continued to use his reverse stringing. He often played by reaching over the fretboard, rather than wrapping his fingers up from underneath.

He partnered with Leo Fender to test new equipment. In interviews Dale noted that Fender had stated &quot;When it can withstand the barrage of punishment from Dick Dale, then it is fit for the human consumption.&quot; His combination of loud amplifiers and heavy gauge strings led him to be called the &quot;Father of Heavy Metal&quot;. After Dale blew up several Fender amplifiers, Leo Fender and Freddie Tavares saw Dale play at the Rendezvous Ballroom, Balboa, California, and identified the problem arose from him creating a sound louder than the audience screaming. The pair visited the James B. Lansing loudspeaker company and asked for a custom 15-inch loudspeaker, which became the JBL D130F model, and was known as the Single Showman Amp. Dale&#x27;s combination of a Fender Stratocaster with a Fender Showman Amp allowed him to attain significantly louder volume levels unobtainable by then-conventional equipment. Furthering the development, the Showman Amp later added a second 15-inch JBL D-130 speaker, and it was named the Dual Showman Amp.

Dale&#x27;s performances at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa in mid to late 1961 are credited with the creation of the surf music phenomenon. Dale obtained permission to use the 3,000 person capacity ballroom for surfer dances after overcrowding at a local ice cream parlor where he performed made him seek other venues. The Rendezvous ownership and the city of Newport Beach agreed to Dale&#x27;s request on the condition that he prohibit alcohol sales and implement a dress code. Dale&#x27;s events at the ballrooms, called &quot;stomps&quot;, quickly became legendary, and the events routinely sold out.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot; is one of the first surf rock songs. This was followed by more locally released songs, including &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; and &quot;Surf Beat&quot; on his own Deltone label. His first full-length album was &quot;Surfers&#x27; Choice&quot; in 1962. The album was picked up by Capitol Records and distributed nationally, and Dale soon began appearing on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and in films where he played his signature single &quot;Miserlou&quot;. He later stated, &quot;I still remember the first night we played it (&quot;Misirlou&quot;). I changed the tempo, and just started &quot;cranking&quot; on that mother. And ... it was eerie. The people came rising up off the floor, and they were chanting and stomping. I guess that was the beginning of the surfer&#x27;s stomp.&quot; His second album was named after his performing nickname, &quot;King of the Surf Guitar&quot;.

Dale later said &quot;There was a tremendous amount of power I felt while surfing and that feeling of power was simply transferred into my guitar&quot;. His playing style reflected the experience he had when surfing, and projecting the power of the ocean to people.

Dale and the Del-Tones performed both sides of his Capitol single, &quot;Secret Surfin&#x27; Spot&quot; in the 1963 movie &quot;Beach Party&quot;, starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. The group performed the songs &quot;My First Love&quot;, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; and &quot;Muscle Beach&quot; in the 1964 film, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot;.

===Later career===
Surf rock&#x27;s national popularity was somewhat brief, as the British Invasion began to overtake the American charts in 1964. Though he continued performing live, Dale developed colorectal cancer. In the liner notes of &quot;Better Shred Than Dead: The Dick Dale Anthology&quot;, Dale quoted Jimi Hendrix saying: &quot;Then you&#x27;ll never hear surf music again&quot; in response to hearing he might be terminally ill. Dale covered &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; as a tribute to Hendrix. Though he recovered, he retired from music for several years. In 1979, he almost lost a leg after a pollution-related infection of a mild swimming injury. As a result, Dale became an environmental activist and soon began performing again. He recorded a new album in 1986 and was nominated for a Grammy. In 1987, he appeared in the movie &quot;Back to the Beach&quot;, playing surf music and performing &quot;Pipeline&quot; with Stevie Ray Vaughan. In 1993, he recorded a guitar solo for the track &quot;Should Have Known&quot; released as a vinyl single by the Southern California indie band, The Pagodas.

The use of &quot;Miserlou&quot; in the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; gained him a new audience. The following year, John Peel praised his playing following a gig in the Garage, London. Peel later selected &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot; as the theme tune for his BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Home Truths&quot;. The same year, he recorded a surf-rock version of Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Aquarium&quot; from &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; for the musical score of the enclosed roller coaster, Space Mountain at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.

Dale was inducted to the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame in 1996. In 2000 the U.S. House of Representatives elected Dale into the Library of Congress Hall of Records for outstanding achievements in music. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed Dale&#x27;s version at number 89 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.

In 2009, Dale was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. Dale is also a 2011 inductee into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California, in the Surf Culture category.

In June 2009, Dale began a West Coast tour from southern California to British Columbia, with approximately 20 concert dates. &quot;Forever Came Calling&quot; (or FCC) featured Dale&#x27;s then-17-year-old son, Jimmie Dale on drums, who opened for him. He was scheduled to play the Australian One Great Night On Earth festival to raise funds to benefit those affected by the Black Saturday bushfires and other natural disasters.

Dale said that he was forced to keep touring to the end of his life, because of his inability to afford his medical costs. He had many health issues, including diabetes, kidney failure, and vertebrae damage that made performing excruciatingly painful. At the time of his death, Dale had tour dates scheduled into November 2019.

==Personal life==
Dale was married three times. His first wife Jeannie in the 1970s was a Tahitian dancer in Hawaii and provided backup
vocals for the 1975 release &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;. Together, they created a musical revue and toured at resorts in Las Vegas, Reno and Lake Tahoe. From the proceeds, the couple made successful investments in nightclubs and real estate, allowing Dale to purchase his three-story 17 room dream mansion at &quot;the Wedge&quot; in Newport Beach. Jeannie toured with Dale and his Deltones through the early &#x27;80s up until their very public and bitter divorce in 1984, which depleted much of Dale&#x27;s accumulated wealth.

He met his second wife Jill in 1986. Together they had a son, James (who later performed professionally as Jimmy Dale), born in 1992. Dale credits Jill for his transition from surf music to a more raw and stripped-down style that consisted of just him and two other musicians. Jill provided back up vocals and drum tracks for Dale&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Tribal Thunder&quot; album. Dale married his third wife Lana in 2011. Dale later owned a home with a small private airstrip in the Mojave Desert east of Los Angeles, and flew his own private aircraft (a Piper Tri-Pacer). The airstrip was marked as &quot;Dale&quot; on the NOAA aeronautical charts.

He said that, for health reasons, he never used alcohol or other drugs, and discouraged their use by band members and road crew. In 1972, he stopped eating red meat. He studied Kenpo karate for over 30 years. In early 2008, he experienced a recurrence of colorectal cancer and completed a surgical, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment regimen.

==Death==
Dale died in Loma Linda, California, on March 16, 2019, at the age of 81. He was treated for heart failure and kidney failure prior to his death.

<text>The Battle of Mactan (; ) was fought on a beach in Mactan Island (now part of Cebu, Philippines) between Spanish forces led by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan along with local allies, and Lapulapu, the chieftain of the island, on the early morning hours of April 27, 1521. Magellan, a Portuguese-born commander serving the Spanish Empire who led an expedition that ultimately circumnavigated the world for the first time, commanded a small Spanish contingent in an effort to subdue Mactan under the Spanish crown. The sheer number of Lapulapu&#x27;s forces, compounded with issues associated with the location and the armor, ultimately resulted in a disastrous defeat for the Europeans and the death of Magellan. Surviving members of Magellan&#x27;s crew continued the expedition under the command of Juan Sebastian de Elcano, who completed the journey in September 1522.

The battle&#x27;s exact details are lost to history, with Antonio Pigafetta&#x27;s account being the only source for much of the known information today. It is remembered in the Philippines as the first battle won by a native Filipino against the Spanish forces, with Lapulapu being hailed as the country&#x27;s first national hero. The Spanish Empire would continue to send expeditions to the archipelago with little to no success until Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&#x27;s expedition to Cebu and Manila in 1565, starting a 333-year Spanish rule on the archipelago.

==Background==
Magellan&#x27;s expedition had left Spain in August 1519 on a mission to find a westward route to the Moluccas or Spice Islands. On March 16, 1521 (Julian calendar), Magellan sighted the mountains of what is now Samar. This event marked the arrival of the first documented Europeans in the archipelago. The following day, Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island.

There, Magellan befriended Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siagu, king of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu. There he met Rajah Humabon, the Rajah of Cebu. Then, Rajah Humabon and his queen were baptized into the Catholic faith, taking the Christian names Carlos, in honor of King Charles I of Spain, and Juana, in honor of King Charles&#x27; mother, Joanna the Mad. To commemorate this event, Magellan gave Juana the Santo Niño, an image of the infant Jesus, as a symbol of their new alliance and held their first Mass on the coast.

As a result of Magellan&#x27;s influence with Rajah Humabon, an order was issued to each of the nearby chiefs, to provide food supplies for the ships, and to convert to Christianity.
Most chiefs obeyed. Datu Lapulapu, one of the two chiefs on the island of Mactan, was the only one to show opposition: he refused to accept the authority of Rajah Humabon in these matters. This opposition proved influential. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan&#x27;s voyage chronicler, wrote that Zula, the island&#x27;s other chief, sent one of his sons to Magellan with gifts but Lapulapu prevented the journey and refused to swear fealty to Spain.

Rajah Humabon and Datu Zula suggested that Magellan go to Mactan to force the Datu&#x27;s compliance. Magellan saw an opportunity to strengthen the existing friendship ties with the ruler of the Visayan region and agreed to help him subdue the resistant Lapulapu.

==Battle==
Upon landing, Magellan&#x27;s small force was immediately attacked by the natives with a heavy barrage of ranged weapons, consisting of arrows, iron-tipped &quot;bamboo&quot; throwing spears (probably rattan &quot;bangkaw&quot;), fire-hardened sticks, and even stones. They surrounded Magellan&#x27;s landing party, attacking from the front and both flanks. The heavy armor of the Spaniards largely protected them from this barrage, inflicting only a handful of fatalities on the Europeans, but it was heavily demoralizing on the troops.

The musketeers and crossbowmen on the boat tried to provide support by firing from the boats. Though the light armor and the shields of the natives were vulnerable to European projectile weapons, the barrage had little effect, as they were firing from an extreme distance and the natives easily avoided them. Due to the same distance, Magellan could not command them to stop and save their ammunition, and the musketeers and crossbowmen continued firing for half an hour until their ammunition was exhausted.

Magellan, hoping to ease the attack, set fire to some of the houses, but this only enraged the natives. Magellan was finally hit with a poisoned arrow through his unarmored legs, at which time the natives charged the Europeans for close-quarters combat.

Many of the warriors specifically attacked Magellan. In the struggle, he was wounded in the arm with a spear and in the leg by a large native sword (likely a kampilan). Those who stood beside him were easily overpowered and killed, while the others who tried to help him were hacked by spears and swords. With this advantage, Lapulapu&#x27;s troops finally overwhelmed and killed Magellan. Pigafetta and a few others managed to escape.

According to Pigafetta, several of Magellan&#x27;s men were killed in battle, and a number of native converts to Catholicism who had come to their aid were immediately killed by the warriors.

Magellan&#x27;s allies, Humabon and Zula, were said to not have participated in the battle, at Magellan&#x27;s bidding. They watched from a distance.

===Aftermath===

Datu Lapulapu&#x27;s warriors recovered the body of Magellan. Humabon demanded the bodies of Magellan and of some of Magellan&#x27;s dead crew, in return for as much merchandise as the warriors wished, but they refused.

Some of the soldiers who survived the battle and returned to Cebu were poisoned at a feast given by Humabon. Magellan was succeeded by Juan Sebastián Elcano as commander of the expedition. After Humabon&#x27;s betrayal, he ordered an immediate departure. Elcano and his fleet sailed west. They reached Spain in 1522, completing the first circumnavigation of the world.

==In Philippine culture==

In Philippine history, the &quot;victory of Mactan&quot; is considered to have delayed the Spanish colonization of the Philippines by 44 years until the conquest by Miguel López de Legazpi in 1564–1565. Today, Lapulapu is retroactively honored as the first &quot;Philippine national hero&quot; to resist foreign rule.

Lapulapu is remembered by a number of commemorations: statues on the island of Mactan and at the Cebu Provincial Capitol, a city bearing his name, and a local variety of Red Grouper fish. Kapampangan actor-turned-politician Lito Lapid starred in a film called &quot;Lapu-Lapu&quot;, and novelty singer Yoyoy Villame wrote a folk song entitled &quot;Magellan&quot; that tells a humorously distorted story of the Battle of Mactan.

There is a spot in Mactan Island called the &quot;Mactan shrine&quot; where the historic battle is reenacted along the mangrove shorelines of the shrine during its anniversary and culminated with the &quot;Rampada Festival&quot;, a festival reenacting the victory celebration of Mactan after the battle. Appropriately called the &quot;Victory of Mactan&quot; (Cebuano: &quot;Kadaugan sa Mactan&quot;), the reenactment is considered as a grand celebration for Cebuanos and one of Cebu&#x27;s prime festivals together with the Sinulog of Cebu. Usually, during the re-enactment, Filipino celebrities, especially of Cebuano origin, play Lapu-Lapu, his wife Reyna Bulakna, and Ferdinand Magellan. In the same shrine, next to the Lapulapu statue, there is an obelisk erected in Magellan&#x27;s honor by the Spanish colonial authorities and defaced shortly after the US military occupation of the Philippines.

Magellan is also honored for bringing Catholicism to the Philippines in general and the Santo Niño (Child Jesus) to Cebu in particular. The Magellan&#x27;s Cross and the aforementioned Magellan&#x27;s shrine were erected in Cebu City. Many landmarks and infrastructures all over the Philippines bear Magellan&#x27;s name, mostly using its Spanish spelling (Magallanes), which is also a widely used Filipino surname.

The inhabitants of the Sulu archipelago believe that Lapulapu was a Muslim of the Sama-Bajau.

On April 27, 2017, in honoring Lapulapu as the first hero who resisted foreign rule in the country, the date April 27 when the battle happened was declared by President Rodrigo Duterte as &quot;Lapulapu Day&quot;.

<text>NBC News is the news division of the American broadcast television network NBC. The division operates under NBCUniversal Television and Streaming, a division of NBCUniversal, which is, in turn, a division of Comcast. The news division&#x27;s various operations report to the president of NBC News, Rebecca Blumenstein. The NBCUniversal News Group also comprises MSNBC, the network&#x27;s 24-hour liberal cable news channel, as well as business and consumer news channels CNBC and CNBC World, the Spanish language and United Kingdom-based Sky News.

NBC News aired the first regularly scheduled news program in American broadcast television history on February 21, 1940. The group&#x27;s broadcasts are produced and aired from 30 Rockefeller Plaza, NBCUl&#x27;s headquarters in New York City. The division presides over the flagship evening newscast &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, the world&#x27;s first of its genre morning television program, &quot;Today&quot;, and the longest-running television series in American history, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, the Sunday morning program of newsmakers interviews. NBC News also offers 70 years of rare historic footage from the NBCUniversal Archives online. NBC News operates NBCNews.com, the division&#x27;s official website.

==History==

===Caravan era===
The first regularly scheduled American television newscast in history was made by NBC News on February 21, 1940, anchored by Lowell Thomas (1892–1981), and airing weeknights at 6:45 p.m. It was simply Lowell Thomas in front of a television camera while doing his NBC network radio broadcast; the television simulcast was seen only in New York. In June 1940, NBC, through its flagship station in New York City, W2XBS (renamed commercial WNBT in 1941, now WNBC) operating on channel one, televised 30¼ hours of coverage of the Republican National Convention live and direct from Philadelphia. The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper New York State, for rebroadcast on W2XB in Schenectady (now WRGB), making this among the first &quot;network&quot; programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.

About this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC&#x27;s WNBT in New York City (WNBC) and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features as well as &quot;The War As It Happens&quot; in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program that was also seen in New York, Philadelphia, and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot; aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot; was renamed &quot;Camel Newsreel Theatre&quot; and then, when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot;.

In 1948, NBC teamed up with &quot;Life&quot; magazine to provide election night coverage of President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s surprising victory over New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. The television audience was small, but NBC&#x27;s share in New York was double that of any other outlet. The following year, the &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot;, anchored by John Cameron Swayze, debuted on NBC. Lacking the graphics and technology of later years, it contained many elements of modern newscasts. NBC hired its own film crews and in the program&#x27;s early years, it dominated CBS&#x27;s competing program, which did not hire its own film crews until 1953. (By contrast, CBS spent lavishly on Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s weekly series, &quot;See It Now&quot;). In 1950, David Brinkley began serving as the program&#x27;s Washington correspondent, but attracted little attention outside the network until paired with Chet Huntley in 1956. In 1955, the &quot;Camel News Caravan&quot; fell behind CBS&#x27; &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot;, and Swayze lost the already tepid support of NBC executives. The following year, NBC replaced the program with the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;.

Beginning in 1951, NBC News was managed by Director of News Bill McAndrew, who reported to Vice President of News and Public Affairs J. Davidson Taylor.

===Huntley-Brinkley era===

Television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late 1950s, and NBC News was called television&#x27;s &quot;champion of news coverage.&quot; NBC president Robert Kintner provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time. In 1956, the network paired anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and the two became celebrities, supported by reporters including John Chancellor, Frank McGee, Edwin Newman, Sander Vanocur, Nancy Dickerson, Tom Pettit, and Ray Scherer.

Created by Producer Reuven Frank, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; had its debut on October 29, 1956. During much of its 14-year run, it exceeded the viewership levels of its CBS News competition, anchored initially by Douglas Edwards and, beginning in April 1962, by Walter Cronkite.

NBC&#x27;s Vice President of News and Public Affairs, J. Davidson Taylor, was a Southerner who, with Producer Reuven Frank, was determined that NBC would lead television&#x27;s coverage of the civil rights movement. In 1955, NBC provided national coverage of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, airing reports from Frank McGee, then News Director of NBC&#x27;s Montgomery affiliate WSFA-TV, who would later join the network. A year later, John Chancellor&#x27;s coverage of the admission of black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print and prompted a prominent U.S. senator to observe later, &quot;When I think of Little Rock, I think of John Chancellor.&quot; Other reporters who covered the movement for the network included Sander Vanocur, Herbert Kaplow, Charles Quinn, and Richard Valeriani, who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in Marion, Alabama in 1965.

While Walter Cronkite&#x27;s enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for CBS and NBC News, with the work of correspondents such as Frank McGee, Roy Neal, Jay Barbree, and Peter Hackes, also provided ample coverage of American crewed space missions in the Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and Project Apollo programs. In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage, NBC configured its largest studio, Studio 8H, for space coverage. It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft, maps of the Earth and Moon to show orbital trackage, and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer Bil Baird were used to depict movements of astronauts before on-board spacecraft television cameras were feasible. (Studio 8H had been home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra and is now the home of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;) NBC&#x27;s coverage of the first Moon landing in 1969 earned the network an Emmy Award.

In the late 1950s, Kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network, making Bill McAndrew president of NBC News, reporting directly to Kintner. McAndrew served in that position until his death in 1968. McAndrew was succeeded by his Executive Vice President, Producer Reuven Frank, who held the position until 1973.

On November 22, 1963, NBC interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at 1:45  p.m... to announce that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas. Eight minutes later, at 1:53:12  p.m..., NBC broke into programming with a network bumper slide and Chet Huntley, Bill Ryan and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened. Still, the reports were audio-only since a camera was not in service. However, NBC did not begin broadcasting over the air until 1:57 p.m. ET. About 40 minutes later, after word came that JFK was pronounced dead, NBC suspended regular programming and carried 71 hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the funeral of the president—including the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of Kennedy&#x27;s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Jack Ruby as Oswald was being led in handcuffs by law-enforcement officials through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters.

===&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; era===

NBC&#x27;s ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the 1960s and fell sharply when Chet Huntley retired in 1970; he died of cancer four years later, in 1974. The loss of Huntley and RCA&#x27;s reluctance to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS&#x27;s funding of its news division left NBC News in the doldrums. NBC&#x27;s primary news show gained its present title, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, on August 3, 1970.
The network tried a platoon of anchors (Brinkley, McGee, and John Chancellor) during the early months of &quot;Nightly News&quot;. Despite the efforts of the network&#x27;s eventual lead anchor, the articulate, even-toned Chancellor, and an occasional first-place finish in the Nielsens, &quot;Nightly News&quot; in the 1970s was primarily a strong second. By the end of the decade, NBC had to contend not only with a powerful CBS but also a surging ABC, led by Roone Arledge. Tom Brokaw became sole anchor in 1983, after co-anchoring with Roger Mudd for a year, and began leading NBC&#x27;s efforts. In 1986 and 1987, NBC won the top spot in the Nielsens for the first time in years, only to fall back when Nielsen&#x27;s rating methodology changed. In late 1996, &quot;Nightly News&quot; again moved into first place, a spot it has held onto in most of the succeeding years. Brian Williams assumed primary anchor duties when Brokaw retired in December 2004. In February 2015, NBC suspended Williams for six months for telling an inaccurate story about his experience in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was replaced by Lester Holt on an interim basis. On June 18, 2015, it was announced that Holt would become the permanent anchor and Williams would be moved to MSNBC as an anchor of breaking news and special reports beginning in August.
In 1993, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; broadcast an investigative report about the safety of General Motors (GM) trucks. GM discovered the &quot;actual footage&quot; utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by including explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and improper sealants for those tanks. GM subsequently filed an anti-defamation lawsuit against NBC, which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with GM on the very same day.

On October 22, 2007, &quot;Nightly News&quot; moved into its new high-definition studio, Studio 3C, at NBC Studios in 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. The network&#x27;s 24-hour cable network, MSNBC, also joined the network in New York on that day. The new studios/headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area.

=== 2007–2016 ===

During the Great Recession, NBC Universal urged NBC News to save $500 million. On that occasion, NBC News laid off several of its in-house reporters, such as Kevin Corke, Jeannie Ohm, and Don Teague. This was the largest layoff in NBC News history.

After the sudden death of the influential moderator Tim Russert of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in June 2008, Tom Brokaw took over as an interim host; and on December 14, 2008, David Gregory became the new moderator of the show until August 14, 2014, when NBC announced that NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd would take over as the 12th moderator of Meet the Press starting September 7, 2014. David Gregory&#x27;s last broadcast was on August 10, 2014.

By 2009, NBC had established leadership in network news, airing the highest-rated morning, evening, and Sunday interview news programs. Its ability to share costs with MSNBC and share in the cable network&#x27;s advertising and subscriber revenue made it far more profitable than its network rivals.
On March 27, 2012, NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a 911 call placed by George Zimmerman before he shot Trayvon Martin. The editing made it appear that Zimmerman volunteered that Martin was black, rather than merely responding to the dispatcher&#x27;s inquiry, which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated. A media watchdog organization accused NBC News of engaging in &quot;an all-out falsehood.&quot; While NBC News initially declined to comment, the news agency did issue an apology to viewers. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the statement &quot;skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded.&quot;

On December 13, 2012, NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members, Aziz Akyavaş, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers, and Ammar Cheikh Omar, were kidnapped in Syria. Having escaped after five days in captivity, Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al-Assad was behind the abduction and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar al-Sham group five days later. Engel&#x27;s account was however challenged from early on. In April 2015, NBC had to revise the kidnapping account, following further investigations by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which suggested that the NBC team &quot;was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army,&quot; rather than by a loyalist Shia group.

In 2013, John Lapinski was Director of Elections, replacing Sheldon Gawiser. In 2015, the election team&#x27;s decision desk group was given its first permanent space at 30 Rockefeller, replacing the News Sales Archives that had occupied the space previously.

The NBC News Division was the first news team to possess the tape of Donald Trump recorded by &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, after a producer of the NBC show had made the News Division aware of it; the News Division internally debated publishing it for three days, and then an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Reporter David Fahrenthold, who contacted NBC for comment, notified the Trump campaign that he had the video, obtained confirmation of its authenticity, and released a story and the tape itself, scooping NBC. Alerted that the &quot;Post&quot; might release the story immediately, NBC News released its own story shortly after the &quot;Post&quot; story was published.

=== Sexual misconduct and NBC News ===

On November 29, 2017, NBC News announced that Matt Lauer&#x27;s employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York. NBC News management said it had been aware that &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; had been conducting independent investigations of Lauer&#x27;s behavior, but that management had been unaware of previous allegations against Lauer. Linda Vester, a former NBC News correspondent, disputed the claims that management knew nothing, saying that &quot;everybody knew&quot; that Lauer was dangerous. According to Ronan Farrow, multiple sources have stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer&#x27;s misconduct beforehand, but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure them into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual misconduct. &quot;Variety&quot; reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer&#x27;s current and former colleagues. Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days.

NBC News President Noah Oppenheim suggested an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein after NBC contributor Ronan Farrow pitched a general idea to report on sexual harassment in Hollywood. After a 10-month investigation by Farrow and NBC Producer Rich McHugh, NBC chose not to publish it. The story, with very few changes, was published a few weeks later in the &quot;New Yorker Magazine&quot; instead. A story on the subject of Weinstein&#x27;s alleged behavior also appeared several days earlier in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Following criticism for missing a major story it had initiated, NBC News defended the decision, saying that at the time Farrow was at NBC, the early reporting still had important missing necessary elements. Farrow later disputed this characterization, saying that he had multiple named accusers willing to come forward and that the version ultimately published in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; had very few changes from the version that NBC News rejected. This version went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, Ronan Farrow cites two sources within American Media, Inc. stating that the story was killed in response to an overt threat from Weinstein to out Lauer.

=== Hiring of Ronna McDaniel ===
In March 2024, NBC News hired Ronna McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) from 2017 to 2024. The hire stirred controversy, as McDaniel had been a staunch Donald Trump loyalist during her tenure at the RNC. She made false claims of voter fraud after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, which she sought to overturn.

After NBC hired her during her interview on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; with Kristen Welker, McDaniel backtracked on her claims, saying that Biden won the 2020 election &quot;fair and square&quot; and condemned political violence. She said of her conduct as RNC chair, &quot;When you&#x27;re the RNC chair, you — you kind of take one for the whole team, right? Now I get to be a little bit more myself.&quot;

==== Reversal of hiring ====
After two days of on-air protests by former Meet the Press anchor Chuck Todd and various MSNBC anchors including Rachel Maddow, Mika Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough and Nicolle Wallace NBC announced on 26 March that the network would not hire McDaniel.

On January 31, 2025, a Defense Department memo announced that NBC News must move out of its longtime workspace on the Correspondents&#x27; Corridor in the Pentagon, a move under a new Annual Media Rotation Program for the Pentagon Press Corps. In a statement, NBC News said, &quot;We&#x27;re disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we&#x27;ve used for many decades&quot;.

==Presidents==
Thirteen people have served as president of NBC News during its history: William R. McAndrew (managed since 1951, named president, 1965–1968), Reuven Frank (1968–1973, 1981–1985), Richard Wald (1973–1977), Lester Crystal (1977–1979), William J.

In August 2013, Deborah Turness assumed the role as President of NBC News, becoming the first woman to head the division. In February 2017, &quot;Today Show&quot; Producer and Executive Noah Oppenheim was named President of NBC News. Rebecca Blumenstein was named President of NBC News on January 10, 2023.

NBC News provides content for the Internet, as well as cable-only news networks CNBC and MSNBC. It produces a daily (formerly twice-daily show) called &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; for Snapchat&#x27;s Discover platform. It also produced programming for Quibi called &quot;The Report&quot;. The &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; team launched &quot;The Overview&quot; on Peacock in 2021.

===NBC News International===
In November 2016, NBC News Group chairman Andy Lack announced NBCUniversal intended to purchase a 25% stake in Euronews, a European news organization competing against the likes of BBC News and ITV News The transaction was completed at the end of May 2017; Deborah Turness, former President of NBC News, was appointed to run &quot;NBC News International,&quot; to perform NBC&#x27;s role in the partnership, in which each network would contribute reporting to the other.

In April 2020, NBCUniversal sold its stake in Euronews to focus all resources on the launch of NBC Sky World News, which was scheduled to launch later in 2020. However, the proposed new service was scrapped in August 2020, resulting in layoffs of 60 employees.

===NBC News Radio===
NBC News Radio is an all-news radio service produced by iHeartMedia through its TTWN Networks subsidiary, in partnership with NBCU&#x27;s news division. It has been available on iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia&#x27;s online live audio and podcasting platform, on different supports (Web and smartphone apps) since July 2016. It can be heard around the clock in 15-minute cycles with the latest news, sports, and other features. It uses the slogan &quot;The news you want, when you want it.&quot; It also supplies hourly newscasts to subscribing radio stations.

While NBCUniversal itself did not own it, NBC News Radio features reports from NBC News correspondents, presented by anchors who are iHeartMedia employees. It is also provided to NBC&#x27;s 24/7 News Source radio station affiliates as a service, including one-minute and two-minute hourly newscasts along with other audio content, such as features on money, health, politics, and sports, heard on over 1,000 radio stations. WOR in New York City serves as NBC News Radio&#x27;s flagship. iHeartMedia has ended the NBC News Radio brand in 2024, reverting back to its 24/7 News channel/platform.

The current NBC News Radio digital station is NBC&#x27;s first step into the all-news radio format since the closure of its ephemeral NBC News &amp; Information Service (NIS) was heard on radio stations across the U.S. from 1975 to 1977. The service was not profitable for NBC and was discontinued after two years. The original major NBC Radio Network was purchased by Westwood One a decade later, in 1987, as General Electric, which had acquired NBC&#x27;s parent company RCA, divested most properties not pertaining to the NBC television network, thus ending its direct participation in the radio business. NBC Radio Network&#x27;s news operation was merged into the Mutual Broadcasting System, then into Westwood One&#x27;s then-corporate sibling CBS Radio, and eventually assimilated into the syndicator itself.

For years, Westwood One has carried on syndicating several NBC-branded shows to affiliate radio stations, including audio versions of current-affairs NBC TV shows such as &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, a practice that continues to date. As for &quot;hard news&quot; programming, Westwood One used to provide a homonymous &quot;NBC News Radio&quot; service, which was initially limited to a feed of one-hour reports updated from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET offered to subscriber local stations. Dial Global –which has branded itself &quot;Westwood One&quot; since 2013– announced on March 5, 2012, its aim to expand NBC News Radio to a full-time 24-hour radio news network, replacing CNN Radio (that itself replaced both NBC Radio and Mutual in 1999). The original NBC News Radio service was eventually discontinued on December 14, 2014. That coincided with the launch of the new, white-label Westwood One News service. It used content from WarnerMedia&#x27;s CNN but was discontinued in 2019.

In addition to NBC News Radio, the audio portions of NBC News cable networks MSNBC and CNBC are available as Internet radio stations through the TuneIn podcasting service and the SiriusXM satellite radio platform.

===&quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; and &quot;NBC&quot; &quot;Nightside&quot;===
In 1982, NBC News began production on &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; with anchors Linda Ellerbee, Lloyd Dobyns, and Bill Schechner. It usually aired at 1:35 a.m. E.T., following &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

NBC News Overnight was canceled in December 1983, but in 1991, NBC News launched another overnight news show called &quot;NBC Nightside&quot;. During its run, the show&#x27;s anchors included Sara James, Bruce Hall, Antonio Mora, Tom Miller, Campbell Brown, Kim Hindrew, Tom Donavan, and Tonya Strong. It was based at NBC Network affiliate WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina. It provided an overnight news service that NBC affiliates could air until early morning programming began, providing programming to help them stay on the air 24/7. At the time, a few NBC affiliates had begun using CNN&#x27;s Headline News service to provide overnight programming, and NBC decided to offer the network&#x27;s own overnight news service. CBS and ABC also began their overnight news programming, as well. In addition, the facility produced a 24-hour news service aimed at Latin American viewers called &quot;Canal de Noticias, NBC. The service closed in 1997, and five years later, the network bought Telemundo.

&quot;NBC Nightside&quot; lasted until 1998 and was replaced by &quot;NBC All Night,&quot; composed of reruns of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and later from January 1, 2007, to September 23, 2011, &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;. NBC now airs same-day repeats of the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; and CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Money&quot; on weekdays, LXTV programs on early Sunday mornings, and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and &quot;Dateline&quot; encores on early Monday mornings.

==International broadcasts==
MSNBC is not shown on a channel outside the Americas. However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on OSN News in the MENA Region.

In the 2000s MSNBC was shown on sister network CNBC Europe, both in scheduled slots and during breaking news, although rebroadcasts of MSNBC have stopped. However, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; is still shown on the channel, while NBC News NOW rebroadcasts &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

In the Philippines, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; is previously both shown on 9TV (formerly Talk TV and Solar News Channel; now as RPTV), while &quot;Early Today&quot; was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, while &quot;Today&quot; dropped it in September 2014 to make room for the weekend children&#x27;s programming and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was the last to dropped it in March 2015, due to the firing of Brian Williams as anchor and the move of Lester Holt to main anchor position as well as the anticipation of rebranding of the said network to CNN Philippines in March of the same year (both &quot;Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; were both previously aired on ETC from 2004 to 2005 and the now defunct 2nd Avenue from 2005 to 2007; &quot;Nightly News&quot; was later moved to C/S 9 (later Solar TV) from 2008 to 2011, while &quot;Today&quot; retains it separately on 2nd Avenue until 2011). After five years of not airing it in the Philippine airwaves, both &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; returned in November 2020 as the launch programs of TAP TV (&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was later moved to its sister network TAP Edge from January to October 2021, until they returned it to the said network in October 2021). TAP TV may also occasionally air special coverage from NBC News, including the U.S. Elections every 2 years and the U.S. Presidential Inauguration every 4 years, as well as breaking news during regular broadcasts of &quot;Today&quot;. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate VSB-TV in Bermuda until 2014.

The Seven Network in Australia has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network&#x27;s imaging and slogans since the 1970s. &quot;Seven News&quot; has featured &quot;The Mission&quot; as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named &quot;Seven Nightly News&quot; from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news resources between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Weekend Today&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; are all broadcast on the Seven Network during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven&#x27;s morning show &quot;Sunrise&quot;.

In Hong Kong, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; is live digital television broadcast transmission (or delayed) on TVB Pearl daily from 7:00 AM until 8:00 AM Hong Kong Time (6:00 PM until 7:00 PM New York City Time).

In the United Kingdom, the ITV network used to air segments from &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; on their &quot;ITV News at 5:30&quot; morning newscast before it was canceled in December 2012. NBC News shares facilities and crew in the UK with ITN, which is the news provider for ITV. NBC News Now is shown as a linear channel on both the Sky and Virgin Media platforms in the UK. NBC News Now has been removed from these platforms as of December 2023 but remains free to view via YouTube.

==Theme music==
&quot;Meet the Press, NBC Nightly News,&quot; and special breaking news reports use movements from &quot;The Mission&quot; by John Williams as their themes. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004. &quot;Scherzo for Today,&quot; the third movement, was in use by &quot;Today&quot; until 2013, when it was replaced by a new theme by Alan Gubman.

<doc id="167286" wikidata="Q16150849" url="?curid=167286" title="History of Irish legislatures">
<text>A number of legislatures have existed in Ireland since mediaeval times. The first Irish legislature was the Parliament of Ireland. However, after its abolition, in 1801, there was no legislature in Ireland, of any kind until 1919. Since that date a number of legislatures have existed on the island.

==Parliament of Ireland==
This body consisted of the King of Ireland and two chambers: the Irish House of Commons and the Irish House of Lords) which existed in Lordship of Ireland (1171–1541) and the Kingdom of Ireland (1541–1800). This parliament operated under major restrictions, including Poynings&#x27; Law and the Penal Laws, imposed by the English and British Crown, by the English and British Parliament and by the King-in-Council. Many of these restrictions were removed in 1782, producing what became known as the Constitution of 1782. The Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.

It was subject to an Irish executive, presided over by the English/British selected Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (previously called the &#x27;Lord Deputy&#x27;), which was ultimately answerable not to it but to the English/British Government in London.

Over the centuries, the Irish parliament met in a number of locations both inside and outside Dublin. Among its most famous meeting places were Dublin Castle, the &quot;Bluecoat School&quot;, &quot;Chichester House&quot; and its final permanent home, the Irish Houses of Parliament in College Green, also sometimes called the Irish Parliament House. It is now generally called the &quot;Bank of Ireland&quot;, an institution which took ownership of the building in 1804 and used it as its headquarters until the 1970s, when a new headquarters was built. The former seat of parliament remains a branch of the bank.

In 1642–49, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, there was brief experiment in independent Irish government known as Confederate Ireland. Its legislature, the General Assembly, met once a year in Kilkenny to review the work of the executive branch (which it appointed) - the Supreme Council.

==Dáil Éireann (1919–1922)==
This was a revolutionary parliament formed by Irish MPs elected to the British House of Commons, who assembled in Dublin in January 1919. Dáil Éireann operated under a temporary constitution, called the Dáil Constitution, which created a prime minister called the President of Dáil Éireann (also known as Príomh Aire) and a Ministry of Dáil Éireann. During the period from August 1921 to January 1922, Éamon de Valera used the title President of the Irish Republic.

The Dáil met in two locations, in the Round Room of the Mansion House, and later in the then University College Dublin campus in Earslfort Terrace in Dublin, where its famously ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921.

==Parliament of Southern Ireland (1920–1922)==
The Parliament of Southern Ireland was created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and consisted of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and the Senate. This parliament did not in reality function, except to ratify the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922. In 1922, a government theoretically answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, called the Provisional Government of Ireland, was created under Michael Collins.

The House of Commons was officially based in the Royal College of Science in Dublin, now the Irish Government Buildings. However the Commons only met on a handful of occasions, primarily to ratify the Treaty in January 1922 and confirm Michael Collins as head of the Provisional Government.

==Oireachtas of the Irish Free State (1922–1937)==
This legislature consisted of the King and two chambers: the Free State Dáil and the Free State Seanad (Senate of Ireland). It created by the Irish Free State&#x27;s 1922 Constitution. The Seanad and the King&#x27;s role in the Oireachtas were both abolished by constitutional amendment in 1936. The executive was answerable to Dáil Éireann, was called the Executive Council and was presided over by a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council.

The Provisional Government under W. T. Cosgrave hired the use of the main lecture theatre of the Royal Dublin Society in its headquarters in Leinster House, a formal ducal palace, to enable a formal state opening of the new two chamber Oireachtas of the new Irish Free State and the delivery of the speech from the throne by the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State, Tim Healy in December 1922. In 1924, the new Free State under Cosgrave bought Leinster House as a temporary seat of parliament, pending the erection or conversion of an alternative. One major contender for the location was Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former soldiers&#x27; home that ultimately became a modern art gallery.

==Oireachtas Éireann (since 1937)==
This Oireachtas consists of the President of Ireland and two chambers: the modern Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. It was established by the 1937 Constitution. The executive is called the Government and is answerable to the Dáil. It is presided over by a prime minister called the Taoiseach. Though plans were periodically discussed for the erection of a new parliament building (a site was even considered in the Phoenix Park), parliament has remained in Leinster House, to which additional offices were added in the 1950s and most recently in the year 2000.

==Legislatures in Northern Ireland==
*Parliament of Northern Ireland - a home rule parliament of 1920–1972.
*Sunningdale Northern Ireland Assembly - a home rule assembly established in 1972.
*Northern Ireland Assembly (1982) - a home rule assembly established in 1982.

<text>Andrés Bonifacio y de Castro (, ; November 30, 1863May 10, 1897) was a Filipino revolutionary leader. He is often called &quot;The Father of the Philippine Revolution&quot;, and considered a national hero of the Philippines.

He was a co-founder and later &quot;Kataastaasang Pangulo&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot;, “Supreme President”, often shortened by contemporaries and historians to &quot;Supremo&quot;) of the &quot;Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan&quot; more commonly known as the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, a movement that sought the independence of the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule and started the Revolution.

Bonifacio reorganized the &quot;Katipunan&quot; into a revolutionary government, with himself as &quot;Pangulo&quot; (President) of a nation-state called &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot; (“Sovereign Nation of the Tagalog People” or “Sovereign Tagalog Nation”), also &quot;Republika ng Katagaluguan&quot; (Spanish: &quot;República Tagala&quot;, “Tagalog Republic”), wherein &quot;Tagalog&quot; referred to all those born in the Philippine Islands and not merely in Tagalog-speaking regions Hence, some historians have argued that he should be considered the First President of the Tagalogs instead of the Philippines; that is why he is not included in the official list of Presidents.

Bonifacio was executed in 1897 by Major Lázaro Macapagal under orders of the &quot;Consejo de la Guerra&quot; (Council of War) led by General Mariano Noriel, on the basis of committing sedition and treason against the government.

==Early life and education==
Andrés Bonifacio y de Castro was born on November 30, 1863, in Tondo, Manila, and was the first of six children of Catalina de Castro, a &quot;tornatrás&quot; from Zambales, and Santiago Bonifacio, a native of Taguig. His parents named him after Saint Andrew the Apostle, the patron saint of Manila on whose feast day he was born. He was baptized on December 3, 1863 by Fr. Saturnino Buntan, parish priest of Tondo Church. He learned the alphabet from his aunt. He was enrolled in Guillermo Osmeña&#x27;s private elementary school and also in &quot;Escuela Municipal de Niños&quot; on Calle Ilaya in Tondo. He reached third year in a private secondary school in Manila.

Some sources assert that he was orphaned at an early age, but the existence of an 1881 record that has Bonifacio&#x27;s parents listed as living in Tondo leaves this disputed. To support his family financially, Bonifacio made walking canes and paper fans which he and his young siblings sold (after they were orphaned, according to the traditional view). He also made posters for business firms, and this became their thriving family business that continued when Andrés and his brothers Ciriaco, Procopio, and Troadio, were employed with private and government companies, which provided them with decent living conditions.

In his late teens, he first worked either as an agent or &quot;mandatario&quot; (messenger) for the British trading firm Fleming and Company, where he rose to become a &quot;corredor&quot; (broker) of tar, rattan and other goods. He later transferred to the German trading firm Fressell and Company, where he worked as a &quot;bodeguero&quot; (storehouse keeper) responsible for warehouse inventory. He was also a theater actor and often played the role of Bernardo Carpio, a fictional hero in Tagalog folklore.

Not finishing his formal education, Bonifacio turned to self-education by reading books. He read books about the French Revolution, biographies of the presidents of the United States, books about contemporary Philippine penal and civil codes, and novels such as Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Eugène Sue&#x27;s &quot;Le Juif errant&quot; and José Rizal&#x27;s &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; and &quot;El filibusterismo&quot;. Aside from Tagalog and Spanish, he spoke some English due to his work in a British firm.

==Marriages==
Bonifacio&#x27;s first wife, Mónica (surname unknown), was his neighbor in Palomar, Tondo. She died of leprosy and they had no recorded children.

In 1892, Bonifacio, a 29-year-old widower, met the 18-year-old Gregoria de Jesús through his friend Teodoro Plata, who was her cousin. Gregoria, nicknamed “Oriang”, was the daughter of a prominent citizen and landowner from Caloocan. Her parents initially disapproved of their relationship for Bonifacio was a Freemason, and the movement was at odds with the Catholic Church. They eventually acquiesced, and Andrés and Gregoria were married in a Catholic ceremony at Binondo Church in March 1893 or 1894. The couple were married later that day in separate Katipunan rites at a friend&#x27;s house in Santa Cruz, Manila.

They had one son, Andrés, in early 1896 who died of smallpox in his infancy.

==Early political activism==

In 1892, Bonifacio became one of the founding members of José Rizal&#x27;s La Liga Filipina, an organization that called for political reforms in Spain&#x27;s colonial government of the Philippines. However, La Liga disbanded after only one meeting, for Rizal was arrested and deported to Dapitan in the Western Mindanao region. Bonifacio, Apolinario Mabini and others revived La Liga in Rizal&#x27;s absence and Bonifacio was active at organizing local chapters in Manila. He would become the chief propagandist of the revived Liga.

La Liga Filipina contributed moral and financial support to the Propaganda Movement of Filipino reformists in Spain.

==Katipunan==

On the night of July 7, 1892, the day after Rizal&#x27;s deportation was announced, Bonifacio and others officially &quot;founded&quot; the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, or in full, &quot;Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan&quot; (&quot;Highest and Most Respected Society of the Country&#x27;s Children&quot;; &quot;Bayan&quot; can also denote community, people, and nation). The secret society sought independence from Spain through armed revolt. It was influenced by Freemasonry through its rituals and organization, and several members including Bonifacio were also Freemasons. Within the society Bonifacio used the pseudonym &quot;May pag-asa&quot; (). Newly found documents though suggest that Katipunan has already been existing as early as January 1892.

For a time, Bonifacio worked with both the &quot;Katipunan&quot; and &quot;La Liga Filipina&quot;. &quot;La Liga&quot; eventually split because some members like Bonifacio lost hope for peaceful reform and stopped their monetary aid. The more conservative members, mostly wealthy members, who still believed in peaceful reforms set up the &quot;Cuerpo de Compromisarios&quot;, which pledged continued support to the reformists in Spain. The radicals were subsumed into the &quot;Katipunan&quot;. From Manila, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; expanded to several provinces, including Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija. Most of its members, called &quot;Katipuneros&quot;, came from the lower and middle classes, and many of its local leaders were prominent figures in their municipalities. At first exclusively male, membership was later extended to females, with Bonifacio&#x27;s wife Gregoria de Jesús as a leading member.

From the beginning, Bonifacio was one of the chief &quot;Katipunan&quot; officers, although he did not become its &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot; (Supreme President) until 1895. He was the third head of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; after Deodato Arellano and Román Basa. Prior to this, he served as the society&#x27;s comptroller and then as its &quot;fiscal&quot; (advocate/procurator). The society had its own laws, bureaucratic structure and elective leadership. For each province involved, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; Supreme Council coordinated with provincial councils in charge of public administration and military affairs, and with local councils in charge of affairs on the district or barrio level.

Within the society, Bonifacio developed a strong friendship with Emilio Jacinto, who served as his adviser and confidant, as well as a member of the Supreme Council. Bonifacio adopted Jacinto&#x27;s &quot;Kartilya&quot; primer as the official teachings of the society in place of his own &quot;Decalogue&quot;, which he judged as inferior. Bonifacio, Jacinto and Pío Valenzuela collaborated on the society&#x27;s organ, &quot;Kalayaan&quot; (Freedom), which had only one printed issue. Bonifacio wrote several pieces for the paper, including the poem &quot;Pag-ibig sa Tinubúang Lupà&quot; (approx. &quot;Love for One&#x27;s Homeland&quot;) under the pseudonym &quot;Agapito Bagumbayan&quot;. The publication of &quot;Kalayaan&quot; in March 1896 led to a great increase in the society&#x27;s membership. The &quot;Katipunan&quot; movement spread throughout Luzon, to Panay in the Visayas and even as far as Mindanao. From less than 300 members in January 1896, it had 30,000 to 40,000 by August 1896.

The rapid increase in &quot;Katipunan&quot; activity drew the suspicion of the Spanish authorities. By early 1896, Spanish intelligence was aware of the existence of a seditious secret society, and suspects were kept under surveillance and arrests were made. On May 3, Bonifacio held a general assembly of &quot;Katipunan&quot; leaders in Pasig, where they debated when to start the revolution. While some officers, especially Bonifacio, believed a revolution was inevitable, some members, especially Santiago Alvarez and Emilio Aguinaldo both of Cavite, expressed reservations and disagreement regarding the planned revolt due to lack of firearms. The consensus was to consult José Rizal in Dapitan before launching armed action, so Bonifacio sent Pío Valenzuela to Rizal. Rizal turned out to be against the revolution, believing it to be premature. He recommended more preparation, but suggested that, in the event the revolution did break out, they should seek the leadership of Antonio Luna, who was widely regarded as a brilliant military leader.

==Philippine Revolution==
===Start of the uprising===
The Spanish authorities confirmed the existence of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; on August 19, 1896. Hundreds of Filipino suspects, both innocent and guilty, were arrested and imprisoned for treason. José Rizal (José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Realonda) was then on his way to Cuba to serve as a doctor in the Spanish colonial army in exchange for his release from Dapitan. When the news broke, Bonifacio first tried to convince Rizal, quarantined aboard a ship in Manila Bay, to escape and join the imminent revolt. Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto and disguised themselves as sailors and went to the pier where Rizal&#x27;s ship was anchored. Jacinto personally met with Rizal, who rejected their rescue offer. Rizal himself was later arrested, tried and executed.

Eluding an intensive manhunt, Bonifacio called thousands of &quot;Katipunan&quot; members to a mass gathering in Caloocan, where they decided to start their uprising. The event, marked by the tearing of &quot;cedulas&quot; (personal identity documents) was later called the &quot;Cry of Balintawak&quot; or &quot;Cry of Pugad Lawin&quot;; the exact location and date of the Cry are disputed. The Supreme Council of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; declared a nationwide armed revolution against Spain and called for a simultaneous coordinated attack on the capital Manila on August 29. Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces to Manila. Other &quot;Katipunan&quot; councils were also informed of their plans. Before hostilities erupted, Bonifacio reorganized the &quot;Katipunan&quot; into an open &quot;de facto&quot; revolutionary government with him as Supremo of the rebel army and the Supreme Council as his cabinet. On August 28, Bonifacio issued the following general proclamation:

This manifesto is for all of you. It is absolutely necessary for us to stop at the earliest possible time the nameless oppositions being perpetrated on the sons of the country who are now suffering the brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this, please, let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the 29th of the current month, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose, it is necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill; or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulations we have put in force.

Mount of Liberty, 28 August 1896 – ANDRÉS BONIFACIO

On August 30, 1896, Bonifacio personally led an attack on San Juan del Monte (now San Juan) to capture the town&#x27;s powder magazine and water station (which supplied Manila). The defending Spaniards, outnumbered, fought a delaying battle until reinforcements arrived. Once reinforced, the Spaniards drove Bonifacio&#x27;s forces back with heavy casualties. Bonifacio and his troops regrouped near Mariquina (now Marikina), San Mateo and Montalban (now Rodriguez). Elsewhere, fighting between rebels and Spanish forces occurred in San Felipe Neri (now Mandaluyong), Sampaloc, Santa Ana, Pandacan, Pateros, Mariquina, Caloocan, San Pedro Macati (now Makati) and Taguig. The conventional view among Filipino historians is that the planned general &quot;Katipunan&quot; offensive on Manila was aborted in favor of Bonifacio&#x27;s attack on San Juan del Monte, which sparked a general state of rebellion in the area. However, more recent studies have advanced the view that the planned offensive did push through and the rebel attacks were integrated; according to this view, Bonifacio&#x27;s San Juan del Monte battle was only a part of a bigger whole – an unrecognized &quot;Battle for Manila&quot;. Despite his reverses, Bonifacio was not completely defeated and was still considered a threat. Further, the revolt had spread to the surrounding provinces by the end of August.

===Haring Bayang Katagalugan===
Influenced by Freemasonry, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; had been organized with &quot;its own laws, bureaucratic structure and elective leadership&quot;. For each province it involved, the Supreme Council coordinated provincial councils which were in charge of &quot;public administration and military affairs on the supra-municipal or quasi-provincial level&quot; and local councils, in charge of affairs &quot;on the district or barrio level&quot;. In the last days of August, the &quot;Katipunan&quot; members met in Caloocan and decided to start their revolt (the event was later called the &quot;Cry of Balintawak&quot; or &quot;Cry of Pugad Lawin&quot;; the exact location and date are disputed). A day after the Cry, the Supreme Council was reorganized by Bonifacio with the following:

The above was divulged to the Spanish by the &quot;Katipunan&quot; member Pío Valenzuela while in captivity. Teodoro Agoncillo thus wrote:

Milagros C. Guerrero and others have described Bonifacio as &quot;effectively&quot; the commander-in-chief of the revolutionaries. They assert:
One name for Bonifacio&#x27;s concept of the Philippine nation-state appears in surviving &quot;Katipunan&quot; documents: &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Nation of Katagalugan&quot;, or &quot;Sovereign Tagalog Nation&quot;) – sometimes shortened into &quot;Haring Bayan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Nation&quot;). &quot;Bayan&quot; may be rendered as &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;people&quot;. Bonifacio is named as the president of the &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot; in an issue of the Spanish periodical &quot;La Ilustración Española y Americana&quot; published in February 1897 (&quot;&quot;Andrés Bonifacio – Titulado &quot;Presidente&quot; de la República Tagala&quot;&quot;). Another name for Bonifacio&#x27;s government was &quot;Repúblika ng Katagalugan&quot; (another form of &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot;) as evidenced by a picture of a rebel seal published in the same periodical the next month.

Official letters and one appointment paper of Bonifacio addressed to Emilio Jacinto reveal Bonifacio&#x27;s various titles and designations, as follows:

*President of the Supreme Council
*Supreme President
*President of the Sovereign Nation of Katagalugan / Sovereign Tagalog Nation
*President of the Sovereign Nation, Founder of the Katipunan, Initiator of the Revolution
*Office of the Supreme President, Government of the Revolution

Later, in November 1896, while encamped at Balara, Bonifacio commissioned Julio Nakpil to compose a national anthem. Nakpil produced a hymn called &quot;Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan&quot; (&quot;Honorable Hymn of the Tagalog Nation/People&quot;).

Eventually, an 1897 power struggle in Cavite led to command of the revolution shifting to Emilio Aguinaldo at the Tejeros Convention, where a new government was formed. Bonifacio was executed after he refused to recognize the new government. The Aguinaldo-headed Philippine Republic (), usually considered the &quot;First Philippine Republic&quot;, was formally established in 1899, after a succession of revolutionary and dictatorial governments (e.g. the Tejeros government, the Biak-na-Bato Republic) also headed by Aguinaldo.

===Campaigns around Manila===
By December 1896, the Spanish government recognized three major centers of rebellion: Cavite (under Mariano Alvarez, Emilio Aguinaldo and others), Bulacan (under Mariano Llanera) and Morong (under Bonifacio). The revolt was most successful in Cavite, which mostly fell under rebel control by September–October 1896.

While Cavite is traditionally regarded as the &quot;Heartland of the Philippine Revolution&quot;, Manila and its surrounding municipalities bore the brunt of the Spanish military campaign, becoming a no man&#x27;s land. Rebels in the area were generally engaged in hit-and-run guerrilla warfare against Spanish positions in Manila, Morong, Nueva Ecija and Pampanga. From Morong, Bonifacio served as tactician for rebel guerrillas and issued commands to areas other than his personal sector, though his reputation suffered when he lost battles he personally led.

From September to October 1896, Bonifacio supervised the establishment of &quot;Katipunan&quot; mountain and hill bases like Balara in Mariquina, Pantayanin in Antipolo, Ugong in Pasig and Tungko in Bulacan. Bonifacio appointing generals for these areas, or approving selections the troops themselves made.

On November 7, 1896, Bonifacio led an assault on San Mateo, Mariquina and Montalban. The Spanish were forced to retreat, leaving these areas to the rebels, except for the municipal hall of San Mateo where some Spanish troops had barricaded. While Bonifacio&#x27;s troops laid siege to the hall, other &quot;Katipunan&quot; forces set up defensive lines along the nearby Langka (or Nangka) river against Spanish reinforcements coming from the direction of Mariquina. After three days, Spanish counterattacks broke through the Nangka river lines. The Spanish troops thus recaptured the rebel positions and surprised Bonifacio in San Mateo, who ordered a general retreat to Balara. They were pursued, and Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding Emilio Jacinto from a Spanish bullet which grazed his collar.

===Bonifacio in Cavite===

In late 1896, Bonifacio, as the recognized overall leader of the revolution, was invited to Cavite province by rebel leaders to mediate between them and unify their efforts. There were two &quot;Katipunan&quot; provincial chapters in Cavite that became rival factions: the &quot;Magdalo&quot;, headed by Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo, and the &quot;Magdiwang&quot;, headed by Mariano Álvarez, uncle of Bonifacio&#x27;s wife. Leaders of both factions came from the upper class, in contrast to Bonifacio, who came from the lower middle class. After initial successes, Emilio Aguinaldo issued a manifesto in the name of the &quot;Magdalo&quot; ruling council which proclaimed a provisional and revolutionary government – despite the existence of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; government. Emilio Aguinaldo in particular had won fame for victories in the province. The &quot;Magdalo&quot; and &quot;Magdiwang&quot; clashed over authority and jurisdiction and did not help each other in battle. After multiple letters were sent to Bonifacio urging him to come, in December 1896 he traveled to Cavite accompanied by his wife, his brothers Procopio and Ciriaco, and some troops, including Emilio Jacinto, Bonifacio&#x27;s secretary and right-hand man. Jacinto was said to be against Bonifacio&#x27;s expedition to Cavite. The Bonifacio brothers stayed in San Francisco de Malabon (present-day General Trias) during this time.

Upon his arrival at Cavite, friction grew between Bonifacio and the &quot;Magdalo&quot; leaders. Apolinario Mabini, who later served as Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s adviser, writes that at this point the &quot;Magdalo&quot; leaders &quot;already paid little heed to his authority and orders.&quot; Bonifacio was partial to the &quot;Magdiwang&quot;, perhaps due to his kinship ties with Mariano Álvarez, or more importantly, due to their stronger recognition of his authority. When Aguinaldo and Edilberto Evangelista went to receive Bonifacio at Zapote, they were irritated with what they regarded as his attitude of superiority. In his memoirs, Aguinaldo wrote that Bonifacio acted &quot;as if he were a king&quot;. Another time, Bonifacio ordered the arrest of one &quot;Katipunan&quot; general from Laguna named Vicente Fernandez, who was accompanying the &quot;Magdalo&quot; leaders in paying their respects to Bonifacio, for failing to support his attack in Manila, but the other &quot;Magdalo&quot; leaders refused to surrender him. Townspeople in Noveleta (a &quot;Magdiwang&quot; town) acclaimed Bonifacio as the ruler of the Philippines, to the chagrin of the &quot;Magdalo&quot; leaders, (Bonifacio replied: &quot;Long live Philippine liberty!&quot;). Aguinaldo disputed with Bonifacio over strategic troop placements and blamed him for the capture of the town of Silang. The Spanish, through Jesuit Superior Pio Pi, wrote to Aguinaldo about the possibility of peace negotiations. When Bonifacio found out, he and the &quot;Magdiwang&quot; council rejected the proposed peace talks. Bonifacio was also angered that the Spanish considered Aguinaldo the &quot;chief of the rebellion&quot; instead of him. However, Aguinaldo continued to arrange negotiations which never took place. Bonifacio believed Aguinaldo was willing to surrender the revolution.

Bonifacio was also subject to rumors that he had stolen &quot;Katipunan&quot; funds, his sister was the mistress of a priest, and he was an &quot;agent provocateur&quot; paid by friars to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was a Mason, a mere Manila employee, allegedly an atheist, and uneducated. According to these letters, Bonifacio did not deserve the title of &quot;Supremo&quot; since only God was supreme. This last allegation was made despite the fact that &quot;Supremo&quot; was meant to be used in conjunction with &quot;Presidente&quot;, i.e. &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot; (Supreme President, Kataas-taasang Pangulo) to distinguish the president of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; Supreme Council from council presidents of subordinate &quot;Katipunan&quot; chapters like the &quot;Magdalo&quot; and &quot;Magdiwang&quot;; in other words, while Mariano Álvarez was the &quot;Magdiwang&quot; president, and Baldomero Aguinaldo was the &quot;Magdalo&quot; president, Bonifacio was the Supreme President. Bonifacio suspected the rumor-mongering to be the work of the &quot;Magdalo&quot; leader Daniel Tirona. He confronted Tirona, whose airy reply provoked Bonifacio to such anger that he drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.

On December 31, Bonifacio and the &quot;Magdalo&quot; and &quot;Magdiwang&quot; leaders held a meeting in Imus, ostensibly to determine the leadership of Cavite in order to end the rivalry between the two factions. The issue of whether the Katipunan should be replaced by a revolutionary government was brought up by the &quot;Magdalo&quot;, and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The &quot;Magdalo&quot; argued that the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the &quot;Magdiwang&quot; contended that the &quot;Katipunan&quot; served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. Edilberto Evangelista presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish Maura Law. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given &quot;carte blanche&quot; to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be in charge of this committee. He tasked Emilio Aguinaldo to record the minutes of the meeting and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.

===The Tejeros Convention===

On March 22, 1897, the revolutionary leaders held an important meeting in a Friar Estate Residence at Tejeros to resume their discussions regarding the escalating tension between the &quot;Magdalo&quot; and &quot;Magdiwang&quot; forces; And also to settle once-and-for-all the issue of governance within the Katipunan through an election. Amidst implications on whether the government of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; should be established as a monarchy or as a republic, Bonifacio maintained that it should be established as a republic. According to him, they were all in opposition to the King of Spain, and all of the government&#x27;s members of any given rank should serve under the principle of liberty, equality, and fraternity, upon which republicanism was founded. Despite Bonifacio&#x27;s concern on the lack of officials and representatives from other provinces, he was obliged to proceed with the election.

Before the election began, he asked that the results be respected by everyone, and all agreed. The Magdalo faction voted their own Emilio Aguinaldo President &quot;in absentia&quot;, as he was involved in the battle of Perez Dasmariñas, which was then ongoing. The resulting revolutionary government established at Tejeros, calling itself the &quot;Republica de Filipinas&quot; (Republic of the Philippines) around a month later, was later superseded by a number of reorganized revolutionary governments also headed by Aguinaldo. These included the &quot;Republica de Filipinas&quot; of November 1897, commonly known today as the &quot;Republic of Biak-na-Bato&quot;, the Hong Kong Junta government-in-exile, the dictatorial government under which Philippine independence was proclaimed on June 12, 1898, and the revolutionary government now commonly known as the First Philippine Republic or &quot;Malolos Republic&quot;, inaugurated on January 23, 1899 as the &quot;Republica Filipina&quot; (Philippine Republic). The 1899 government is now officially considered to be the true &quot;first&quot; Republic of the Philippines, with the present-day government of the Philippines thus being the &quot;fifth&quot; Republic.

Bonifacio received the second-highest number of votes for president. Though it was suggested that he be automatically be awarded the Vice Presidency, no one seconded the motion and the Election continued. Mariano Trías of the Magdiwang was elected vice president. Bonifacio was the last to be elected, as Director of the Interior. Daniel Tirona, protested Bonifacio being appointed as Director of the Interior on the grounds that the position should not be occupied by a person without a lawyer&#x27;s diploma. Tirona suggested a prominent lawyer for the position such as Jose del Rosario. Insulted and angered, Bonifacio demanded an apology, since the voters had agreed to respect the election results. Tirona ignored Bonifacio&#x27;s demand for apology which drove Bonifacio to draw his gun and again he nearly shot Tirona, who hid among the people, but he was restrained by Artemio Ricarte of the &quot;Magdiwang&quot;, who had been elected Captain-General. Bonifacio declared: &quot;In my capacity as chairman of this convention, and as &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot; of the Most Venerable Katipunan of the Sons of the People, which association is known and acknowledged by all, I hereby declare null and void all matters approved in this meeting.&quot; He then promptly left the premises.

===Repudiation of Tejeros election results===
On March 23, 1897, the day after the Tejeros convention, Aguinaldo surreptitiously took his oath of office as president in a chapel officiated by a Catholic priest Cenon Villafranca who was under the authority of the Pope in Rome. According to Gen. Santiago Alvarez, guards were posted outside with strict instructions not to let in any unwanted partisan from the Magdiwang faction while the oath-taking took place. Artemio Ricarte also took his office &quot;with great reluctance&quot; and made a declaration that he found the Tejeros elections &quot;dirty or shady&quot; and &quot;not been in conformity with the true will of the people.&quot;

Meanwhile, Bonifacio met with his remaining supporters and drew up the Acta de Tejeros, wherein they gave their reasons for not accepting the election results. Bonifacio alleged the election was fraudulent due to cheating and accused Aguinaldo of treason for his negotiations with the Spanish. In their memoirs Santiago Álvarez (son of Mariano) and Gregoria de Jesús both alleged that many ballots were already filled out before being distributed, and Guillermo Masangkay contended there were more ballots prepared than voters present. Álvarez writes that Bonifacio had been warned by a Cavite leader Diego Mojica of the rigged ballots before the votes were canvassed, but he had done nothing. The Acta de Tejeros was signed by Bonifacio and 44 others, including Artemio Ricarte, Mariano Alvarez and Pascual Alvarez. Then, in a later meeting on April 19 in Naic, another document, the Naic Military Agreement, was drawn up which declared that its 41 signatories, &quot;... having discovered the treason committed by certain officers who have been sowing discord and conniving with the Spaniards [and other offensive acts]&quot;, had &quot;agreed to deliver the people from this grave danger&quot; by raising an army corps &quot;by persuasion or force&quot; under the command of General Pio del Pilar. The document&#x27;s 41 signatories included Bonifacio, Ricarte and del Pilar. The meeting was interrupted by Aguinaldo and del Pilar. Mariano Noriel and others present then promptly returned to Aguinaldo&#x27;s fold. Aguinaldo attempted to persuade Bonifacio to cooperate with his government, but Bonifacio refused and proceeded to Indang, Cavite planning to get out of Cavite and proceed back to Morong.

===Arrest, trial and execution===

In late April, Aguinaldo fully assumed the presidential office after consolidating his position among the Cavite elite – most of Bonifacio&#x27;s &quot;Magdiwang&quot; supporters shifting allegiance to Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo&#x27;s government then ordered the arrest of Bonifacio, who was then moving out of Cavite.

In April 1897, Aguinaldo ordered the arrest of Bonifacio after he received a letter that Bonifacio had burned down a village and ordered the burning of the parish house and church of Indang when the townspeople were unable to provide the required supplies and provisions. Many of the principal men of Indang, among them Severino de las Alas (a loyalist and supporter of Bonifacio), presented Emilio Aguinaldo with several complaints against Bonifacio that the Supremo&#x27;s men stole carabaos and other work animals by force and butchered them for food. On April 25, a party of Aguinaldo&#x27;s men led by Colonel Agapito Bonzón and Major José Ignacio &quot;Intsik&quot; Paua caught up with Bonifacio at his camp in barrio Limbon, Indang. The unsuspecting Bonifacio received them cordially. Early the next day, Bonzón and Paua attacked Bonifacio&#x27;s camp. Bonifacio was surprised and refused to fight against &quot;fellow Tagalogs&quot;, ordering his men to hold their fire, but shots were nevertheless exchanged. Bonifacio was shot in the arm by Bonzón, and Paua stabbed him in the neck but was prevented from striking further by one of Bonifacio&#x27;s men, who offered to die in Bonifacio&#x27;s place. Andrés&#x27;s brother Ciriaco was shot dead, while his other brother Procopio was beaten, and his wife Gregoria may have been raped by Bonzón. From Indang, a half-starved and wounded Bonifacio was carried by hammock to Naic, which had become President Aguinaldo&#x27;s headquarters.

Bonifacio&#x27;s party was brought to Naic initially and then to Maragondon, Cavite, where he and Procopio stood trial on May 5, 1897, on charges of sedition and treason against Aguinaldo&#x27;s government and conspiracy to murder Aguinaldo. The jury was composed entirely of Aguinaldo&#x27;s men and even Bonifacio&#x27;s defence lawyer himself declared his client&#x27;s guilt. Bonifacio was barred from confronting the state witness on the charge of conspiracy to murder on the grounds that the latter had been killed in battle. However, after the trial the witness was seen alive with the prosecutors.

The Bonifacio brothers were found guilty, despite insufficient evidence, and were recommended to be executed. Aguinaldo commuted the sentence to deportation on May 8, 1897, but Pío del Pilar and Mariano Noriel persuaded him to withdraw the order for the sake of preserving unity. In this they were seconded by Mamerto Natividád and other &quot;bona fide&quot; supporters of Aguinaldo. The Bonifacio brothers were executed on May 10, 1897, in the mountains of Maragondon. Apolinario Mabini wrote that Bonifacio&#x27;s death demoralized many rebels from Manila, Laguna and Batangas who had come to help those in Cavite, and caused them to quit. In other areas, Bonifacio&#x27;s close associates like Emilio Jacinto and Macario Sakay continued the Katipunan and never recognized Aguinaldo&#x27;s authority.

==Historical controversies==
The historical assessment of Bonifacio involves several controversial points. His death is alternately viewed as a justified execution for treason, and a &quot;legal murder&quot; fueled by politics. Some historians consider him to be the rightful first President of the Philippines instead of Aguinaldo. Some historians have also advocated that Bonifacio share or even take the place of José Rizal as the (foremost) Philippine national hero. The purported discovery of Bonifacio&#x27;s remains has also been questioned.

===Trial and sentencing===
Historians have condemned the trial of the Bonifacio brothers as unjust. The jury was entirely composed of Aguinaldo&#x27;s men; Bonifacio&#x27;s defense lawyer acted more like a prosecutor as he himself declared Bonifacio&#x27;s guilt and instead appealed for less punishment; and Bonifacio was not allowed to confront the state witness for the charge of conspiracy on the grounds that the latter had been killed in battle, but later the witness was seen with the prosecutors.

Teodoro Agoncillo writes that Bonifacio&#x27;s declaration of authority in opposition to Aguinaldo posed a danger to the revolution, because a split in the rebel forces would result in almost certain defeat by their united and well-armed Spanish foe. In contrast, Renato Constantino contends that Bonifacio was neither a danger to the revolution in general for he still planned to fight the Spanish, nor to the revolution in Cavite since he was leaving; but Bonifacio was definitely a threat to the Cavite leaders who wanted control of the Revolution, so he was eliminated. Constantino contrasts Bonifacio who had no record of compromise with the Spanish with the Cavite leaders who did compromise, resulting in the Pact of Biak-na-Bato whereas the revolution was officially halted and its leaders exiled, though many Filipinos continued to fight, especially &quot;Katipunan&quot; leaders who used to be close to Bonifacio. (Aguinaldo, unofficially allied with the United States, eventually did return to take charge of the revolution during the Spanish–American War.)

Historians have also discussed the motives of the Cavite government to replace Bonifacio, and whether it had the right to do so. The Magdalo provincial council which helped establish a republican government led by one of their own was only one of many such councils in the pre-existing Katipunan government. Therefore, Constantino and Alejo Villanueva write that Aguinaldo and his faction may be considered counter-revolutionary as well – as guilty of violating Bonifacio&#x27;s constituted authority just as they considered Bonifacio to violate theirs. Aguinaldo&#x27;s own adviser and official Apolinario Mabini writes that he was &quot;primarily answerable for insubordination against the head of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; of which he was a member&quot;. Aguinaldo&#x27;s authority was not immediately recognized by all rebels. If Bonifacio had escaped Cavite, he would have had the right as the &quot;Katipunan&quot; leader to prosecute Aguinaldo for treason instead of the other way around. Constantino and Villanueva also interpret the Tejeros Convention as the culmination of a movement by members of the upper class represented by Aguinaldo to wrest power from Bonifacio who represented the middle and lower classes. Regionalism among the Cavite rebels, dubbed &quot;Cavitismo&quot; by Constantino, has also been put forward as motivation for the replacement of Bonifacio. Mabini considered the execution as criminal and &quot;assassination...the first victory of personal ambition over true patriotism.&quot; He also noted that &quot;All the electors [at the Tejeros Convention] were friends of Don Emilio Aguinaldo and Don Mariano Trías, who were united, while Bonifacio, although he had established his integrity, was looked upon with distrust only because he was not a native of the province: this explains his resentment.&quot;

Writing retrospectively in 1948, Aguinaldo explained that he initially commuted the sentence of death but rescinded his commutation from the pressure of the Consejo dela Guerra (Council of War) including Generals Mariano Noriel, Pio del Pilar, Severino de las Alas, all of which are supporters and loyalist of Bonifacio, among with General Mamerto Natividad, Sr. Anastacio Francisco together with the poet and historian Jose Clemente Zulueta among many others
===Execution===
There are differing accounts of Bonifacio&#x27;s manner of execution. The commanding officer of the execution party, Lazaro Macapagal, said in two separate accounts that the Bonifacio brothers were shot to death, which is the orthodox interpretation. Macapagal&#x27;s second account has Bonifacio attempting to escape after his brother is shot, but he is also killed while running away. Macapagal writes that they buried the brothers in shallow graves dug with bayonets and marked by twigs.

However, another account states that after his brother was shot, Bonifacio was stabbed and hacked to death. This was allegedly done while he lay prone in a hammock in which he was carried to the site, being too weak to walk. This version was maintained by Guillermo Masangkay, who claimed to have gotten this information from one of Macapagal&#x27;s men. Also, one account used to corroborate this version is of an alleged eyewitness, a farmer who claimed he saw five men hacking a man in a hammock. Historian Milagros Guerrero also says Bonifacio was bayoneted, and that the brothers were left unburied. After bones said to be Bonifacio&#x27;s – including a fractured skull – were discovered in 1918, Masangkay claimed the forensic evidence supported his version of events. Writer Adrian Cristobal notes that accounts of Bonifacio&#x27;s captivity and trial state he was very weak due to his wounds being left untreated; he thus doubts that Bonifacio was strong enough to make a last dash for freedom as Macapagal claimed. Historian Ambeth Ocampo, who doubts the Bonifacio bones were authentic, thus also doubts the possibility of Bonifacio&#x27;s death by this manner.

===Bonifacio as first President of the Republic of the Philippines===

Some historians such as Milagros Guerrero, Emmanuel Encarnación, Ramón Villegas and Michael Charleston Chua have pushed for the recognition of Bonifacio as the first President of the Philippines instead of Aguinaldo, the officially recognized one. This view emphasizes that Bonifacio was not just the leader of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; as a revolutionary secret society, as traditional historiography has emphasized, but that he also established and headed a revolutionary government through the &quot;Katipunan&quot; from 1896 to 1897, before a revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo was first formed at the Tejeros Convention. Guerrero writes that Bonifacio had a concept of the Philippine nation called &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Tagalog Nation&quot;) which was displaced by Aguinaldo&#x27;s concept of &quot;Filipinas&quot;. In documents predating Tejeros and the First Philippine Republic of 1899, Bonifacio is called the president of the &quot;Sovereign [Tagalog] Nation&quot; and the &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot;.

The term &quot;&quot; historically refers to an ethnic group, their language, and script. Historians have thus viewed Bonifacio&#x27;s concept of the Philippine nation as restricted to the Tagalog-speaking regions of Luzon, as compared to Aguinaldo&#x27;s view of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao (comprising the modern Philippines).
In their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo and other Magdalo people claim Bonifacio became the head of the Magdiwang, receiving the title &quot;Harì ng Bayan&quot; (&quot;King of the Nation&quot;) with Mariano Álvarez as his second-in-command. Historians such as Carlos Quirino and Michael Charleston Chua suggest these claims stem from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Bonifacio&#x27;s neologism &quot;Haring Bayan&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Nation&quot;) as referring to Bonifacio himself instead of his concept of the nation, as was in truth reflected in his title &quot;Pangulo ng Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot; (&quot;President of the Sovereign Tagalog Nation&quot;), sometimes shortened to &quot;Pangulo ng Haring Bayan&quot; (&quot;President of the Sovereign Nation&quot;). Santiago Álvarez (son of Mariano) distinguishes between the &quot;Magdiwang&quot; government and the &quot;Katipunan&quot; Supreme Council headed by Bonifacio.

According to historian Chua, the &quot;first President&quot; issue has been confounded by over a century of Philippine historiography most often referring to Bonifacio as &quot;The Supremo&quot; and taking it to mean &quot;The Supreme Leader&quot;, thus ultimately taking him to have had dictatorial or monarchist ambitions as opposed to the later democratic and republican Philippine Presidents, when in fact &quot;Supremo&quot; was only a contraction of Spanish &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot; - a translation of Bonifacio&#x27;s actual title as head of the Katipunan in Tagalog, &quot;Kataas-taasang Pangulo&quot; (Supreme President) - and based on surviving documents, Bonifacio generally did not call himself by the plain term &quot;Supremo&quot; despite other people&#x27;s usage, but instead styled himself &quot;Pangulo&quot;, i.e. President. Chua further writes:

...even inside the Katipunan, Bonifacio struggled to make people understand his concept of the Haring Bayan not as an individual or a King, but as something else... Haring Bayan really meant the King, or the power, is the people (Haring Bayan), which is basically &quot;The Sovereign Nation&quot;... So when he signed himself as Pangulo ng Haring Bayan past 24 August 1896, that means he intended to be president of a national revolutionary government which aimed to be a democracy.

===Bonifacio as national hero===
José Rizal is generally considered the foremost of the national heroes of the Philippines and often &quot;the&quot; national hero, albeit not in law, but Bonifacio has been suggested as a more worthy candidate on the grounds of having started the Philippine Revolution. Teodoro Agoncillo notes that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not &quot;the leader of its liberation forces&quot;. Renato Constantino writes that Rizal is a &quot;United States-sponsored hero&quot; who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the American Occupation period of the Philippines – after Aguinaldo lost the Philippine–American War. The United States promoted Rizal, who was taken to represent peaceful political advocacy, instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule. Specifically, Rizal was selected over Bonifacio who was viewed as &quot;too radical&quot; and Apolinario Mabini who was &quot;unregenerate.&quot;

Historian Ambeth Ocampo gives the opinion that arguing for Bonifacio as the &quot;better&quot; hero on the grounds that he, not Rizal, began the Philippine Revolution, is moot since Rizal inspired Bonifacio, the Katipunan, and the Revolution. Even prior to his banishment to Dapitan, Rizal was already regarded by the Filipino people as a national hero, having been elected as honorary president by the &quot;Katipunan&quot;. Other historians also detail that Bonifacio was a follower of Rizal&#x27;s La Liga Filipina. León María Guerrero notes that while Rizal did not give his blessing to the Katipunan because he believed the time was premature, he did not condemn the aim of independence per se. Teodoro Agoncillo gives the opinion that Bonifacio should not replace Rizal as national hero, but they should be honored &quot;side by side&quot;.

Despite popular recognition of Rizal as &quot;&quot;the&quot; Philippine national hero&quot;, the title itself has no explicit legal definition in present Philippine law. Rizal and Bonifacio, however, are given the implied recognition of being national heroes because they are commemorated annually nationwide – &quot;Rizal Day&quot; on December 30 and &quot;Bonifacio Day&quot; on November 30. According to the website of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts: 
Despite the lack of any official declaration explicitly proclaiming them as national heroes, [Rizal and Bonifacio] remain admired and revered for their roles in Philippine history. Heroes, according to historians, should not be legislated.

Their appreciation should be better left to academics. Acclamation for heroes, they felt, would be recognition enough.
===Bonifacio&#x27;s bones===
In 1918, the American occupational government of the Philippines mounted a search for Bonifacio&#x27;s remains in Maragondon. A group consisting of government officials, former rebels, and a man reputed to be Bonifacio&#x27;s servant found bones which they claimed were Bonifacio&#x27;s in a sugarcane field on March 17. The bones were placed in an urn and put into the care of the National Library of the Philippines. They were housed at the Library&#x27;s headquarters in the Legislative Building in Ermita, Manila, together with some of Bonifacio&#x27;s papers and personal belongings. The authenticity of the bones was much disputed at the time and has been challenged as late as 2001 by Ambeth Ocampo. When Emilio Aguinaldo ran for President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935, his opponent Manuel L. Quezon (the eventual victor) invoked the memory of Bonifacio against him, the bones being the result of Bonifacio&#x27;s execution by the judiciary branch of the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo. During World War II, the Philippines was invaded by Japan beginning on December 8, 1941. The bones were lost due to the widespread destruction and looting during the Allied capture of Manila in February 1945.

<text>Michael Latham Powell (30 September 1905 – 19 February 1990) was an English filmmaker, celebrated for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger. Through their production company The Archers, they together wrote, produced and directed a series of classic British films, notably &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944), &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945), &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in the U.S.), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951). 

His controversial &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), which was so vilified on first release that it seriously damaged his career, is now considered a classic, and possibly the earliest &quot;slasher movie&quot;. Many renowned filmmakers, such as Francis Ford Coppola, George A. Romero, Brian De Palma, Bertrand Tavernier and Martin Scorsese have cited Powell as an influence. 

In 1981, Powell and Pressburger received the BAFTA Fellowship, the highest honour the British Academy of Film and Television Arts can bestow upon a filmmaker. Five of their films were featured on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest British films. In 2024, their work was explored in the documentary &quot;Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger&quot;, narrated by Scorsese. David Thomson writes &quot;There is not a British director with as many worthwhile films to his credit as Michael Powell.&quot; 

==Early life==
Powell was the second son and youngest child of Thomas William Powell, a hop farmer, and Mabel, daughter of Frederick Corbett, of Worcester, England. Powell was born in Bekesbourne, Kent, and educated at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury and then at Dulwich College. He started work at the National Provincial Bank in 1922 but quickly realised he was not cut out to be a banker.

==Film career==
Powell entered the film industry in 1925 through working with director Rex Ingram at the Victorine Studios in Nice, France (the contact with Ingram was made through Powell&#x27;s father, who owned a hotel in Nice). He first started out as a general studio hand, the proverbial &quot;gofer&quot;: sweeping the floor, making coffee, fetching and carrying. Soon he progressed to other work such as stills photography, writing titles (for the silent films) and many other jobs including a few acting roles, usually as comic characters. Powell made his film début as a &quot;comic English tourist&quot; in &quot;The Magician&quot; (1926).

Returning to England in 1928, Powell worked at a diverse series of jobs for various filmmakers including as a stills photographer on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s silent film &quot;Champagne&quot; (1928). He also signed on in a similar role on Hitchcock&#x27;s first &quot;talkie&quot;, &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929). In his autobiography, Powell claims he suggested the ending in the British Museum which was the first of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;monumental&quot; climaxes to his films. Powell and Hitchcock remained friends for the remainder of Hitchcock&#x27;s life.

After scriptwriting on two productions, Powell entered into a partnership with American producer Jerry Jackson in 1931 to make &quot;quota quickies&quot;, hour-long films needed to satisfy a legal requirement that British cinemas screen a certain quota of British films. During this period, he developed his directing skills, sometimes making up to seven films a year.

Although he had taken on some directing responsibilities in other films, Powell had his first screen credit as a director on &quot;Two Crowded Hours&quot; (1931). This thriller was considered a modest success at the box office despite its limited budget. From 1931 to 1936, Powell was the director of 23 films, including the critically received &quot;Red Ensign&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Phantom Light&quot; (1935).

In 1937 Powell completed his first truly personal project, &quot;The Edge of the World&quot;. Powell gathered together a cast and crew who were willing to take part in an expedition to what was then a very isolated part of the UK. They had to stay there for quite a few months and finished up with a film which not only told the story he wanted but also captured the raw natural beauty of the location.

By 1939, Powell had been hired as a contract director by Alexander Korda on the strength of &quot;The Edge of the World&quot;. Korda set him to work on some projects such as &quot;Burmese Silver&quot; that were subsequently cancelled. Nonetheless, Powell was brought in to save a film that was being made as a vehicle for two of Korda&#x27;s star players, Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson. The film was &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;, during pre-production of which Powell first met Emeric Pressburger in 1939.

===Meeting Emeric Pressburger===

The original script of &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; followed the book quite closely, but was too verbose and did not have a good role for either Veidt or Hobson. Korda called a meeting where he introduced a diminutive man, saying, &quot;Well now, I have asked Emeric to read the script, and he has things to say to us.&quot;

Powell then went on to record (in &quot;A Life in Movies&quot;) how:
Emeric produced a very small piece of rolled-up paper, and addressed the meeting. I listened spellbound. Since talkies took over the movies, I had worked with some good writers, but I had never met anything like this. In the silent days, the top [American] screenwriters were technicians rather than dramatists ... the European cinema remained highly literate and each country, conscious of its separate culture and literature, strove to outdo the other. All this was changed by the talkies. America, with its enormous wealth and enthusiasm and its technical resources, waved the big stick. ... The European film no longer existed. ... Only the great German film business was prepared to fight the American monopoly, and Dr. Goebbels soon put a stop to that in 1933. But the day that Emeric walked out of his flat, leaving the key in the door to save the storm-troopers the trouble of breaking it down, was the worst day&#x27;s work that the clever doctor ever did for his country&#x27;s reputation, as he was soon to find out. As I said, I listened spellbound to this small Hungarian wizard, as Emeric unfolded his notes, until they were at least six inches long. He had stood Storer Clouston&#x27;s plot on its head and completely restructured the film.

They both soon recognised that although they were total opposites in background and personality, they had a common attitude to film-making and that they could work very well together. After making two more films together, &quot;Contraband&quot; (1940) and &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), with separate credits, the pair decided to form a partnership and to sign their films jointly as &quot;Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.&quot;

===The Archers===
Working together as co-producers, writers and directors in a partnership they dubbed &quot;The Archers&quot;, they made 19 feature films, many of which received critical and commercial success. Their best films are still regarded as classics of 20th-century British cinema. The BFI 100 list of &quot;the favourite British films of the 20th century&quot; contains five of Powell&#x27;s films, four with Pressburger. Thomson writes that Powell and Pressburger &quot;struggle with great, clashing virtues—with marvelous visual imagination and uneasy, intellectual substance. &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going&quot; is a genuinely superstitious picture; &quot;49th Parallel&quot; is a strange war odyssey, with escaping Germans wandering across Canada—naïve, very violent, at times unwittingly comic, but possessed by a primitive feeling for endangered civilization; an interesting sequel is &quot;One of Our Aircraft is Missing&quot;—English fliers getting out of Holland; &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; is pretentious in its way, yet very funny and absolutely secure in its dainty stepping from one world to another ... &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; is delightful, &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; a beautiful salute to Englishness ... &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns.&quot;

Although admirers would argue that Powell ought to rank alongside fellow British directors Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean, his career suffered a severe reversal after the release of the controversial psychological thriller film &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, made in 1960 as a solo effort. The film was excoriated by mainstream British critics, who were offended by its sexual and violent images; Powell was ostracized by the film industry and found it almost impossible to work thereafter.

The film did, however, meet with the rapturous approval of the young critics of &quot;Positif&quot; and &quot;Midi Minuit Fantastique&quot; in France, and those of &quot;Motion&quot; in England, and in 1965 he was subject of a major positive revaluation by Raymond Durgnat in the auteurist magazine &quot;Movie&quot;, later included in Durgnat&#x27;s influential book &quot;A Mirror for England&quot;.

===Zoetrope Studios===
In 1982, Francis Ford Coppola invited Powell to be &#x27;senior director in residence&#x27; at his Zoetrope Studios. There, Powell &quot;pottered around&quot;, including starting to write his autobiography. Powell&#x27;s films came to have a cult reputation, broadened during the 1970s and early 1980s by a series of retrospectives and rediscoveries, as well as further articles and books. By the time of his death, he and Pressburger were recognised as one of the foremost film partnerships of all time – and cited as a key influence by many noted filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma.

==Personal life==

In 1927 Powell married Gloria Mary Rouger, an American dancer; they were married in France and stayed together for only three weeks. During the 1940s, Powell had love affairs with actresses Deborah Kerr and Kathleen Byron. From 1 July 1943 until her death on 5 July 1983, Powell was married to Frances &quot;Frankie&quot; May Reidy, the daughter of medical practitioner Jerome Reidy; they had two sons: Kevin Michael Powell (b. 1945) and Columba Jerome Reidy Powell (b. 1951). He also lived with actress Pamela Brown for many years until her death from cancer in 1975. 

Powell was introduced to film editor Thelma Schoonmaker by Martin Scorsese and London-based film producer Frixos Constantine. The couple were married from 19 May 1984 until his own death from cancer on 19 February 1990 at his home in Avening, Gloucestershire. The couple had no children.

His niece was the Australian actress Cornelia Frances, who appeared in bit parts in her uncle&#x27;s early films.

==Legacy==
David Thomson writes: I was fortunate enough to know Michael Powell in the last decade of his life. he was in America a good deal at that time: teaching for a term at Dartmouth; as director emeritus with Coppola&#x27;s American Zoetrope, as treasured Merlin in the court of Scorsese; and in his marriage to the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. I had the chance to watch many of his films with him, discussing them and learning the passion of his vision. It is all the more agreeable now to see Michael&#x27;s influence spreading: the ardent antirealist has inspired so many people; the man in love with color, gesture, and cinema helped to educate viewers as well as filmmakers—not lest in the two volumes of his autobiography, &quot;A Life in Movies&quot; ... The great Powell and Pressburger films do not go stale; they never relinquish their wicked fun or that jaunty air of being poised on the brink. To put an arrow in our eye—to leave a nurturing wound—that was Michael&#x27;s eternal thrill. I do not invoke the figure of Merlin lightly: Powell was English but Celtic, sublime yet devious, magical in the absolute certainty that imagination rules.
* Cited as a major influence on many film-makers such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George A. Romero and Bertrand Tavernier. Said Thelma Schoonmaker (Scorsese&#x27;s long-time film editor and Powell&#x27;s third wife) of Scorsese, &quot;Anyone he meets, or the actors he works with, he immediately starts bombarding with Powell and Pressburger movies.&quot; Scorsese and Schoonmaker are working on restoring Powell&#x27;s films, beginning with &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;.
* The Michael Powell Award for the Best New British Feature was instigated in 1993 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (awarded 1993–2010 and 2012–2021). It was sponsored by the UK Film Council and was &quot;named in homage to one of Britain&#x27;s most original filmmakers&quot;.
* Pinewood Studios, where Powell made many of his most notable films, has named a mixing theatre in the post-production department after him: The Powell Theatre. A giant picture of the director covers the door to the theatre, where many well-known films are mixed.
* The Film, Radio and Television Department of Canterbury Christ Church University has its main building named after him: The Powell Building.
* He has been played on screen by Alastair Thomson Mills in the award-winning short film (2022) which explores Moira Shearer&#x27;s life changing decision to appear in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. 
* A celebration entitled &#x27;Cinema Unbound: The Creative Worlds of Powell and Pressburger&#x27; was held by the British Film Institute in 2023, including a UK-wide programme of films and an exhibit of production and promotion materials from &quot;The Red Shoes.&quot;
* Powell&#x27;s work was explored in the documentary &quot;Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger&quot; (2024), with narration by Martin Scorsese.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as &quot;the most trusted man in America&quot; after being so named in an opinion poll. Cronkite received numerous honors including two Peabody Awards, a George Polk Award, an Emmy Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Cronkite reported many events from 1937 to 1981, including bombings in World War II; the Nuremberg trials; combat in the Vietnam War; the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings; Watergate; the Iran Hostage Crisis; and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King Jr., and Beatles musician John Lennon. He was also known for his extensive coverage of the U.S. space program, from Project Mercury to the Moon landings to the Space Shuttle. He was the only non-NASA recipient of an Ambassador of Exploration award. Cronkite is known for his departing catchphrase, &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is&quot;, followed by the date of the broadcast.

== Early life and education ==
Cronkite was born on November 4, 1916, in Saint Joseph, Missouri, the son of Helen Lena (née Fritsche) and Dr. Walter Leland Cronkite, a dentist.

Cronkite lived in Kansas City, Missouri, until he was 10, when his family moved to Houston, Texas. He attended elementary school at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School (now Baker Montessori School), junior high school at Lanier Junior High School (now Lanier Middle School) in Houston, and high school at San Jacinto High School, where he edited the high school newspaper. He was a member of the Boy Scouts. He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), entering in the fall term of 1933, where he worked on the &quot;Daily Texan&quot; and became a member of the Nu chapter of the Chi Phi fraternity. He also was a member of the Houston chapter of DeMolay, a Masonic fraternal organization for boys.

While attending UT, Cronkite had his first taste of performance, appearing in a play with fellow student Eli Wallach. He dropped out in 1935, not returning for the fall term, to concentrate on journalism.

== Career ==
Cronkite left college in his junior year, in the fall term of 1935, after starting a series of newspaper reporting jobs covering news and sports. He entered broadcasting as a radio announcer for WKY in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1936, he met his future wife, Mary Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Maxwell, while working as the sports announcer for KCMO (AM) in Kansas City, Missouri. His broadcast name was &quot;Walter Wilcox&quot;.

He would explain later that radio stations at the time did not want people to use their real names for fear of taking their listeners with them if they left. In Kansas City, he joined the United Press International in 1937.

With his name now established, he received a job offer from Edward R. Murrow at CBS News to join the Murrow Boys team of war correspondents, relieving Bill Downs as the head of the Moscow bureau. CBS offered Cronkite $125 ($2,235 in 2020 money) a week along with &quot;commercial fees&quot; amounting to $25 ($447 in 2020) for almost every time Cronkite reported on air. Up to that point, he had been making $57.50 ($1,027 in 2020) per week at UP, but he had reservations about broadcasting. He initially accepted the offer. When he informed his boss Harrison Salisbury, UP countered with a raise of $17.50 ($312 in 2020) per week; Hugh Baillie also offered him an extra $20 ($357 in 2020) per week to stay. Cronkite ultimately accepted the UP offer, a move which angered Murrow and drove a wedge between them that would last for years.

Cronkite became one of the top American reporters in World War II, covering battles in North Africa and Europe. He was on board starting in Norfolk, Virginia, through her service off the coast of North Africa as part of Operation Torch, and then back to the US. On the return trip, Cronkite was flown off &quot;Texas&quot; in one of her Vought OS2U Kingfisher aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance. He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on to return to the US and to issue the first uncensored news reports to be published about Operation Torch. Cronkite&#x27;s experiences aboard &quot;Texas&quot; launched his career as a war correspondent. Subsequently, he was one of eight journalists selected by the United States Army Air Forces to fly bombing raids over Germany in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress as part of group called The Writing 69th, and during a mission fired a machine gun at a German fighter. He also landed in a glider with the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Market Garden and covered the Battle of the Bulge. After the war, he covered the Nuremberg trials and served as the United Press main reporter in Moscow from 1946 to 1948.

=== Early years at CBS ===
In 1950, Cronkite joined CBS News in its young and growing television division, again recruited by Murrow. Cronkite began working at WTOP-TV (now WUSA), the CBS affiliate in Washington, D.C.. He originally served as anchor of the network&#x27;s 15-minute late-Sunday-evening newscast &quot;Up To the Minute&quot;, which followed &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; at 11:00 pm ET from 1951 through 1962.

Although it was widely reported that the term &quot;anchor&quot; was coined to describe Cronkite&#x27;s role at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, marking the first nationally televised convention coverage, other news presenters bore the title before him. Cronkite anchored the network&#x27;s coverage of the 1952 presidential election as well as later conventions. In 1964 he was temporarily replaced by the team of Robert Trout and Roger Mudd; this proved to be a mistake, and Cronkite returned to the anchor chair for future political conventions.

From 1953 to 1957, Cronkite hosted the CBS program &quot;You Are There&quot;, which reenacted historical events, using the format of a news report. His famous last line for these programs was: &quot;What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times ... and you were there.&quot; In 1971, the show was revived and redesigned to attract an audience of teenagers and young adults, hosted again by Cronkite on Saturday mornings. In 1957, he began hosting &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot; (eventually renamed &quot;The 20th Century&quot;), a documentary series about important historical events of the century composed almost exclusively of newsreel footage and interviews. A long-running hit, the show was again renamed as &quot;The 21st Century&quot; in 1967 with Cronkite hosting speculative reporting on the future for another three years. Cronkite also hosted &quot;It&#x27;s News to Me&quot;, a game show based on news events.

During the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956 Cronkite hosted the CBS news-discussion series &quot;Pick the Winner&quot;.

Another of his network assignments was &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, CBS&#x27; short-lived challenge to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as &quot;one of the highlights&quot; of the show. He added, &quot;A puppet can render opinions on people and things that a human commentator would not feel free to utter. I was and I am proud of it.&quot; Cronkite also angered the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the show&#x27;s sponsor, by grammatically correcting its advertising slogan. Instead of saying &quot;Winston tastes good like a cigarette should&quot; verbatim, he substituted &quot;as&quot; for &quot;like.&quot;

He was the lead broadcaster of the network&#x27;s coverage of the 1960 Winter Olympics, the first-ever time such an event was televised in the United States. He replaced Jim McKay, who had suffered a mental breakdown.

=== Anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; ===

On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards as anchorman of CBS&#x27;s nightly feature newscast, tentatively renamed &quot;Walter Cronkite with the News&quot;, but later the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on September 2, 1963, when the show was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television&#x27;s first nightly half-hour news program. Cronkite&#x27;s tenure as anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; made him an icon in television news.

During the early part of his tenure anchoring the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Cronkite competed against NBC&#x27;s anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot;. For much of the 1960s, &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; had more viewers than Cronkite&#x27;s broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS&#x27; ascendancy to the top of the ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite&#x27;s wire service experience, and in 1967 the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; began to surpass &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; in viewership during the summer months.

In 1969, during the Apollo 11 (with co-host and former astronaut Wally Schirra) and Apollo 13 Moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions. In 1970, when Huntley retired, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist John Chancellor, Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981.

One of Cronkite&#x27;s trademarks was ending the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with the phrase &quot;...And that&#x27;s the way it is,&quot; followed by the date. Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary. Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the Iran hostage crisis, Cronkite added the length of the hostages&#x27; captivity to the show&#x27;s closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.

== Historic moments==
=== Kennedy&#x27;s assassination ===

Cronkite is vividly remembered for breaking the news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy on Friday, November 22, 1963. Cronkite had been standing at the United Press International wire machine in the CBS newsroom as the bulletin of the President&#x27;s shooting broke and he clamored to get on the air to break the news as he wanted CBS to be the first network to do so.

There was a problem facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no television camera in the studio at the time, as the technical crew was working on it. Eventually, the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence but the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera to see if they could get it set up quicker.

Meanwhile, CBS was ten minutes into its live broadcast of the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns (ATWT)&quot;, which had begun at the very minute of the shooting. A &quot;CBS News Bulletin&quot; bumper slide abruptly broke into the broadcast at 1:40 pm EST. Over the slide, Cronkite began reading what would be the first of three audio-only bulletins that were filed in the next twenty minutes:

While Cronkite was reading this bulletin, a second one arrived, mentioning the severity of Kennedy&#x27;s wounds:

Just before the bulletin cut out, a CBS News staffer was heard saying &quot;Connally too,&quot; apparently having just heard the news that Texas Governor John Connally had also been shot while riding in the presidential limousine with his wife Nellie and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy.

CBS then rejoined the telecast of &quot;ATWT&quot; during a commercial break, which was followed by show announcer Dan McCullough&#x27;s usual fee plug for the first half of the program and the network&#x27;s 1:45 pm station identification break. Just before the second half of &quot;ATWT&quot; was to begin, the network broke in with the bumper slide a second time. In this bulletin Cronkite reported in greater detail about the assassination attempt on the President, while also breaking the news of Governor Connally&#x27;s shooting:

Cronkite then recapped the events as they had happened: that the President and Governor Connally had been shot and were in the emergency room at Parkland Hospital, and no one knew their condition as yet. CBS then decided to return to &quot;ATWT&quot;, which was now midway through its second segment.

The cast had continued to perform live while Cronkite&#x27;s bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. &quot;ATWT&quot; then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break would be the last anyone would see of any network&#x27;s programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy had been shot in the head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 pm EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS&#x27; affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.

Within twenty seconds of the announcement, every CBS affiliate except Dallas&#x27; KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network&#x27;s feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made on the life of the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy&#x27;s condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.

After several minutes, the coverage came back to the CBS newsroom where Cronkite reported that the President had been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report from KRLD that someone had been arrested in the assassination attempt at the Texas School Book Depository. Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD&#x27;s feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy&#x27;s death.

CBS cut back to Cronkite reporting that one of the priests had administered last rites to the president. In the next few minutes, several more bulletins reporting that Kennedy had died were given to Cronkite, including one from CBS&#x27;s own correspondent Dan Rather that had been reported as confirmation of Kennedy&#x27;s death by CBS Radio. As these bulletins came into the newsroom, it was becoming clearer that Kennedy had in fact died. Cronkite, however, stressed that these bulletins were simply reports and not any official confirmation of the President&#x27;s condition; some of his colleagues recounted in 2013 that his early career as a wire service reporter taught him to wait for official word before reporting a story. Still, as more word came in, Cronkite seemed to be resigned to the fact that it was only a matter of time before the assassination was confirmed. He appeared to concede this when, several minutes after he received the Rather report, he received word that the two priests who gave the last rites to Kennedy told reporters on the scene that he was dead. Cronkite said that report &quot;seems to be as close to official as we can get&quot;, but would not declare it as such. Nor did he do so with a report from Washington, DC that came moments later, which said that government sources were now reporting the President was dead (this information was passed on to ABC as well, which took it as official confirmation and reported it as such; NBC did not report this information at all and chose instead to rely on reports from Charles Murphy and Robert MacNeil to confirm their suspicions).

At 2:38 pm EST, while filling in time with some observations about the security presence in Dallas, which had been increased due to violent acts against United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson in the city earlier that year, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took off his glasses, and made the official announcement:

After making that announcement, Cronkite paused briefly, put his glasses back on, and swallowed hard to maintain his composure. With noticeable emotion in his voice he intoned the next sentence of the news report:

With emotion still in his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again recapped the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining the significance of the pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally&#x27;s condition was still unknown, and that there was no report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while.

At about 3:30 pm EST, Cronkite came back into the newsroom to relay some new information. The two major pieces of information involved the Oath of Office being administered to now-President Johnson, and that Dallas police had arrested a man named Lee Harvey Oswald whom they suspected had fired the fatal shots. After that, Cronkite left again to begin preparing for that night&#x27;s &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, which he returned to anchor as normal. For the next four days, along with his colleagues, Cronkite continued to report segments of uninterrupted coverage of the assassination, including the announcement of Oswald&#x27;s death in the hands of Jack Ruby on Sunday. The next day, on the day of the funeral, Cronkite concluded the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with the following assessment about the events of the last four dark days:

Referring to his coverage of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, in a 2006 TV interview with Nick Clooney, Cronkite recalled:

In a 2003 CBS special commemorating the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Cronkite recalled his reaction upon having the death confirmed to him, he said:

According to historian Douglas Brinkley, Cronkite provided a sense of perspective throughout the unfolding sequence of disturbing events.

=== Vietnam War ===

In mid-February 1968, on the urging of his executive producer Ernest Leiser, Cronkite and Leiser journeyed to Vietnam to cover the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. They were invited to dine with General Creighton Abrams, the deputy commander of all forces in Vietnam, whom Cronkite knew from World War II. According to Leiser, Abrams told Cronkite, &quot;we cannot win this Goddamned war, and we ought to find a dignified way out.&quot;

Upon return, Cronkite and Leiser wrote separate editorial reports based on that trip. Cronkite, an excellent writer, preferred Leiser&#x27;s text over his own. On February 27, 1968, Cronkite closed &quot;Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?&quot; with that editorial report:

Following Cronkite&#x27;s editorial report, President Lyndon B. Johnson is claimed by some to have said, &quot;If I&#x27;ve lost Cronkite, I&#x27;ve lost Middle America.&quot; However, this account of Johnson has been questioned by other observers in books on journalistic accuracy. At the time the editorial aired, Johnson was in Austin, Texas, attending Texas Governor John Connally&#x27;s birthday gala and was giving a speech in his honor.

In his book &quot;This Just In: What I Couldn&#x27;t Tell You on TV&quot;, CBS News correspondent Bob Schieffer, who was serving as a reporter for the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; when Cronkite&#x27;s editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson&#x27;s aide George Christian &quot;told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day&quot; and that &quot;That&#x27;s when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it.&quot; When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir &quot;A Reporter&#x27;s Life&quot;, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson&#x27;s decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him the President had made the statement was a recount from Bill Moyers, a journalist and former aide to Johnson.

Several weeks later, Johnson, who sought to preserve his legacy and was now convinced his declining health could not withstand growing public criticism, announced he would not seek reelection.

During the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Cronkite was anchoring the CBS network coverage as violence and protests occurred outside the convention, as well as scuffles inside the convention hall. When Dan Rather was punched to the floor (on camera) by security personnel, Cronkite commented, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.&quot;

=== Other historic events ===
The first publicly transmitted live trans-Atlantic program was broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962, at 3:00 pm EDT, and Cronkite was one of the main presenters in this multinational broadcast. The broadcast was made possible in Europe by Eurovision and in North America by NBC, CBS, ABC, and the CBC. The first public broadcast featured CBS&#x27;s Cronkite and NBC&#x27;s Chet Huntley in New York, and the BBC&#x27;s Richard Dimbleby in Brussels. Cronkite was in the New York studio at Rockefeller Plaza as the first pictures to be transmitted and received were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first segment included a televised major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. From there, the video switched first to Washington, D.C.; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; then to Quebec City, Quebec, and finally to Stratford, Ontario. The Washington segment included a press conference with President Kennedy, talking about the price of the American dollar, which was causing concern in Europe. This broadcast inaugurated live intercontinental news coverage, which was perfected later in the sixties with &quot;Early Bird&quot; and other Intelsat satellites.

On November 22, 1963, Cronkite introduced The Beatles to the United States by airing a four-minute story about the band on the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;. The story was scheduled to be shown again on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; that same day, but the assassination of John F. Kennedy prevented the broadcast of the regular evening news. The Beatles story was aired on the evening news program on December 10.

General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower returned to his former Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) headquarters for an interview by Cronkite on the CBS News Special Report &quot;D-Day + 20&quot;, telecast on June 6, 1964.
Cronkite is also remembered for his coverage of the United States space program, and at times was visibly enthusiastic, rubbing his hands together on camera with a smile and uttering, &quot;Whew...boy&quot; on July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission put the first men on the Moon.

Cronkite participated in Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China. Because Cronkite was colorblind, he had to ask others what color of coat First Lady Pat Nixon was wearing when they disembarked in Peking (Beijing).

According to the 2006 PBS documentary on Cronkite, there was &quot;nothing new&quot; in his reports on the Watergate affair; however, Cronkite brought together a wide range of reporting, and his credibility and status is credited by many with pushing the Watergate story to the forefront with the American public, ultimately resulting in the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon on August 9, 1974. Cronkite had anchored the CBS coverage of Nixon&#x27;s address, announcing his impending resignation, the night before.

The January 22, 1973, broadcast of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; saw Cronkite break the news of the death of another notable American political figure. At approximately 6:38 pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, the former press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was at the time serving as station manager of KTBC-TV, which at the time was the CBS affiliate in Austin, Texas and had been owned by the former President until recently.

The pre-recorded report was cut short while Cronkite was talking to Johnson, and when the live camera returned Cronkite had the telephone receiver held to his ear. Once he was told he was back on the air, Cronkite briefly nodded and held up one of his fingers to let the audience and studio crew know he needed a moment to let Johnson finish talking before he relayed the topic of conversation to the nation watching. Once Johnson finished talking, Cronkite thanked him and asked him to stay on the line as he reported the following:

During the final ten minutes of that broadcast, Cronkite reported on the death, giving a retrospective on the life of the nation&#x27;s 36th president, and announced that CBS would air a special on Johnson later that evening. This story was re-told on a 2007 CBS-TV special honoring Cronkite&#x27;s 90th birthday. 

== Retirement ==
On February 14, 1980, Cronkite announced that he intended to retire from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;; at the time, CBS had a policy of mandatory retirement by age 65. Although sometimes compared to a father figure or an uncle figure, in an interview about his retirement he described himself as being more like a &quot;comfortable old shoe&quot; to his audience. His last day in the anchor chair at the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was on March 6, 1981; he was succeeded the following Monday by Dan Rather.

Cronkite&#x27;s farewell statement:

On the eve of Cronkite&#x27;s retirement, he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; hosted by Johnny Carson. The following night, Carson did a comic spoof of his on-air farewell address.

== Other activities ==
=== Post-&quot;CBS Evening News&quot; ===

As he had promised on his last show as anchor in 1981, Cronkite continued to broadcast occasionally as a special correspondent for CBS, CNN, and NPR into the 21st century; one such occasion was Cronkite anchoring the second space flight by John Glenn in 1998 as he had Glenn&#x27;s first in 1962. Cronkite hosted &quot;Universe&quot; until its cancellation in 1982. In 1983, he reported on the British general election for the ITV current affairs series &quot;World In Action&quot;, interviewing, among many others, the victorious Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Cronkite hosted the annual Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert on PBS from 1985 to 2008, succeeded by Julie Andrews in 2009. For many years, until 2002, he was also the host of the annual Kennedy Center Honors.

In 1998, Cronkite hosted the 90-minute documentary, &quot;Silicon Valley: A 100 Year Renaissance&quot;, produced by the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association. The film documented Silicon Valley&#x27;s rise from the origin of Stanford University to the current high-technology powerhouse. The documentary was broadcast on PBS throughout the United States and in 26 countries. Prior to 2004, he could also be seen in the opening movie &quot;Back to Neverland&quot; shown in the Walt Disney World attraction &quot;The Magic of Disney Animation&quot;, interviewing Robin Williams as if he is still on the CBS News channel, ending his on-camera time with Cronkite&#x27;s famous catchphrase. In the feature, Cronkite describes the steps taken in the creation of an animated film, while Williams becomes an animated character (and even becomes Cronkite, impersonating his voice). He also was shown inviting Disney guests and tourists to the Disney Classics Theater.

On May 21, 1999, Cronkite participated in a panel discussion on &quot;Integrity in the Media&quot; with Ben Bradlee and Mike McCurry at the Connecticut Forum in Hartford, Connecticut. Cronkite provided an anecdote about taking a picture from a house in Houston, Texas, where a newsworthy event occurred and being praised for getting a unique photograph, only to find out later that the city desk had provided him with the wrong address.

=== Voice-overs ===
Cronkite narrated the IMAX film about the Space Shuttle, &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;, released in 1985. From May 26, 1986, to August 15, 1994, he was the narrator&#x27;s voice in the EPCOT Center attraction &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. He provided the pivotal voice of Captain Neweyes in the 1993 animated film &quot;We&#x27;re Back: A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot;, delivering his trademark line at the end. In 1995, he made an appearance on Broadway, providing the voice of the titular book in the 1995 revival of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;.

Cronkite was a finalist for NASA&#x27;s Journalist in Space program, which mirrored the Teacher in Space Project, an opportunity that was suspended after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986. He recorded voice-overs for the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, modifying the script he was given to make it more &quot;Cronkitian.&quot; In 2002, Cronkite was the voice of Benjamin Franklin in the educational television cartoon &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;, which included a news segment ending with the same phrase he did back on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. This role earned him Daytime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Series, in 2003 and 2004, but he did not win. His distinctive voice provided the narration for the television ads of the University of Texas, Austin, his alma mater, with its &#x27;We&#x27;re Texas&#x27; ad campaign.

He held amateur radio operator license KB2GSD and narrated a 2003 American Radio Relay League documentary explaining amateur radio&#x27;s role in disaster relief. The video tells Amateur Radio&#x27;s public service story to non-hams, focusing on ham radio&#x27;s part in helping various agencies respond to wildfires in the Western US during 2002, ham radio in space and the role Amateur Radio plays in emergency communications. &quot;Dozens of radio amateurs helped the police and fire departments and other emergency services maintain communications in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC,&quot; narrator Cronkite intoned in reference to ham radio&#x27;s response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Unusually, Cronkite was a Novice-class licensee—the entry level license—for his entire, and long, tenure in the hobby.

On February 15, 2005, he went into the studio at CBS to record narration for &quot;WCC Chatham Radio&quot;, a documentary about Guglielmo Marconi and his Chatham station, which became the busiest ship-to-shore wireless station in North America from 1914 to 1994. The documentary was directed by Christopher Seufert of Mooncusser Films and premiered at the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center in April 2005. In 2006, Cronkite hosted the &quot;World War One Living History Project,&quot; a program honoring America&#x27;s final handful of veterans from the First World War. The program was created by Treehouse Productions and aired on NPR on November 11, 2006. In May 2009, &quot;Legacy of War&quot;, produced by PBS, was released. Cronkite chronicles, over archive footage, the events following World War II that resulted in America&#x27;s rise as the dominant world power.

Prior to his death, &quot;Uncle Walter&quot; hosted a number of TV specials and was featured in interviews about the times and events that occurred during his career as America&#x27;s &quot;most trusted&quot; man. In July 2006, the 90-minute documentary &quot;Walter Cronkite: Witness to History&quot; aired on PBS. The special was narrated by Katie Couric, who assumed the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor chair in September 2006. Cronkite provided the voiceover introduction to Couric&#x27;s &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, which began on September 5, 2006. Cronkite&#x27;s voiceover was notably not used on introducing the broadcast reporting his funeral – no voiceover was used on this occasion.

=== TV and movie appearances ===
Cronkite made a cameo appearance on a 1974 episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, in which he met with Lou Grant in his office. Ted Baxter, who at first tried to convince Cronkite that he (Baxter) was as good a newsman as Eric Sevareid, pleaded with Cronkite to hire him for the network news, at least to give sport scores, and gave an example: &quot;The North Stars 3, the Kings Oh!&quot; Cronkite turned to Grant and said, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna get you for this!&quot; Cronkite later said that he was disappointed that his scene was filmed in one take, since he had hoped to sit down and chat with the cast.

In the late 1980s and again in the 1990s, Cronkite appeared on the news-oriented situation comedy &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as himself. Both episodes were written by the Emmy Award-winning team of Tom Seeley and Norm Gunzenhauser. He also continued hosting a variety of series. In the early 1980s, he was host of the documentary series &quot;World War II with Walter Cronkite&quot;. In 1991, he hosted the TV documentary &quot;Dinosaur!&quot; on A&amp;E (not related to the documentary of the same title hosted by Christopher Reeve on CBS six years earlier), and a 1994 follow-up series, &quot;Ape Man: The Story of Human Evolution&quot;. In 1995, he narrated the World Liberty Concert held in the Netherlands.

Cronkite routinely hosted the Kennedy Center Honors from 1981 to 2002.

Cronkite appeared briefly in the 2005 dramatic documentary &quot;The American Ruling Class&quot;, written by Lewis Lapham, and the 2000 film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; reporting on the Cuban Missile Crisis; and provided the opening synopsis of the American Space Program leading to the events of Apollo 13 for the 1995 Ron Howard film of the same name.

=== Political activism ===

Cronkite wrote a syndicated opinion column for King Features Syndicate. In 2005 and 2006, he contributed to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Cronkite was the honorary chairman of The Interfaith Alliance. In 2006, he presented the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award to actor and activist George Clooney on behalf of his organization at its annual dinner in New York.

Cronkite was a vocal advocate for free airtime for political candidates. He worked with the Alliance for Better Campaigns and Common Cause, for instance, on an unsuccessful lobbying effort to have an amendment added to the McCain-Feingold-Shays-Meehan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001 that would have required TV broadcast companies to provide free airtime to candidates. Cronkite criticized the present system of campaign finance which allows elections to &quot;be purchased&quot; by special interests, and he noted that all the European democracies &quot;provide their candidates with extensive free airtime.&quot; &quot;In fact,&quot; Cronkite pointed out, &quot;of all the major nations worldwide that profess to have democracies, only seven – just seven – do not offer free airtime&quot; This put the United States on a list with Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Trinidad and Tobago. Cronkite concluded that &quot;The failure to give free airtime for our political campaigns endangers our democracy.&quot; During the elections held in 2000, the amount spent by candidates in the major TV markets approached $1 billion. &quot;What our campaign asks is that the television industry yield just a tiny percentage of that windfall, less than 1 percent, to fund free airtime.&quot;

He was a member of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee. He also supported the nonprofit world hunger organization Heifer International.

In 1998, he supported President Bill Clinton during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial. He was also a proponent of limited world government on the American federalist model, writing fundraising letters for the World Federalist Association (now Citizens for Global Solutions). In accepting the 1999 Norman Cousins Global Governance Award at the ceremony at the United Nations, Cronkite said:

It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid the eventual catastrophic world conflict we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and keep the peace. To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order. But the American colonies did it once and brought forth one of the most nearly perfect unions the world has ever seen.

Cronkite contrasted his support for accountable global government with the opposition to it by politically active Christian fundamentalists in the United States:

Even as with the American rejection of the League of Nations, our failure to live up to our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow, selfish political objectives at the cost of our nation&#x27;s conscience. They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition and the rest of the religious right wing. Their leader, Pat Robertson, has written that we should have a world government but only when the messiah arrives. Any attempt to achieve world order before that time must be the work of the Devil! Well join me... I&#x27;m glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.

In 2003, Cronkite, who owned property on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, became involved in a long-running debate over his opposition to the construction of a wind farm in that area. In his column, he repeatedly condemned President George W. Bush and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Cronkite appeared in the 2004 Robert Greenwald film &quot;Outfoxed&quot;, where he offered commentary on what he said were unethical and overtly political practices at the Fox News Channel. Cronkite remarked that when Fox News was founded by Rupert Murdoch, &quot;it was intended to be a conservative organization – beyond that; a far-right-wing organization&quot;. In January 2006, during a press conference to promote the PBS documentary about his career, Cronkite said that he felt the same way about America&#x27;s presence in Iraq as he had about their presence in Vietnam in 1968 and that he felt America should recall its troops.

Cronkite spoke out against the War on Drugs in support of the Drug Policy Alliance, writing a fundraising letter and appearing in advertisements on behalf of the DPA. In the letter, Cronkite wrote: &quot;Today, our nation is fighting two wars: one abroad and one at home. While the war in Iraq is in the headlines, the other war is still being fought on our own streets. Its casualties are the wasted lives of our own citizens. I am speaking of the war on drugs. And I cannot help but wonder how many more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: the war on drugs is a failure.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Cronkite was married for nearly 65 years to Mary Elizabeth &#x27;Betsy&#x27; Maxwell Cronkite, from March 30, 1940, until her death from cancer on March 15, 2005. They had three children: Nancy Cronkite, Mary Kathleen (Kathy) Cronkite, and Walter Leland (Chip) Cronkite III (who is married to actress Deborah Rush). Cronkite dated singer Joanna Simon from 2005 to 2009.
A grandson, Walter Cronkite IV, worked at CBS and currently serves as director of communications at the Structured Finance Association. Cronkite&#x27;s cousin is former Mayor of Kansas City and 2008 Democratic nominee for Missouri&#x27;s 6th congressional district Kay Barnes.

Cronkite was an accomplished sailor and enjoyed sailing coastal waters of the United States in his custom-built 48-foot Sunward &quot;Wyntje&quot;. Cronkite was a member of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, with the honorary rank of commodore. Throughout the 1950s, he was an aspiring sports car racer, even racing in the 1959 12 Hours of Sebring.

Cronkite was an Episcopalian. He briefly considered entering the ministry before deciding to embark on a career in journalism.

Cronkite was reported to be a fan of the game &quot;Diplomacy&quot;, which was rumored to be Henry Kissinger&#x27;s favorite game.

== Death ==
In June 2009, Cronkite was reported to be terminally ill. He died on July 17, 2009, at his home in New York City aged 92. He is believed to have died from cerebrovascular disease.

Cronkite&#x27;s funeral took place on July 23, 2009, at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in midtown Manhattan, New York City. Among many journalists who attended were Tom Brokaw, Connie Chung, Katie Couric, Charles Gibson, Matt Lauer, Dan Rather, Andy Rooney, Morley Safer, Diane Sawyer, Bob Schieffer, Meredith Vieira, Barbara Walters, and Brian Williams. At his funeral, his friends noted his love of music, including, recently, drumming. He was cremated and his remains buried next to his wife, Betsy, in the family plot in Kansas City.

A memorial service for Cronkite was held at Lincoln Center in New York City on September 9, 2009.  Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton eulogized him, as did CBS presidents Les Moonves and Howard Stringer, Nick Clooney, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, Buzz Aldrin, and Bob Schieffer, among others. Obama said Cronkite &quot;was a voice of certainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain. And through it all, he never lost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in the heartland.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Public credibility and trustworthiness ===
For many years, until a decade after he left his post as anchor, Cronkite was considered one of the most trusted figures in the United States. For most of his 19 years as anchor, he was the &quot;predominant news voice in America.&quot; Affectionately known as &quot;Uncle Walter&quot;, he covered many of the important news events of the era so effectively that his image and voice are closely associated with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam War, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the Watergate scandal. &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that &quot;few TV figures have ever had as much power as Cronkite did at his height.&quot; Enjoying the cult of personality surrounding Cronkite in those years, CBS allowed some good-natured fun-poking at its star anchorman in some episodes of the network&#x27;s popular situation comedy &quot;All in the Family&quot;, during which the lead character Archie Bunker would sometimes complain about the newsman, calling him &quot;Pinko Cronkite.&quot;

Cronkite trained himself to speak at a rate of 124 words per minute in his newscasts so that viewers could clearly understand him. In contrast, Americans average about 165 words per minute, and fast, difficult-to-understand talkers speak close to 200 words per minute.

=== Awards and honors ===

In 1968, the faculty of the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University voted to award Cronkite the Carr Van Anda Award &quot;for enduring contributions to journalism.&quot; In 1970, Cronkite received a &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; George Polk Award and the Paul White Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association.

In 1972, in recognition of his career, Princeton University&#x27;s American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Cronkite the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service.

In 1977, Cronkite was elected to membership in the American Antiquarian Society, for which he was a proactive supporter and member, even participating in educational video materials for the society&#x27;s 175th anniversary. In 1981, the year he retired, former president Jimmy Carter awarded Cronkite the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In that year, he also received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards, and the Paul White Award for lifetime achievement from the Radio Television Digital News Association. In 1985, Cronkite was honored with the induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. In 1989 he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1994. In 1995, he received the Ischia International Journalism Award. In 1999, Cronkite received the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement&#x27;s Corona Award in recognition of a lifetime of achievement in space exploration. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. On March 1, 2006, Cronkite became the first non-astronaut to receive NASA&#x27;s Ambassador of Exploration Award. Among Cronkite&#x27;s numerous awards were four Peabody awards for excellence in broadcasting.

In 2003, Cronkite was honored by the Vienna Philharmonic with the Franz Schalk Gold Medal, in view of his contributions to the New Year&#x27;s Concert and the cultural image of Austria.

Minor planet 6318 Cronkite, discovered in 1990 by Eleanor Helin, is named in his honor.

There is a street named after Cronkite in San Antonio, Texas.

=== Cronkite School at Arizona State University ===
A few years after Cronkite retired, Tom Chauncey, a former owner of KOOL-TV, the then-CBS affiliate in Phoenix, contacted Cronkite, an old friend, and asked him if he would be willing to have the journalism school at Arizona State University named after him. Cronkite immediately agreed. The ASU program acquired status and respect from its namesake.

Cronkite was not just a namesake, but he also took the time to interact with the students and staff of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. He made the trip to Arizona annually to present the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism to a leader in the field of media.

&quot;The values that Mr. Cronkite embodies – excellence, integrity, accuracy, fairness, objectivity – we try to instill in our students each and every day. There is no better role model for our faculty or our students,&quot; said Dean Christopher Callahan.

The school, with approximately 1,700 students, is widely regarded as one of the top journalism schools in the country. It is housed in a new facility in downtown Phoenix that is equipped with 14 digital newsrooms and computer labs, two TV studios, 280 digital student workstations, the Cronkite Theater, the First Amendment Forum, and new technology. The school&#x27;s students regularly finish at the top of national collegiate journalism competitions, such as the Hearst Journalism Awards program and the Society of Professional Journalists Mark of Excellence Awards. In 2009, students won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for college print reporting.

In 2008, the state-of-the-art journalism education complex in the heart of ASU&#x27;s Downtown Phoenix campus was also built in his honor. The Walter Cronkite Regents Chair in Communication seats the Texas College of Communications dean.

=== Walter Cronkite Papers ===

The Walter Cronkite papers are preserved at the curatorial Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. Occupying 293 linear feet (almost 90 metres) of shelf space, the papers document Cronkite&#x27;s journalism career. Amongst the collected material are Cronkite&#x27;s early beginnings while he still lived in Houston. They encompass his coverage of World War II as a United Press International correspondent, where he cemented his reputation by taking on hazardous overseas assignments. During this time he also covered the Nuremberg war crimes trial serving as the chief of the United Press bureau in Moscow. The main content of the papers documents Cronkite&#x27;s career with CBS News between 1950 and 1981.

The Cronkite Papers assemble a variety of interviews with U.S. presidents, including Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan. President Lyndon Johnson requested a special interview with Cronkite while he was broadcasting live on CBS.
Cronkite was helped in compiling the materials for his autobiography by Don Carleton, executive director for the Center for American History in the early 1990s, which was published as &quot;A Reporter&#x27;s Life&quot; in 1996. Materials from the archive would later be integral to the television adaptation &quot;Cronkite Remembers&quot;, which was shown on the Discovery Channel.

NASA presented Cronkite with a Moon rock sample from the early Apollo expeditions spanning 1969 to 1972. Cronkite passed on the Moon rock to Bill Powers, president of the University of Texas at Austin, and it became part of the collection at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. Carleton said at this occasion, &quot;We are deeply honored by Walter Cronkite&#x27;s decision to entrust this prestigious award to the Center for American History. The Center already serves as the proud steward of his professional and personal papers, which include his coverage of the space program for CBS News. It is especially fitting that the archive documenting Walter&#x27;s distinguished career should also include one of the moon rocks that the heroic astronauts of the Apollo program brought to Earth.&quot;

=== Memorial at Missouri Western State University ===
On November 4, 2013, Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri, dedicated the Walter Cronkite Memorial. The nearly 6,000 square-foot memorial includes images, videos and memorabilia from Cronkite&#x27;s life and the many events he covered as a journalist. The memorial includes a replica of the newsroom from which Cronkite broadcast the news during the 1960s and 1970s. In 2014, the Memorial received the Missouri Division of Tourism&#x27;s Spotlight Award.

<text>Thomas John Brokaw (; born February 6, 1940) is an American retired network television journalist and author. He first served as the co-anchor of &quot;The Today Show&quot; from 1976 to 1981 with Jane Pauley, then as the anchor and managing editor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; for 22 years (1982–2004). In the previous decade he served as a weekend anchor for the program from 1973 to 1976. He is the only person to have hosted all three major NBC News programs: &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and, briefly, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. He formerly held a special correspondent post for NBC News.

Along with his competitors Peter Jennings at ABC News, and Dan Rather at CBS News, Brokaw was one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; U.S. news anchors during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. All three hosted their networks&#x27; flagship nightly news programs for more than 20 years.

Brokaw has also written several books on American history and society in the 20th century including &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; (1998). He occasionally writes and narrates documentaries for other outlets. In 2021, NBC announced that Brokaw would retire after 55 years at the network, one of the longest standing anchors in the world at the same news network.

Brokaw is the recipient of numerous awards and honors including the two Peabody Awards; two Emmy Awards; the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was awarded to him by President Barack Obama in 2014; and the French Legion of Honor in 2016.

== Early life ==

Brokaw was born in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Eugenia &quot;Jean&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Conley; 1917–2011), who worked in sales and as a post-office clerk, and Anthony Orville &quot;Red&quot; Brokaw (1912–1982). He was the eldest of their three sons (brothers named William and Michael) and named for his maternal great-grandfather, Thomas Conley.

His father was a descendant of Huguenot immigrants Bourgon and Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Le Fèvre) Broucard, and his mother was Irish American. His paternal great-grandfather, Richard P. Brokaw, founded the town of Bristol, South Dakota, and the Brokaw House, a small hotel and the first structure in Bristol.

Brokaw&#x27;s father was a construction foreman for the Army Corps of Engineers. He worked at the Black Hills Ordnance Depot (BHOD) and helped construct Fort Randall Dam; his job often required the family to resettle throughout South Dakota during Brokaw&#x27;s early childhood. The Brokaws lived for short periods in Bristol, Igloo (the small residential community of the BHOD), and Pickstown, before settling in Yankton, where Brokaw attended high school.

As a high school student attending Yankton Senior High School, Brokaw was governor of South Dakota American Legion Boys State, and in that capacity he accompanied then-South Dakota Governor Joe Foss to New York City for a joint appearance on a TV game show. It was to be the beginning of a long relationship with Foss, whom Brokaw would later feature in his book about World War II veterans, &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. Brokaw also became an Advisory Board member of the Joe Foss Institute.

Brokaw matriculated at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, but dropped out after a year as he apparently failed to keep up in his studies, in his words majoring in &quot;beer and co-eds&quot;. In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University, and he later donated his papers to the University of Iowa Libraries. He joked that the &quot;honorary degree is especially coveted because it helps to make up for the uneven (to put it mildly) performance of my freshman year.&quot; He later transferred to the University of South Dakota, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science.

For several years, Brokaw mountain-climbed with the &quot;Do Boys&quot;, whose members included Yvon Chouinard and Douglas Tompkins. He owned a home on 53 acres in Pound Ridge, New York, for over two decades.

== Broadcasting career ==

=== 1966–1981: early years ===

Brokaw&#x27;s television career began at KTIV in Sioux City, Iowa, followed by stints at KMTV in Omaha, Nebraska, and WSB-TV in Atlanta. In 1966 he joined NBC News, reporting from Los Angeles and anchoring the 11:00 p.m. news for KNBC. In 1973, NBC made Brokaw White House correspondent, covering the Watergate scandal, and anchor of the Saturday editions of &quot;Nightly News.&quot; He became co-host (with Jane Pauley) of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; in 1976 and remained in the job until 1981, when he was succeeded by Bryant Gumbel.

Brokaw kept a closely guarded secret for many years: in 2017 Brokaw wrote of having been offered – and having promptly turned down – the press secretary position in the Nixon White House in 1969. While living in California before Nixon made his political comeback, Brokaw had come to know H. R. &#x27;Bob&#x27; Haldeman (White House chief of staff and initiator of the offer) as well as Nixon&#x27;s press secretary, Ron Ziegler, and others members of the White House staff.

In 2019, Brokaw wrote a book entitled &quot;The Fall of Richard Nixon: A Reporter Remembers Watergate&quot;, about his experiences working as a reporter and member of the White House press corps.

=== 1982–2004: &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; ===

On April 5, 1982, Brokaw began co-anchoring &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; from New York with Roger Mudd in Washington, succeeding John Chancellor. After a year, NBC News president Reuven Frank concluded that the dual-anchor program was not working and selected Brokaw to be sole anchor. The &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw&quot; commenced on September 5, 1983. Among other news items, he covered the Challenger disaster, EDSA Revolution, the June Struggle, Loma Prieta earthquake, fall of the Berlin Wall, and Hurricane Andrew.
Brokaw scored a major coup when, on November 9, 1989, he was the first English-language broadcast journalist to report the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Brokaw attended a televised press conference organized in East Berlin by Günter Schabowski, press spokesman for East German Politburo, which had just decided to allow its citizens to apply to permanently leave the country through its border with West Germany. When Schabowski was asked when this loosening of regulations would take effect, he glanced through his notes, then said, &quot;sofort, unverzüglich&quot; (&quot;immediately, without delay&quot;), touching off a stampede of East Berliners to the Wall. Brokaw had an interview with Schabowski after the press conference, who repeated his &quot;immediately&quot; statement when pressed. Later that evening Brokaw reported from the west side of Brandenburg Gate on this announcement and the pandemonium that had broken out in East Berlin because of it.

As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He and Katie Couric hosted a prime-time newsmagazine, &quot;Now&quot;, that aired from 1993 to 1994 before being folded into the multi-night &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; program.

Also, in 1993, on the first broadcast of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on CBS, in response to David Letterman&#x27;s monologue containing jokes about NBC, Brokaw walked on stage in a surprise cameo (accompanied by Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra playing the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; theme). He congratulated Letterman on his new show and wished him well, but also stated he was disappointed and shocked; he subsequently walked over to the man holding the cue cards, took two, and remarked, &quot;These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!&quot;, leaving the stage afterwards. Letterman then remarked, &quot;Who would have thought you would ever hear the words &#x27;intellectual property&#x27; and &#x27;NBC&#x27; in the same sentence?&quot;

In 1996 Brokaw made the following statement about Richard Jewell&#x27;s suspected involvement in the 1996 Olympic Park bombing, after which Jewell sued NBC News:

Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000.
On September 11, 2001, Brokaw joined Katie Couric and Matt Lauer around 9:30 a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw observed: &quot;This is war. This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States.&quot; He continued to anchor coverage to midnight on the following two days. Later that month, a letter containing anthrax was addressed to him as part of the 2001 anthrax attacks. Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected. In 2008, he testified before the Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism about the anthrax attacks, publicly discussing his experiences for the first time in a detailed, day-by-day account.

In 2002, NBC announced that Brokaw would retire as anchor of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; following the 2004 Presidential election, to be succeeded by Brian Williams. Brokaw would remain with NBC News in a part-time capacity from that point onwards, serving as an analyst and anchoring and producing documentary programs. Brokaw closed his final &quot;Nightly News&quot; broadcast in front of 15.7 million viewers on NBC on December 1, 2004, by saying:

By the end of his time as &quot;Nightly News&quot; anchor, Brokaw was regarded as the most popular news personality in the United States. &quot;Nightly News&quot; had moved into first place in the Nielsen ratings in late 1996 and held on to the spot for the remainder of Brokaw&#x27;s tenure on the program, placing him ahead of ABC&#x27;s Peter Jennings and &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, and CBS&#x27;s Dan Rather and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Along with Jennings and Rather, Brokaw helped usher in the era of the TV news anchor as a lavishly compensated, globe-trotting star in the 1980s. The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw&#x27;s retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather&#x27;s ousting from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in March 2005, and Jennings&#x27;s death in August 2005, brought that era to a close.

=== 2004–2021: after &quot;Nightly News&quot; ===

After leaving the anchor chair, Brokaw remained at NBC as Special Correspondent, providing periodic reports for &quot;Nightly News&quot;. He served as an NBC analyst during the 2008 presidential election campaign and moderated the second presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain at Belmont University. He reported documentaries for the Discovery Channel and the History Channel and in 2006 delivered one of the eulogies during the state funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford.

On June 13, 2008, when NBC interrupted its regular programming to announce the sudden death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; moderator Tim Russert, Brokaw served as the announcer. A week later, NBC announced that Brokaw would serve as host of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on an interim basis. He was succeeded by David Gregory in December 2008.

Brokaw serves on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Rescue Committee, and the Mayo Clinic. He is also a member of the Howard University School of Communications Board of Visitors and a trustee of the University of South Dakota, the Norton Simon Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the International Rescue Committee. He also provides the voiceover for a University of Iowa advertisement that airs on television during Iowa Hawkeyes athletic events.

In 2011, Brokaw began hosting &quot;The Boys in the Hall&quot;, a baseball documentary series for Fox Sports Net.

In December 2012, Brokaw starred in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir&#x27;s annual Christmas concert, with live audiences of 84,000. The concert, titled &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, was nationally televised in December 2013.

In April 2014, a new broadcast facility opened on the Universal Studios Hollywood lot, and named in Brokaw&#x27;s honor as the Brokaw News Center. The facility houses KNBC-TV, Telemundo owned-and-operated station KVEA, and the Los Angeles bureau of NBC News.

In November 2014, President Barack Obama presented Brokaw with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America&#x27;s highest civilian honor. He received the honor with the citation, &quot;The chronicler of the Greatest Generation...we celebrate him as one of our nation’s greatest journalists&quot;.

On March 11, 2016, Brokaw gave one of the eulogies for former First Lady Nancy Reagan at her funeral. He spoke about his relationship with both the Reagans as a reporter and later anchor.

On January 22, 2021, NBC announced Brokaw would retire after 55 years at the network, one of the few news anchors in the world who have spent the longest time on the same news network, along with Ecuadorian news anchor Alfonso Espinosa de los Monteros who was on Ecuavisa for over 56 years from 1967 to May 2023.

== Personal life ==
Since 1962, Brokaw has been married to author Meredith Lynn Auld. They have three daughters: Jennifer, Andrea, and Sarah. Brokaw and his wife spend considerable time at their ranch near Livingston, Montana, which they bought in 1989.

On September 6, 2012, Brokaw was hospitalized after appearing on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot;. He later tweeted that he was &quot;all well&quot; and explained his illness as having accidentally taken half a dose of Ambien in the morning. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a treatable but incurable blood cancer, in August 2013 at the Mayo Clinic. Brokaw and his physicians were &quot;very encouraged with his progress&quot;. He continued to work for NBC throughout his treatments. On December 21, 2014, Brokaw announced that his cancer is in remission. His 2015 book, &quot;A Lucky Life Interrupted: A Memoir of Hope&quot; (published by Random House), was about his cancer battle.

In 2018, Brokaw was accused of having made unwanted sexual advances toward two women in the 1990s. Brokaw denied the allegations. In response to the allegations, former colleagues Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Maria Shriver, Kelly O&#x27;Donnell, and 64 others, signed a letter characterizing Brokaw as &quot;a man of tremendous decency and integrity&quot;.

<text>Wire removal is a visual effects technique used to remove wires in films, where the wires are originally included as a safety precaution or to simulate flying in actors or miniatures. It uses a lot of rotomatting, a process of using splines in a program like After Effects or Nuke to extract a subject from a video, motion tracking, and painting over footage, which can be done in Photoshop, Boris Silhouette, or Nuke.

Wire removal can be partly automated through various forms of keying, or each frame can be edited manually. First, the live action plates of actors or models suspended on wires are filmed in front of a green screen. Editors can then erase the wires frame by frame, without worrying about erasing the backdrop, which will be added later. This can be accomplished automatically with a computer. If the sequence is not filmed in front of a green-screen, or with a green wire a digital editor must hand-paint the lines out. This can be an arduous and time consuming task.

The modern technique of wire removal was pioneered by Industrial Light and Magic, when they used it in films such as &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986), &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), and &quot;Hook&quot; (1991).

<text>Marie Dionne Warwick ( ; born Marie Dionne Warrick; December 12, 1940) is an American singer, actress, and television host. During her career, Warwick has won many awards, including six Grammy Awards. She has been inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Apollo Theater Walk of Fame. In 2019, Warwick won the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Three of her songs (&quot;Walk On By&quot;, &quot;Alfie&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;) have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Warwick ranks among the 40 biggest U.S. hit makers between 1955 and 1999, based on her chart history on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 pop singles chart. She is the second-most charted female vocalist during the rock era (1955–1999). She is also one of the most-charted vocalists of all time, with 56 of her singles making the Hot 100 between 1962 and 1998 (12 of them Top Ten), and 80 singles in total – either solo or collaboratively – making the Hot 100, R&amp;B, or adult contemporary charts. Warwick ranks number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Artists of all time&quot;. She is a former Goodwill Ambassador for the UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization.

== Early life and education ==
Marie Dionne Warrick, later Warwick, was born to Arthur Lee Drinkard and Mancel Warrick. Her mother was manager of the Drinkard Singers, and her father was a Pullman porter, chef, record promoter, and CPA. Dionne was named after her aunt on her mother&#x27;s side. She had a sister, Delia (&quot;Dee Dee&quot;), who died in 2008, and a brother, Mancel Jr., who was killed in an accident in 1968 at the age of 21. Her parents were both African-American, and she also has Native American and Dutch ancestry.

Warwick was raised in East Orange, New Jersey, and was a Girl Scout for a time. She began singing gospel as a child at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. After finishing East Orange High School in 1959, Warwick pursued her passion at the Hartt College of Music in West Hartford, Connecticut. She landed some work with her group singing backing vocals for recording sessions in New York City. During one session, Warwick met Burt Bacharach, who hired her to record demos featuring songs written by him and lyricist Hal David. She later landed her own record deal.

== Career ==
=== Drinkard Singers ===
Many members of Warwick&#x27;s family were members of the Drinkard Singers, a family gospel group and RCA recording artists who frequently performed throughout the New York metropolitan area. The original group, known as the Drinkard Jubilairs, consisted of Cissy, Anne, Larry, and Nicky, and later included Warwick&#x27;s grandparents, Nicholas and Delia Drinkard, and their children: William, Lee (Warwick&#x27;s mother) and Hansom. When the Drinkard Singers performed on &quot;TV Gospel Time&quot;, Dionne Warwick had her television performance debut.

Marie instructed the group, and they were managed by Lee. As they became more successful, Lee and Marie began performing with the group, and they were augmented by pop/R&amp;B singer Judy Clay, whom Lee had unofficially adopted. Elvis Presley eventually expressed an interest in having them join his touring entourage.

=== The Gospelaires ===
Other talented singers joined the Gospelaires from time-to-time, including Judy Clay, Cissy Houston (mother of Whitney Houston), and Doris &quot;Rikii&quot; Troy, whose chart selection &quot;Just One Look&quot; (when she recorded it in 1963) featured backing vocals from the Gospelaires. After personnel changes (Dionne and Doris left the group after achieving solo success), the Gospelaires became the recording group the Sweet Inspirations, and had some chart success, but were much sought-after as studio background singers. The Gospelaires, and later the Sweet Inspirations, performed on many records cut in New York City for artists such as Garnet Mimms, the Drifters, Jerry Butler, Solomon Burke and, later, Warwick&#x27;s solo recordings, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Warwick recalled, in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot;, that &quot;a man came running frantically backstage at the Apollo and said he needed background singers for a session for Sam &quot;the Man&quot; Taylor and old big-mouth here spoke up and said &#x27;We&#x27;ll do it!&#x27; and we left and did the session. I wish I remembered the gentleman&#x27;s name because he was responsible for the beginning of my professional career.&quot;

The chance encounter led to the group being asked to provide background vocals at recording sessions around New York. Soon, the group was in-demand for their harmonies among New York musicians and producers, after hearing their work with the Drifters, Ben E. King, Chuck Jackson, Dinah Washington, Ronnie Hawkins, and Solomon Burke, among many others. In the same aforementioned &quot;Biography&quot; interview, Warwick recalled that, on weekdays after school, the girls would catch a bus from East Orange to the Port Authority Terminal, then take the subway to the recording studios in Manhattan, perform their background vocal work, and still be back at home in East Orange with time to do their school homework. Warwick&#x27;s music work would continue while she pursued her studies at Hartt.

=== Discovery ===
While she was performing background on the Drifters&#x27; recording of their 1962 release &quot;Mexican Divorce&quot;, Warwick&#x27;s voice and star presence were noticed by the song&#x27;s composer, Burt Bacharach, a Brill Building songwriter who was writing songs with many other songwriters, including lyricist Hal David. According to a July 14, 1967, article on Warwick in &quot;Time&quot;, Bacharach stated, &quot;She has a tremendous strong side and a delicacy when singing softly – like miniature ships in bottles.&quot; Musically, she was no &quot;play-safe girl. What emotion I could get away with!&quot; During the session, Bacharach asked Warwick if she would be interested in recording demonstration recordings of his compositions to pitch the tunes to record labels, paying her $12.50 per demo recording session (). One such demo, &quot;It&#x27;s Love That Really Counts&quot;destined to be recorded by Scepter-signed act the Shirellescaught the attention of the President of Scepter Records, Florence Greenberg, who, according to &quot;Current Biography&quot; (1969 Yearbook), told Bacharach, &quot;Forget the song, get the girl!&quot;

Warwick was signed to Bacharach&#x27;s and David&#x27;s production company, according to Warwick, which in turn was signed to Scepter Records in 1962 by Greenberg. The partnership would provide Bacharach with the freedom to produce Warwick without the control of recording company executives and company A&amp;R men. Warwick&#x27;s musical ability and education would also allow Bacharach to compose more challenging tunes. The demo version of &quot;It&#x27;s Love That Really Counts&quot;, along with her original demo of &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot;, would surface on Warwick&#x27;s debut Scepter album, &quot;Presenting Dionne Warwick&quot;, which was released in early 1963.

=== Early stardom (1962–1965) ===
In November 1962, Scepter Records released her first solo single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, the title of which Warwick supplied herself when she snapped the phrase at producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David in anger. Warwick had found out that &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot; – a song on which she had recorded the original demo and had wanted to be her first single release – had been given to another artist, Jerry Butler. From the phrase &quot;don&#x27;t make me over&quot;, Bacharach and David created their first top-40 pop hit (No. 21) and a top-5 U.S. R&amp;B hit. Warrick&#x27;s name was misspelled on the single&#x27;s label, and she began using the new spelling, &quot;Warwick&quot;, both professionally and personally.

After &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot; hit in 1962, she answered the call of her manager, left school and went on a tour of France, where critics crowned her &quot;Paris&#x27; Black Pearl&quot;, having been introduced on stage at Paris Olympia that year by Marlene Dietrich.

The two immediate follow-ups to &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot; – &quot;This Empty Place&quot; (with &quot;B&quot; side &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;&quot; later recorded by Dusty Springfield) and &quot;Make The Music Play&quot; – charted briefly in the top 100. Her fourth single, &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;, released in November 1963, was Warwick&#x27;s first top 10 pop hit (No. 8) in the U.S. and an international million seller. This was followed by &quot;Walk On By&quot; in April 1964, another major international hit and million seller that solidified her career. For the rest of the 1960s, Warwick was a fixture on the U.S. and Canadian charts, and much of her output from 1962 to 1971 was written and produced by the Bacharach/David team.

Warwick weathered the British Invasion better than most American artists. Her biggest UK hits were &quot;Walk On By&quot; and &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose?&quot; In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by British singers Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Dusty Springfield, most notably Black&#x27;s &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: &quot;I told her that &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot; would be my next single in the States. I honestly believe that if I&#x27;d sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed on hers too. There was no imagination in her recording.&quot; Warwick later covered two of Cilla&#x27;s songs – &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot; appeared on &quot;Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls&quot;, released in 1968 and on the soundtrack to &quot;Alfie&quot;.

Warwick was named the Bestselling Female Vocalist in the &quot;Cash Box Magazine&quot; poll in 1964, with six chart hits in that year. &quot;Cash Box&quot; named her the Top Female Vocalist in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1967 &quot;Cash Box&quot; poll, she was second to Petula Clark, and in 1968&#x27;s poll second to Aretha Franklin. &quot;Playboy&quot;″s influential Music Poll of 1970 named her the Top Female Vocalist. In 1969, Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Society named her Woman of the Year.

In &quot;Time&quot;″s cover article of May 21, 1965, entitled &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: The Sound of the Sixties&quot;, Warwick&#x27;s sound was described as:

Swinging World. Scholarly articles probe the relationship between the Beatles and the nouvelle vague films of Jean-Luc Godard, discuss &quot;the brio and elegance&quot; of Dionne Warwick&#x27;s singing style as a &#x27;pleasurable but complex&#x27; event to be &#x27;experienced without condescension.&#x27; In chic circles, anyone damning rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is labeled not only square but uncultured. For inspirational purposes, such hip artists as Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers and Andy Warhol occasionally paint while listening to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. Explains Warhol: &quot;It makes me mindless, and I paint better.&quot; After gallery openings in Manhattan, the black-tie gatherings often adjourn to a discothèque.

In 1965, Eon Productions intended to use Warwick&#x27;s song titled &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; as the theme song of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, until Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the theme song include the film&#x27;s title. A new song was composed and recorded at the eleventh hour titled &quot;Thunderball&quot;, performed by Tom Jones. The melody of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; remains a major component of the film score. The Ultimate Edition DVD of &quot;Thunderball&quot; has the Warwick song playing over the titles on one of the commentary track extras, and the song was released on the 30th anniversary CD of Bond songs.

=== Chart success (1966–1971) ===

The mid-1960s to early 1970s were a more successful time period for Warwick, who saw a string of gold-selling albums and Top 20 and Top 10 hit singles. &quot;Message to Michael&quot;, a Bacharach-David composition that the duo was certain was a &quot;man&#x27;s song&quot;, became a top 10 hit for Warwick in May 1966. The January 1967 LP &quot;Here Where There Is Love&quot; was her first RIAA certified Gold album, and featured &quot;Alfie&quot; and two 1966 hits: &quot;Trains and Boats and Planes&quot; and &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;. &quot;Alfie&quot; had become a radio hit when disc jockeys across the nation began to play the album cut early in 1967. &quot;Alfie&quot; was released as the &quot;B&quot; side of a Bacharach/David ballad, &quot;The Beginning of Loneliness&quot;, which charted in the Hot 100. Disc jockeys flipped the single and made it a double-sided hit. Bacharach had been contracted to produce &quot;Alfie&quot; for the Michael Caine film of the same name and wanted Warwick to sing the tune, but the British producers wanted a British subject to cut the tune. Cilla Black was selected to record the song, and her version peaked at No. 95 upon its release in the US. A cover version by Cher used in the American prints of the film peaked at No. 33. In the UK and Australia, Black&#x27;s version was a Top-10 hit.

Later that same year, Warwick earned her first RIAA certified Gold single for U.S. sales of over one million units for the single &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;. When disc jockeys across the nation began to play the track from the album in the fall of 1967 and demanded its release as a single, Scepter Records complied and &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; became Warwick&#x27;s biggest U.S. hit to that point, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Charts. The tune was also the first RIAA certified USA million seller for Bacharach-David.

Her follow-up to &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;, &quot;(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls&quot;, was unusual in several respects. It was not written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; it was the &quot;B&quot; side of her &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; single, and it was a song that she almost did not record. While the film version of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; was being made, actress Barbara Parkins suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film&#x27;s theme song, written by songwriting team André and Dory Previn. The song was to be recorded by Judy Garland, who was subsequently fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, disc jockeys flipped the single and made the single one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era and another million seller. At the time, RIAA rules allowed only one side of a double-sided hit single to be certified as gold, but Scepter awarded Warwick an &quot;in-house award&quot; to recognize &quot;(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls&quot; as a million selling tune.

Warwick had re-recorded a Pat Williams-arranged version of the theme at A&amp;R Studios in New York because contractual restrictions with her label would not allow the Warwick version from the film to be included on the 20th Century Fox soundtrack LP, and reverse legal restrictions would not allow the film version to be used anyplace else in a commercial LP. The LP &quot;Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls&quot;, released in early 1968 and containing the re-recorded version of the movie theme (No. 2 for three weeks), &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose?&quot; and several new Bacharach-David compositions, hit the No. 6 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and would remain on the chart for over a year. The film soundtrack LP, without Warwick vocals, failed to impress the public, while &quot;Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls&quot; earned an RIAA Gold certification.

The single &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose?&quot; (an international million seller and a Top-10 hit in several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Japan and Mexico) was also a double-sided hit, with the &quot;B&quot; side &quot;Let Me Be Lonely&quot; charting at No. 79. More hits followed into 1971, including &quot;Who Is Gonna Love Me&quot; (No. 32, 1968) with &quot;B&quot; side, &quot;(There&#x27;s) Always Something There to Remind Me&quot; becoming another double-sided hit; &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (No. 19, 1968); &quot;This Girl&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; (No. 7, 1969); &quot;The April Fools&quot; (No. 37, 1969); &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (No. 15, 1969); &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; (No. 6 Pop, No. 1 AC, 1969); &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot; (No. 37 Pop, No. 10 AC, 1970); &quot;Let Me Go to Him&quot; (No. 32 Pop, No. 4 AC, 1970); and &quot;Paper Mache&quot; (No. 43 Pop, No. 3 AC), 1970). Warwick&#x27;s final Bacharach/David penned single on the Scepter label was March 1971&#x27;s &quot;Who Gets the Guy&quot; (No. 52 Pop, No. 6 AC), 1971), and her final &quot;official&quot; Scepter single release was &quot;He&#x27;s Moving On&quot; b/w &quot;Amanda&quot;, (No. 83 Pop, No. 12 AC) both from the soundtrack of the motion picture adaptation of Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s &quot;The Love Machine&quot;.

Warwick had become the priority act of Scepter Records with the release of &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; in 1963. Other Scepter LPs certified RIAA Gold include &quot;Dionne Warwick&#x27;s Golden Hits Part 1&quot; released in 1967 and &quot;The Dionne Warwicke Story: A Decade of Gold&quot; released in 1971. By the end of 1971, Warwick had sold an estimated 35 million singles and albums internationally in less than nine years and more than 16 million singles in the U.S. alone. Exact figures of her sales are unknown and probably underestimated, due to Scepter Records&#x27; apparently lax accounting policies and the company policy of not submitting recordings for RIAA audit. Warwick became the first Scepter artist to request RIAA audits of her recordings in 1967 with the release of &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;.

On September 17, 1969, CBS Television aired Warwick&#x27;s first television special, entitled &quot;The Dionne Warwick Chevy Special&quot;. Warwick&#x27;s guests were Burt Bacharach, George Kirby, Glen Campbell, and Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1970, Warwick formed her own label, Sonday Records, of which she was president. Sonday was distributed by Scepter.

In 1970, she was a performer on the prestigious Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium, singing &quot;The Look of Love, What the World Needs Now&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot;.
In 1971, Warwick left the family atmosphere of Scepter Records for Warner Bros. Records, for a $5 million contract, the most lucrative recording contract given to a female vocalist up to that time, according to &quot;Variety&quot;. Warwick&#x27;s last LP for Scepter was the soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;The Love Machine&quot;, in which she appeared in an uncredited cameo, released in July 1971. In 1975, Bacharach and David sued Scepter Records for an accurate accounting of royalties due the team from their recordings with Warwick and labelmate B.J. Thomas. They were awarded almost $600,000 and the rights to all Bacharach/David recordings on the Scepter label. The label, with the defection of Warwick to Warner Bros. Records, filed for bankruptcy in 1975 and was sold to Springboard International Records in 1976.

Following her signing with Warners, with Bacharach and David as writers and producers, Warwick returned to New York City&#x27;s A&amp;R Studios in late 1971 to begin recording her first album for the new label, the self-titled &quot;Dionne&quot; (not to be confused with her later Arista debut album) in January 1972. The album peaked at No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Album Chart. In 1972, Burt Bacharach and Hal David scored and wrote the tunes for the motion picture &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. However, the film was panned by the critics, and in the fallout, the songwriting duo decided to terminate their working relationship. The break-up left Warwick devoid of their services as her producers and songwriters. She was contractually obligated to fulfill her contract with Warners without Bacharach and David, and she would team with a variety of producers during her tenure with the label.

Faced with the prospect of being sued by Warner Bros. Records due to the breakup of Bacharach/David and their failure to honor their contract with Warwick, she filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against her former partners for breach of contract. The suit was settled out of court in 1979 for $5 million, including the rights to all Warwick recordings produced by Bacharach and David.

Also in 1971, Warwick had her name changed to &quot;Warwicke&quot; per the advice of Linda Goodman, an astrologer friend, who believed it would bring greater success. A few years later, she reverted to the old spelling after a string of disappointments and an absence from the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40.

=== Warner era (1972–1978) ===

Without the guidance and songwriting that Bacharach/David had provided, Warwick&#x27;s career stalled in the early 1970s although she remained a top concert draw throughout the world. There were no big hits during the early and mid part of the decade, aside from 1974&#x27;s &quot;Then Came You&quot;, recorded as a duet with the Spinners and produced by Thom Bell. Bell later noted, &quot;Dionne made a (strange) face when we finished [the song]. She didn&#x27;t like it much, but I knew we had something. So we ripped a dollar in two, signed each half and exchanged them. I told her, &#x27;If it doesn&#x27;t go number one, I&#x27;ll send you my half.&#x27; When it took off, Dionne sent hers back. There was an apology on it.&quot; It was her first U.S. No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Other than this success, Warwick&#x27;s five years on Warner Bros. Records produced no other major hits, but &quot;Then Came You&quot; was issued by co-owned Atlantic Records, the Spinners&#x27; label. Two notable songs recorded during this period were &quot;His House and Me&quot; and &quot;Once You Hit The Road&quot; (No. 79 pop, No. 5 R&amp;B, No. 22 Adult Contemporary), both of which were produced in 1975 by Thom Bell. 

Warwick recorded five albums with Warners: &quot;Dionne&quot; (1972), produced by Bacharach and David and a modest chart success; &quot;Just Being Myself&quot; (1973), produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland;
&quot;Then Came You&quot; (1975), produced by Jerry Ragovoy; &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (1975), produced by Thom Bell; and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; (1977), produced by Steve Barri and Michael Omartian. Her five-year contract with Warners expired in 1977, and with that, she ended her stay at the label. Warwick&#x27;s dry spell on the American charts ended with her signing to Arista Records in 1979, where she began a second highly successful run of hit records and albums well into the late 1980s.

=== &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and move to Arista (1979–1989) ===
With the move to Arista Records and the release of her RIAA-certified million seller &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love This Way Again&quot; in 1979, Warwick was again enjoying top success on the charts. The song was produced by Barry Manilow. The accompanying album, &quot;Dionne&quot;, was certified Platinum in the United States for sales exceeding one million units. The album peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Chart and made the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums Chart. Warwick had been personally signed and guided by the label&#x27;s founder Clive Davis, who told her, &quot;You may be ready to give the business up, but the business is not ready to give you up.&quot; Warwick&#x27;s next single release was another major hit. &quot;Deja Vu&quot; was co-written by Isaac Hayes and hit No. 1 Adult Contemporary as well as No. 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100. In 1980, Warwick won two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love This Way Again&quot; and Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. She became the first female artist in the history of the awards to win in both categories the same year. Her second Arista album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;No Night So Long&quot; sold 500,000 U.S. copies and featured the title track which became a major success – hitting No. 1 Adult Contemporary and No. 23 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 – and the album peaked at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Albums Chart.
In January 1980, while under contract to Arista Records, Warwick hosted a two-hour TV special called &quot;Solid Gold &#x27;79&quot;. This was adapted into the weekly one-hour show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, which she hosted throughout 1980 and 1981 and again in 1985–86. Major highlights of each show were the duets she performed with her co-hosts, which often included some of Warwick&#x27;s hits and her co-hosts&#x27; hits, intermingled and arranged by &quot;Solid Gold&quot; musical director Michael Miller. Another highlight in each show was Warwick&#x27;s vocal rendition of the &quot;Solid Gold&quot; theme, composed by Miller (with lyrics by Dean Pitchford).

After a brief appearance in the Top Forty in early 1982 with Johnny Mathis on &quot;Friends in Love&quot; – from the album of the same name – Warwick&#x27;s next hit later that same year was her full-length collaboration with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees for the album &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. The project came about when Clive Davis was attending his aunt&#x27;s wedding in Orlando, Florida in early 1982 and spoke with Barry Gibb. Gibb mentioned that he had always been a fan of Warwick&#x27;s, and Davis arranged for Warwick and the Bee Gees to discuss a project. Warwick and the Gibb brothers obviously hit it off as both the album and the title single were released in October 1982 to massive success. Warwick later stated to Wesley Hyatt in his &quot;Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits&quot; that she was not initially fond of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; but recorded the tune because she trusted the Bee Gees&#x27; judgment that it would be a hit. The song did become one of Warwick&#x27;s biggest international hits, returning her to the Top 10 of &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100 as well as No. 1 Adult Contemporary and No. 2 in both the UK and Australia. The tune was also a Top-10 hit throughout continental Europe, Japan, South Africa, Canada and Asia. The album ended up selling 3 million copies internationally and earned Warwick an RIAA Gold record award in the US. In Britain, the disc was certified Platinum.

In 1983, Warwick released &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot;, produced by Luther Vandross. The album&#x27;s most successful single was the title track, &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot;, a Warwick/Vandross duet, which peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also became a Top-10 hit on the Adult Contemporary and R&amp;B charts. The album peaked at No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Of note was a reunion with the original Shirelles on Warwick&#x27;s cover of &quot;Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; The album &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot; followed in 1984 and reunited her with both Barry Manilow and Burt Bacharach, who was writing with his then current lyricist partner and wife, Carole Bayer Sager. In 1985, Warwick contributed her voice to the multi-Grammy Award winning charity song &quot;We Are the World&quot;, along with vocalists like Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and Ray Charles. The song spent four consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It was the year&#x27;s biggest hit – certified four times Platinum in the United States alone.

In 1985, Warwick and Bacharach once again collaborated on the song &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. This period was the first time they had worked together since the 1970s, when Warwick felt abandoned by Bacharach and Hal David dissolving their partnership. Warwick said of their reconciliation:

Warwick recorded &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; as a benefit single for the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) alongside Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder in 1985. The single, credited to &quot;Dionne and Friends&quot;, was released in October and eventually raised more than three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple No. 1 – R&amp;B, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1986 – selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. &quot;Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed the right thing to do. You have to be granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is so painful to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony&quot;, Warwick told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1988. &quot;I am tired of hurting and it does hurt.&quot; The single won the performers the NARAS Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled &quot;Friends&quot;, which reached No. 12 on Billboard&#x27;s album chart.
In 1987, Dionne Warwick won the Special Recognition Award at the American Music Awards for &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;.

In 1987, Warwick scored another hit with &quot;Love Power&quot;. Her eighth career No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit, it also reached No. 5 in R&amp;B and No. 12 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. A duet with Jeffrey Osborne, it was also written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager, and it was featured in Warwick&#x27;s album &quot;Reservations for Two&quot;. The album&#x27;s title song, a duet with Kashif, was also a chart hit. Other artists featured on the album included Smokey Robinson and June Pointer.

=== &quot;Friends Can Be Lovers&quot; (1990–2000) ===
During the 1990s, Warwick hosted infomercials for the Psychic Friends Network, which featured self-described psychic Linda Georgian. The 900 number psychic service was active from 1991 to 1998. According to press statements throughout the 1990s, the program was the most successful infomercial for several years and Warwick earned in excess of three million dollars per year as spokesperson for the network. In 1998, Inphomation, the corporation owning the network, filed for bankruptcy and Warwick ended her association with the organization. Warwick&#x27;s longtime friend and tour manager Henry Carr acknowledged that &quot;when Dionne was going through an airport and a child recognized her as &#x27;that psychic lady on TV&#x27;, Dionne was crushed and said she had worked too hard as an entertainer to become known as &#x27;the psychic lady.

Warwick&#x27;s most publicized album during this period was 1993&#x27;s &quot;Friends Can Be Lovers&quot;, which was produced in part by Ian Devaney and Lisa Stansfield. Featured on the album was &quot;Sunny Weather Lover&quot;, which was the first song that Burt Bacharach and Hal David had written together for Warwick since 1972. It was Warwick&#x27;s lead single in the United States, and was heavily promoted by Arista, but failed to chart. A follow-up &quot;Where My Lips Have Been&quot; peaked at No. 95 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. The 1994 &quot;Aquarela Do Brasil&quot; album marked the end of Warwick&#x27;s contract with Arista Records. In 1990, Warwick recorded the song &quot;It&#x27;s All Over&quot; with former member of Modern Talking Dieter Bohlen (Blue System). The single peaked at No. 60 (No. 33 airplay) on the German pop charts and it was covered on Blue System&#x27;s album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;.

In 1993, Forrest Sawyer, host of the ABC news/entertainment program &quot;Day One&quot;, alleged financial improprieties by the Warwick Foundation, founded in 1989 to benefit AIDS patients, and particularly Warwick&#x27;s charity concert performances organized to benefit the organization as &quot;America&#x27;s Ambassador of Health&quot;. The network news magazine story, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, reported that the Warwick Foundation was operating at more than 90% administrative cost, donating only about 3% of the money it raised to AIDS groups. Several AIDS groups and nonprofit experts criticized her foundation, including an AIDS group in the Virgin Islands that claimed she nearly bankrupted them after extravagant expenses left nothing for local charities. ABC reported that Warwick flew first class and was accommodated at first-class hotels for charity concerts and events in which she participated for the Warwick Foundation, managed by her close confident, Guy Draper, a former chief of protocol for former Washington DC Mayor Marion Barry, and who had a history of bankruptcies. Warwick alleged that the ABC report was racially motivated and threatened to sue ABC News for defamation, although a suit was never filed. The Internal Revenue Service began an investigation of the Warwick Foundation after other complaints were filed, and the Warwick Foundation was later dissolved. ABC&#x27;s story was nominated for a national Emmy award in 1994 and won a prestigious Investigative Reporters and Editors national television award in 1993.

=== &quot;My Favorite Time of the Year&quot; and move to Concord Records (2000–2010) ===

On October 16, 2002, Warwick was nominated to be Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

In 2004, Warwick&#x27;s first Christmas album was released. Entitled &quot;My Favorite Time of the Year&quot;, the CD featured jazzy interpretations of many holiday classics. In 2007, Rhino Records re-released the CD with new cover art.

In 2005, Warwick was honored by Oprah Winfrey at her Legends Ball. She appeared on the May 24, 2006, fifth-season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Warwick sang a medley of &quot;Walk On By&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;, with longtime collaborator Burt Bacharach accompanying her on the piano.

In 2006, Warwick signed with Concord Records after a 15-year tenure at Arista, which had ended in 1994. Her first and only release for the label was &quot;My Friends and Me&quot;, a duets album containing reworkings of her old hits, very similar to her 1998 CD &quot;Dionne Sings Dionne&quot;. Among her singing partners were Gloria Estefan, Olivia Newton-John, Wynonna Judd and Reba McEntire. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was produced by her son, Damon Elliott. A follow-up album featuring Warwick&#x27;s old hits as duets with male vocalists was planned, but the project was cancelled. The relationship with Concord concluded with the release of &quot;My Friends and Me&quot;. A compilation CD of her greatest hits and love songs, &quot;The Love Collection&quot;, entered the UK album chart at number 27 on February 16, 2008.

Warwick&#x27;s second gospel album, &quot;Why We Sing&quot;, was released on February 26, 2008, in the United Kingdom and on April 1, 2008, in the United States. The album features guest spots by her sister Dee Dee Warwick and BeBe Winans.

On October 18, 2008, Warwick&#x27;s sister Dee Dee died in a nursing home in Essex County, New Jersey. She had been in failing health for several months.

On November 24, 2008, Warwick was the star performer on &quot;Divas II&quot;, a UK ITV1 special show that also featured Rihanna, Leona Lewis, the Sugababes, Pink, Gabriella Climi and Anastacia.

In 2008, Warwick began recording an album of songs from the Sammy Cahn and Jack Wolf songbooks. The finished recording, entitled &quot;Only Trust Your Heart&quot;, was released in 2011.

On October 20, 2009, Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation and New Gold Music Ltd. released a song that Warwick had recorded about ten years prior called &quot;Starlight&quot;. The lyrics were written by Dean Pitchford, prolific writer of &quot;Fame&quot;, screenwriter of – and sole or joint lyricist of every song in the soundtrack of – the original 1984 film &quot;Footloose&quot;, and lyricist of the &quot;Solid Gold&quot; theme. The music had been composed by Bill Goldstein, whose versatile career included the original music for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot; TV series. Warwick, Pitchford and Goldstein announced that they would be donating 100% of their royalties to Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation, to support Starlight&#x27;s mission to help seriously ill children and their families cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, education and family activities.
When Bill and Dean brought this song to me, I instantly felt connected to its message of shining a little light into the lives of people who need it most&quot;, said Warwick. &quot;I admire the work of Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation and know that if the song brings hope to even just one sick child, we have succeeded.

=== &quot;Only Trust Your Heart&quot; and Grammy Award (2010–2019) ===

In 2011, the New Jazz style CD &quot;Only Trust Your Heart&quot; was released, featuring many Sammy Cahn songs. In March 2011, Warwick appeared on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 4&quot;. Her charity was the Hunger Project. She was dismissed from her &quot;apprenticeship&quot; to Donald Trump during the fourth task of the season. In February 2012, Warwick performed &quot;Walk On By&quot; on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;. She also received the Goldene Kamera Musical Lifetime Achievement Award in Germany, and performed &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; at the ceremony.

On May 28, 2012, Warwick headlined the World Hunger Day concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. She sang &quot;One World One Song&quot;, specially written for the Hunger Project by Tony Hatch and Tim Holder and was joined by Joe McElderry, the London Community Gospel Choir and a choir from Woodbridge School, Woodbridge, Suffolk.

In 2012, the 50th anniversary CD entitled &quot;NOW&quot; was released; Warwick recorded 12 Bacharach/David tracks produced by Phil Ramone.

On September 19, 2013, she collaborated with country singer Billy Ray Cyrus for his song &quot;Hope Is Just Ahead&quot;.

=== Documentary and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; (2020–present) ===
In 2020, she appeared as &quot;Mouse&quot; on the third season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. She was eliminated in the fifth round, but came back during the first part of the season three finale to sing &quot;What the World Needs Now is Love&quot; with the finalists Night Angel, Frog and Turtle as a tribute to the healthcare workers working on the front lines during the coronavirus pandemic. This performance was created after the season wrapped production in March. Warwick made a guest appearance during Gladys Knight&#x27;s and Patti Labelle&#x27;s Verzuz battle. Together they performed Warwick&#x27;s song, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. They closed with their collaborative song &quot;Superwoman&quot;.

In &quot;My Life, as I See It: An Autobiography&quot;, Warwick lists her honorary doctorate from Hartt among those awarded by six other institutions: Hartt College, Bethune-Cookman University, Shaw University, Columbia College of Chicago, Lincoln College, Illinois [May 2010, Doctor of Arts (hon.)], and University of Maryland Eastern Shore.

On February 10, 2021, Dionne was nominated for inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

On December 3, 2021, Dionne was honored with a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.

Warwick appears in a documentary revolving around her life and career, &quot;Dionne Warwick: Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2021. Organizers of the Toronto Film Festival announced that she would be honored in the upcoming event as a music icon. On November 26, 2021, Warwick released the single &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Impossible&quot; a duet featuring Chance the Rapper. Two charities are being supported by the duet: SocialWorks, a Chicago-based nonprofit that Chance founded to empower the youth through the arts, education and civic engagement, and Hunger: Not Impossible, a text-based service connecting kids and their families in need with prepaid, nutritious, to-go meals from local restaurants. On January 1, 2023, the documentary premiered on national television on CNN.

In December 2023, Warwick participated in the fifth series of &quot;The Masked Singer UK&quot; as &quot;Weather&quot;. She was eliminated and unmasked on the first episode.

On April 26, 2024, Warwick along with the vocal group The Chi-Lites, were inducted into The Atlantic City Walk of Fame presented by The National R&amp;B Music Society Inc. Producer, writer and director Dave Wooley was the presenter for Warwick. The induction ceremony was held at Brighton Park in Atlantic City, NJ.

In 2024, Warwick was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical excellence category. She also competed on episode of &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

== Voice and artistry ==
Warwick is a contralto, particularly known for her signature musicality and &quot;husky&quot; singing voice. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; theatre critic Hilton Als reported that, early in her singing career, Warwick&#x27;s wide vocal range &quot;allowed her both to sing contralto low notes and to soar as a soprano&quot;. According to Mike Joyce of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, some performances on Warwick&#x27;s album &quot;Dionne Warwick Sings Cole Porter&quot; (1990) capture her warmth &quot;and emphasize her subtle phrasing&quot;. In a separate review published in 1982, Joyce noted that Warwick&#x27;s &quot;magical&quot; voice still manages to be &quot;opaque, elusive, elegant&quot; simultaneously, even when performing what he described as some of her most banal material in her discography. Reviewing a concert in 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Stephen Holden observed that Warwick&#x27;s voice had deepened &quot;into a near-baritone at its bottom end&quot;, resulting in &quot;an ever-more fascinating vocal personality&quot;. Similarly, in 2006, Sarah Dempster of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that Warwick&#x27;s voice &quot;has deepened with age, lending a splendidly full-bodied finish to everything&quot;.

Music critics have described Warwick as the muse of songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s, a term Bacharach himself has used to refer to the singer. Bacharach confirmed that they considered Warwick their &quot;main artist&quot;, to whom they allowed first priority on new songs. MTV contributor Carol Cooper said Warwick&#x27;s interpretation of their songs &quot;established Warwick as the eloquent voice of wounded feminine pride&quot;, crediting her with making their material &quot;even more unique and compelling&quot;. According to Michael Musto of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the singer&#x27;s voice proved to be &quot;the perfect venue for Bacharach-David hits&quot;, writing, &quot;Dionne could do sultry, pained, wispy, and regretful, all with sophisticated phrasings that made her a vocal emblem for the &#x27;60s heartbeat&quot;. The singer claims she did not find their material difficult to sing because they had been written specifically for her voice. Cooper identified their partnership as a precedent to the collaborations between R&amp;B singer Toni Braxton, and songwriters Babyface and Diane Warren.

Musically, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Stephen Holden and &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Ian Gittins described Warwick as a pop soul singer. However, AllMusic biographer William Ruhlmann found the singer particularly difficult to categorize as a vocalist, writing, &quot;Although Warwick grew up singing in church, she is not a gospel singer. Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan are clear influences, but she is not a jazz singer. R&amp;B is also part of her background, yet she is not really a soul singer, either, at least not in the sense that Aretha Franklin is&quot;. Similar, AllMusic reviewer believes Warwick combines elements of jazz, R&amp;B, and gospel, which ultimately result in a &quot;pure pop singer&quot;. &quot;The Washington Informer&quot; senior editor D. Kevin McNeir reported that Warwick&#x27;s delivery and stage presence are often described as &quot;scintillating, soothing, sensual and soulful&quot;. A writer for the &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot; observed that Warwick is usually described as a &quot;sophisticated&quot; singer, while noting that this term &quot;doesn&#x27;t place her in a specific musical category&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Warwick as &quot;one of the greatest pop singers of all time&quot;, while Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named her &quot;that one-of-a-kind instrument that defined pop sophistication in the mid-1960s&quot;.

In recent years, Warwick has become known for sharing candid, straightforward opinions about various topics on the social media platform Twitter, being nicknamed the &quot;Queen of Twitter&quot; by several media publications.

== Personal life ==
In 1966, Warwick married actor and drummer William Elliott; they divorced in May 1967. They reconciled and were remarried in Milan, Italy, in August 1967. On January 18, 1969, while living in East Orange, New Jersey, she gave birth to her first son, David Elliott. In 1973, her second son Damon Elliott was born. On May 30, 1975, the couple separated and Warwick was granted a divorce in December 1975 in Los Angeles. The court denied Elliott&#x27;s request for $2,000 a month () in support pending a community property trial, and for $5,000, when he insisted he was making $500 a month in comparison to Warwick making $100,000 a month (). Warwick stated &quot;I was the breadwinner. The male ego is a fragile thing. It&#x27;s hard when the woman is the breadwinner. All my life, the only man who ever took care of me financially was my father. I have always taken care of myself.&quot;

In 2002, Warwick was arrested at Miami International Airport for possession of marijuana. It was discovered that she had 11 suspected marijuana cigarettes inside her carry-on luggage, hidden in a lipstick container. She was charged with possessing marijuana totaling less than five grams. 
In 2009 Warwick had a $2.2 million federal tax lien filed against her. The IRS eventually discovered that a large portion of the lien was due to an accounting error and revoked $1.2mil in 2012.

In 1993, her older son David, a former Los Angeles police officer, co-wrote with Terry Steele the Warwick-Whitney Houston duet &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;, featured on her album &quot;Friends Can Be Lovers&quot;. Since 2002, he has periodically toured with and performed duets with his mother (along with being the drummer of her touring band), and had his acting debut in the film &quot;Ali&quot; as the singer Sam Cooke. David became a singer-songwriter, with Luther Vandross&#x27; &quot;Here and Now&quot; among others to his credit.

Her second son, Damon Elliott, is a music producer, who has worked with Mýa, Pink, Christina Aguilera and Keyshia Cole. He arranged and produced his mother&#x27;s 2006 Concord release &quot;My Friends and Me&quot;. She received a 2014 Grammy Award nomination in the Traditional Pop Category for her 2013 album release, &quot;Now&quot;.

On January 24, 2015, Warwick was hospitalized after a fall in the shower at her home. After ankle surgery, she was discharged from the hospital.

=== Bankruptcy ===
Warwick declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy in New Jersey on March 21, 2013. Due to the reported mismanagement of her business affairs, she listed liabilities that included nearly $7 million owed to the Internal Revenue Service for the years 1991 to 1999 and more than $3 million in business taxes owed to the state of California. Unable to work out an agreement with tax officials, she and her attorney decided that declaring bankruptcy would be the best course of action.

=== Relations ===
Warwick&#x27;s sister Dee Dee Warwick also had a successful singing career, scoring several notable R&amp;B hits in the US, including the original version of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;. Dee Dee recorded the original version of the song &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot;, which later became a 1963 No. 5 R&amp;B hit for Betty Everett, a 1964 No. 3 UK hit for The Swinging Blue Jeans and a 1975 No. 1 pop hit for Linda Ronstadt. In 1966, the Swinging Blue Jeans had a No. 31 UK hit with a cover of Dionne&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, thus appearing in the UK Singles Chart with covers of songs from both Warwick sisters.

Warwick&#x27;s maternal aunt is gospel-trained vocalist Cissy Houston, mother of Warwick&#x27;s cousin, the late singer Whitney Houston.

In her 2011 autobiography, &quot;My Life, as I See It&quot;, Warwick notes that opera diva Leontyne Price is a maternal cousin.

<text>Bergen aan Zee is a village and seaside resort on the North Sea coast in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about 9 km west of Alkmaar.

==History==
The village was first mentioned in 1848 as Bergen aan Zee, and means Bergen on the sea. It was officially founded in 1906. A new seaside village was built as a result of private investment by large landowners and the mayor of Bergen. Bergen aan Zee has grown into a beach resort town, popular for surfing and sailing. The majority of the visitors come either from the Netherlands or Germany, to enjoy the sandy beach. It is also home to Zee Aquarium Bergen.

Between 1909 and 1955 it was the terminus of a light rail line from Alkmaar to the coast, where the iconic Dutch steam engine &quot;Bello&quot; was one of the locomotives.

<text>Catrijp is a hamlet in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about 9 km northwest of Alkmaar.

The name already appears in 1680 as &quot;Catryp&quot;. This name refers to a strip of land along water, probably water in the dunes. The first part (cat) of the name is unclear and has multiple meanings. Catrijp has no place name signs.

<text>Egmond aan den Hoef () is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about west of Alkmaar. Until 2001, Egmond aan den Hoef was part of the municipality of Egmond.

The village was first mentioned in 1167 Ekmunde, and means &quot;parcel of land belonging to Egmond&quot;. The name originally applied only to the castle, but was later used for the settlement around the castle.

In Egmond aan den Hoef are the remains of Egmond Castle, the residence of the House of Egmond. The castle was first built in the 11th century, and was destroyed around 1205. It was rebuilt and fortified, and was destroyed again in the 14th century. Again it was rebuilt. In 1573 at the order of William the Silent it was demolished by the Geuzen, led by Diederik Sonoy. The remnants were taken down at the end of the 18th century. During the 1930s the remains were dug up.

The French philosopher René Descartes, author of &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, lived in Egmond aan den Hoef, right near the castle remains, in 1643-44 and perhaps longer. For many years he lived in the neighboring village of Egmond-Binnen.

<doc id="167303" wikidata="Q133466" url="?curid=167303" title="A Canterbury Tale">
<text>A Canterbury Tale is a 1944 British film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger starring Eric Portman, Sheila Sim, Dennis Price and Sgt. John Sweet; Esmond Knight provided narration and played two small roles. For the post-war American release, Raymond Massey narrated and Kim Hunter was added to the film. The film was made in black and white, and was the first of two collaborations between Powell and Pressburger and cinematographer Erwin Hillier.

Much of the film&#x27;s visual style is a mixture of British realism and Hillier&#x27;s German Expressionist style that is harnessed through a neo-romantic sense of the English landscape. The concept that &#x27;the past always haunts the present&#x27; in the English landscape was already part of English literary culture, e.g. in works by Rudyard Kipling such as &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;, and would become a notable trope for British novelists and film-makers from the 1960s. &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; takes its title from the 14th-century &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; of Geoffrey Chaucer and loosely uses Chaucer&#x27;s theme of &quot;eccentric characters on a religious pilgrimage&quot; to highlight the wartime experiences of the citizens of Kent and encourage wartime Anglo-American friendship and understanding. Anglo-American relations were also explored in Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; and in more detail in their subsequent film &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;.

==Plot==
The story concerns three young people: British Army Sergeant Peter Gibbs, U.S. Army Sergeant Bob Johnson, and a &quot;Land Girl&quot;, Miss Alison Smith. The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement &quot;next stop Canterbury&quot; and thinking he was in Canterbury.

As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform, who pours glue on her hair before escaping. It transpires that this has happened to other women, and the mystery attacker is known locally as &quot;the glue man&quot;. Alison asks Bob if he will spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several small boys who play large-scale war games.

The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man&#x27;s victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and steals the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson&#x27;s boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper. The dates of the attacks correspond with Colpeper&#x27;s night watches, for which he wore a Home Guard uniform kept in the town hall.

On their train journey to Canterbury on the Monday morning, Colpeper joins the three in their compartment. They confront him with their suspicions, which he does not deny, and they discover that his motive is to prevent the soldiers from being distracted from his lectures by female company, as well as to help keep the local women faithful to their absent British boyfriends. In Colpeper&#x27;s words, Chaucer&#x27;s pilgrims travelled to Canterbury to &quot;receive a blessing or to do penance&quot;. On arriving in the city of Canterbury, devastated by wartime bombing, all three young people receive blessings of their own. Alison discovers that her boyfriend, believed killed in the war, has survived after all; his father, who had blocked their marriage because he thought his son could do better than a shopgirl, finally relents. Bob receives long-delayed letters from his sweetheart, who is now a WAC in Australia. Peter, a cinema organist before the war, gets to play the music of Johann Sebastian Bach on the large organ at Canterbury Cathedral, before leaving with his unit. He decides not to report Colpeper to the Canterbury police, as he had planned to do.

==Cast==

* Eric Portman as Thomas Colpeper, a gentleman farmer and magistrate in Chillingbourne. He is a bachelor, living with his mother and, being very keen on the local history of the area, wants to share that knowledge with everyone around him, particularly with the soldiers from elsewhere in Britain who have been billeted nearby.
* Sgt. John Sweet, U.S. Army as Acting Sgt. Bob Johnson, ASN 31036062, hails from Three Sisters Falls, Oregon. On his way from Salisbury to Canterbury to meet his friend and fulfil a promise to his mother to see Canterbury Cathedral, he gets off the train at Chillingbourne (filmed at Selling railway station between Faversham and Canterbury) by mistake and almost immediately gets caught up in the mystery of the &quot;glue man&quot;. He has come to Britain as a part of the American Army preparing for the invasion of Europe. He becomes more and more willing to learn something about England during his visit. The original script mentioned that Johnson was on his way to Canterbury as his ancestors had come from there. The producers had originally planned to use Burgess Meredith in the role but changed their mind in favour of an unknown. Meredith acted as a script editor for Johnson&#x27;s character.
* Dennis Price as Sgt Peter Gibbs, a cinema organist from London. He has been conscripted into the British Army and has just been stationed at the military camp outside Chillingbourne, where his unit is engaged in training manoeuvres.
* Sheila Sim as Alison Smith, a shop assistant in a department store in London. She has joined the Women&#x27;s Land Army to &quot;do her bit&quot; to help in the defence of her country. She has been assigned to the farm of Thomas Colpeper, the local JP in Chillingbourne. Alison had previously spent a happy summer just outside Chillingbourne, living in a caravan with her fiancé, an archaeologist who has since joined the RAF and is missing in action at the outset of the film. (He is reported at the end as alive and in Gibraltar). Alison is determined to solve the mystery of the &quot;glue man&quot; and seeks the help of Bob Johnson to do so. Johnson replies &quot;You need about as much help as a Flying Fortress&quot;.
* Charles Hawtrey as Thomas Duckett, the town&#x27;s stationmaster.
* Esmond Knight as Narrator/Seven-Sisters Soldier/Village Idiot. The Narrator reads the modernised extract from Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, followed by a piece in Chaucerian style on the changes to Kent since Chaucer&#x27;s time (both only in the original version).
* George Merritt as Ned Horton and Edward Rigby as Jim Horton, play the blacksmith and the wheelwright. The real Horton brothers, Ben and Neville, are seen acting as assistants to the actors.
* Hay Petrie as Woodcock.
* Freda Jackson as Mrs Prudence Honeywood, the farming woman who employs Alison.
* Eliot Makeham as the cathedral organist in Canterbury.
* Betty Jardine as Fee Baker.
* Harvey Golden as Sgt Roczinsky, Bob Johnson&#x27;s friend in Canterbury.
* Leonard Smith (Leslie) James Tamsitt (Terry) and David Todd (David), play among the group of boys enjoying an adventure and river battle in a bucolic setting. All of them were local to the Canterbury area. Smith, Tamsitt and Todd were selected for speaking roles.
* Beresford Egan as PC Ovenden.
* Anthony Holles as Sergt. Bassett.
* Maude Lambert as Miss Grainger.
* Wally Bosco as ARP man.
* Charles Paton as Ernie Brooks.
* Jane Millican as Susanna Foster.
* John Slater as Sergt. Len.

* Judith Furse as Dorothy Bird.
* Barbara Waring as Polly Finn.
* Jean Shepeard as Gwladys Swinton.
* Margaret Scudamore as Mrs Colpeper.
* Joss Ambler as Police Inspector.
* Jessie James as Waitress.
* Kathleen Lucas as a passer- by.
* H. F. Maltby as Mr Portal.
* Eric Maturin as Geoffrey&#x27;s father.
* Parry Jones jnr as Arthur.
* Kim Hunter as Johnson&#x27;s Girl (American release).
* Raymond Massey as Narrator (American version) (voice).
* Esma Cannon as Agnes the maid.

==Production==
===Writing===
Powell and Pressburger, who were known collectively as &quot;The Archers&quot;, wrote the script together, linking the concepts of landscape and history (light and time) with the personal journey of three people—the pilgrims—to show a basis of common identity. Powell was said to have used the work of Chaucer as inspiration to create a film that showed &quot;the love of his birthplace and all that he felt about England&quot;.

===Casting===
All three leads were unknowns. Many local people, including a lot of young boys, were recruited as extras for the extensive scenes of children&#x27;s outdoor activities such as river &quot;battles&quot; and dens.

===Filming===
The film was shot throughout the county of Kent not long after the Baedeker raids of May–June 1942 which had destroyed large areas of the city centre of Canterbury. Much of the film is shot on location in and around Canterbury Cathedral and the city&#x27;s bomb sites, including the High Street, Rose Lane and the Buttermarket. The cathedral was not available for filming as the stained glass had been taken down, the windows boarded up and the organ, an important location for the story, removed to storage, all for protection against air raids. By the use of clever perspective, large portions of the cathedral were recreated within the studio by art director Alfred Junge.

Several Kent villages including Chilham, Wickhambreaux, Fordwich and Wingham were used for scenes showing the fictional village of Chillingbourne. Selling Station appears in the film as Chillingbourne Station at the beginning of the film. Chilham Mill features in the film in the scene where GI Bob meets children playing in the river on a boat and later, with Peter, when they get the proof about Colpeper. The scene where soldiers gather for a lecture at the Colpepper Institute was filmed in Fordwich. As Bob and Alison ride on a cart through the village, Wickham Mill, Wickhambreaux, can be clearly seen. Colpeper&#x27;s house was Wickhambreaux Court. A local Wingham village pub &quot;The Red Lion&quot; was used for some exterior shots of &quot;The Hand of Glory&quot; inn where Bob stays whilst in the village. Other exterior shots of &quot;The Hand of Glory&quot; were filmed at &quot;The George and Dragon&quot;, Fordwich.

Before the credits, the following acknowledgement appears over an image of the cathedral viewed from the Christ Church Gate,

==Soundtrack==
Besides that composed by Allan Gray for the film, musical works featured include:
* &quot;Angelus ad Virginem&quot; mid-15th century polyphony heard as a peal of bells in orchestral guise under the opening titles
* &quot;Commando Patrol&quot; by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley – quickstep heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs&#x27;s scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory
* &quot;I See You Everywhere&quot; by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley – slow foxtrot heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs&#x27;s scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory
* &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; – folksong heard as Agnes leaves Bob&#x27;s bedroom
* &quot;Come to the Church in the Wild Wood&quot; – Bob sings as he washes
* &quot;Hear my prayer, O Lord&quot; by Henry Purcell – the ethereal choral music heard as Gibbs pauses on entering the cathedral
* &quot;Bond of Friendship&quot; – Regimental March of the King&#x27;s Division. Played as the band nears the Cathedral
* Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 by J. S. Bach (the original while inside the cathedral and the orchestration by Leopold Stokowski outside the cathedral) and the hymn &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; – played on the organ by Gibbs

==Reception==
The world premiere was held on 11 May 1944 at the Friars&#x27; Cinema (later the second site of the Marlowe Theatre, now demolished), Canterbury, England, an event commemorated there by a plaque unveiled by stars Sheila Sim and John Sweet in October 2000. Although the film initially had very poor reviews in the UK press, and only small audiences, it became a moderate success at the British box office in 1944.

The film was the first production of Powell and Pressburger not to be a major box office draw. With the war over Powell was forced by the studio to completely re-edit the film for the U.S. release, cutting over 20 minutes to make the film shorter and faster moving, adding narration by Raymond Massey, and filming &quot;bookends&quot; which introduced Kim Hunter as Sergeant Johnson&#x27;s girlfriend to make the film more contemporary. At the time of filming, Hunter and Massey were preparing to film &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; for Powell. Powell filmed Hunter&#x27;s sequences with Sweet on an English set simulating New York City where the couple, now married, presented the film as a flashback similar to the openings of &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. Sweet was actually filmed in New York with the sequences combined. The film was fully restored by the British Film Institute in the late 1970s and the new print was hailed as a masterwork of British cinema. It has since been reissued on DVD in both the UK and USA.

There is now an annual festival based around the film in which film fans tour the film&#x27;s locations. The theme of the film was used by Spike Milligan for &quot;The Goon Show&quot; episode &quot;The Phantom Head Shaver of Brighton&quot; in 1954. The film was shown in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 19 September 2007 to help raise money for the cathedral restoration fund and in the Chilham village hall in May 2014 to help raise money for the restoration of its war memorial. The screening, which took place in the village where the film was made, coincided with the 70th anniversary of the film&#x27;s premiere in Canterbury. Several video artists have recut the more visionary sections of the film as video art. Dialogue from the film was sampled on the track &quot;Introduction&quot; on the album &quot;Merrie Land&quot; by The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, and Dreadzone&#x27;s &quot;Second Light&quot;.

<text>Egmond aan Zee () is a village on the North Sea coast in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, about 9 km west of Alkmaar.

Egmond aan Zee was a separate municipality until 1978, when it merged with Egmond-Binnen and Egmond aan den Hoef to form the new municipality Egmond. In turn, Egmond was amalgamated into Bergen on 1 January 2001.

==History==

This best-known of the three villages of Egmond was formed in the coastal dunes. According to legend, it was founded around 977. Settlers in this area have battled the sea since the first settlements. During the All Saints&#x27; Flood of 1570, some 50 houses disappeared into the sea. And in November 1741, the sea swallowed 36 houses, the church, and its tower.

Apart from being dangerous, the sea also provided the people of Egmond food and work, as most inhabitants of Egmond were fishermen. Quite a few sights in Egmond remind one of this; for instance, the &quot;fishermen-houses&quot;, which are tiny houses near the sea where fishermen used to live. Another sight is a fishermen monument and the &quot;Prins Hendrik Stichting&quot;, a stately building named after a Dutch prince that used to house retired fishermen. The Egmond museum paints a picture of what living in Egmond used to be like.

Egmond aan Zee has been a popular seaside resort since the beginning of the 20th century, when it was well known for its healthy and clear sea air. Children came over to stay in one of the many &quot;koloniehuizen&quot; (colony houses), which were sanatorium-like institutions often run by charities and churches. The center of attention in Egmond is certainly the Jan van Speijk Lighthouse, built in 1834 and named after Dutch sea captain Jan van Speijk.

==Art and the artists&#x27; colony==
Historically, Egmond aan Zee had been a popular subject for artists such as Cornelis Beelt and Jacob van Ruisdael.

The rural Dutch villages of Egmond aan Zee, Egmond aan den Hoef, and Egmond Binnen played host to a small artists&#x27; colony beginning in 1881 when the American artist George Hitchcock settled there. Walter MacEwen, also American, painted there from 1883 to 1885. Another American, Gari Melchers, arrived in 1884. Melchers continued there for 25 years, recording the people and the rural environment. See Joseph G. Dreiss, Gari Melchers; His Works in the Belmont Collection, Charlottesville, University Press of Virginia, 1984, pp. 11ff.

==Statistics==
In 2001, the town of Egmond aan Zee had 5086 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.85 km2, and contained 2490 residences.

==Events==
The Egmond Half Marathon (Dutch: Egmond Halve Marathon) is an annual half marathon race over 21.1 kilometres that has been staged since 1973. The competition normally takes place in early January. Sections of the road race cross along the beach and sand dunes of the village, situated on the North Sea coast. The 2010 edition of the race was cancelled due to poor weather conditions, marking the first break in the race&#x27;s history.

From 1995, Egmond aan Zee has hosted the Finder Darts Masters, a yearly major darts tournament that features players for the British Darts Organisation circuit, and formally sanctioned by the World Darts Federation. It is usually held in December, at the Hotel Zuiderduin, and is traditionally the last tournament held before the World Championship.

== Cultural references ==
Egmond aan Zee is the setting of part of the novel &quot;The Tree and the Vine&quot; (1954) by Dola de Jong.

<text>Egmond-Binnen () is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about southwest of Alkmaar.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 922 as Ekmunde. The etymology is unknown. The missionary Adalbert of Egmond founded a chapel near Egmond-Binnen and died there around 740. In 922, the Benedictine Egmond Abbey was founded at the location and a settlement developed around it. The abbey was plundered and partially destroyed in 1573. The loot was used to finance the founding of Leiden University.

René Descartes lived in the village during the 1640s.

In 1789, the south tower collapsed, and the remainder was sold for demolition.

The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1836 at the former north tower of the abbey. Between 1914 and 1956, the church was built and a tower was added. In 1933, a new monastery was built in Egmond-Binnen and elevated to abbey in 1950.

Egmond-Binnen was home to 915 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1978, when it merged with Egmond aan Zee and Egmond aan den Hoef to form the new municipality Egmond. In turn, Egmond was amalgamated into Bergen on 1 January 2001.

<text>Fabian Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943), professionally known as Fabian, is an American singer and actor.

Forte rose to national prominence after performing several times on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. He became a teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Eleven of his songs reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Fabian Forte was born on February 6, 1943, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Born to Italian-American parents, he is the son of Josephine and Dominic Forte. His father was a Philadelphia police officer. He is the eldest of three brothers and grew up in the South Philadelphia&#x27;s Lower Moyamensing neighborhood.

===Discovery===
Forte was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks.

Marcucci was a friend of Fabian&#x27;s next-door neighbor. One day, Fabian&#x27;s father had a heart attack, and, while he was being taken away in an ambulance, Marcucci spotted Fabian. Fabian later recalled, &quot;He kept staring at me and looking at me. I had a crew cut, but this was the day of Rick Nelson and Elvis. He comes up and says to me, &#x27;So if you&#x27;re ever interested in the rock and roll business...&#x27; and hands me his card. I looked at the guy like he was out of his mind. I told him, &#x27;Leave me alone. I&#x27;m worried about my dad.&#x27;&quot;

When Fabian&#x27;s father returned from the hospital he was unable to work, so when Marcucci persisted, Fabian and his family were amenable, and he agreed to record a single. Frankie Avalon, also of South Philadelphia, suggested Forte as a possibility. Fabian later said, &quot;They gave me a pompadour and some clothes and those goddamned white bucks and out I went.&quot; &quot;He was the right look and right for what we were going for&quot;, wrote Marcucci later.

==Singing stardom==
===Early songs===
Fabian was given an allowance from the record company of $30 a week (). He also kept working part-time at a pharmacy as well as studying at South Philadelphia High School, while practicing his singing. Fabian later said &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, but I knew my goal, to try to make extra money. That meant a lot to our family. I rehearsed and rehearsed, and I really felt like a fish out of water. And we made a record. And it was horrible. Yet it got on Georgie Woods. For some reason, Georgie Woods played it.&quot;
The song was &quot;Shivers&quot;, which was a local hit in Chicago. This helped Fabian meet Dick Clark, who agreed to try Fabian at one of Clark&#x27;s record hops, where singers would perform to teenage audiences. Fabian lip synched to a song and Clark wrote &quot;the little girls at the hop went wild. They started screaming and yelling for this guy who didn&#x27;t do a thing but stand there. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.&quot; Clark told Marcucci &quot;you got a hit, he&#x27;s a star. Now all you have to do is teach him to sing.&quot;

Clark eventually put the young singer on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; where he sang &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;. Fabian later admitted this song &quot;was not very good either&quot; but &quot;the response – they told me – was overwhelming. I had no idea. All during that period, I was doing record hops. Not getting paid for it, but for the record company promotions. Just lip synching to my records. The response was really good.&quot;

===Hit songs===
Marcucci gave a song written by Mort Shuman and Doc Pomus to Fabian, &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; (not the Bo Diddley hit), which Fabian later said he &quot;liked a lot and was very comfortable with. It was giving me more experience, but I still felt like a fish out of water.&quot;

Pomus&#x27; biographer later wrote Fabian&#x27;s &quot;labored reading of a macho lyric lent him a vulnerability that couldn&#x27;t have been missed by his pubescent fans.&quot; The song made the top 40.

Marcucci heavily promoted Fabian&#x27;s next single, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, using a series of advertisements saying &quot;Fabian Is Coming&quot;, then &quot;Who is Fabian?&quot; then finally &quot;Fabian is Here&quot;. It worked and &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; went into the Top Ten, peaking at number 9.

This was later followed by &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, (US #9; UK #46), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the US charts. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

A review in &quot;Variety&quot; of a concert featuring Fabian in early 1959 declared the singer &quot;was undoubtedly the standout of the show, who floors the kids with his gyrations and groans of “Hard Headed Woman,” “I&#x27;m a Man,” “Turn Me Loose” and, for an encore, “Stop Thief”.&quot;

Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; (written by a man who went on a crime spree) and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the US charts. At age 15, he won the Silver Award as &quot;The Promising Male Vocalist of 1958&quot;. His first album, &quot;Hold That Tiger&quot; reached the top 15 within two weeks. The song &quot;Think of Me&quot;, although it did not chart in the US, was a big hit in some Asian countries including Sri Lanka in 1964. A review of &quot;Hold That Tiger&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;Fabian is a hardbelting rocking singer who has the faculty of projecting his emotions. Fabian&#x27;s voice is only adequate but be delivers with a beat that is undeniably commercial. Fine backing by combo and chorus lend an important assist.&quot;

In October 1959, he toured five major cities in Australia including several concerts in Sydney that were turned into the Australian film, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Due to a contractual dispute, however, his appearance was quickly removed from the film. That same year, Forte told a judge he was earning $250,000 a year () though an earlier report put this at $137,000. He kept up his studies and graduated from high school in June 1960.

During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Forte testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electronically to &quot;significantly improve his voice&quot;.

His career in music basically ended when he was 18 after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci for $65,000. (This was announced in July 1963.

In 1974, he said, &quot;I felt controlled. I felt like a puppet. It was frightening, like a three-year nightmare.&quot;

Marcucci later admitted to punching Fabian on one occasion when the singer sat in the aisle of a movie theater, not in the middle of the row like Marcucci had asked; Fabian was spotted by a teenage fan who screamed. Marcucci was angry that he did not see the film and hit the singer. In 1963, he signed a contract with Dot Records. He spent the next thirteen years concentrating on acting.

Fabian later said in 1971 that &quot;I must say I never knew [Marcucci] to cheat me out of any money due me and he never promised me anything he didn&#x27;t deliver.&quot; He stated he left his manager because &quot;all the songs were sounding the same. So I bought myself out of the contract. It cost me plenty – a lot more than I thought it would.&quot;

==Acting==
===20th Century Fox===
20th Century-Fox had enjoyed success casting teen idol pop stars in movies, such as Elvis Presley and Pat Boone. They decided to do the same thing with Fabian and signed him to a long-term contract. His first leading role was &quot;Hound-Dog Man&quot; (1959), based on the novel by Fred Gipson (who had written &quot;Old Yeller&quot;) and directed by Don Siegel. He co-starred with the more experienced Stuart Whitman and sang several songs, including the title track. The &quot;Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film&quot; featured a photo of Forte&#x27;s screen test where he appeared in the same outfit that Elvis Presley wore in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. &quot;Acting came natural to me. I don&#x27;t know why&quot;, Fabian later said.

Fabian&#x27;s recording of the &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot; title song was a top ten hit but the film was not a financial success – in contrast to Presley and Boone&#x27;s first films. The studio, however, tried again in two smaller roles, supporting a bigger star – &quot;High Time&quot;, with Bing Crosby, and &quot;North to Alaska&quot;, with John Wayne. Both films were popular especially the latter and in November 1960 his contract with the studio was amended with an increase in salary – it was now a seven-year deal with an option for two films a year. He later said that &quot;acting wasn&#x27;t like the singing, because it was very private – quiet on the set. No screaming [teenage fans]. It was a wonderful experience. I got to meet and work with John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Peter Lorre. Elvis came over to meet me when I was on the lot. Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood and Gary Cooper were also on the lot. I was on the plane with Marlon Brando for eight hours coming back from Tahiti.&quot;

The Fox contract included television series as well as films. Fabian was cast by director Robert Altman as a psychotic killer in &quot;A Lion Walks Among Us&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. This episode was highly controversial due to its violent content, with many affiliates refusing to run the program, so much so, that it was even mentioned in the US Senate. However, the series was good for Fabian&#x27;s acting career, and saw him regarded with more respect. He later said he regarded this as his best performance.

Paramount borrowed him from Fox to co-star with teen idol Tommy Sands in &quot;Love in a Goldfish Bowl&quot; (1961). In 1961, Bob Marcucci announced that Fabian and Avalon would star in &quot;Virginia Ridge&quot; by Clarence Fillmore about the Battle of New Market, where Virginia Military cadets took on union soldiers. The movie was never made. In April 1961 Fox announced Fabian would star in &quot;Blue Denim Baby&quot; and &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot;; the former was never made and the latter was made with Richard Beymer.

Instead Fabian co-starred opposite Tuesday Weld in an episode of &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;, titled &quot;Run Till It&#x27;s Dark&quot;. In &quot;Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation&quot; (1962), he romanced (and sang with) the daughter of a family man played by James Stewart; this was a big hit. So too was &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), Fox&#x27;s all-star epic about the D-Day landings; Fabian appeared among a number of other teen idols as US Rangers. Less popular, though still widely seen, was &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (1962), Irwin Allen&#x27;s take on Jules Verne; Fabian sang one song but again it was a supporting role.

In April August 1961 Fabian had to go to court to get his contract with Fox approved. It was for six years, covering nine films for a gross sum of $545,000.

In October 1962 Fabian changed management to Jack Spina, who managed Pat Boone.

When Fox temporarily shut down following cost overruns on &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Fabian was one of the first actors whose options were exercised after the studio re-opened. He was to have supported Stewart again in &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1963) but did not appear in the final film. Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures said he wanted Fabian to play the lead in &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963) but was unable to do it because of his Fox contract. &quot;Filmink&quot; argued the film might not have been as successful with Fabian in it.

Fabian had not become a film star but was in demand as an actor, appearing in episodes of series like &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described his performance in &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as &quot;most effective&quot;.

He had a good role in a surf movie made for Columbia, &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; (1964) (with Tab Hunter), and was reunited with James Stewart for Fox&#x27;s &quot;Dear Brigitte&quot; (1965) – the film failed to repeat the success of &quot;Hobbs&quot;. Harry Alan Towers cast him as one of the victims in &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (1965).

In October 1965, Fox announced it had picked up Fabian&#x27;s option to make three more films for the studio, starting with &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. However, that film was not made and Fabian made no further films for Fox.

===AIP===
In November 1965, he signed a seven-picture deal with American International Pictures (AIP). His first film for the company was alongside &quot;Beach Party&quot; stars Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello in the 1966 stock car racing film &quot;Fireball 500&quot;. AIP then sent him to Italy to play a role originally intended for Avalon in &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs&quot; (1966), supporting Vincent Price and directed by Mario Bava. Back in the United States, he made another stock car racing film for AIP, &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1967), opposite Funicello and directed by Richard Rush. His fourth movie for AIP was &quot;Maryjane&quot; (1968), where Fabian played a school teacher fighting the evils of the marijuana trade.

He returned to racing car dramas with &quot;The Wild Racers&quot; (1968), partly financed by Roger Corman and shot in Europe. This was not a big hit on release but has developed a cult following; Quentin Tarantino described it as his favorite racing car movie.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s 8&quot; (1968) was an AIP rip-off of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (with a script co-written by John Milius). His seventh and final film for the studio was &quot;A Bullet for Pretty Boy&quot; (1970).

Fabian also played Josh Ashley in &quot;Little Laura and Big John&quot; (1973) for Crown International Pictures.

He performed in &quot;John Loves Mary&quot; in summer stock in 1962.

==Later years==
Forte later admitted the pressures of his career and home life caused him to start drinking in the 1960s. From June 1969 onwards he was billed as &quot;Fabian Forte&quot;.

===Return to singing===
In 1973, he began singing again. To raise his profile, he posed nude for &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine. &quot;I knew it was a mistake the minute I saw the thing sold in a paper bag. I could barely live with myself.&quot;

In January 1974, he started an act at the MGM-Grand in Las Vegas. He was managed at this stage by Allan Carr. In March 1974, he performed at the Blue Max of the Hyatt Regency O&#x27;Hare in Chicago. A review said &quot;he seems rather lost in the act he was putting on... he&#x27;s giving it the old beach party try. But all that, unfortunately, can&#x27;t distract for long from the basic lack of talent.&quot; In October 1974, Carr – by then no longer his manager – said that Fabian was &quot;a sensational lounge act in Nevada and shouldn&#x27;t play anywhere else except on prom nights. He&#x27;s not a middle of the road act in a middle of the road room. At the 12.30 am show at the Blue Max, when the conventioneers had had a few drinks it was terrific... This boy probably made $18,000 last year; this year he&#x27;ll make about $270,000.&quot;

He often performed in Las Vegas in the mid 1970s until he fell into difficulties with the authorities after attacking a Las Vegas district attorney, and resultant bankruptcy.

He retired once more in 1977, then resumed performing in 1981. He never regained his teenage popularity, but has continued performing.

===&quot;The Idolmaker&quot;===
The film &quot;The Idolmaker&quot; (1980), written by Edward Di Lorenzo and the first feature film directed by Taylor Hackford, was a thinly disguised biography of Fabian (called Caesare in the film), as well as songwriter/producer Marcucci (called Vinnie Vacarri) and Frankie Avalon (called Tommy Dee). In the movie version, singer Caesare—a pretty boy with little singing talent—goes through a whirlwind of success in a short time, and in a fit of pique, he abruptly fires his songwriters and quits his record label. The real-life Fabian launched a $64 million lawsuit at the time of the picture&#x27;s release, claiming the film made him look like &quot;a totally manufactured singer, a mere pretty face without any singing ability or acting talent.&quot; The filmmakers insisted that the movie presented only fictional characters (although Marcucci was a paid consultant on the film). Forte claimed they settled out of court, where he and his wife received apologies and Marcucci&#x27;s 7.5% ownership of the film passed to Forte.

He appeared in a 1982 television commercial for &quot;The Idols of Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; and in the documentary film &quot;The Bituminous Coal Queens of Pennsylvania&quot; (2005). In the 1980s, he developed some sitcoms for television. Forte hosted and headlined in the hit show &quot;The Original Stars of Bandstand&quot; at The Dick Clark Theater in Branson, Missouri. The show starred Forte and Bobby Vee and featured The Chiffons, Brian Hyland, Chris Montez and rare footage of the performers and Dick Clark. As part of a long-running concert tour, Fabian has toured with fellow Philadelphian 1950s teen idols Bobby Rydell and Frankie Avalon as Dick Fox&#x27;s Golden Boys.

On January 8, 2002, Forte was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his achievements in live theatre.

==Personal life==
He was drafted, but rejected, for military service during the Vietnam War. According to USMC Lt. Col. Arthur Eppley, Forte was declared 4F (unfit for service).

In 1982, he was arrested for reportedly sticking his cigarette into a passenger who asked him to put out the cigarette in a non-smoking section of an aircraft. The passenger turned out to be a district attorney, but ultimately no charges were brought.

===Race car accident===
In 1978, Fabian was participating in a charity racing event in Watkins Glen, New York. He was practicing at Willow Springs International Motorsports Park under the instruction of professional driver Bill Simpson when he rolled his car and suffered minor cuts and bruises.

In 1982, a jury found him 40% liable for the accident (Fabian testified that Simpson repeatedly urged him to drive faster while Simpson testified that Fabian suddenly accelerated wildly in spite of his orders to slow down). He received $32,000 in an out-of-court settlement ().

===Marriages===
Forte has been married three times. His first marriage was to model Kathleen Regan in September 1966. They had two children together, Christian and Julie, before separating in June 1975. In October 1975, when Forte and Regan were estranged, he was arrested after an argument with her and her mother. He was accused of hitting them. He was put on probation for two years. The couple divorced in 1979. &quot;My fault&quot;, said Fabian.

He married Kate Netter in 1980; they divorced in 1990.

In 1998, he married Andrea Patrick, a former Bituminous Coal Queen and Miss Pennsylvania USA. He and Andrea were later sued for unpaid bills, by the resort where they were married .

Fabian relocated from Los Angeles to southwestern Pennsylvania, to be closer to his wife&#x27;s family; he and his wife were sued by the builder of their house, also for unpaid bills. They live on in Dunbar in a home that his wife designed. In 2013, he said he played &quot;25 shows a year. It gets me out of the house ... I&#x27;ve never been happier. [At home] I ride my ATV and tractor and cut the grass. Where I grew up, there wasn&#x27;t any grass.&quot;

He and Andrea Patrick also work for &quot;Gladys Magazine&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
Fabian and Andrea Forte are actively involved in the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association and Forte has helped raise money for veterans with his Celebrity Golf Tournament in North Carolina.

==Discography==
All albums use Forte&#x27;s mononymous name Fabian. Before going to Chancellor records, Forte cut two albums on his own, one of which contained the original version of the song &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot;, but both albums were a commercial failure.

<text>Groet is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about 11 km northwest of Alkmaar.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned between 1130 and 1161 as &quot;in Grothen&quot;, and means &quot;land growth&quot;. Groet developed on the boundary of the dunes and the raised bog.

The Dutch Reformed church is a single aisled church with wooden tower which was built in 1639 and was modified in 1738. In 1830, the choir collapsed and was rebuilt shortly after.

The windmill Groetermolen is a &quot;polder&quot; mill was built in 1890. In 1977, a pumping station was built and the wind mill was decommissioned resulting in a deterioration of the wind mill, therefore, it was decided to drain the &quot;polder&quot; both by the mill and the pumping station. Groetermolen is still in active service.

In 1639, a little town hall was built in Groet. It claims to be the smallest and oldest town hall of the Netherlands. The oldest claim is definitely not true, but it may be the smallest.

Groet was a separate municipality between 1817 and 1834, when it was merged with Schoorl. The village was home to 186 people in 1840. In 2001, it became part of the municipality of Bergen.

The 1st and the 4th International Youth Congress of Esperanto, in 1938 and 1948 respectively, took place in Groet.

<text>Hargen is a hamlet in the municipality of Bergen], in the provinces of North Holland, the Netherlands.

The hamlet was first mentioned between 822 and 825 as in Horgana, and means &quot;sacred place&quot;. Hargen has no place signs, but there is a directional sign pointing to Hargen. It was home to 171 people in 1840. The current population is difficult to determine, because it has been added to the much larger Groet in the statistics.

<text>Schoorl is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about 8 km northwest of Alkmaar. Until 2001, Schoorl was also a municipality of its own.

Schoorl is a village in between the polder area of North Holland and the Schoorlse dunes. The village is about 8 km (5mls) long and never wider than 2 km (1mls). The village is heavily protected by the highest and widest dunes of the Netherlands, which reach about 54 m (164 ft) above sealevel right behind the center of Schoorl, and are more than 5 km (3mls) wide.

Schoorl is a major local tourism location in the summer and counts over 25 campsites, the largest concentration of campsites in the Netherlands.
The village, earlier named &quot;Scorel&quot; contains evidence of a long history in the form of two &quot;raadhuisjes&quot; (town hall) aging from 1600. The Dutch painter and evangelist Jan van Scorel was born here.

Meidenmarkt is the most renowned yearly festivity that is celebrated once a year on the second day (Monday) of pentecost (see also this list of dates to see when Pentecost begins). The celebration is a 100-year-old tradition where the local youngsters can meet partners of the opposite sex. The celebration takes place on the klimduin in the center of town. This klimduin is a century-old attraction and many Dutch people have visited it as part of a school trip.

During World War II, Kamp Schoorl was a concentration camp originally built as a Dutch army camp. Jews and political prisoners were imprisoned there and some were then deported in camps in the east where they were later murdered.

==Statistics==
The former municipality of Schoorl also included Aagtdorp, Catrijp, Groet, and Camperduin, and had about 6500 inhabitants.
&quot;Schoorl&quot; was until about 200 years ago known as &quot;Schorel&quot; (also part known as &quot;Schoreldam&quot;) and the family crest (coat of arms) is recorded as being St Michaels (the dragon slayer), and was found on a grave some 1,000 years old.

It appears that Jan van Schorel during his travelling through southern countries in Europe held it was easier to use the name Jan van Scorel, Jan van Schoorl, and other versions of his surname. Very old maps of North Holland/The Netherlands show &quot;Schorel&quot;.

<doc id="167316" wikidata="Q1054021" url="?curid=167316" title="Graduation">
<text>A graduation is the awarding of a diploma by an educational institution. It may also refer to the ceremony that is associated with it, which can also be called [[Commencement speech|commencement]], [[Graduation|congregation]], [[Graduation|convocation]] or invocation. The date of the graduation ceremony is often called &quot;graduation day&quot;. Graduates can be referred to by their year of graduation.

==History==
Ceremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the twelfth century. At that time, Latin was the language of scholars. A &quot;universitas&quot; was a guild of masters (such as MAs) with license to teach. The etymology of &quot;degree&quot; and &quot;graduate&quot; originates from , meaning &quot;step&quot;. The first step was admission to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the and license to teach. Typical dress for graduation is a gown and hood, or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.

The tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid-eighteenth century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front. The graduation hat tradition was initially adopted by students at Uppsala University. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.

==Ceremony==
Usually, the ceremony and name apply to university or college degrees: Associate&#x27;s, Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s and Doctoral degrees.

In a graduation ceremony for a college or university, the presiding officer or other authorized person formally confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or &quot;en masse&quot;. However, some graduates may physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or departmental ceremonies, or even through the mail.

Ceremonies often include a procession of some of the academic staff, candidates, and a valediction. The students typically wear formal academic dress, such as square academic caps and gowns. The academic staff will usually also wear academic dress at the ceremony, as will the trustees (if applicable). 

===Graduation &quot;in absentia&quot;===
When a student graduates without attending the graduation ceremony, then it is called graduation .

===Non-tertiary graduations===
In the United States and Israel, completing high school is also referred to as &quot;graduating&quot;, with a high school diploma or Bagrut certificate, respectively. Graduations from high school typically occur between the months of June and August. Oftentimes, completing middle school or kindergarten is also marked by a graduation ceremony.
==By country==
The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. In the United Kingdom a graduation usually only occurs at university level. Whereas in the United States and many other countries, graduations also occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are awarded to the graduates.

In Sweden, most universities are research-oriented and may present their students with bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctor&#x27;s degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, math and science among degree courses.

In Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most often is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the president of the country officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the President&#x27;s hand. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is Zimbabwe&#x27;s late ex-president Robert Mugabe. At other state institutions of higher learning, the vice presidents or other senior government officials may preside.

Otherwise, in countries like Argentina and Uruguay, enthusiasm prevails over moderation, as well as taking part in an authentic carnival as part of the celebration that is mostly spontaneous, anarchic, and barely planned in the middle of the streets: hundreds of graduates, familiars and friends gather in an open place, carrying alcoholic drinks, eggs, flour and other messy food; pelting it all over the graduates; whereas the party is public and open to excesses that carry the complaints of all sorts of commerce, neighbours and authorities in the zone due to the concentration of public disorder and filth that lasts until the aftermath and overwhelms the municipal services.

<doc id="167320" wikidata="Q15104336" url="?curid=167320" title="Arkarua">
<text>Arkarua adami is a small, Precambrian disk-like fossil with a raised center, a number of radial ridges on the rim, and a five-pointed central depression marked with radial lines of five small dots from the middle of the disk center. Fossils range from 3 to 10 mm in diameter.

&quot;Arkarua&quot; is known only from the Ediacaran beds of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. The generic name refers to Arkaroo, a giant snake from the Dreaming of the local Aboriginal people.

&quot;Arkarua&quot; is suggested to have been a passive suspension feeder.

==Classification==
All known specimens of &quot;Arkarua&quot; are casts that give no clue to the internal structure, making classification problematic. Because of &quot;Arkarua&quot;&#x27;s pentamerous symmetry, it is tentatively placed within phylum Echinodermata. Because of its flattened disk- or button-shape, coupled with its pentamerous symmetry, some claim that it can be further classified into the Edrioasteroidea, a class of the echinoderms.

This identification remains suspect, as the fossils do not appear to have either madreporites, or plates of stereom, a unique crystalline form of calcium carbonate from which echinoderm skeletons are built. These two features are diagnostic of all other echinoderms, as all extinct and extant echinoderms have either one, the other, or both features present.

<text>The Beneden Merwede (; &quot;Lower Merwede&quot;) is a stretch of river in the Netherlands, mainly fed by the river Rhine. It starts as the continuation of the Boven Merwede after the branching-off of the Nieuwe Merwede ship canal. It flows from Hardinxveld-Giessendam to Dordrecht, where it splits into the Noord and Oude Maas rivers. Its length is 14.8 km. The river is part of the main shipping route between the port of Rotterdam and the industrial region of the Ruhr, Germany.

There is a road bridge and, more to the east, a railroad bridge between the railway stations Dordrecht Stadspolders and Hardinxveld-Giessendam on the line Dordrecht-Gorinchem.

<doc id="167326" wikidata="Q2627975" url="?curid=167326" title="Ceremony">
<text>A ceremony (, ) is a unified ritualistic event with a purpose, usually consisting of a number of artistic components, performed on a special occasion.

The word may be of Etruscan origin, via the Latin .

==Religious and civil (secular) ceremonies==
According to Dally Messenger and Alain de Botton, in most Western countries the values and ideals articulated in both church and civil ceremonies are generally similar. The difference is in what Messenger calls the &quot;supernatural infrastructure&quot; or de Botton the &quot;implausible supernatural element&quot;.

Most religions claim some extra advantage conferred by the deity, e.g., Roman Catholics believe that through the words of consecration in the mass ceremony, God himself becomes actually present on the altar.

Both religious and civil ceremonies share the powerful psychological, social and cultural influences which all ceremony seeks to attain. The style of music played, words used, other components and the structure vary.

===Shared traditions===
As Edward Schillebeeckx writes about the marriage ceremony, there are a number of ancient traditional elements in both church and civil ceremonies in the western world. Key ceremonies date from the pre-Christian Roman and Greek times, and their practices have continued through the centuries. For example, from pre-Christian Roman times in the marriage ceremony, we inherit best men and bridesmaids, processions, signing of the contract, exchange of rings and the wedding cake.

===Sharing non-supernatural content===
Writer and philosopher de Botton maintains atheists should appropriate many of the useful insights, artistic treasures and symbolism inspired by religion. He argues that the secular world can also learn from the religions the importance of community and continuity. Messenger agrees, and points out that the success of civil celebrants in Australia has been partly due to their espousing of these principles, both in theory and practice, since 1973.

==History of secular ceremony==

The main impetus to the development of quality civil ceremonies in the Western world was the foresight of the Australian statesman, senator and high court judge, Lionel Murphy. In 1973 in Australia, the civil celebrant program entrusted appropriately selected individuals to provide non-church people with ceremonies of substance and dignity. This initiative to a great extent has now been followed by New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and some states of the US.

==Purpose of secular ceremony==
According to Dally Messenger III secular ceremonies are &quot;roadmap&quot; influences which lead to an acceptable, ethical and dignified life. 
Ceremonies contribute to the unseen ingredients of psychological stability, a sense of identity, reassurances of life&#x27;s purposes, and the personal sense of self-worth. Murphy considered that personal genuine ceremonies were central to a civilised, stable and happy society. Here he echoed the conviction of the mythologist Joseph Campbell who had maintained the strongly asserted generality that the level of civilised behaviour in a society is directly linked to the practice of ceremonies and rites of passage.

In addition, Messenger makes the following statements:

* A complex of good ceremonies raise the level of human happiness in society.
* Ceremonies assist humans to adjust to change.
* Ceremonies are signposts of the culture and indicate that such a culture has life-affirming substance.
* Ceremonies are an important means of expressing, reinforcing and transmitting values.
* Ceremonies are constructed from the visual and performing arts. In a chosen setting they are an important vehicle for telling stories, reciting poetry and prose, using symbolism, and performing music.
* Ceremonies, done well, leave lifelong lasting memories and therefore permanent good effects.
* The better a ceremony is done, the better its psychological, cultural, and social outcomes.

==The components of ceremony==
To be powerful and effective, such ceremonies, in the view of all the scholars in the field, had to have impact. This occurred when the ceremony was framed by the visual and performing arts. 
Great care had to be taken in creating and choosing the poetry, prose, stories, personal journeys, myths, silences, dance, music and song, shared meditations, choreography and symbolism which comprised a ceremony. 
To reinforce the psychological and cultural power of ceremony it should be enacted, as far as possible, in a beautiful interior and exterior place. Beauty is the essential core of ceremony, having always been part of &quot;raising the spirit&quot; and embedding the good in the memory.

Ceremonies, as they always had been, are historically the bridge between the visual and performing arts and the people. Murphy and his followers, and international practitioners such as David Oldfield of Washington DC understand that ceremonies are core expressions of the culture. Done well, they can assist in major decision-making, bring emotional security, strengthen bonds between people, and communicate a sense of contentment. To quote David Oldfield:

&quot;Rituals and ceremonies are an essential and basic means&quot;
&quot;for human beings to give themselves and others&quot;

&quot;the necessary messages&quot;

&quot;which enable the individual to stay human.&quot;

&quot;They communicate acceptance,&quot;

&quot;love, a sense of identity, esteem,&quot;

&quot;shared values and beliefs&quot;

&quot;and shared memorable events.&quot;

&quot;Every ritual contains tender and sacred moments.&quot;

&quot;And in those moments of sensitivity&quot;

&quot;We are taken out of the normal flow of life,&quot;

&quot;And out of our routines.&quot;

&quot;We are then in an event&quot;

&quot;that is irreplaceable and sacred&quot;.

&quot;In ritual we participate in&quot;

&quot;something deep and significant.&quot;

&quot;They are moments which move our heart&quot;

&quot;And touch our spirit.&quot;
==Qualities of a celebrant==
Lionel Murphy also knew that the superficial, the unaware, were not the right persons to bring this about. The civil celebrant needs to have a rich skill-set and knowledge base. Murphy is on the record as asserting that the civil celebrant needed to have a &quot;feel&quot; for ceremony and be professional, knowledgeable, educated, creative, imaginative, inspired, well presented, idealistic, and well practised.

The civil celebrant should be a person inspired to improve lives at a deep and lasting level. For this reason they must be carefully chosen. The ideal is that they be educated in the humanities and trained to expertly co-create, creatively write and perform ceremonies.

==Ceremonial occasions==

* Marriage, or a wedding, is the flagship ceremony of every culture.
* Almost as important is the funeral or burial ceremony.
&quot;The funeral ritual, too, is a public, traditional and symbolic means of expressing our beliefs, thoughts and feelings about the death of someone loved. Rich in history and rife with symbolism, the funeral ceremony helps us acknowledge the reality of the death, gives testimony to the life of the deceased, encourages the expression of grief in a way consistent with the culture&#x27;s values, provides support to mourners, allows for the embracing of faith and beliefs about life and death, and offers continuity and hope for the living.&quot;
* Birth, i.e. a naming ceremony
&quot;Naming Ceremonies existed in human culture long before Christianity or any of the major religions came on the scene. Every community has a ceremony to welcome a new child into the world, to give that child recognition, and to celebrate the birth of new life.&quot;
* Baptism or christening ceremony
* Initiation (college orientation week)
* Puberty
* Social adulthood (Bar (or Bat) Mitzvah), coming of age ceremonies
* Graduation
* Award ceremonies
* Retirement
* Death (Day of the Dead)
* Spiritual (baptism, communion)
* Grand opening

==Celebration of events==
Other, society-wide ceremonies may mark annual or seasonal or recurrent events such as:

* Vernal equinox, winter solstice and other annual astronomical positions
* Weekly Sabbath day
* Inauguration of an elected office-holder
* Occasions in a liturgical year or &quot;feasts&quot; in a calendar of saints
* Opening and closing of a sports event, such as the Olympic Games

Other ceremonies underscore the importance of non-regular special occasions, such as:

* Coronation of a monarch
* Victory in battle

In some Asian cultures, ceremonies also play an important social role, for example the tea ceremony.

==Process==

Ceremonies may have a physical display or theatrical component: dance, a procession, the laying on of hands. A declaratory verbal pronouncement may explain or cap the occasion, for instance:

* I now pronounce you husband and wife.
* I swear to serve and defend the nation ...
* I declare open the games of ...
* I/We dedicate this ... ... to ...

Both physical and verbal components of a ceremony may become part of a liturgy.

<text>Werrington is a residential area of the city of Peterborough, in the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire, England. For electoral purposes it comprises North Werrington and South Werrington wards. Werrington spans an area of two and a half square miles (6 km2) and has a population of 14,800.

Originally a village, Werrington was engulfed by Peterborough in the mid 20th century, as the city expanded. The area is on the northern edge of the conurbation, approximately four miles (6.4 km) from the city centre. There are two distinct areas of Werrington, the village and new Werrington. The village dates from older periods and focuses on the village green. The new Werrington area focuses on the Werrington Centre, a small shopping complex featuring stores for basic needs.

Werrington became a parish in 1866. In 1921 the parish had a population of 807. Werrington parish was abolished and merged with Peterborough on 1 April 1929.

== Shopping ==
Werrington Centre shops include Tesco, Age Concern and other small shops. These shops have undergone change since 2004 as a result of bigger companies buying out the locally owned shops. 

The development of Werrington continues, with new residential accommodation in the northernmost part of the area. The shopping centre redevelopment has now been abandoned by Tesco with many small units available for rent or are boarded up. 

== Activities ==
Werrington has held a summer carnival and bonfire and fireworks display every year since the 1970s. At the bonfire, two people made out of clay are set on fire, made by volunteers from the local Scout and Guide Association in conjunction with Werrington Primary School. 

Werrington Village Cricket Club plays in the local Huntingdonshire leagues throughout the summer and plays its home games at nearby Campbell Drive sports fields. Werrington Badminton Club has 100 members ranging from beginners up to county level who play in tournaments around the city and county. They also run two men&#x27;s and a mixed team in the Hunts league.

== Local schools ==
New Werrington contains three schools. William Law and Welbourne are both primary schools. Ken Stimpson Academy is the only secondary school in the area. 

Ken Stimpson Academy is a public secondary school which opened in 1982. The school has about 1,100 pupils from years 7 to post-16 (Years 12/13). The school acquired Business and Enterprise College Specialist school status in late 2004.

Werrington Primary School is the only school in the original village. It is in the top five for most rankings for primary schools in Peterborough. The school was founded at the end of the 19th century on the site of what is now the village centre as a Church of England school. The junior school moved to its current site in 1961, followed by the infant school in 1966. The junior and infant schools have merged and share a common administration. William Law C of E Primary School and Welbourne Primary School are the two primary schools that are not in Werrington village.

<text>The Philippine Revolutionary Army (Spanish: ; ), later renamed Philippine Republican Army, was the army of the First Philippine Republic from its formation in March 1897 to its dissolution in November of 1899 in favor of guerrilla operations in the Philippine–American War.

==History==

The revolutionary army used the 1896 edition of the Spanish regular army&#x27;s &quot;Ordenanza del Ejército&quot; to organize its forces and establish its character as a modern army. Rules and regulations were laid down for the reorganization of the army, along with the regulation of ranks and the adoption of new fighting methods, new rank insignias, and a new standard uniform known as the &quot;rayadillo&quot;. Filipino artist Juan Luna is credited with this design. Juan Luna also designed the collar insignia for the uniforms, distinguishing between the services: infantry, cavalry, artillery, sappers, and medics. His brother, General Antonio Luna commissioned him with the task and personally paid for the new uniforms. At least one researcher has postulated that Juan Luna may have patterned the tunic after the English Norfolk jacket, since the Filipino version is not a copy of any Spanish-pattern uniform. Infantry officers wore blue pants with two white stripes down the side, while Cavalry officers wore red trousers with two black stripes. Soldiers and junior officers wore straw hats while senior officers often wore peaked caps.

Orders and circulars were issued covering matters such as building trenches and fortifications, equipping every male aged 15 to 50 with bows and arrows (as well as bolo knives, though officers wielded European swords), enticing Filipino soldiers in the Spanish army to defect, collecting empty cartridges for refilling, prohibiting unplanned sorties, inventories of captured arms and ammunition, fundraising, purchasing of arms and supplies abroad, unification of military commands, and exhorting the rich to give aid to the soldiers.

Aguinaldo, a month after he declared Philippine independence, created a pay scale for officers in the army: Following the board, a brigadier general would receive 600 pesos annually, and a sergeant 72 pesos.

When the Philippine–American War erupted on February 4, 1899, the Filipino army suffered heavy losses on every sector. Even Antonio Luna urged Apolinario Mabini, Aguinaldo&#x27;s chief adviser, to convince the President that guerrilla warfare must be announced as early as April 1899. Aguinaldo adopted guerrilla tactics on November 13, 1899, dissolving what remained of the regular army and after many of his crack units were decimated in set-piece battles.

==Weaponry==
The Filipinos were short on modern weapons. Most of its weapons were captured from the Spanish, were improvised or were traditional weapons. The service rifles of the nascent army were the Spanish M93 and the Spanish Remington Rolling Block rifle. Moreover, while in Hong Kong, Emilio Aguinaldo purchased rifles from the Americans. Two batches of 2,000 rifles each including ammunition were ordered and paid for. The first batch arrived while the second batch never did. In his letters to Galicano Apacible, Mariano Ponce also sought weapons from both domestic and international dealers in the Empire of Japan. He was offered different breech-loading single-shot rifles since most nations were discarding them in favor of new smokeless bolt-action rifles. However, there was no mention of any purchase occurring. Another planned purchase was the Murata rifle from Japan but no record exists that it made its way into the hands of Filipino revolutionaries.

Crew-served weapons of the Philippine military included lantaka, Krupp guns, Hontoria guns, Ordóñez guns, Hotchkiss guns, Nordenfelt guns, Maxim guns, and Colt guns. Many of these were captured from the Spanish and the Americans. There were also improvised artillery weapons made of water pipes reinforced with bamboo or timber, which could only fire once or twice.
==Ranks==
===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
===Branch colors===
In 1898, the Philippine government prescribed branch colors twice:

===Branch insignia===
*Engineers: A castle superimposed on a diagonally crossed pickax and shovel, surmounted by a sun.
*Artillery: Crossed field guns above six cannonballs, surmounted by a sun.
*Infantry: A diagonally crossed dagger and bolo surmounted by a sun, superimposed on three concentric circles.
*Cavalry: Two crossed lances over two crossed sabers, surmounted by a sun.
*Light Infantry/Rifle battalions: Two crossed rifles with fixed bayonets surmounted by a sun, superimposed on three concentric circles. (This badge is the basis of the current PA infantry branch insignia).
*Intendancy-Quartermaster: A cockade within a wreath surmounted by a sun.
*Signals: Six lightning bolts over a semicircular wreath surmounted by a sun.
*Medical Service: A bowl of Hygieia within a wreath surmounted by a sun.

==Recruitment and conscription==
During the revolution against Spain, the Katipunan gave leaflets to the people to encourage them to join the revolution. Since the revolutionaries had become regular soldiers at the time of Emilio Aguinaldo, they started to recruit males and some females aged 15 and above as a form of national service. A few Spanish and Filipino enlisted personnel and officers of the Spanish Army and Spanish Navy defected to the Revolutionary Army, as well as a number of foreign individuals and American defectors who volunteered to join during the course of the revolution.

Conscription in the revolutionary army was in effect in the Philippines and military service was mandatory at that time by the order of Gen. Antonio Luna, the Chief Commander of the Army during the Philippine–American War.

==Organization==

The largest standard unit in the Filipino army according to the decree issued by President Aguinaldo on July 30, 1898 was the battalion, which varied in size depending on the province: six-company battalions in populous provinces like Cavite and Manila, four-company battalions in Morong, Bataan, and Nueva Ecija, a two-company battalion in Mindoro, and a single company in Marinduque. Soldiers were recruited voluntarily, with surplus volunteers either joining the police or forming a 3,000-strong central corps under the President. Battalions were named after their respective provinces, such as the &quot;1st Battalion of Tayabas&quot;.

==Philippine Revolutionary Navy==
The Philippine Revolutionary Navy was established during the second phase of the Philippine Revolution when General Emilio Aguinaldo formed the Revolutionary Navy. On May 1, 1898, the first ship handed by Admiral George Dewey to the Revolutionary Navy is a small pinnace from the Reina Cristina of Admiral Patricio Montojo, which was named &quot;Magdalo&quot;. The Navy was initially composed of a small fleet of eight Spanish steam launches captured from the Spaniards. The ships were refitted with 9-centimeter guns. The rich, namely Leon Apacible, Manuel Lopez and Gliceria Marella de Villavicencio, later donated five other vessels of greater tonnage, the &quot;Taaleño&quot;, the &quot;Balayan&quot;, the &quot;Bulusan&quot;, the &quot;Taal&quot; and the &quot;Purísima Concepción&quot;. The 900-ton inter-island tobacco steamer further reinforced the fleet, &quot;Compania de Filipinas&quot; (renamed as the navy flagship &quot;Filipinas&quot;), steam launches purchased from China and other watercraft donated by wealthy patriots.

Naval stations were later established to serve as ships&#x27; home bases in the following:
*Ports of Aparri
*Ports of Legaspi
*Ports of Balayan
*Ports of Calapan
*Ports of San Roque, Cavite

On September 26, 1898, Aguinaldo appointed Captain Pascual Ledesma (a merchant ship captain) as Director of the Bureau of the Navy, assisted by Captain Angel Pabie (another merchant ship captain). After passing of the Malolos Constitution the Navy was transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Relations to the Department of War (thereafter known as the Department of War and the Navy) headed by Gen. Mariano Trías.

As the tensions between Filipinos and Americans erupted in 1899 and a continued blockade on naval forces by the Americans, the Philippine naval forces started to be decimated.

<text>An adult is an animal that has reached full growth. The biological definition of the word means an animal reaching sexual maturity and thus capable of reproduction. In the human context, the term &quot;adult&quot; has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a non-adult or &quot;minor&quot;, a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. They may also be regarded as &quot;majors&quot;. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18 although definition may vary by legal rights, country, and psychological development.

Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior, but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.

In different cultures, there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. This often encompasses passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.

==Biological adulthood==
Historically and cross-culturally, adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of puberty (the appearance of secondary sex characteristics such as menstruation and the development of breasts in women, ejaculation, the development of facial hair, and a deeper voice in men, and pubic hair in both sexes). In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony. During the Industrial Revolution, children went to work as soon as they could in order to help provide for their family. There was not a huge emphasis on school or education in general. Many children could get a job and were not required to have experience as adults are nowadays. Adulthood, in more recent years, as it has been studied has developed a characteristic list, that goes far beyond just ones physical maturity. These markers for a full, mentally developed, adult include traits of personal responsibilities in multiple aspects of life.

Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two-word term &quot;biological adult&quot;, the first definition of &quot;adult&quot; in multiple dictionaries includes &quot;the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained&quot;. Thus, the base definition of the word &quot;adult&quot; is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity, which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base word &quot;adult&quot;, the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults. The two-word term &quot;biological adult&quot; stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on physical maturity (i.e. having reached reproductive competency), is being used.

The time of puberty varies from child to child, but usually begins between 10 and 12 years old. Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12. Girls generally complete puberty by 15–17, and boys by age 16 or 17. Nutrition, genetics and environment also usually play a part in the onset of puberty. Girls will go through a growth spurt and gain weight in several areas of their body. Boys will go through similar spurts in growth, though it is usually not in a similar style or time frame. This is due to the natural processes of puberty, but genetics also plays a part in how much weight they gain or how much taller they get.

One recent area of debate within the science of brain development is the most likely chronological age for full mental maturity, or indeed, if such an age even exists. Common claims repeated in the media since 2005 (based upon interpretations of imaging data) have commonly suggested an &quot;end-point&quot; of 25, referring to the prefrontal cortex as one area that is not yet fully mature at the age of 18. However, this is based on an interpretation of a brain imaging study by Jay Giedd, dating back to 2004 or 2005, where the only participants were aged up to 21 years, and Giedd assumed this maturing process would be done by the age of 25 years, whereas more recent studies show prefrontal cortex maturation continuing well past the age of 30 years, marking this interpretation as incorrect and outdated.

==Legal adulthood==
Legally, &quot;adulthood&quot; typically means that one has reached the age of majority – when parents lose parental rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned. Depending on one&#x27;s jurisdiction, the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities, such as engaging in a contract, marriage, voting, having a job, serving in the military, buying/possessing firearms, driving, traveling abroad, involvement with alcoholic beverages, smoking, sexual activity, gambling, being a model or actor in pornography, running for president, etc. Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person, concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior, or because of the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items).

One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc. There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling. Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian, or just by an adult. Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.

Using the example of pornography, one can distinguish between:
* being allowed inside an adult establishment
* being allowed to purchase pornography
* being allowed to possess pornography
* another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person pornography, see disseminating pornography to a minor
* being a pornographic actor: rules for the young person, and for other people, regarding production, possession, etc. (see child pornography)

With regard to films with violence, etc.:
* another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person a film; a cinema being allowed to let a young person enter

The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. Nigeria, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon define adulthood at age 15, but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common.

In most of the world, the legal adult age is 18 for most purposes, with some notable exceptions:

# The legal age of adulthood in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, and Yukon in Canada is 19 (though there are some exceptions in which Canadians may be considered legal adults in certain situations like sexual consent, which is age 16, and criminal law, federal elections and the military, which is at 18);
#The legal age of adulthood in Nebraska and Alabama in the United States is 19.
#The legal age of adulthood in South Korea is 19.
# The legal age of adulthood in Mississippi and Puerto Rico in the U.S. is 21.

Prior to the 1970s, young people were not classed as adults until 21 in most western nations. For example, in the United States, young citizens could not vote in many elections until 21 until July 1971 when the 26th Amendment passed mandating that the right to vote cannot be abridged for anyone 18 or older. The voting age was lowered in response to the fact that young men between the ages of 18 and 21 were drafted into the army to fight in the Vietnam War, hence the popular slogan &quot;old enough to fight, old enough to vote&quot; 

Young people under 21 in the US could also not purchase alcohol, purchase handguns, sign a binding contract, or marry without permission from parents. After the voting age was lowered, many states also moved to lower the drinking age (with most states having a minimum age of 18 or 19) and also to lower the age of legal majority (adulthood) to 18. However, there are legal activities where 18 is not the default age of adulthood. There are still some exceptions where 21 (or even higher) is still the benchmark for certain rights or responsibilities. For example, in the US the Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits those under 21 from purchasing a handgun from a federally licensed dealer (although federal law makes an exception for individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 to obtain one from a private dealer if state law permits.) 

As of July 1984, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act mandated that all states raise their respective drinking ages to 21 to create a uniform standard for legally purchasing, drinking, or publicly possessing alcohol with exceptions made for consumption only in private residences under parental supervision and permission. This was done in response to reducing the number of drunk driving fatalities prevalent among young drivers. States that choose not to comply can lose up to 10% of highway funding.

The Credit Card Act of 2009 imposed tougher safeguards for young adults between the ages of 18 and 20 obtaining a credit card. Young adults under the age of 21 must either have a co-signer 21 or older or show proof (usually a source of income) that they can repay their credit card balance. Unless that requirement is met, one must wait until 21 to be approved for a credit card on their own.

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expands the age that young adults can remain on their parent&#x27;s health insurance plan up to age 26.

, the federal government raised the legal age to purchase tobacco and vaping products from 18 to 21. In states where recreational marijuana is legalized, the default age is also 21, though those younger may be able to obtain medical marijuana prescriptions or cards upon seeing a physician.

Gambling also varies from 18 to 21 depending on the state and many rental car companies do not rent cars to those under 21 and have surcharges for drivers under 25 (although this is not codified, and is company policy).

In Quebec, Canada the Quebec legislature in 2020 raised the age one could purchase recreational marijuana from 18 to 21 stepping out of line with most of the country that set a minimum age of 19 (except Alberta, which is 18.) The Quebec government cited the risk that marijuana poses to the brain development of people under 21 as justification for the age raise.

In March 2021, the state of Washington in a 5–4 decision, justices in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington tossed the life without parole sentences of a 19-year-old and a 20-year-old convicted in separate cases of first-degree aggravated murder decades ago, saying, as with juveniles, the court must first consider the age of those under 21 before sentencing them to die behind bars. This comes at a time where there are ongoing debates about whether those between 18 and 20 should be exempted from the death penalty.

In Germany, courts largely sentence defendants under the age of 21 according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender.

In May 2021, the state of Texas raised the age that one can be an exotic dancer and work and patronize sexually oriented businesses from 18 to 21.

In the UK, there have been many proposals to raise the age that one can buy tobacco from 18 to 21 in an attempt to curb teen and young adult use to get to a &quot;smoke-free&quot; UK by 2030.
All of these laws made over the years reflect the growing awareness that young adults, while not children, are still in a transitional stage between adolescence and full adulthood and that there should be policy adjustments or restrictions where necessary, especially where it pertains to activities that carry certain degrees of risk or harm to themselves or others.

At the same time, however, even though the generally accepted age of majority is 18 in most nations, there are rights or privileges afforded to adolescents who have not yet reached legal adulthood. In the United States, youth are able to get a part-time job at 14 provided they have a work permit. At 16, one is able to obtain a driver&#x27;s permit or license depending on state laws and is able to work most jobs (except ones requiring heavy machinery) and consent to sexual activity (depending on the state). At 17, one is able to enlist in the armed forces with parental consent although they cannot be deployed to be in combat roles until age 18.

The voting age for local elections in most American cities is 18. But in five localities nationwide — four of which are in Maryland — 16 and 17-year-olds are eligible to vote. The cities are Takoma Park, Riverdale, Greenbelt, and Hyattsville.

In 2020, students 16 or older in Oakland, California gained the right to vote in school board elections. There is a growing movement to lower the voting age in the US and many other countries from 18 to 16 in hopes of engaging the youth vote and encouraging greater electoral participation. Some countries already have a voting age of 16 which include Austria, Scotland, Argentina, Brazil, Wales, Cuba, and Ecuador.

In Germany, one can purchase beer and wine at the age of 16 although they cannot purchase spirits or hard liquor until 18. The age of consent in Germany is 14 if both partners are under 18. Sexual activity with a person under 18 is punishable if the adult is a person of authority over the minor in upbringing, education, care, or employment.

==Social construction of adulthood==
In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood, social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed. While aging is an established biological process, the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria. In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development, regardless of context, nation, generation, gender, race, or social class. Social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood.

Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time. Historically, adulthood in the U.S. has rested on completing one&#x27;s education, moving away from the family of origin, and beginning one&#x27;s career. Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent. These criteria are social and subjective; they are organized by gender, race, ethnicity, and social class, among other key identity markers. As a result, particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others.

Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults&#x27; experiences of aging. The criteria are marked by a growing &quot;importance of individualistic criteria and the irrelevance of the demographic markers of normative conceptions of adulthood.&quot; In particular, younger cohorts&#x27; attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.

Jeffrey Arnett, a psychologist and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, studied the development of adults and argues that there is a new and distinct period of development in between adolescence and adulthood. This stage, which he calls &quot;emerging adulthood&quot;, occurs between the ages of 18 and 25. Arnett describes these individuals as able to take some responsibility for their lives, but still not completely feeling like an adult. Arnett articulates five distinct features that are unique to this period of development: identity exploration, feeling in between, instability, self-focus, and having possibilities. Arnett makes it clear that these 5 aspects of emerging adulthood are only relevant during the life stage of emerging adulthood.

The first feature, identity exploration, describes emerging adults making decisions for themselves about their career, education, and love life. This is a time of life when a young person has yet to finalize these decisions but are pondering them, making them feel somewhere in between adolescent and adult. This leads into a second feature of this phase of life—feeling in between. Emerging adults feel that they are taking on responsibilities but do not feel like a &#x27;full&#x27; adult quite yet. Next, the instability feature notes that emerging adults often move around after their high school years whether that is to college, friends&#x27; houses, or living with a romantic partner, as well as moving back home with their parents/guardians for a time. This moving around often ends once the individual&#x27;s family and career have been set. Tagging along with the instability feature is having self-focus. Emerging adults, being away from their parental and societal routines, are now able to do what they want when they want and where they want before they are put back into a routine when they start a marriage, family, and career. Arnett&#x27;s last feature of emerging adulthood, an age of possibilities, characterizes this stage as one where &quot;optimism reigns&quot;. These individuals believe they have a good chance of turning out better than their parents did.

==Religion==
According to Jewish tradition, adulthood is reached at age 13 for Jewish boys and 12 for Jewish girls in accordance with the Bar or Bat Mitzvah; they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the Torah and other Jewish practices. The Christian Bible and Jewish scripture contain no age requirement for adulthood or marrying, which includes engaging in sexual activity.

The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, &quot;A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage&quot;. According to &quot;The Disappearance of Childhood&quot; by Neil Postman, the Christian Church of the Middle Ages considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even executed as an adult, to be age 7. While certain religions have their guidelines on what it means to be an adult, generally speaking, there are trends that occur regarding religiosity as individuals transition from adolescence to adulthood. The role of religion in one&#x27;s life can impact development during adolescence. The National Library of Medicine (NCBI) highlights some studies that show rates of religiosity declining as people move out of the house and live on their own. Oftentimes when people live on their own, they change their life goals and religion tends to be less important as they discover who they are. Other studies from the NCBI show that as adults get married and have children they settle down, and as they do, there tends to be an increase in religiosity. Everyone&#x27;s level of religiosity builds at a different pace, meaning that religion relative to adult development varies across cultures and time.
