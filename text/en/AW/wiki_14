<text>Nile Gregory Rodgers Jr. (born September 19, 1952) is an American musician, songwriter, guitarist and record producer. The co-founder of Chic, he has written, produced, and performed on records that have sold more than 750 million albums and 100 million singles worldwide.

Formed as the Big Apple Band in 1972 with bassist Bernard Edwards, Chic released their self-titled debut album in 1977; it featured the hit singles &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)&quot; and &quot;Everybody Dance&quot;. The 1978 album &quot;C&#x27;est Chic&quot; included &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; and &quot;Le Freak&quot;, with the latter selling more than seven million singles worldwide. The song &quot;Good Times&quot; from the 1979 album &quot;Risqué&quot; was a number one single on the pop and soul charts, and became one of the most-sampled songs of all time, predominantly in hip-hop, starting with the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;.

With Edwards, Rodgers wrote and produced music for other artists, including the songs &quot;He&#x27;s the Greatest Dancer&quot; and &quot;We Are Family&quot; (for Sister Sledge) and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot; (for Diana Ross). After Chic&#x27;s breakup in 1983, Rodgers produced albums and singles for other artists, including David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;; &quot;Original Sin&quot; by INXS; Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;The Reflex&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot;; and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. He also worked with artists including Kylie Minogue, Nervo, Jake Shears, the B-52s, Keith Urban, Jeff Beck, Daft Punk, Mick Jagger, Coldplay, Grace Jones, the Vaughan Brothers, Bryan Ferry, Christina Aguilera, Lady Gaga, and Beyoncé. He won three Grammy Awards in 2014 for his work on Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, and two in 2023 for his work with Beyoncé on her album &quot;Renaissance&quot;. In 2018, Rodgers co-founded Hipgnosis Songs Fund, a publicly traded music intellectual property investment company.

Rodgers is a Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame via the Musical Excellence category in 2017. He has received six Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement/Special Merit Award. Known for his chucking guitar style, in 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;the full scope of Nile Rodgers&#x27; career is still hard to fathom&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Rodgers 7th on a list of the 250 greatest guitarists of all time, writing: &quot;There&#x27;s &#x27;influential,&#x27; then there&#x27;s &#x27;massively influential&#x27;, then there&#x27;s Nile Rodgers... a true innovator who never slows down, still making history with his guitar.&quot;

==Early life==
Rodgers was born on September 19, 1952, in the Lower East Side, New York City, to Beverly Goodman. She gave birth to Rodgers when she was 14. His biological father, Nile Rodgers Sr., was a travelling percussionist who specialized in Afro-Cuban beats and was rarely present as Rodgers grew up; although influential in his life, Rodgers saw his father only a &quot;handful&quot; of times prior to his death in 1970. In 1959, Goodman married Bobby Glanzrock. Rodgers described Glanzrock in his 2011 autobiography as a &quot;beatnik PhD, whose observations had angles that would make Miles Davis contemplate his cool.&quot; Richard Pryor, Thelonious Monk, and Lenny Bruce often visited their home in Greenwich Village. Glanzrock and Goodman were addicted to heroin, and Rodgers began using drugs at 13.

Before learning to play the guitar at 16, Rodgers played the flute and the clarinet. As a teenager, he played guitar with African, Persian, Latin, jazz and Boogaloo bands. He became a subsection leader of the Lower Manhattan branch of the New York Black Panther Party. He was raised as a Catholic.

Rodgers&#x27; cousin, trumpeter Robert &quot;Spike&quot; Mickens, was a member of Kool and the Gang from 1964 to 1986.

==Career==
===1970s: Formation of Chic, &quot;Le Freak&quot;, Sister Sledge===
Rodgers met bassist Bernard Edwards in 1970 while working as a touring musician for the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; stage show. Together they formed The Big Apple Band and initially worked as back-up musicians for the vocal group New York City (&quot;I&#x27;m Doin&#x27; Fine Now&quot;). New York City&#x27;s one hit allowed them to tour extensively, opening for The Jackson 5 on the American leg of their first world tour in 1973. The band dissolved after their second album failed to yield a hit.

Rodgers and Edwards subsequently joined forces with drummer Tony Thompson to form the Boys, playing gigs up and down the East Coast. Although there was label interest, record companies passed on the band after discovering its members were black, believing that black rock artists would be too hard to promote.

As the Big Apple Band, Rodgers and Edwards worked with Ashford &amp; Simpson and Luther Vandross, among others. Since another New York artist, Walter Murphy, had a band called The Big Apple Band, in 1977 Rodgers and Edwards changed the band&#x27;s name to Chic.

Inspired by Roxy Music, Chic developed a sound that was a fusion of jazz, soul, and funk grooves with melodies and lyrics with a European influence. Between gigs, they recorded the song &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, with then-boss Luther Vandross on vocals. Originally released by Buddah Records, it was a hit when it was re-released by Atlantic in the summer of 1977. Atlantic picked up an album option with Rodgers and Edwards, who quickly wrote more songs, and Chic&#x27;s self-titled debut was released in November.

The band scored numerous top ten hits, including &quot;Le Freak&quot;, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, &quot;Everybody Dance&quot;, &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)&quot;, &quot;My Forbidden Lover&quot;, and &quot;Good Times&quot; becoming club/pop/R&amp;B standards. &quot;Le Freak&quot; was Atlantic Records&#x27; only triple platinum selling single at the time, and &quot;Good Times&quot; shot to No. 1 in August 1979 despite that year&#x27;s &quot;Disco Sucks&quot; campaign.

The success of Chic&#x27;s first singles led Atlantic to offer Rodgers and Edwards the opportunity to produce any act on its roster. They chose Sister Sledge, whose 1979 album, &quot;We Are Family&quot;, hit #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, charting well into 1980. The first two singles, &quot;He&#x27;s the Greatest Dancer&quot; and the title cut &quot;We Are Family&quot; both reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, and No. 6 and No. 2, respectively on the pop chart. In April 2018, &quot;We Are Family&quot; was selected to be preserved in the Library of Congress.

===1980s: Diana Ross, David Bowie, INXS, Madonna, Duran Duran===
The 1979 disco backlash derailed Chic, and Edwards retreated from work, while Rodgers&#x27; drug use accelerated. Rodgers and Edwards delivered their final Atlantic album under contract, &quot;Believer&quot;, in 1982. They completed one of their last projects together in 1980, writing and producing the album &quot;Diana&quot; for Diana Ross, which yielded the hits &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot;. They produced Deborah Harry&#x27;s 1981 solo album &quot;Koo Koo&quot;, and produced the hit &quot;Spacer&quot; for the French disco act Sheila and B. Devotion. During the same time period, Chic&#x27;s song &quot;Good Times&quot; was sampled on the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, the first multiple-platinum hip hop single. The song continued to influence the sounds of others, including Queen&#x27;s 1980 #1 hit &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, and Blondie, who had a #1 hit with &quot;Rapture&quot;. Following Chic&#x27;s breakup, Rodgers released his first solo album, &quot;Adventures in the Land of the Good Groove&quot;.

With Chic no longer occupying most of his time, Rodgers was free to focus on working with other artists. He produced David Bowie&#x27;s biggest selling album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, which yielded the hit singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;China Girl&quot;, and &quot;Modern Love&quot;. He produced the single &quot;Original Sin&quot; by INXS, and in 1984, he produced Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, which scored four hit singles including its title track, &quot;Material Girl&quot;, and &quot;Dress You Up&quot;. He worked extensively with Duran Duran, remixing their biggest-selling single, &quot;The Reflex&quot;, producing &quot;Wild Boys&quot; on their 1984 live album, &quot;Arena&quot;, and co-producing the album &quot;Notorious&quot;.

In 1985, Rodgers produced albums for Sheena Easton, Jeff Beck, Thompson Twins, Mick Jagger, and others, and performed at Live Aid with Madonna and the Thompson Twins. He was named the #1 Singles Producer in the World by &quot;Billboard&quot; at the end of the year. At the end of the decade, he produced albums for Grace Jones, Al Jarreau (&quot;L is for Lover&quot;), Earth Wind and Fire&#x27;s vocalist Philip Bailey, and performed on &quot;Higher Love&quot; with Steve Winwood, as well as on records for Cyndi Lauper, and others. In 1989, he co-produced the B-52&#x27;s multi-platinum album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;; it reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart, and yielded the singles &quot;Love Shack&quot;, and &quot;Roam&quot;. He produced &quot;Workin&#x27; Overtime&quot;, Diana Ross&#x27; return to Motown, and the soundtracks for &quot;Alphabet City&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;White Nights&quot;, and &quot;The Fly&quot;. He later composed an orchestral soundtrack, his first, for the film &quot;Coming to America&quot;.

Rodgers formed the short-lived experimental band Outloud in 1987, with David Letterman&#x27;s guitarist, composer, and vocalist Felicia Collins and French session musician, producer, composer, and keyboardist Philippe Saisse; the trio released a single album, &quot;Out Loud&quot;, on Warner Bros. Records.

===1990s: Production, reformed Chic and death of Edwards, Sumthing Else===

In September 1990, shortly after the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Rodgers-produced Vaughan Brothers album &quot;Family Style&quot; was released. He produced records for David Bowie, Eric Clapton, the B-52s, David Lee Roth, Ric Ocasek, the Stray Cats and others early in the decade, and worked on the soundtracks for &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, &quot;Cool World&quot;, and &quot;The Beavis and Butt-head Experience&quot;.

Rodgers and Edwards reformed Chic in 1992 and recorded new material for the album &quot;Chic-Ism&quot;. In 1996, they released a Japan-only album consisting of old Chic material rerecorded with guest vocalists, &quot;Chic Freak and More Treats&quot;. Edwards and Rodgers performed with Sister Sledge, Steve Winwood, and Slash in a series of commemorative concerts in Japan.

Edwards died following a concert on April 17, 1996. Rodgers discovered his body. He later said that he &quot;cried like a baby and suffered intensely but eventually realised the best tribute to him would be to carry on and be the best I could be.&quot; A year later, Rodgers returned to Japan to pay homage to Edwards, and in 1999, Rodgers released &quot;Live at the Budokan&quot;, a live recording of Edwards&#x27; final performance. The album was not overdubbed or changed in order to keep the recording pure.

Rodgers started playing live concerts again while composing and producing music for the film soundtracks &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;, &quot;Blue Chips&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot;, working with Bob Dylan, among others.

In 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. released &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; sampling Rodgers and Edwards&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; from Diana Ross&#x27;s platinum album &quot;Diana&quot;. &quot;Mo Money, Mo Problems&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks and was nominated for the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.

In 1998, Rodgers founded Sumthing Else Music Works record label and Sumthing Distribution, an independent music label distributor. Sumthing focused on distributing video game soundtracks, and released the world&#x27;s first 5.1 surround DVD game-soundtrack album. Its titles include the &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Gears of War&quot; and &quot;Borderlands&quot; series.

=== 2000s: Film and video game soundtracks, We Are Family Foundation ===
In the early 2000s, Rodgers worked extensively on film and video game soundtracks, including &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, &quot;Snow Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Semi-Pro&quot; starring Will Ferrell, who co-wrote the title song &quot;Love Me Sexy&quot; with Rodgers.

In 2002, Rodgers returned to work again with the original five members of Duran Duran when he co-produced &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The album rose to No. 3 in the UK.

Following the September 11 attacks, Rodgers brought together more than 200 musicians and celebrities to record &quot;We Are Family&quot;. It was recorded in New York at Avatar Studios (previously The Power Station, where the original recording of &quot;We Are Family&quot; took place in 1978), and in Los Angeles at the Record Plant. The accompanying music video was directed by Spike Lee. An 80-minute documentary, &quot;The Making and Meaning of We Are Family&quot;, directed by Danny Schechter, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002. In a collaboration between Disney, Nickelodeon and PBS, more than 100 children&#x27;s television characters participated in a &quot;We Are Family&quot; children&#x27;s music video, and on March 11, 2002, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and PBS aired the video to promote tolerance and diversity on the 6-month anniversary of 9/11. In July 2002, Rodgers co-founded the We Are Family Foundation with his
life partner, Nancy Hunt. A non-profit organization that promotes &quot;cultural diversity while nurturing and mentoring the vision, talents, and ideas of young people who are positively changing the world&quot;, it is dedicated to the vision of a global family.

===2010s: Autobiography, Daft Punk, Songwriters Hall of Fame, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;===

In 2010, Rhino Records released a four-CD box set, &quot;Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization, Volume 1: Savoir Faire&quot;, which for the first time collected tracks from all of the acts produced by The Chic Organization up to their original break-up in 1983. Rodgers provided liner notes for the set, which was also reissued in 2013.

Rodgers&#x27; critically acclaimed autobiography, &quot;Le Freak: An Upside Down Story of Family, Disco, and Destiny&quot; was published by Spiegel &amp; Grau, a Random House imprint, in late 2011. It was named one of the top 10 of the 25 Greatest Rock Memoirs of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In February 2012, Rodgers announced that he was collaborating with electronic band Daft Punk for their latest album, &quot;teasing out their R&amp;B influences&quot;. The record, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; was released in 2013. Rodgers co-wrote and played guitar on three tracks: &quot;Give Life Back to Music&quot;, &quot;Lose Yourself to Dance&quot;, and &quot;Get Lucky&quot;. In April, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 3, only 24 hours after its release, and two weeks later rose to No. 1. In an interview with Official Charts Company, Rodgers said, &quot;I&#x27;ve had big records and Number 1s; I have had records that were Number 1 in the United States but nowhere else ... I&#x27;ve had records which have done well [in the UK], but not in the States. But to have this ubiquitous record, that is a hit everywhere ... It&#x27;s amazing to me! I&#x27;m out on the road and I can hear it wherever I go. I&#x27;m flabbergasted!&quot; &quot;Get Lucky&quot; became one of the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling singles of all time.

Rhino Records released &quot;Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization Up All Night (The Greatest Hits)&quot;, a compilation album featuring songs written, played or produced by Rodgers and Bernard Edwards for Chic and various artists, including Diana Ross, Sister Sledge, Carly Simon, Debbie Harry, Johnny Mathis, Sheila &amp; B. Devotion and Norma Jean Wright. &quot;Up All Night&quot; reached No. 2 on the UK Compilation Album Chart for the week ending July 13, 2013. In October 2013, Rhino released &quot;Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization Up All Night (The Greatest Hits Disco Edition)&quot;, which included a medley taken from Chic ft. Nile Rodgers&#x27; live performance at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival.

Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were nominated to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in October 2013. In January 2014, Rodgers performed &quot;Get Lucky&quot; with Daft Punk on the Grammy Awards, along with Pharrell Williams and Stevie Wonder, with a medley including elements of Chic&#x27;s &quot;Le Freak&quot; and Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Another Star&quot;. Rodgers won three Grammy Awards for his work with Daft Punk on &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, including Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Record of the Year and Album of the Year. In March, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Rodgers one of the 50 Most Important People in EDM, stating, &quot;The full scope of Nile Rodgers&#x27; career is still hard to fathom, and it&#x27;s not just ongoing, it&#x27;s in overdrive.&quot; In December, NARAS announced that &quot;Le Freak&quot; would be inducted into The Grammy Hall of Fame.

Rodgers&#x27; solo single &quot;Do What You Wanna Do (IMS Anthem)&quot; was released on August 10, 2014 to benefit the We Are Family Foundation. A year later, in March 2015, Rodgers released Chic&#x27;s first single in more than 23 years, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, with a live streamed concert from The Roundhouse in London. The song was produced using original Chic outtake tapes from the 70s, with Bernard Edwards, Tony Thompson, and vocalists Alfa Anderson and Luci Martin. The song went to #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance Music Chart on June 20, 2015. In August, Rodgers launched FOLD Festival (FreakOut! Let&#x27;s Dance), a multi-day event with a diverse line-up of artists including Beck, Duran Duran, Chaka Khan, Keith Urban, Janelle Monáe, Ginger Minj, Chic and others.

Rodgers collaborated with Lady Gaga to remake Chic&#x27;s hit, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; for Tom Ford&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2016 collection video in lieu of a fashion show.

Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 9, 2016. In 2017, after 11 nominations for Chic, Rodgers was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with an award for Musical Excellence. &quot;It&#x27;s sort of bittersweet,&quot; says Rodgers. &quot;I&#x27;m quite flattered that they believed that I was worthy, but my band Chic didn&#x27;t win. They plucked me out of the band and said, &#x27;You&#x27;re better than Chic.&#x27; That&#x27;s wacky to me ... I am flattered and I think it&#x27;s cool, but I feel like somebody put me in the lifeboat and told my family they can&#x27;t get in.&quot;

On the evening of 25 June 2017, Rodgers and Chic returned to the Glastonbury Festival, as headliners on the Pyramid Stage, for an audience of close to 100,000. In September of the same year, a version of George Michael&#x27;s song &quot;Fantasy&quot; was released, credited to &quot;George Michael featuring Nile Rodgers.&quot; The track, released as a B-side by Michael&#x27;s label in 1990, was reworked by Rodgers and featured him prominently on guitar. It was Michael&#x27;s only posthumous release.

In June 2018, &quot;Till the World Falls&quot;, the first single from Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic&#x27;s first album since 1992, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, was released. The song featured Mura Masa, Cosha and Vic Mensa. The album was released in September 2018, and hit the Top 10 in the UK. It was the first Chic record to hit the Top 10 in 25 years. Two singles from the album were subsequently released: &quot;Sober&quot; featuring Craig David and Stefflon Don, and &quot;Do You Wanna Party&quot; featuring LunchMoney Lewis. In December 2018, Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic began their first UK arena tour. They were nominated for a Brit Award in the &quot;Best International Group Category&quot;, in January 2019.

== Television and film ==
=== Soundtracks and scores ===
In 1982, Rodgers and Edwards produced the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Soup for One.&quot; As Chic, they wrote and performed three songs, including the film&#x27;s title track. Edwards and Rodgers also wrote and produced Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Why&quot;, a top 10 hit in the UK that helped resurrect Simon&#x27;s career. The soundtrack, which also featured Sister Sledge, Debbie Harry, and Teddy Pendergrass, was a bigger hit than the film.

Rodgers became increasingly in-demand as a producer and composer for film and television following the success of the &quot;Soup for One&quot; soundtrack. In 1984, he produced Al Jarreau&#x27;s theme for the television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;; he wrote, produced and scored the soundtrack for &quot;Alphabet City&quot;, and in 1986 and worked with Laurie Anderson on her concert film, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. In 1988, in addition to producing the soundtrack for &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, he composed the orchestral score for Eddie Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Coming to America&quot;. He also served as film&#x27;s music supervisor, and wrote and produced its title track, a hit for The System, and wrote the jingle for the Soul Glo commercial, &quot;the most iconic fake ad in cinematic history.&quot;

In 1999, he executive produced, scored, music-supervised and appeared in &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, a documentary about the Black Panthers. In a review of the soundtrack, critic Maria Blandford wrote: &quot;The disc realistically supports the conflicting and controversial nature of this historical period, and opens the arena for present-day discussion and evaluation...this recording is an examination of the American conscience.&quot;

Between the mid-1980s and the late 2000s, songs written, produced or performed by Rodgers (and/or Chic) were included in the films or on the soundtracks for &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (&quot;Le Freak&quot;), &quot;Thelma and Louise, Rush Hour 2, Cool World, Beavis and Butthead Do America, The Flintstones&quot; (in collaboration with the B-52s), &quot;Summer of Sam, Space Jam&quot; (with Seal), &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; (with Bob Dylan), &quot;Curdled,&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Cool World&quot;, &quot;Snow Dogs&quot;, &quot;White Hot, Gremlins, That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;, among others. He scored the film &quot;Blue Chips&quot;, and reunited with Murphy to score &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III.&quot; He also produced a remake of &quot;Axel F&quot;, from the first &quot;Beverly Hills Cop,&quot; which he performed with Richard Hilton. In 2008, he cowrote Semi-Pro&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Sexy&quot; with Will Ferrell, who starred in the movie.

In the 2010s, music by Rodgers was featured in movies including &quot;Arctic Tale&quot;, &quot;Trolls&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby, a&quot;s well as on the TV shows &quot;Vinyl, The Get Down,&quot; and &quot;Horrid Henry,&quot; among others. In 2019, he collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Cats.&quot; In 2023 it was announced that he and The-Dream were co-writing music for the Mark Anthony Green horror film, &quot;Opus.&quot;

=== Television and film appearances ===
Since his 1978 debut with Chic on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, Rodgers has performed on more than 150 television programs. He has been the subject of documentaries including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Nile Rodgers: The Hitmaker&quot;, &quot;Front and Center: Songwriters Hall of Fame: Nile Rodgers&quot; on PBS, Arte France&#x27;s &quot;Nile Rodgers: Secrets of a Hitmaker&quot;, and the short film &quot;Composing America: The Musical Talents of Nile Rodgers&quot;. The BBC also broadcast &quot;Nile Rodgers: How To Make It in the Music Business&quot;, a three-hour, three part special. In 2018, &quot;Once in a Lifetime Sessions with Nile Rodgers&quot; premiered on Netflix.

Rodgers has appeared in documentaries about David Bowie, Diana Ross, Elton John, Michael Jackson, Rick James, George Michael, Duran Duran, Daft Punk, Public Enemy, Madonna, Avicii, Studio 54, the Seventies, the Eighties, the Nineties, recorded music, girl groups, the disco era, disco, house music, funk, and soul music. He was featured in the 2023 BBC documentary about Little Richard, &quot;Little Richard: King and Queen of Rock’n’Roll.&quot;

Rodgers most frequently plays Fender Stratocasters, as well as Gibson Les Pauls and archtop guitars such as the Gibson ES-300 and D&#x27;Angelico New Yorker. He auctioned more than 100 guitars and bass guitars from his personal collection to benefit We Are Family Foundation in December 2021.

===The Hitmaker===
Rodgers plays a 1960 Fender Stratocaster with a 1959 neck, nicknamed The Hitmaker, which he acquired as a trade-in at a shop in Miami Beach, Florida. Exceptionally light, it has a maple fingerboard and a worn white finish. Rodgers claims it has a unique sound. After Rodgers purchased the guitar, Edwards taught him how to play it in a chop chord style, which he called &quot;chucking&quot;. In his autobiography, Rodgers wrote: &quot;He fingered the chords with his left hand, and his right hand would continuously play sixteen notes to the bar while accenting the main parts of the rhythm ... One lesson was all I needed. For the next few nights straight, while my roommate pursued all manner of trysts, I was having a love affair in the bathroom with my new ax. In just a few days, I&#x27;d emerge as a chucking funk guitarist who knew more jazz chord inversions than most of my R&amp;B counterparts.&quot;

The Fender Custom Shop introduced a limited edition Nile Rodgers Hitmaker Stratocaster, a recreation of Rodgers&#x27; guitar, in January 2014.

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Rodgers woke up in the hospital to learn that his heart had stopped eight times, and he was alive due only to the actions of the doctor who was filling out his death certificate. He stopped using drugs and alcohol in 1994 after a friend showed him a tape of a performance during which he was inebriated.

Rodgers was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer in October 2010. He documented his illness on a blog called &quot;Walking on Planet C&quot;. He was given the all-clear in 2013. In 2017, a growth on his right kidney was diagnosed as two different cancers within one mass. The mass was surgically removed in November 2017. He said he expected a 100% recovery. At his performance at the Hollywood Bowl, on July 4, 2019, Rodgers announced that he was &quot;100% cancer-free.&quot;

Rodgers lived in Westport, Connecticut until July 2021 when he moved to Miami, Florida with his life partner, Nancy Hunt.

<text>Antiochus XII Dionysus Epiphanes Philopator Callinicus (; between 124 and 109 BC – 82 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as King of Syria between 87 and 82 BC. The youngest son of Antiochus VIII and, most likely, his Egyptian wife Tryphaena, Antiochus XII lived during a period of civil war between his father and his uncle Antiochus IX, which ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII in 96 BC. Antiochus XII&#x27;s four brothers laid claim to the throne, eliminated Antiochus IX as a claimant, and waged war against his heir Antiochus X.

By 87 BC, only two claimants remained, both brothers of Antiochus XII: Demetrius III and Philip I. The realm of Demetrius III was initially centered in Damascus but later extended over most of Syria. Demetrius III was defeated by Philip I and went into exile in Parthia, allowing Antiochus XII to gain control of Damascus while Philip I remained in the Syrian capital Antioch. Antiochus XII consolidated his territory within inner Syria and did not seek to expand into the territories of Philip I, who attempted to annex Damascus but was repulsed. Antiochus XII focused his attention on Syria&#x27;s southern reaches into which the Judaeans and Nabataeans sought to expand.

Antiochus XII reinforced his southern frontier and warred with his neighbors, conducting two campaigns against Nabataea that included engagements with Judea. After several victories in his first campaign, Antiochus XII was killed towards the end of his second campaign against the Nabateans at the Battle of Cana in 82 BC. Damascus was captured by the forces of the Nabatean King Aretas III, and the Syrian throne was claimed by Antiochus X&#x27;s widow Cleopatra Selene and her son Antiochus XIII.

==Name and background==

Antiochus, Greek for &quot;resolute in contention&quot;, was a dynastic name borne by many Seleucid monarchs. The Seleucid dynasty&#x27;s founder Seleucus I named the capital of Syria, Antioch, in honor of his father Antiochus. Antiochus XII was the fifth and youngest son of Antiochus VIII and his Ptolemaic Egyptian wife Tryphaena, who married in 124 BC. In 109 BC, Tryphaena was killed by Antiochus VIII&#x27;s half-brother Antiochus IX, who fought with Antiochus VIII from 113 BC for the throne of Syria. Antiochus XII&#x27;s brothers were Seleucus VI, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III.

Following Antiochus VIII&#x27;s assassination in 96 BC, his second wife, Tryphaena&#x27;s sister Cleopatra Selene, married Antiochus IX and then his son Antiochus X, who fought with Antiochus XII&#x27;s four brothers for the throne. By 88 BC, only Demetrius III and Philip I remained; Demetrius III was originally based in Damascus before extending his authority to most of Syria. He was defeated by Philip I and his Parthian allies in 87 BC and exiled to Parthia, where he died of an unknown illness. Philip I took control of the capital, while Cleopatra Selene, now a widow, took shelter in Ptolemais with her sons by Antiochus X.

==Reign==
The departure of Demetrius III left a power vacuum in Damascus that was filled by Antiochus XII. Coins minted during the reign of Demetrius III are dated to the Seleucid year (SE) 225 (88/87 BC), while the earliest coins minted during the reign of Antiochus XII have the date 226 SE (87/86 BC), suggesting there was a rapid assumption of power by Antiochus XII. Monarchs of the Hellenistic period did not use regnal numbers, which is a more modern practice, but instead used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs; Three of Antiochus XII&#x27;s four epithets, &quot;Epiphanes&quot; (illustrious)–previously used by his father, &quot;Philopator&quot; (father-loving) and &quot;Callinicus&quot; (nobly victorious), served to emphasize the ancestry of his grandfather Demetrius II in contrast to the line of the latter&#x27;s brother Antiochus VII, which was represented by Antiochus IX and his descendants; &quot;Callinicus&quot; may have been an echo of Demetrius II&#x27;s epithet &quot;Nikator&quot; (victorious). He likely used his other epithet &quot;Dionysus&quot; to associate himself with the Greek god of wine in his role as conqueror of the East. Antiochus XII was depicted on coinage with an exaggerated hawked nose in the likeness of his father, as a means of strengthening the legitimacy of his succession.

===Policies and territory===

According to historian Alfred Bellinger, Antiochus XII may have received assistance from Ptolemaic Egypt to gain his throne. This view is reflected in Antiochus XII&#x27;s policies, which were targeted at the south in Nabataea and Judaea, but not towards expansion within the kingdom of Syria. His dominion was limited to inner Syria, centered on Damascus, which served as his capital and primary mint. Antiochus XII also ruled over the town of Gadara, governed by an official named Philotas. In 100 BC, Gadara had been conquered by the Hasmonean king of Judea Alexander Jannaeus, who partially destroyed its walls, but it was recaptured by the Seleucids in 93 BC. Gadara held great strategic importance for Syria as it served as a major military hub for operations in the south. Controlling it was vital to the war effort against the Judaeans, which led Antiochus to rebuild the city&#x27;s defenses in 228 SE (85/84 BC). Historian Aryeh Kasher suggested that Antiochus XII dug what the first-century historian Josephus called the &quot;trench of Antiochus&quot; (or valley of Antiochus) to protect Damascus from the Nabataeans; the trench was probably located in the Hula Valley.

Seleucid coins often had depictions of their Greek deities, but the silver coinage of Antiochus XII depicted the supreme Semitic god Hadad on the reverse, possibly in recognition of the shrinking borders of the kingdom, which convinced the monarch of the importance of the local cults. By promoting indigenous deities, Seleucid kings hoped to gain the support of their non-Greek subjects. According to Bellinger, the use of Hadad indicated that Antiochus XII placed focus on his &quot;intention of being first and foremost king of Damascus&quot;. During his reign, Demetrius III had also depicted a Semitic deity, Atargatis, on his currency. In the view of historian , the change of coin imagery from Atargatis to Hadad probably served two goals: to imply that Antiochus XII had a different policy focus than his predecessor, and to demonstrate his intention of maintaining a good relationship with the Semitic population of Damascus, who comprised the majority of the inhabitants, to avoid tension with Greek settlers. Seleucid kings presented themselves as protectors of Hellenism and patronized intellectuals and philosophers, but Antiochus XII may have adopted a different attitude; he ordered the expulsion of such scholars.

===Military campaigns===

Early in his reign, Antiochus XII attacked the Nabataeans and the Judaeans, whose territories both lay south of his own. This conflict was recorded by Josephus, although he made no mention of the name of the Nabataean king. Josephus mentioned two campaigns against the Nabataeans, but did not explain the motives leading the Syrian King to attack them. Modern scholars presented several theories. In the view of Israel Shatzman, Antiochus XII may have feared the growing power of the Nabataeans, who were expanding into southern Syria. Zayn Bilkadi suggested that Antiochus XII wanted to take control over the Nabataeans&#x27; crude oil industry, while Alexander Fantalkin and Oren Tal suggested that the Nabataeans actively supported Philip I in his attempts to take control over Antiochus XII&#x27;s realm.

====First Nabataean campaign and the incursions of Philip I====
Antiochus XII&#x27;s first Nabataean campaign was launched in 87 BC, and might have included a battle near Motho, modern Imtan in the region of Hauran, as proposed by the historian Hans Peter Roschinski, who drew on the writings of Stephanus of Byzantium. The Byzantine historian preserved in his book, &quot;Ethica&quot;, fragments from a lost work by the historian Uranius of Apamea, who wrote a book titled &quot;Arabica&quot;, which has been dated to 300 AD. In the account of Uranius, King Antigonus I () is killed at Motho by a king of the Arabs named Rabbel. The name Motho could refer to a northern city in Hauran or a southern city in Moab. The name of Antigonus was regularly &quot;corrected&quot; to Antiochus by different scholars who believed that Uranius was referring to Antiochus XII. Roschinski considered it conceivable that Stephanus was conflating two events taking place during the reign of the Nabataean King Rabbel I: a battle of Antiochus XII&#x27;s first Nabataean campaign at Motho in the north, and the battle from the second Nabataean campaign in which Antiochus XII was killed. Shatzman, on the other hand, noted that nowhere in his work did Stephanus indicate that the battle of Motho took place in the north.

Taking advantage of his brother&#x27;s absence, Philip I seized Damascus, aided by the governor of the city&#x27;s citadel, Milesius, who opened the gates to him. According to Josephus, Milesius received no reward from Philip I, who attributed the betrayal to the general&#x27;s fear, leading Milesius to betray Philip I, who had left the city to attend an event in the nearby hippodrome. The general closed the gates, locking Philip I out, and awaited the return of Antiochus XII, who had hastily ended his campaign when he heard of his brother&#x27;s occupation of the city. Modern scholars noted that Seleucid currency, struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper), portrayed the King sporting a beard. During his first two years, Antiochus XII&#x27;s visage appeared beardless, but this changed in 228 SE (85/84 BC). This is possibly related to Philip I&#x27;s attack on Damascus, but this supposition has little support, as Antiochus XII failed to take any action against his brother. No coins were minted during the period that Philip I held Damascus, indicating only a brief occupation of the city.

====Second Nabataean campaign, war in Judea and death====
Although his territory directly abutted Nabataean territory, for his second Nabataean campaign Antiochus XII instead chose to march his forces through Judaea along the coast, probably to attack the Nabataean-dominated Negev, which would have cut off the port city of Gaza, threatened Nabataean Mediterranean trade, and curbed Nabataean ambitions in the Transjordan. This route would have allowed Antiochus XII to keep Alexander Jannaeus at bay. According to Josephus, the Judaean King feared Antiochus XII&#x27;s intentions and ordered the &quot;Yannai Line&quot; to be built, which consisted of a trench that fronted a defensive wall dotted with wooden towers. The trench stretched from Caphersaba to the sea near Joppa. Antiochus XII leveled the trench, burned the fortifications, and continued his march into Nabataean territory.

The account of the campaign, written by Josephus, is subject to some debate; the historian wrote that Antiochus XII&#x27;s forces defeated those of Alexander Jannaeus, but the eighth-century historian George Syncellus mentioned a defeat suffered by Antiochus XII at the hands of the Judaean king. The existence of the Yannai Line has been questioned by several historians, and Josephus&#x27;s explanation of Alexander Jannaeus&#x27;s attempt to stop the march of Antiochus XII, because of his fears of the latter&#x27;s intentions, is unsatisfactory. Both the Nabataeans and Syrians were enemies of Judea and it would have been to Alexander Jannaeus&#x27;s benefit if those two powers were in conflict. Syncellus may have been referring to an earlier confrontation between the Syrian king and Alexander Jannaeus. Thus the statement of Syncellus supports the notion that Antiochus XII&#x27;s second Nabataean campaign was also aimed at Judea; perhaps Antiochus XII sought to annex the coastal cities of Alexander Jannaeus as retribution for the defeat mentioned by Syncellus. Another objective would be subduing the Judaeans to keep them from attacking Syria while Antiochus XII was busy in Nabataea.

The final engagement between the forces of Antiochus XII and the Nabataeans occurred near the village of Cana, the location of which is unknown, but is generally assumed by modern scholars to be southwest of the Dead Sea. Historian Siegfried Mittmann considered it to be synonymous with &quot;Qina&quot;, modern-day Horvat Uza, as mentioned by Josephus in Book 15 of his &quot;Antiquities&quot;. Details of the battle, as written by Josephus, spoke of the Nabataeans employing a feigned retreat, then counterattacking the Syrian forces before their ranks could be ordered. Antiochus XII managed to rally his troops and weathered the attack, but he fought in the front lines, jeopardizing his life, and he eventually fell. The year of Antiochus XII&#x27;s death is debated, but his last coins struck in Damascus are dated to 230 SE (83/82 BC).

==Aftermath and legacy==

According to Josephus, the death of the King resulted in a rout of the Syrian forces, with many being killed in the field or during the retreat. Survivors of the rout sheltered in Cana, where most died of starvation. Antiochus XII was the last energetic Seleucid king. Little is recorded of Philip I after his attempt at annexing Damascus, which was left without a protector after the death of Antiochus XII. Fearing the Ituraean ruler Ptolemy, the people of Damascus invited Aretas III of Nabataea to take the city. The numismatist Oliver D. Hoover suggested that Aretas III did not hold Damascus for long before the city returned to Seleucid possession.

The identity of Antiochus XII&#x27;s wife remains unknown, but according to the sixth-century historian John Malalas, whose work is considered generally unreliable by scholars, the King had two daughters, Cleopatra and Antiochis. Cleopatra Selene, who went into hiding after the death of Antiochus X in 224 SE (89/88 BC), took advantage of Antiochus XII&#x27;s death and declared her son Antiochus XIII king with herself as queen regent and regnant. Coins struck during her regency show the marks of the Damascus mint. Archeologist Nicholas L. Wright suggested that Cleopatra Selene&#x27;s takeover of Damascus took place after 80 BC. Josephus called Antiochus XII the last Seleucid king, and Malalas, according to the translation of the historian Glanville Downey, followed suit; the last Seleucid king was in fact Antiochus XIII, who was dethroned in 64 BC after Antioch was annexed by the Romans.

<text>Christopher Walken (born Ronald Walken; March 31, 1943) is an American actor. His diverse work on stage and screen has earned him numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Tony Awards. His films have grossed more than $1.6 billion in the United States alone. 

Walken has appeared in supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; (1971), &quot;Next Stop, Greenwich Village&quot; (1976), &quot;Roseland&quot; (1977) and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), before coming to wider attention as the troubled Vietnam War veteran Nick Chevotarevich in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). His performance earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated for the same award for portraying con artist Frank Abagnale&#x27;s father in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002).

Since his breakthrough, Walken has appeared in films in various genres, both in lead and supporting roles. These include &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1980), &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1983), &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983), &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), &quot;At Close Range&quot; (1986), &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; (1988), &quot;King of New York&quot; (1990), &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1990), &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;The Prophecy&quot; (1995, and its two sequels), &quot;Suicide Kings&quot; (1997), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; (2012), &quot;A Late Quartet&quot; (2012), &quot;Percy&quot; (2020), and &quot;&quot; (2024). He has also provided voice work for the animated films &quot;Antz&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016).

On television, Walken has appeared in films such as &quot;Who Am I This Time?&quot; (1982), and &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall&quot; (1991), for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. More recently, he has starred in television series &quot;The Outlaws&quot; (2021–), and &quot;Severance&quot; (2022–), the latter of which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nomination. He has guest-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; seven times. His roles on the show include record producer Bruce Dickinson in the &quot;More Cowbell&quot; sketch, the disgraced Confederate officer Colonel Angus, and multiple appearances as an aging, unsuccessful lothario in the Continental sketch.

As a stage actor, Walken starred with Irene Worth in a 1975 Broadway revival of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;. Walken has played the lead in the Shakespeare plays &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. His performance in the original rendition of &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s The Dead&quot; (2000), earned him a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical nomination. He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role in Martin McDonagh&#x27;s &quot;A Behanding in Spokane&quot; (2010). He also wrote and played the lead role in the 1995 play &quot;Him&quot;, about his idol Elvis Presley.

==Early life==
Walken was born Ronald Walken on March 31, 1943, in Astoria, Queens, New York City. His parents were Rosalie Russell, a Scottish immigrant from Glasgow, and Paul Wälken, a German immigrant from Gelsenkirchen who owned and operated Walken&#x27;s Bakery in Astoria. Walken was named after actor Ronald Colman. He was raised Methodist. He and his brothers, Kenneth and Glenn, were child actors on television in the 1950s, influenced by their mother&#x27;s dreams of stardom.

When he was 15, a girlfriend showed Walken a magazine photo of Elvis Presley and Walken later said, &quot;This guy looked like a Greek god. Then I saw him on television. I loved everything about him.&quot; He changed his hairstyle to imitate Presley and has not changed it since. As a teenager, he worked as a lion tamer trainee for a short time in a circus.

Walken attended Hofstra University but dropped out after one year, having been cast in the role of Clayton Dutch Miller in an off-Broadway revival of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; alongside Liza Minnelli. Walken initially trained as a dancer at the Washington Dance Studio before moving on to dramatic stage roles and then film.

==Career==
===1950s–1960s===
As a child, Walken appeared on screen as an extra in numerous anthology series and variety shows during the Golden Age of Television. After appearing in a sketch with Martin and Lewis on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, Walken decided to become an actor. He landed a regular role in the 1953 television show &quot;Wonderful John Acton,&quot; playing the part of Kevin Acton. During this time, he was credited as Ronnie Walken.

Over the next two years, he appeared frequently on television, and had a thriving career in theater. From 1954 to 1956, Walken and his brother Glenn originated the role of Michael Bauer on the soap opera &quot;The Guiding Light.&quot; In 1963, he appeared as a character named Chris in an episode of &quot;Naked City&quot;, starring Paul Burke.

In 1964, he changed his first name to Christopher at the suggestion of Monique van Vooren, who had a nightclub act in which Walken was a dancer. She believed the name suited him better than Ronnie (a pet form of his given name, Ronald), which he was credited as until then. He prefers to be known informally as Chris instead of Christopher.

In 1966, Walken played the role of King Philip of France in the Broadway premiere of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;. In 1968, he played Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Stratford Festival in Canada.

He appeared in the made-for-TV movies &quot;Barefoot in Athens&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1969), and made his feature film debut in &quot;Me and My Brother&quot; (1969), a low-budget production that also featured Sam Shepard. In 1969, Walken guest-starred in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; as Navy SP Walt Kramer.

===1970s===
In 1970, Walken starred in the Off-Broadway production of Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lemon Sky&quot; opposite Charles Durning and Bonnie Bartlett. Later that year Walken received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance.

Walken&#x27;s first major studio film was Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; (1971) with Sean Connery and Dyan Cannon. In 1972&#x27;s &quot;The Mind Snatchers&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Happiness Cage&quot;, Walken played his first starring role. In this science fiction film, which deals with mind control and normalization, he plays a sociopathic U.S. soldier stationed in Germany.

Paul Mazursky&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Next Stop, Greenwich Village&quot; had Walken, under the name &quot;Chris Walken&quot;, playing the charismatic and promiscuous fictional poet Robert Fulmer. In Woody Allen&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (in which his surname was misspelled &quot;Wlaken&quot; in the end credits), Walken played the borderline crazy brother of Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Also in 1977, Walken had a minor role as Eli Wallach&#x27;s partner in &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. In 1978, he appeared in &quot;Shoot the Sun Down&quot;, a western filmed in 1976 that costarred Margot Kidder. Along with Nick Nolte and Burt Reynolds, Walken was considered by George Lucas for the part of Han Solo in &quot;Star Wars&quot;; the part ultimately went to Harrison Ford.

In 1977, Walken also guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Kojak&quot; as Ben Wiley, a robber.

Walken won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Michael Cimino&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. He played a Pennsylvania steelworker who was emotionally destroyed by the Vietnam War. To help achieve his character&#x27;s gaunt appearance before the third act, Walken consumed only bananas, water and rice for a month.

===1980s===

Walken&#x27;s first film of the 1980s was the controversial &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, also directed by Cimino. Walken also starred in the 1981 action adventure &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, directed by John Irvin. He surprised many critics and filmgoers with his intricate tap-dancing striptease in Herbert Ross&#x27;s musical &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981). In 1982, he played a socially awkward but gifted theater actor in the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s short story &quot;Who Am I This Time?&quot; opposite Susan Sarandon. Walken then played schoolteacher-turned-psychic Johnny Smith in David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1983 adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. That same year, Walken also starred in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; alongside Natalie Wood and (in a minor role) his wife, Georgianne.

In 1985, Walken played a James Bond villain, Max Zorin, in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, Roger Moore&#x27;s last appearance as Bond. Walken dyed his hair blond to befit Zorin&#x27;s origins as a Nazi experiment.

&quot;At Close Range&quot; (1986) starred Walken as Brad Whitewood, a rural Pennsylvania crime boss who tries to bring his two sons into his empire; his character was mostly based on criminal Bruce Johnston.

In 1988, Walken played a memorable role as Sgt. Merwin J. Toomey in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;, which was directed by Mike Nichols, and he played the role of Federal Agent Kyril Montana in &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;. He also played the leading role of Whitley Strieber in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Communion&quot;, an autobiographical film written by Strieber. It was based on claims that he and his friends were subject to visitations by unknown, other-worldly entities variously identified as &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;visitors&quot;. That same year, Walken appeared in the film &quot;Homeboy&quot;, which was written by and featured Mickey Rourke in the titular role. In 1989, he played the lead role of &quot;Puss&quot; in the Cannon theater group&#x27;s musical version of &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

===1990s===

&quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot;, an art house film directed by Paul Schrader, features Walken as Robert, a decadent Italian aristocrat with extreme sexual tastes and murderous tendencies who lives with his wife (Helen Mirren) in Venice.

&quot;King of New York&quot; (1990), directed by Abel Ferrara, stars Walken as ruthless New York City drug dealer Frank White, a recently released prisoner set on reclaiming his criminal territory. In 1991, Walken starred in &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall&quot; as Jacob Witting, a widowed farmer. In 1992, Walken played villain millionaire industrialist Max Shreck in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. In January 1993, he appeared in Madonna&#x27;s music video for her hit single &quot;Bad Girl&quot; (directed by David Fincher). Walken also played Bobby, Cassandra&#x27;s producer, in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;.

Walken&#x27;s next major film role was opposite Dennis Hopper in &quot;True Romance&quot;, scripted by Quentin Tarantino. Walken later had a supporting role in Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; as a Vietnam veteran named Captain Koons.

Later in 1994, Walken starred in &quot;A Business Affair&quot;, a rare leading role for him in a romantic comedy. Walken manages to once again feature his trademark dancing scene as he performs the tango. In 1995, he appeared in &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, &quot;Wild Side&quot;, &quot;The Prophecy&quot; and the modern vampire flick &quot;The Addiction&quot;, which was his second collaboration with director Abel Ferrara and writer Nicholas St. John. He also appeared in &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, which starred Johnny Depp, and an arthouse film by David Salle titled &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;. Also in 1995, Walken acted in &quot;Him&quot;, the first play written by Walken, and about his idol Elvis in the afterlife, featured in the New York Shakespeare Festival. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a somewhat positive review of his &quot;most cheering and refreshingly absurd invention&quot; of retelling Elvis&#x27; death as a disappearing act that enabled Elvis to flee to Morocco for a sex change to become &quot;her&quot; in a &quot;woozily conceived, fantastical new play...in the sharpness and wit of writing and in the performances by Mr. Walken and Mr. Heyman.&quot; Walken made an appearance in the music video for Skid Row&#x27;s &quot;Breakin&#x27; Down&quot;.

In the 1996 film &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, Walken plays a sadistic gangster named Hickey. That year, he played a prominent role in the video game &quot;Ripper&quot;, portraying Detective Vince Magnotta. &quot;Ripper&quot; made extensive use of real-time recorded scenes and a wide cast of celebrities in an interactive film. In 1996 Walken also appeared in the Italian film &quot;Celluloide&quot; as US Officer Rod Geiger and played the role of Ray in the Abel Ferrara crime-drama film &quot;The Funeral&quot;. In 1997, Walken starred in the comedy films &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and had a minor role in the film &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;. He also appeared in the drama/thriller film &quot;Suicide Kings&quot;, which was also filled with suspense and humor.

In 1998, Walken played an influential gay New York theater critic in John Turturro&#x27;s film &quot;Illuminata&quot;. The same year he voiced Colonel/General Cutter in the animated film &quot;Antz&quot;.

In 1999, he played James Houston in &quot;Vendetta&quot;, an HBO original film based on the March 14, 1891 New Orleans lynchings. In the same year, Walken appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; portraying Calvin Webber, a brilliant but eccentric Caltech nuclear physicist whose fears of a nuclear war lead him to build an enormous fallout shelter beneath his suburban home. The same year, he appeared as the Headless Horseman in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. He also appeared in &quot;Kiss Toledo Goodbye&quot; with Michael Rapaport and Nancy Allen.

===2000s===

In 2000, Walken was cast as the lead, along with Blair Brown, in &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s The Dead&quot; on Broadway. A &quot;play with music&quot;, &quot;The Dead&quot; featured music by Shaun Davey, conducted by Charles Prince, with music coordination and percussion by Tom Partington. &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s The Dead&quot; won a Tony Award that year for Best Book for a Musical.

Walken had a music video performance in 2001 with Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;. Directed by Spike Jonze, it won six MTV awards in 2001 and—in a list of the top 100 videos of all time compiled from a survey of musicians, directors and music industry figures conducted by UK music TV channel VH1—won Best Video of All Time in April 2002. In the video, Walken dances and flies around the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Los Angeles; Walken also helped choreograph the dance. Also in 2001, Walken played a gangster who was in the witness protection program in the David Spade comedy &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; and an eccentric film director in &quot;America&#x27;s Sweethearts&quot;. Also in 2001, Walken played Lieutenant Macduff in &quot;Scotland, PA&quot;, a loose film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

In 2002 Walken played Mike in the film &quot;Poolhall Junkies&quot; and played Frank Abagnale Sr. in &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, which is inspired by the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a con artist who passed himself off as several identities and forged millions of dollars&#x27; worth of checks. His portrayal earned him a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Walken also had a part in the 2003 action comedy film &quot;The Rundown&quot;, starring Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson and Seann William Scott, in which he plays a ruthless despot. He was nominated for a Razzie (Worst Supporting Actor) in 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Country Bears&quot;
and in two 2003 films, &quot;Gigli&quot; and &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot;.
Walken also starred in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Envy&quot;, in which he plays J-Man, a crazy guy who helps Ben Stiller&#x27;s character and in his starring role in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Around the Bend&quot; he again has a dancing scene as he portrays an absentee father who has fled prison to reunite with his father, his son and the grandson he never knew before dying. Walken played the role of Paul Rayburn in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, where, when speaking about the imminent destructive actions of John Creasy (Denzel Washington), his character states: &quot;A man can be an artist... in anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasy&#x27;s art is death. He&#x27;s about to paint his masterpiece.&quot; Also in 2004, Walken played Mike in the film &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;.

In 2005, he played Mark Heiss in the film &quot;Domino&quot; and the role of Secretary Cleary in the film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;. In 2006, he played Morty, a sympathetic inventor who is more than meets the eye, in the comedy/drama &quot;Click&quot; and also appeared in &quot;Man of the Year&quot; with Robin Williams and Lewis Black. He co-starred in the 2007 film adaptation &quot;Hairspray&quot;, wherein he is seen singing and dancing in a romantic duet with John Travolta and portrayed the eccentric but cruel crime lord and Ping-Pong enthusiast Feng in the 2007 comedy action film &quot;Balls of Fury&quot; opposite Dan Fogler. Walken was in the film &quot;Five Dollars a Day&quot; (2008), in which he plays a con man proud of living like a king on $5 a day. &quot;The Maiden Heist&quot;, a comedy co-starring Morgan Freeman, William H. Macy and Walken about security guards in an art museum, debuted at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2009.

Walken also starred in Universal Studios Florida&#x27;s &quot;Disaster!&quot; theme park attraction, which opened in 2008 and closed in 2015. He portrayed Frank Kincaid, the fictional CEO of &quot;Disaster Studios&quot; who encouraged guests to be extras in his latest film. In the attraction&#x27;s pre-show, Walken was projected on a clear screen, much like a life-size hologram and interacted with the live-action talent.

===2010s===
Walken returned to Broadway in Martin McDonagh&#x27;s play &quot;A Behanding in Spokane&quot; in 2010 and received a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.
He had a small voice role in NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;, in the &quot;Audition Day&quot; episode. In 2011, he played the role of Jewish-American loan shark Alex &quot;Shondor&quot; Birns in the film based on the life of gangster Danny Greene, &quot;Kill the Irishman&quot;. In 2012, Walken reunited with McDonagh for the British-American crime comedy film &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; and also played the founder and leader of a string quartet in &quot;A Late Quartet&quot;.

Walken costarred with Al Pacino and Alan Arkin in the film &quot;Stand Up Guys&quot;, a story about aging gangsters out on the town for one last hoorah. He also appeared in &quot;The Power of Few&quot;. In 2012, Walken was selected as a &quot;GQ&quot; Man of the Year. In 2013, Walken became the protagonist in the campaign &quot;Made From Cool&quot; by Jack &amp; Jones. In 2014, he appeared in &quot;Turks &amp; Caicos&quot;. Walken appears as Gyp DeCarlo in the 2014 film &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;. In 2014, Walken played Captain Hook in the NBC production &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot; In 2015, Walken starred in the film &quot;When I Live My Life Over Again&quot; and played the role of Clem for the second time in the David Spade comedy &quot;Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser&quot;. In 2016, he voiced King Louie in the CGI-live action adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, directed by Jon Favreau. He also recorded a cover of Louie&#x27;s song &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot;, which he sings in the film as well as on the soundtrack. Also that year, he appeared in Dexter Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot; and Barry Sonnenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Nine Lives&quot;. In 2017, Walken replaced Bill Irwin in the role of Walter Tinkler in the critically panned &quot;Father Figures&quot;. The following year, he played Myron in the Netflix film &quot;Irreplaceable You&quot;.

===2020s===
In 2021, Walken appeared as Frank in the BBC One/Amazon Prime Video comedy &quot;The Outlaws&quot;. and in the second series broadcast on BBC1 in 2022.

In 2022, he had a supporting role as Burt Goodman, the severed chief of the Optics and Design division in the Apple TV+ series &quot;Severance&quot;. For his performance, he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Walken next portrayed Emperor Shaddam IV in the 2024 film, &quot;&quot;. The film received universal critical acclaim and &quot;SlashFilm&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a treat to watch Walken work — he shows up, delivers his ominous lines with a whisper, and wipes the floor with anyone he&#x27;s acting against. Show &#x27;em how it&#x27;s done, Christopher Walken.&quot;

==Legacy and popularity==
Described as &quot;diverse and eccentric&quot; and &quot;one of the most respected actors of his generation&quot;, Walken has a long-established cult following among film fans. He is known for his versatility and was named as one of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time&quot;. Once dubbed a &quot;cultural phenomenon&quot;, he has portrayed several iconic film characters including Johnny Smith in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, Max Shreck in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and Max Zorin in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, and was also considered for the role of Han Solo in &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. His Oscar-winning performance in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was ranked as the 88th greatest film performance of all time by &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine and his performance in &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; made it into &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances that should have won Oscars but didn&#x27;t.&quot; Sometimes regarded as &quot;one of the kings of cameos&quot;, Walken has made several cameo appearances or appeared in a single scene of films including as Captain Koons in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Duane in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, Hessian Horseman in &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and Don Vincenzo in &quot;True Romance&quot;. Writer and director Quentin Tarantino declared that Walken&#x27;s involvement in &quot;True Romance&quot;″s &quot;Sicilian scene&quot; was one of the proudest moments in his career.

Benicio del Toro cited Walken as an influence and stated that the best advice he had ever been given regarding acting came from him: &quot;When you&#x27;re in a scene and you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re gonna do, don&#x27;t do anything.&quot; Kat Dennings called him her favorite actor and said that he was the reason that she wanted to be an actress. Johnny Depp once said one of the main reasons he starred in &quot;Nick of Time&quot; was wanting to work with Walken. Jeffrey Wright, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Bradley Cooper, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mads Mikkelsen are among actors who spoke about their admiration for Walken. Prominent film critic Roger Ebert, who was particularly impressed by his villain and anti-hero portrayals, once stated, &quot;when he is given the right role, there is nobody to touch him for his chilling ability to move between easy charm and pure evil&quot; and called him &quot;one of the few undeniably charismatic male villains.&quot;

Walken is noted for refusing film roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is too busy to accept. He regards each role as a learning experience. A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the film &quot;Go Go Tales&quot; (2007). According to film director Abel Ferrara, the character was originally written for Walken, who &quot;didn&#x27;t want to do it&quot;. The role was then given to Walken&#x27;s &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; (1998) co-star Willem Dafoe.

Walken&#x27;s voice and speaking style have been compared to other entertainment figures with voices that create &quot;a pleasing (or at least entertaining) aural experience,&quot; such as William Shatner and Garrison Keillor. Walken believes that the source of his speech stems from growing up with immigrant neighbors who came from everywhere, stating, &quot;The neighborhood itself, you didn&#x27;t hear a lot of English. Lots of Greek, Italian, Polish, German, Yiddish. I think I grew up listening to people who spoke English in a kind of broken way. I think maybe I talked that way.&quot; Walken inspired the stage show, &quot;All About Walken: The Impersonators of Christopher Walken&quot;, created by actor/comedian Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan in Hollywood in 2006.

In 2003, he was voted Number 34 in Channel 4&#x27;s countdown of the 100 greatest movie stars of all time.

===Appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Walken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) seven times.

One of Walken&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; performances was a spoof of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, featuring a recording session of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) the Reaper&quot;. In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the real Bruce Dickinson, lead singer for Iron Maiden), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting &quot;More Cowbell&quot; into the song. The phrase &quot;I gotta have more cowbell&quot; has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who suggested the cowbell on the original BÖC recording is David Lucas.

Walken appeared in one of Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch&#x27;s &quot;The Luvahs&quot; skits. His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs and she is subjected to learning the history that Walken&#x27;s character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror (&quot;She was willing to accept her lover&#x27;s body in places no one had ever trespassed... specifically, the ear canal&quot;).

Walken spoofed his starring role from &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983) in a sketch titled &quot;Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic&quot; (1992). In the film, Walken&#x27;s character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future events but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: &quot;You&#x27;re going to get an ice cream headache. It&#x27;s going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.&quot;).

His character in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was parodied in a sketch titled &quot;Lease with an Option to Kill&quot;, in which he reprised his role as Max Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other Bond villains (Blofeld&#x27;s cat and suit, Emilio Largo&#x27;s eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn&#x27;t fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin &quot;a good deal&quot; on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.

He performed a song and dance rendition of the Irving Berlin standard, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music and Dance&quot;. Finally, there was the &quot;Colonel Angus&quot; sketch, laden with ribald double entendres, in which Walken played a dishonored Confederate officer.

Until 2003, Walken had a recurring &quot;SNL&quot; sketch called &quot;The Continental&quot;, in which Walken played a &quot;suave ladies&#x27; man&quot; who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a two-way mirror when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In &quot;The Continental&quot;, only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.

The April 5, 2008 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; show was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a &quot;Continental&quot; sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled &quot;Walken Family Reunion&quot;, which spoofs many of Walken&#x27;s idiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken family reunion, where all of Christopher&#x27;s relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns and sport his trademark pompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher&#x27;s cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley&#x27;s brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John&#x27;s son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries a doll that also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom &quot;flamboyance&quot; means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a cosmo glass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think that &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; was hilarious and who are hosts of a Nigerian foreign exchange student named Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he &quot;talks like a normal teenaged American boy&quot;. The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott&#x27;s teenaged attitude: &quot;I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you&#x27;re the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs.&quot; Scott&#x27;s response: &quot;Wow! It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re lookin&#x27; right into my noggin!&quot; (Will Forte also appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)

In September 2004, &quot;SNL&quot; released a DVD titled &quot;The Best of Christopher Walken&quot; through Lionsgate.

Walken returned to the show for the first time in 15 years on October 28, 2023, in a cameo role as the &quot;Spirit of Halloween&quot; in which he gave advice to President Joe Biden (Mikey Day). Walken also introduced the musical guest Foo Fighters instead of host Nate Bargatze. Foo Fighters were the musical guest during his 2003 episode, during which Dave Grohl pranked Walken into speaking with the emphasis on &quot;Fighters&quot; instead of &quot;Foo&quot;. Clips of the introduction later became an internet meme and Walken pronounced the band&#x27;s name correctly in 2023.

===Presidential candidacy hoax===
Walken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for President of the United States. Some believed it was authentic, until Walken&#x27;s publicist dismissed the claims. When asked about the hoax in a September 2006 interview with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Walken said he was amused and when asked to come up with a campaign slogan, he replied, &quot;What the Heck&quot; and &quot;No More Zoos!&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1963, Walken met Georgianne Thon during a tour of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. They married in January 1969. The couple have no children, and Walken has stated in interviews that not having children is one of the reasons that he has had such a prolific career. 

Walken discussed his feelings on sexuality in a 1973 interview with &quot;After Dark&quot; while promoting his appearance as Bassanio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. &quot;I suppose I think of the man I&#x27;m playing as bisexual, and I suppose that&#x27;s how I think of myself too. I&#x27;d hate to think that I was harnessed to heterosexuality. I mean, my life is heterosexual, but I like to think that my head is bisexual, and I think it&#x27;s a good idea for everybody to start getting used to that notion, because that way one becomes aware of a lot more things.&quot;

On November 29, 1981, Walken was with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner on Wagner&#x27;s yacht the night Wood went missing and ultimately was found dead by drowning. Walken was not considered a suspect by authorities. The case was re-opened in November 2011; Walken was once again not considered a suspect and he fully co-operated with authorities conducting the investigation. 

In an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Walken said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have technology. I only have a satellite dish on my house. So I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Severance&quot; on DVDs that they&#x27;re good enough to send me. I don&#x27;t have a cell phone. I&#x27;ve never emailed or, what do you call it, Twittered.&quot;

<doc id="167792" wikidata="Q36857" url="?curid=167792" title="Oviduct">
<text>The oviduct in vertebrates is the passageway from an ovary. In human females, this is more usually known as the fallopian tube. The eggs travel along the oviduct. These eggs will either be fertilized by spermatozoa to become a zygote, or will degenerate in the body. Normally, these are paired structures, but in birds and some cartilaginous fishes, one or the other side fails to develop (together with the corresponding ovary), and only one functional oviduct can be found. 

Except in teleosts, the oviduct is not directly in contact with the ovary. Instead, the most anterior portion ends in a funnel-shaped structure called the infundibulum, which collects eggs as they are released by the ovary into the body cavity.

The only female vertebrates to lack oviducts are the jawless fishes. In these species, the single fused ovary releases eggs directly into the body cavity. The fish eventually extrudes the eggs through a small genital pore towards the rear of the body.

==Fish and amphibians==
In amphibians and lungfishes, the oviduct is a simple ciliated tube, lined with mucus-secreting glands that produce the jelly that surrounds the ovum. In all other vertebrates, there is normally some degree of specialisation of the tube, depending on the type of eggs produced.

In cartilaginous fishes, the middle portion of the tube develops as a shell gland. The first portion of this gland secretes the egg white, while the lower portion secretes a hard, horny, capsule to protect the developing egg. Distal to the shell gland is the ovisac, a distended region in which eggs are stored prior to laying. In ovoviviparous species, the egg remains within the ovisac until it hatches. Some cartilaginous fishes, however, are truly viviparous, giving birth to live young, and producing no egg shell. In these forms, the ovisac nurtures the developing embryo, often with the aid of vascular outgrowths similar to, but much simpler than, the mammalian placenta.

The most primitive ray finned fishes retain the simple structure also found in lungfishes. In teleosts, folds of peritoneum enclose the ovary and upper part of the tube, fusing them into a single structure. The ovary itself is hollow, with eggs being shed into the central cavity, and thence passing directly into the oviduct. The enclosed nature of the female reproductive system in these fishes makes it impossible for eggs to escape into the general body cavity; a necessary development, given that thousands or even millions of eggs may be released in a single spawning.

==Amniotes==
In amniotes – reptiles, birds, and mammals – the egg is enclosed with an outer layer, or amnion, which has led to further development of the oviduct. In reptiles, birds, and monotremes, the main part of the oviduct is a muscular tube, capable of considerable distension to transport the large eggs that are produced. This part of the oviduct is lined with glands that secrete the components of the egg white. The lower portion of the oviduct, or uterus, has a thicker layer of smooth muscle and contains the glands that secrete the egg shell. 

In marsupials and placental mammals, the uterus becomes lined by an endometrium, and is more developed than in egg-laying amniotes. In many placental mammals, the uteri of each side become partially or wholly fused into a single organ, although in marsupials they remain completely separate.

For birds, the oviduct is composed of:

# &quot;Infundibulum&quot; (formation of &quot;chalazae&quot;, place of fertilisation)
# &quot;Magnum&quot; (formation of egg white)
# Isthmus (formation of the shell membrane)
# &quot;Shell gland&quot; (formation of egg shell)
# &quot;Vaginal homologue&quot; (formation of cuticle)
(See matching numbers in the picture)

<text>The Freeman&#x27;s Journal, which was published continuously in Dublin from 1763 to 1924, was in the nineteenth century Ireland&#x27;s leading nationalist newspaper.

==History==
===Patriot journal===
It was founded in 1763 by Charles Lucas and was identified with radical 18th-century Protestant patriot politicians Henry Grattan and Henry Flood. This changed from 1784 when it passed to Francis Higgins (better known as the &quot;Sham Squire&quot;) and took a more pro-British and pro-administration view. In fact Francis Higgins is mentioned in the Secret Service Money Book as having betrayed Lord Edward FitzGerald. Higgins was paid £1,000 for information on FitzGerald&#x27;s capture.

===Voice of constitutional nationalism===
In the 19th century it became more nationalist in tone, particularly under the control and inspiration of Sir John Gray (1815–75).

&quot;The Journal&quot;, as it was widely known as, was the leading newspaper in Ireland throughout the 19th century. Contemporary sources record it being read to the largely illiterate population by priests and local teachers gathering in homes. It was mentioned in contemporary literature and was seen as symbolising Irish newspapers for most of its time. By the 1880s it had become the primary media supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). The weekend edition of the paper was known as The Weekly Freeman, which began featuring large format political cartoons in the 1870s.

It was challenged on all sides by rivals. On the nationalist side some preferred &quot;The Nation&quot; founded by Thomas Davis while others, including radical supporters of Parnell, read the &quot;United Irishman&quot;. The Anglo-Irish establishment in contrast read the historically Irish unionist &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. With the split in the IPP over Parnell&#x27;s relationship with Katharine O&#x27;Shea, its readership split too. While &quot;The Journal&quot; in September 1891 eventually went with the majority in opposing Parnell, a minority moved to read the &quot;Daily Irish Independent&quot;. It was also challenged from the turn of the century by William O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Irish People&quot; and the &quot;Cork Free Press&quot;. With Thomas Sexton becoming Chairman of the Board of Directors (1893–1911), the Journal languished under his spartanic management.

===Superseded by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;===
The collapse of the IPP in 1918, and the electoral success of Sinn Féin, saw a more radical nationalism appear that increasingly was out of step with the moderation of the Journal. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, the successor to the &quot;Daily Irish Independent&quot;, was more aggressively marketed. Just prior to the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in March 1922, the Freeman&#x27;s Journal printing machinery was destroyed by Anti-Treaty IRA men under Rory O&#x27;Connor for its support of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It did not resume publication until after the outbreak of civil war, when the Irish Free State re-asserted its authority over the country.

&quot;The Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; ceased publication in 1924, when it was merged with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. Until the 1990s, the Irish Independent included the words &#x27;Incorporating the Freeman&#x27;s Journal&#x27; in its mast-head over its editorials.

===Offices===
The newspaper&#x27;s head office was located at 4-6 Prince Street North until its destruction during the Easter Rising of 1916.

After its destruction, the newspaper refurbished buildings at 6-8 Townsend Street incorporating the former Dublin Coffee Palace however these were ultimately ransacked by anti-treaty forces in March 1922.

It also developed other alternative offices at 27 Westmoreland Street in 1917 while carrying out extensive renovations there in 1921-22.

==In fiction==
James Joyce drew on his recollection of his visits to the Freeman’s office in 1909 in his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. As the place of Leopold Bloom&#x27;s employment, the depiction of the paper&#x27;s offices in the Aeolus chapter has been deemed &quot;an authentic portrait&quot; at a time when the newspaper was &quot;moribund – the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; having supplanted it as the most popular daily newspaper in Dublin.&quot; Its decline is reflected in &quot;the anxious question posed in Aeolus about the Freeman’s editor, WH Brayden: &#x27;But can he save the circulation?&#x27;&quot;

<text>The National Mall is a landscaped park near the downtown area of Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States. It contains and borders a number of museums of the Smithsonian Institution, art galleries, cultural institutions, and various memorials, sculptures, and statues. It is administered by the National Park Service (NPS) of the United States Department of the Interior as part of the National Mall and Memorial Parks unit of the National Park System. The park receives approximately 24 million visitors each year. Designed by Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, the &quot;Grand Avenue&quot; or Mall was to be a democratic and egalitarian space—unlike palace gardens, such as those at Versailles in France, that were paid for by the people but reserved for the use of a privileged few.

The core area of the National Mall extends between the United States Capitol grounds to the east and the Washington Monument to the west and is lined to the north and south by several museums and federal office buildings. The term &quot;National Mall&quot; may also include areas that are also officially part of neighboring West Potomac Park to the south and west and Constitution Gardens to the north, extending to the Lincoln Memorial on the west and Jefferson Memorial to the south.

==Landmarks, museums, and other features==

===Boundaries===
In its 1981 National Register of Historic Places nomination form, the NPS defined the boundaries of the National Mall (proper) as Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues on the north, 1st Street NW on the east, Independence and Maryland Avenues on the south, and 14th Street NW on the west, with the exception of the section of land bordered by Jefferson Drive on the north, Independence Avenue on the south, and by 12th and 14th Streets respectively on the east and west, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers and which contains the Jamie L. Whitten Building (U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building). The 2012–2016 National Park Service index describes the National Mall as being a landscaped park that extends from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, defined as a principal axis in the L&#x27;Enfant Plan for the city of Washington.

However, a 2010 NPS plan for the Mall contains maps that show the Mall&#x27;s general area to be larger. A document within the plan describes this area as &quot;the grounds of the U.S. Capitol west to the Potomac River, and from the Thomas Jefferson Memorial north to Constitution Avenue&quot;. A map within the plan entitled &quot;National Mall Areas&quot; illustrates &quot;The Mall&quot; as being the green space bounded on the east by 3rd Street, on the west by 14th Street, on the north by Jefferson Drive, NW, and on the south by Madison Drive, SW. A Central Intelligence Agency map shows the Mall as occupying the space between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol.

In 2011, the 112th United States Congress enacted the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012, which transferred to the Architect of the Capitol the NPS &quot;property which is bounded on the north by Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, on the east by First Street Northwest and First Street Southwest, on the south by Maryland Avenue Southwest, and on the west by Third Street Southwest and Third Street Northwest&quot;. This act removed Union Square (the area containing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and the Capitol Reflecting Pool) from NPS jurisdiction.

==Purposes==
The National Park Service states that the purposes of the National Mall are to:

* Provide a monumental, dignified, and symbolic setting for the governmental structures, museums, and national memorials as first delineated by the L&#x27;Enfant plan and further outlined in the McMillan plan.
* Maintain and provide for the use of the National Mall with its public promenades as a completed work of civic art, a designed historic landscape providing extraordinary vistas to symbols of the nation.
* Maintain National Mall commemorative works (memorials, monuments, statues, sites, gardens) that honor presidential legacies, distinguished public figures, ideas, events, and military and civilian sacrifices and contributions.
* Forever retain the West Potomac Park section of the National Mall as a public park for the recreation and enjoyment of the people.
* Maintain the National Mall in the heart of the nation&#x27;s capital as a stage for national events and a preeminent national civic space for public gatherings because it is here that the constitutional rights of speech and peaceful assembly find their fullest expression.
* Maintain the National Mall as an area free of commercial advertising while retaining the ability to recognize sponsors.&quot;

==History==
===L&#x27;Enfant City Plan===
In his 1791 plan for the future city of Washington, D.C., Pierre (Peter) Charles L&#x27;Enfant envisioned a garden-lined &quot;grand avenue&quot; approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length
and wide, in an area that would lie between the Congress House (now the United States Capitol) and an equestrian statue of George Washington. The statue would be placed directly south of the President&#x27;s House (now the White House) and directly west of the Congress House (see L&#x27;Enfant Plan) on the site of the Washington Monument. The grand avenue was to be flanked by gardens and spacious accommodations for foreign ministers.

Mathew Carey&#x27;s 1802 map is reported to be the first to name the area west of the United States Capitol as the &quot;Mall&quot;. The name is derived from that of The Mall in London, which during the 1700s was a fashionable promenade near Buckingham Palace upon which the city&#x27;s elite strolled.

The Washington City Canal, completed in 1815 in accordance with the L&#x27;Enfant Plan, travelled along the former course of Tiber Creek to the Potomac River along B Street Northwest (NW) (now Constitution Avenue NW) and south along the base of a hill containing the Congress House, thus defining the northern and eastern boundaries of the Mall. Being shallow and often obstructed by silt, the canal served only a limited role and became an open sewer that poured sediment and waste into the Potomac River&#x27;s flats and shipping channel. The portion of the canal that traveled near the Mall was covered over in 1871 for sanitary reasons.

Some consider a lockkeeper&#x27;s house constructed in 1837 near the western end of the Washington City Canal for an eastward extension of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal to be the oldest building still standing on the National Mall. The structure, which is located near the southwestern corner of 17th Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW, is west of the National Mall (proper).

The Smithsonian Institution Building (&quot;The Castle&quot;), constructed from 1847 to 1855, is the oldest building now present on the National Mall (proper). The Washington Monument, whose construction began in 1848 and reached completion in 1888, stands near the planned site of its namesake&#x27;s equestrian statue. The Jefferson Pier marks the planned site of the statue itself.
===Downing Plan: Mid-19th century===

During the early 1850s, architect and horticulturist Andrew Jackson Downing designed a landscape plan for the Mall. Over the next half century, federal agencies developed several naturalistic parks within the Mall in accordance with Downing&#x27;s plan. Two such areas were Henry Park and Seaton Park.

During that period, the Mall was subdivided into several areas between B Street Northwest (NW) (now Constitution Avenue NW) and B Street Southwest (SW) (now Independence Avenue SW):
* The Public Grounds between 2nd and 6th Streets NW and SW
* The Armory Grounds between 6th and 7th Streets NW and SW
* The Smithsonian Grounds between 7th and 12th Streets NW and SW
* The Agricultural Grounds between 12th and 14th Streets NW and SW
* The Monument Grounds between 14th and 17th Streets NW and SW

In 1856, the Armory (No. 27 on the 1893 map of the Mall) was built at the intersection of B Street SW and 6th Street SW on the Armory Grounds. In 1862, during the American Civil War, the building was converted to a military hospital known as Armory Square Hospital to house Union Army casualties. After the war ended, the Armory building became the home of the United States Fish Commission.

The United States Congress established the United States Department of Agriculture in 1862 during the Civil War. Designed by Adolf Cluss and Joseph von Kammerhueber, the United States Department of Agriculture Building (No. 25 on the map), was constructed in 1867–1868 north of B Street SW within a 35-acre site on the Mall.

After the Civil War ended, the Department of Agriculture started growing experimental crops and demonstration gardens on the Mall. These gardens extended from the department&#x27;s building near the south side of the Mall to B Street NW (the northern boundary of the Mall). The building was razed in 1930. In addition, greenhouses belonging to the U.S. Botanical Garden (No. 16 on the map) appeared near the east end of the Mall between the Washington City Canal and the Capitol (later between 1st and 3rd Streets NW and SW).

Originating during the early 1800s as a collection of market stalls immediately north of the Washington City Canal and the Mall, the Center Market (No. 19 on the map), which Adolf Cluss also designed, opened in 1872 soon after the canal closed. Located on the north side of Constitution Avenue NW, the National Archives now occupies the Market&#x27;s site.

During that period, railroad tracks crossed the Mall on 6th Street, west of the Capitol. Near the tracks, several structures were built over the years. The Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station (B on the map) rose in 1873 on the north side of the Mall at the southwest corner of 6th Street and B Street NW (now the site of the west building of the National Gallery of Art).

In 1881, the Arts and Industries Building (No. 34 on the map), known originally as the National Museum Building, opened on the north side of B Street SW to the east of &quot;The Castle&quot;. Designed in 1876 by Adolf Cluss and his associates, the building is the second oldest still standing on the National Mall (proper).

In 1887, the Army Medical Museum and Library, which Adolf Cluss designed in 1885, opened on the Mall at northwest corner of B Street SW and 7th Street SW. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Hirshhorn Museum now occupies the site of the building, which was demolished in 1968.

Meanwhile, in order to clean up the Potomac Flats and to make the Potomac River more navigable, in 1882 Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the river. The Corps used the sediment removed from the shipping channel to fill in the flats. The work started in 1882 and continued until 1911, creating the Tidal Basin and 628 new acres of land. Part of the new land, which became West Potomac Park, expanded the Mall southward and westward (see 1893 map above).

===McMillan Plan: Early 20th century===

In 1902, the McMillan Commission&#x27;s plan, which was partially inspired by the City Beautiful Movement and which purportedly extended Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan, called for a radical redesign of the Mall that would replace its greenhouses, gardens, trees, and commercial/industrial facilities with an open space. The plan differed from L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s by replacing the wide &quot;grand avenue&quot; with a wide vista containing a long and broad expanse of grass.

Four rows of American elm trees (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) planted fifty feet apart between two paths or streets would line each side of the vista. Buildings housing cultural and educational institutions constructed in the Beaux-Arts style would line each outer path or street, on the opposite side of the path or street from the elms.

In subsequent years, the vision of the McMillan plan was generally followed with the planting of American elms and the layout of four boulevards down the Mall, two on either side of a wide lawn. In accordance with a plan that it completed in 1976, the NPS converted the two innermost boulevards (Washington Drive NW and Adams Drive SW) into gravel walking paths. The two outermost boulevards (Madison Drive NW and Jefferson Drive SW) remain paved and open to vehicular traffic.

===Temporary war buildings===
During World Wars I and II, the federal government constructed a number of temporary buildings (tempos) on the Mall, disrupting the area&#x27;s planned layout. Most of these buildings were in two clusters: one near the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and the other on the National Mall (proper) in the vicinity of 4th through 7th Streets NW and SW.

====World War I====

The United States entered World War I in April 1917. By 1918, a row of tempos designated from north to south as Buildings A, B, and C had stretched across the Mall along the east side of the former railroad route on 6th Street. The smokestacks of the buildings&#x27; centrally-located power plant were set apart to preserve the view of the Washington Monument from the Capitol building. Soon afterwards, the government constructed Buildings D, E and F to the east and west of the row.

Around 1921 (when the United States and Germany signed the U.S.–German Peace Treaty, thus formally ending the war between the two nations), the government demolished Buildings A and B. The remaining tempos held offices of several agencies belonging to the Agriculture, Commerce, Treasury and War Departments for a number of years after the war ended.

The government then slowly dismantled most of the tempos that had remained within the Mall (proper), removing the power plant and nearby buildings by 1936. Among those removed was Building C, which the government demolished between 1933 and 1936.

By 1937, the government had removed all of the World War I tempos that had been within the National Mall (proper) except for Building E, thus largely restoring the Mall&#x27;s central vista. However, another World War I tempo, which the government constructed south of the Mall in 1919 between 14th Street SW and the Tidal Basin as the Liberty Loan Building, remained standing in 2019 while housing the Treasury Department&#x27;s Bureau of the Fiscal Service.
In 1918, contractors for the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Yards and Docks constructed the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings along nearly a third of a mile of the south side of Constitution Avenue (then known as B Street), from 17th Street NW to 21st Street NW. Although the Navy intended the buildings to provide temporary quarters for the United States military during World War I, the reinforced concrete structures remained in place until 1970. After their demolition, much of their former sites became Constitution Gardens, which was dedicated in 1976.

====World War II====
During World War II, the government constructed a larger set of temporary buildings on the Mall in the area of the former World War I tempos, along the south side of Constitution Avenue between 12th and 14th Streets NW, on the west side of the Washington Monument grounds, along the entire length of the south side of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and between the Reflecting Pool and the Main Navy and Munition buildings on the Pool&#x27;s north side. Numbers identified new buildings built on the Monument grounds, while letters identified the remainder. The government also built dormitories, residence halls and facilities for dining and recreation south of the eastern half of the Mall and within the part of West Potomac Park that lay south of the Mall&#x27;s western half.

The government progressively demolished all of the World War II tempos beginning in 1964. After the government removed the Main Navy and Munitions buildings in 1970, much of their former sites became Constitution Gardens, which was dedicated in 1976.

===Later history===
The planting of American elm trees (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) on the National Mall following the McMillan Plan started in the 1930s between 3rd and 14th Streets at the same time that Dutch Elm Disease (DED) began to appear in the United States. Concern was expressed about the impact that DED could have on these trees.
DED first appeared on the Mall during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS has used a number of methods to control this fungal epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with DED-resistant American elm cultivars (see &quot;Ulmus americana&quot; cultivars). The NPS cloned one such cultivar (&#x27;Jefferson&#x27;) from a DED-resistant tree growing near a path on the Mall in front of the Freer Gallery of Art, near the Smithsonian Institution Building (&quot;The Castle&quot;).

The NPS has combated the disease&#x27;s local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (&quot;Scolytus multistriatus&quot;), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. Soil compaction and root damage by crowds and construction projects also adversely affect the elms.

On October 15, 1966, the NPS listed the National Mall on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1981, the NPS prepared a National Register nomination form that documented the Mall&#x27;s boundaries, features and historical significance.

From the 1970s to 1994, a fiberglass model of a triceratops named &quot;Uncle Beazley&quot; stood on the Mall in front of the National Museum of Natural History. The life-size statue, which is now located at the National Zoological Park (the National Zoo) in Northwest Washington, D.C., was donated to the Smithsonian Institution by the Sinclair Oil Corporation. The statue, which Louis Paul Jonas created for Sinclair&#x27;s DinoLand pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, was named after a dinosaur in Oliver Butterworth&#x27;s 1956 children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Enormous Egg&quot;, and the 1968 televised movie adaptation in which the statue appeared.

In 2003, the 108th United States Congress enacted the Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act. This Act prohibits the siting of new commemorative works and visitor centers in a designated reserve area within the cross-axis of the Mall.

In October 2013, a two-week federal government shutdown closed the National Mall and its museums and monuments. However, when a group of elderly veterans tried to enter the National World War II Memorial during the shutdown&#x27;s first day, the memorial&#x27;s barricades were removed. The NPS subsequently announced that the veterans had a legal right to be in the memorial and would not be barred in the future. During the shutdown&#x27;s second week, the NPS permitted an immigration rally and concert to take place on the Mall.

On December 8, 2016, the NPS listed on the National Register of Historic Places an increase in the National Mall Historic District&#x27;s boundary to encompass an area bounded by 3rd Street, NW/SW, Independence Avenue, SW, Raoul Wallenberg Place, SW, the CSX Railroad, the Potomac River, Constitution Avenue, NW, 17th Street, NW, the White House Grounds, and 15th Street, NW. The listing&#x27;s registration form, which contained 232 pages, described and illustrated the history and features of the historic district&#x27;s proposed expanded area.

==Demolished or moved structures==
* Washington City Canal, covered over by Constitution Avenue NW, 3rd Street NW, and SW and Canal Street SW (now Washington Street SW)
* Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, closed in 1907 when Washington Union Station opened
* United States Department of Agriculture Building, demolished in 1930
* Center Market, replaced in 1931 by the National Archives Building
* Armory Square Hospital/Armory, replaced in 1976 by the National Air and Space Museum
* Army Medical Museum and Library, demolished in 1968; replaced by the Hirshhorn Museum
* Temporary Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, built in 1918, demolished in 1970; replaced by Constitution Gardens
* Uncle Beazley, moved in 1994 to the National Zoo

==Usage==
In combination with the other attractions in the Washington Metropolitan Area, the National Mall makes the nation&#x27;s capital city one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. It has several other uses in addition to serving as a tourist focal point.

===Protests and rallies===

The National Mall&#x27;s status as a vast, open expanse at the heart of the capital makes it an attractive site for protests and rallies of all types. One notable example was the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a political rally during the Civil Rights Movement, at which Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his speech &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;.

The largest officially recorded rally was the Vietnam War Moratorium Rally on October 15, 1969. However, in 1995, the NPS issued a crowd estimate for the Million Man March with which an organizer of the event, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, disagreed. The next year, a committee of the 104th United States Congress provided no funds for NPS crowd-counting activities in Washington, D.C., when it prepared legislation making 1997 appropriations for the U.S. Department of the Interior.

As a result, the NPS has not provided any official crowd size estimates for Mall events since 1995. The absence of such an official estimate fueled a political controversy following the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017 (see: Inauguration of Donald Trump crowd size).

On April 25, 2004, the March for Women&#x27;s Lives filled the Mall. On January 27, 2007, tens of thousands of protesters opposed to the Iraq War converged on the Mall (see: January 27, 2007 anti-war protest), drawing comparisons by participants to the Vietnam War protest.

On June 12, 2018, the National Hockey League&#x27;s Washington Capitals staged a rally on the Mall after parading through the city to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship victory. Tens of thousands of fans reportedly joined the beer-soaked event.

===Presidential inaugurations===

The American presidential inauguration is a momentous occasion that symbolizes the peaceful transfer of power and the beginning of a new chapter in the nation&#x27;s leadership. Held at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., the inauguration draws people from across the country and the world to witness this historic event. The Capitol, with its majestic dome and iconic architecture, serves as the backdrop for the ceremony. The Mall, stretching from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, becomes the gathering place for thousands of spectators who come to witness the swearing-in of the President and Vice President of the United States.

Days leading up to the inauguration are filled with anticipation and preparation. Security measures are heightened to ensure the safety of attendees and dignitaries. The National Mall, usually bustling with tourists and locals, transforms into a sea of spectators, eagerly awaiting the moment when the President-elect takes the oath of office. During presidential inaugurations, people without official tickets gather at the National Mall. Normally, the Mall between 7th and 14th Streets NW is used as a staging ground for the parade.

On December 4, 2008, the Presidential Inaugural Committee (see: United States presidential inauguration organizers) announced, &quot;for the first time, the entire length of the National Mall will be opened to the public so that more people than ever before will be able to witness the swearing-in of the president from a vantage point in sight of the Capitol.&quot; The committee made this arrangement because of the massive attendance – projected to be as many as 2 million people – that it expected for the first inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009.

Despite the arrangement, a throng of people seeking access to the event climbed and then removed temporary protective fences around the Smithsonian&#x27;s Mary Livingston Ripley Garden, six blocks from the site at which Obama took his inaugural oath. Hordes then trampled the garden&#x27;s vegetation and elevated plant beds when entering and leaving the event. Others could not find a way to enter the Mall in time to view the ceremony. More than a thousand people with purple tickets missed the event while being stranded in the I-395 Third Street Tunnel beneath the Mall after police directed them there (see Purple Tunnel of Doom). Terrance W. Gainer, the Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate, stated that it appeared that the stranding had occurred because there were more bulky people in coats than the event&#x27;s purple section could accommodate. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies subsequently announced that ticket holders that were not admitted would receive copies of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos of Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, and a color print of the ceremony.

===Other events and recreational activities===
The National Mall has long served as a spot for jogging, picnics, and light recreation for the Washington population. The Smithsonian Carousel, located on the Mall in front of the Arts and Industry Building, is a popular attraction. The Allan Herschell Company built the carousel, which arrived at Gwynn Oak Park near Baltimore, Maryland, in 1947. The carousel was moved to the Mall in 1981 and now operates seasonally.

====Annual events====
A number of large free events recur annually on the Mall. A kite festival, formerly named the &quot;Smithsonian Kite Festival&quot; and now named the &quot;Blossom Kite Festival&quot;, usually takes place each year on the Washington Monument grounds during the last weekend of March as part of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. The event&#x27;s organizers cancelled the 2020 kite festival, which they had earlier scheduled to take place on the Washington Monument grounds on Saturday, March 28, because of concerns related the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

An Earth Day celebration often takes place on the Mall around April 22. A week-long series of rallies, exhibits, observances and performances occurred on the Mall from April 17 to April 25, 2010, to commemorate Earth Day&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The final day&#x27;s events featured performances by Sting, Mavis Staples, the Roots, John Legend and others.
The 2012 Earth Day rally, which featured music, entertainment, celebrity speakers and environmental activities, took place on the Mall during a rainy day on Sunday, April 22. Cheap Trick, Dave Mason, Kicking Daisies, Sting, John Legend, Joss Stone, the Roots, Mavis Staples, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Weir and the Explorers Club performed and Congressmen John Dingell and Edward Markey spoke.

In 2013, an &quot;Earth Month&quot; at Washington Union Station replaced the Mall&#x27;s Earth Day event. On April 19, 2015, a &quot;Global Citizen&quot; Earth Day concert featured performances on the Washington Monument grounds by Usher, My Morning Jacket, Mary J. Blige, Train and No Doubt.

The National Symphony Orchestra presents each year its &quot;National Memorial Day Concert&quot; on the west lawn of the United States Capitol during the evening of the Sunday before Memorial Day (the last Monday of May). The National Gallery of Art hosts a &quot;Jazz in the Garden&quot; series each year in the museum&#x27;s Sculpture Garden on Friday evenings from late May through August.

Components of the United States Navy Band, the United States Air Force Band, the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Band perform on the west steps of the United States Capitol on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings, respectively, during June, July and August. The Marine Band repeats each Wednesday Capitol performance on the following evening (Thursday) at the Sylvan Theater on the grounds of the Washington Monument. Components of U.S. military bands also provide evening concerts at the World War II Memorial from May through August.

The Smithsonian Folklife Festival takes place on the Mall each year for two weeks around Independence Day (July 4). On that holiday, the &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; concert takes place in the late afternoon and early evening on the west lawn of the Capitol. This and other Independence Day celebrations on and near the Mall end after sunset with a fireworks display between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.

The National Symphony Orchestra presents each year its &quot;Labor Day Capitol Concert&quot; on the west lawn of the United States Capitol during the evening of the Sunday before Labor Day (the first Monday of September).

====Other events====

On April 9, 1939, singer Marian Anderson gave an Easter Sunday concert at the Lincoln Memorial after the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) denied a request by Howard University for her to give an Easter performance at the DAR&#x27;s nearby racially segregated Constitution Hall (see: Marian Anderson&#x27;s 1939 Lincoln Memorial concert). The event, which 75,000 people attended, occurred after President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave his assent for the performance.

The 1976 United States Bicentennial celebration provided the motivation for planning to accommodate large numbers of expected visitors to the National Mall. A number of major memorials were added to the Mall throughout that period. On May 21, 1976, Constitution Gardens was dedicated. On July 1, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum opened. On July 4, the Bicentennial fireworks display on the Mall attracted one million viewers, making it second only to the 1965 presidential inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson as the largest event in the Mall&#x27;s history up to that time.

On Sunday, October 9, 1979, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass on the National Mall during a visit to Washington. The celebration took place after an appellate court denied a motion for an injunction that atheists Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair and Jon Garth Murray had filed to prevent the event from occurring.

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and the Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts on the Mall, attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups.

Watt said that &quot;rock bands&quot; that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted &quot;the wrong element&quot;, who would mug individuals and families attending any similar events in the future. Watt then announced that Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton, a friend and supporter of President Ronald Reagan and a contributor to Republican Party political campaigns, would perform at the Mall&#x27;s 1983 Independence Day celebration.

During the ensuing uproar, Rob Grill, lead singer of the Grass Roots, stated that he felt &quot;highly insulted&quot; by Watt&#x27;s remarks, which he called &quot;nothing but un-American&quot;. The Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, &quot;obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element&quot;. Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, &quot;They&#x27;re my friends and I like their music&quot;.

On July 3, 1983, thousands attended a heavily policed &quot;Rock Against Reagan&quot; concert that the hardcore punk rock band, Dead Kennedys, performed on the Mall in response to Watt&#x27;s action. When Newton entered an Independence Day stage on the Mall on July 4, members of his audience booed. Watt apologized to the Beach Boys, First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized for Watt, and in 1984 the Beach Boys gave an Independence Day concert on the Mall to an audience of 750,000 people.
On September 4, 2003, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, Aretha Franklin, Aerosmith and others performed in a nationally televised &quot;NFL Kickoff Live from the National Mall Presented by Pepsi Vanilla&quot; (see: Pre-game concerts for National Football League kickoff game). Preceded by a three-day National Football League &quot;interactive Super Bowl theme park&quot;, the event had primarily commercial purposes, unlike earlier major activities on the Mall. Three weeks later, the United States Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation that, when enacted into law, limited displays of commercial sponsorship on the Mall.

On July 7, 2007, one leg of Live Earth was held outdoors at the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall. Former Vice President Al Gore presented, and artists such as Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood performed.

Occurring once every two to three years on the Mall in the early fall from 2002 to 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon displayed solar-powered houses that competitive collegiate teams designed, constructed and operated. Igniting a controversy, the Department of Energy (DOE) decided to move the 2011 Decathlon off the Mall, claiming that this would support an effort to protect, improve and restore the park. Federal officials stated that heavy equipment that had placed two-story houses on the Mall during earlier Decathlons had cracked walkways and killed grass to a greater extent than had most other Mall events.

On February 4, 2011, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial criticized attempts to have President Obama restore the Decathlon to the Mall. Nevertheless, by February 12, 2011, at least thirteen U.S. senators had signed a letter asking the DOE to reconsider its decision. On February 23, 2011, the DOE and the Department of the Interior announced that the 2011 Solar Decathlon would take place along Ohio Drive southeast of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in West Potomac Park. The event took place in the Park from September 23 through October 2, 2011. The 2013 Decathlon took place in Irvine, California, instead of Washington.

From 2003 to 2013, the National Book Festival took place on the Mall each year in late September or early October. However, the event moved to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in 2014 because the NPS became concerned about the damage that pedestrians had inflicted on the Mall&#x27;s lawn during previous Festivals.

A four-day exhibition took place each year on the Mall during Public Service Recognition Week (the first full week of May) until 2010. Government agencies participating in the event sponsored exhibits that displayed the works of public employees and that enabled visitors to learn about government programs and initiatives, discuss employee benefits, and interact with agency representatives. However, the 2011 United States federal budget (), which was belatedly enacted on April 15, 2011, contained no funding for that year&#x27;s event, forcing the event&#x27;s cancellation. The event did not take place in 2012.

On June 12, 2010, Tareq and Michaele Salahi, a couple under investigation for allegedly crashing a White House state dinner for the prime minister of India in November 2009 (see: 2009 U.S. state dinner security breaches), hosted an America&#x27;s Polo Cup match between the United States and India on the Mall, charging $95 per person for admission. A spokesman for the Embassy of India stated that neither the Embassy nor the government of India had any association with the event. Reports of the event stated that the players who represented India were actually of Pakistani origin and were from Florida. 
The inaugural USA Science and Engineering Festival Expo took place on the National Mall and surrounding areas on October 23 and 24, 2010. More than 1,500 free interactive exhibits reportedly drew about 500,000 people to the event, which had over 75 performances. The second Expo took place on April 28–29, 2012, in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

On Veterans Day, November 11, 2014, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, Rihanna, Metallica, Carrie Underwood, Dave Grohl, the Zac Brown Band and other pop entertainers performed on the Mall during a free evening Concert for Valor honoring veterans and their families. Attendance was in the hundreds of thousands, making it one of the biggest events on the Mall for the year.

The annual Screen on the Green movie festival took place on the Mall on Monday nights during July and August for 17 years until 2015. Free classic movies were projected on large portable screens and typically drew crowds of thousands of people. Organizers cancelled the event in 2016 when the event&#x27;s sponsors (HBO and Comcast) terminated their support, stating that they needed their resources for other projects.

During October 2020, artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg installed 267,080 white flags within a site at the D.C. Armory Parade Grounds near Washington&#x27;s Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to temporarily memorialize the lives lost in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. She recreated her memorial on the Washington Monument grounds during September 2021 when covering for three weeks a area with 700,000 white flags.

From September 29, 2023, until October 1, 2023, the National Mall hosted the third global World Culture Festival, featuring performances from around the world and speeches from global leaders.

==Improvements and future plans==
===National Mall Plan===
From 2006 through 2010, the NPS conducted a public process that created a plan for the future of the National Mall. On July 13, 2010, the NPS issued in the Federal Register a notice of availability of a final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the National Mall Plan. The two-volume final EIS responded to comments and incorporated changes to a draft EIS for the Plan.

On November 9, 2010, the NPS and the Department of the Interior issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that completed the planning process. The ROD contains a summary of the selected alternative, which is the basis for the Plan, together with mitigation measures developed to minimize environmental harm; other alternatives considered; the basis for the decision in terms of planning objectives and the criteria used to develop the preferred alternative; a finding of no impairment of park resources and values; the environmentally preferable alternative; and the public and agency involvement.

The Plan proposed several changes to the Mall. The NPS would construct a vast expanse of paved surface in Union Square at the east end of the Mall to accommodate demonstrations and other events by reducing the size of the Capitol Reflecting Pool or by replacing the pool with a fountain or other minor water feature. Additional proposed changes included the replacement of the Sylvan Theater on the Washington Monument grounds with a facility containing offices, restaurants, and restrooms, as well as the replacement of an open space near the east end of Constitution Gardens with a multipurpose visitor facility containing food service, retail, and restrooms.

On December 2, 2010, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) unanimously approved the final National Mall Plan at a public hearing. The NCPC&#x27;s approval allowed the NPS to move forward with implementation of the Plan&#x27;s recommendations.

On March 1, 2012, the NCPC discussed a proposal that, when implemented, reduced the Mall&#x27;s green space by widening and paving most of the north–south walkways that cross the Mall between Seventh and Fourteenth Streets. The project also replaced with gravel large areas of grass that were located near the Smithsonian Metro Station and the National Gallery of Art&#x27;s Sculpture Garden.
On September 8, 2011, the Trust for the National Mall and the NPS announced an open competition for a redesign of the spaces on the National Mall that Union Square, the Sylvan Theater grounds and the Constitution Gardens lake now occupy. Former First Lady of the United States Laura Bush agreed to be the honorary co-chair of a drive to raise funds for the three projects.

On April 9, 2012, the Trust for the National Mall announced the ideas for the redesign of Union Square, the Sylvan Theater grounds and Constitution Gardens lake area that finalists in the competition had submitted. The Trust asked the public to submit online comments that the competition jury would consider when evaluating each design. The Trust announced the winners of the competition on May 2, 2012. Groundbreaking for the first project was expected to take place by 2014, with the first ribbon-cutting ceremony by 2016.
The competition winners were as follows:

* Union Square: Gustafson &quot;Guthrie Nichol + Davis Brody Bond&quot;
* Sylvan Theater on the Washington Monument Grounds: &quot;OLIN + Weiss/Manfredi&quot;
* Constitution Gardens: &quot;Rogers Marvel Architects + Peter Walker and Partners&quot;

On October 1, 2015, the NCPC approved the preliminary and final site and building plans that the NPS had submitted for the first phase rehabilitation of Constitution Gardens. Plans included the relocation and rehabilitation of the Lockkeeper&#x27;s House, C &amp; O Canal Extension, a new entry plaza at the corner of Constitution Avenue and 17th Street, NW, landscaping, a meadow and pollinator habitat and a new perimeter garden wall. A temporary path would connect to an existing plaza located at the eastern end of Constitution Garden&#x27;s lake.

The NPS began to implement the first phase rehabilitation of Constitution Gardens in 2017. A Park Service contractor moved the Lockkeeper&#x27;s House, C &amp; O Canal Extension, southward and westward away from Constitution Avenue, NW and 17th Street, NW while retaining the structure&#x27;s east–west orientation. The NPS restored the building&#x27;s exterior to the conditions that had existed before the building was modified during 1915 and earlier years. The NPS also replaced the structure&#x27;s brick chimneys, thus restoring the building to its original 1800s appearance. The building reopened temporarily in late August 2018 and permanently on September 13 of that year. The structure now serves in its new location as an NPS education center.

===Reconstruction and restoration===
From 2010 to 2012, NPS contractors rebuilt the aging Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, which had first been constructed in the early 1920s and whose water had come from the pipes that supply Washington, D.C., with its drinking water. As a result of the project, the pool now receives filtered water from the Tidal Basin through a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline.

The NPS then began a four-year restoration of the portion of the central axis of the Mall that lies between 3rd Street and 14th Street. By 2016, the restoration project had completely replaced the deteriorated and weedy turf that had previously covered much of that part of the Mall with a new cover containing soil, fescue (&quot;Festuca&quot;) and Kentucky bluegrass (&quot;Poa pratensis&quot;).
==Transportation==
===Public transportation===

The National Mall is accessible via the Washington Metro, with the Smithsonian station located on the south side of the Mall, near the Smithsonian Institution Building between the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol. The Federal Triangle, Archives, Judiciary Square and Union Station Metro stations are also located near the Mall, to the north. The L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, Federal Center Southwest and Capitol South Metro stations are located several blocks south of the Mall. Metrobus and the DC Circulator make scheduled stops near the Mall.

===Bicycles===
The NPS provides parking facilities for bicycles near each of the major memorials as well as along the National Mall. From March to October, an NPS concessionaire rents out bicycles at the Thompson Boat Center, located near the intersection of Virginia Avenue NW and Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, north of the Lincoln Memorial along the Potomac River-Rock Creek Trail. The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the National Mall on March 16, 2012, shortly before the start of the 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival.

The National Mall is the official midpoint of the East Coast Greenway, a 2,900 mile–long system of shared-use bicycle trails linking Calais, Maine, with Key West, Florida.

=== Electric scooters and Segways ===
The use of an electric scooter or a Segway falls under the NPS definition of recreational use of a self-propelled vehicle. People without identified disabilities can only use such vehicles on park roadways. NPS rules, therefore, prohibit people without disabilities from using electric scooters and Segways on sidewalks and paths within the National Mall and its memorials. 

Several companies rent out electric scooters within the District of Columbia. However, the National Mall is outside of those companies&#x27; service areas. Some such companies, therefore, charge fines for people who end their rides on the Mall. Others do not allow people to end their trips until they have left the area.

===Pedicabs===
The NPS licenses pedicab drivers to provide transportation and tours of the National Mall through its Commercial Use Authorization program.

===Motor vehicle parking===

General visitor parking is available along Ohio Drive SW, between the Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson Memorials. Bus parking is available primarily along Ohio Drive, SW, near the Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson Memorials, and along Ohio Drive SW, in East Potomac Park. There is limited handicapped parking at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt and World War II Memorials and near the Washington Monument and the Thomas Jefferson, Lincoln, Korean War Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans Memorials; otherwise, parking is extremely scarce in and near the Mall.

In April 2017, the NPS awarded a contract for the installation of parking meters on streets and in parking areas on the Mall. On June 12, 2017, the NPS and the District of Columbia Department of Public Works began to enforce metered parking on approximately 1,100 parking spaces in which motorists could previously park without charge.

==Weather and climate==
On July 16, 2016, speakers and musicians participated in a gathering of thousands of evangelicals during a Together 2016 rally on the Mall. Although the event was originally scheduled to conclude at 9 p.m., it ended at 4 p.m. due to excessive heat. Officers reportedly responded to 350 medical calls for heat-related injuries. The large number of people who lost consciousness because of heat syncope overwhelmed emergency medical technicians.

On July 1, 2021, an EF1 tornado formed in Arlington County, Virginia at 8:59 p.m., crossed the Potomac River near the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, and traveled eastward along the National Mall before dissipating near 16th Street NW and Constitution Avenue south of the White House and The Ellipse, from where it had started. Its maximum winds were , and it was as wide as . The National Weather Service reported that wind damage to trees on the Mall &quot;was prominent from 23rd St NW east for to near 16th Street NW south of The Ellipse&quot;. The weather service stated that the tornado lifted up and twisted temporary fencing installed on the Mall for the upcoming July 4 Independence Day celebration. The fencing landed in a &quot;mangled and haphazard manner&quot; before the twister dissipated at 9:05 p.m.
==In popular culture==
The National Mall is a common backdrop and setting for films, television shows, and other forms of media. The Mall is the setting for a famous scene in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, in which Forrest gives a speech during the 1967 March on the Pentagon at the Lincoln Memorial. The film &quot;National Treasure&quot; is set on and around the National Mall. The Mall is also a common setting in several superhero movies. &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; all have prominent scenes on the Mall. The comedic film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; is set in Washington, D.C., and has scenes on the Mall. Additionally, the mall is a common feature of the Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot;. The Mall is also a setting of season three, episode three of the show &quot;Family Guy&quot;, as well as season 17, episode 11 of the show, nicknamed &quot;Trump Guy&quot;.

News organisations that present live coverage or recorded programs from Washington often use the Mall as a backdrop.

<doc id="167799" wikidata="Q2517366" url="?curid=167799" title="Irish Famine (1740–1741)">
<text>The Irish Famine of 1740–1741 (, meaning the Year of Slaughter) in the Kingdom of Ireland, is estimated to have killed between 13% and 20% of the 1740 population of 2.4 million people, which was a proportionately greater loss than during the Great Famine of 1845–1852.

The famine of 1740–1741 was due to extremely cold and then dry weather in successive years, resulting in food losses in three categories: a series of poor grain harvests, a shortage of milk, and frost damage to potatoes. At this time, grains, particularly oats, were more important than potatoes as staples in the diet of most workers. 

Deaths from mass starvation in 1740–1741 were compounded by an outbreak of fatal diseases. The cold and its effects extended across Europe, but mortality was higher in Ireland because both grain and potatoes failed. This is now considered by scholars to be the last serious cold period at the end of the Little Ice Age of about 1400–1800.

The famine of 1740–1741 is different from the Great Famine of the 19th century. By the mid-19th century, potatoes made up a greater portion of Irish diets, with adverse consequences when the crop failed, causing famine from 1845 to 1852. The Great Famine differed by &quot;cause, scale and timing&quot; from the Irish Famine of 1740–1741. It was caused by an oomycete infection which destroyed much of the potato crop for several years running, a crisis exacerbated by the laissez-faire policies of the ruling British government, continued exportation of food, insufficient relief, rigid government regulations and state sponsored evictions.

==Background==
In 1740, Ireland had a population of 2.4 million people, most of whom depended on grains (oats, wheat, barley and rye) and potatoes as their staple foods. Half their expenses for food went for grain, 35% for animal products and the remainder for potatoes. Some survived only on oatmeal, buttermilk and potatoes. Over a year, in the period 1776-1778 (thirty years later), daily consumption of potatoes was estimated at per person. Diets varied according to village locations and individual income, with many people supplementing these staples with river, lake or sea fish, especially herring, and small game such as wild duck. At the time social welfare was an entirely private initiative undertaken on a local level by the village or parish, with the government not being oriented to large-scale relief efforts.

==Cause==

An extraordinary climatic shock struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741 following a decade of relatively mild winters. Its cause remains unknown. Charting its course sharply illuminates how climate events can result in famine and epidemic disease, and affect economies, energy sources, and politics.

In the winter of 1739–1740, Ireland suffered seven weeks of very cold weather known as the &quot;Great Frost&quot;.
Although no barometric or temperature readings for Ireland survive from the Great Frost, a scattered few records survive from Englishmen who made personal readings. The mercury thermometer was invented 25 years earlier by German pioneer Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. Indoor values during January 1740 were as low as . The one outdoor reading that has survived was stated as &quot;thirty-two degrees of frost,&quot; equivalent to . This did not include the effects of the wind chill factor, which would have been severe. This kind of weather was &quot;quite outside the Irish experience,&quot; notes David Dickson, author of &quot;Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41&quot;.

In the period before the crisis in January 1740, the winds and terrible cold intensified, yet barely any snow fell. Ireland was locked into a stable and vast high-pressure system which affected most of Europe in a broadly similar way, from Scandinavia and Russia to northern Italy. Rivers, lakes, and waterfalls froze and fish died in these first weeks of the Great Frost. People tried to avoid hypothermia without using up winter fuel reserves in a matter of days. People living in the country were probably better off than city-dwellers because in Ireland country people had cabins sheltered by turf stacks, while the latter, especially the poor, dwelt in freezing basements and garrets.

Coal dealers and shippers during normal times ferried coal from Cumbria and South Wales to east and south-coast ports in Ireland, but the ice-bound quays and frozen coal yards temporarily stopped such trade. When in late January 1740 the traffic across the Irish Sea resumed, retail prices for coal soared. Desperate people stripped bare hedges, ornamental trees, and nurseries around Dublin to obtain substitute fuel. Also affected by the Frost were the pre-industrial town mill-wheels, which froze. The machinery was stilled that customarily ground wheat for the bakers, tucked cloth for the weavers, and pulped rags for the printers. The abrupt weather change disrupted craft employment and food processing.

==Protestants and alms-giving==
The municipal leaders (mostly Protestant merchants and members of the landed gentry) paid closer attention to the state of urban and rural artisans and tradespeople because of their contributions to the commercial economy on which the landowners depended. These leaders knew from experience that &quot;an unemployed or hungry town often became a sickly town and such sickness might be no respecter of class or wealth&quot;. This is what happened as the Frost continued.

The propertied classes began to respond to fuel and food shortages when the Frost was about two weeks old. The Church of Ireland parish clergy solicited donations, which they converted into free rations in the city parishes, distributing nearly 80 tons of coal and ten tons of meal four weeks into the Frost. The Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Devonshire, in an unprecedented move on 19 January 1740, prohibited the export of grain out of Ireland to any destination except Britain. This action was in response to Cork Corporation (City of Cork), which remembered vividly the city events of eleven years earlier when serious food riots erupted and four people died.

In Celbridge, County Kildare, Katherine, the widow of William Conolly, commissioned the construction of the Conolly Folly in 1740 to give employment to local workers. In 1743, she had The Wonderful Barn built nearby as a food store in case of further famines.

==Potatoes deteriorate==
The Great Frost affected the potato, which was one of the two main staples (the other was oatmeal) in rural Ireland. Potatoes typically were left in storage in gardens and in special storage in fields. The crops from the autumn of 1739 were frozen, destroyed and inedible. They could not serve as seeds for the next growing season. &quot;Richard Purcell, one of the best rural witnesses of the unfolding crisis, reported in late February [1740] that had the Frost not occurred, there would have been enough potatoes in his district to have kept the country [Ireland] fed until August [1740], indicating a rare local abundance of the crop. &#x27;But both root and branch…is destroyed every where&#x27;, except for &#x27;a few which happen&#x27;d to be housed&#x27;, and &#x27;in a very few deep…and turfy moulded gardens where some, perhaps enough for seed for the same ground, are sound.&#x27;&quot;

At that time, potatoes were typically stored in the fields where they were grown, in earthen banks known as potato clamps. They were put among layers of soil and straw that normally prevented frost from penetrating deeply enough to destroy the contents of the clamp. This disruption of the agricultural cycle created problems in Ireland in the winter of 1740–1741.

==Spring drought, 1740==
In spring 1740, the expected rains did not arrive. Although the Frost dissipated, the temperatures remained low and the northerly winds fierce. The drought killed off animals in the field, particularly sheep in Connacht and black cattle in the south.

By the end of April, it destroyed much of the tillage crops (wheat and barley) sown the previous autumn, and grains were more important in the diet than were potatoes. The important corn crop also failed, which resulted in greater mortality in Ireland than in Britain or the Continent.

Grains were so scarce that the Irish hierarchy of the Catholic Church allowed Catholics to eat meat four days each week during Lent, but not everyone could afford meat. The potato crisis caused an increase in grain prices, resulting in smaller and smaller loaves of bread for the old price. Dickson explains that the &quot;wholesale rise in the price of wheat, oats and barley reflected not just the current supply position, but the dealers&#x27; assessment as to the state of things later in the year.&quot;

By summer 1740, the Frost had decimated the potatoes, and the drought had decimated the grain harvest and herds of cattle and sheep. Starving rural dwellers started a &quot;mass vagrancy&quot; towards the better-supplied towns, such as Cork in southern Ireland. By mid-June 1740, beggars lined the streets.

==Food riots==
With the soaring cost of food, hungry townspeople &quot;vented their frustration on grain dealers, meal-mongers and bakers, and when they turned to direct action the most likely flashpoints were markets or warehouses&quot; where food owners stored bulk food. The first &quot;flareup&quot; occurred at Drogheda, north of Dublin on the east coast of Ireland, in mid-April. A band of citizens boarded a vessel laden with oatmeal, which was preparing to depart for Scotland. They removed the rudder and sails. The officials made sure that Scotland would receive no more food from their port. They, like the Cork Corporation officials, wanted no trouble from the Irish citizens.

A riot broke out in Dublin on Saturday and Sunday near the end of May 1740 when the populace believed that bakers were holding off baking bread. They broke into the bakers&#x27; shops and sold some of the loaves, giving the money to the bakers. Other people simply took the bread and left. On Monday, rioters raided to take the meal from mills near the city and resold it at discounted prices. Trying to restore order, troops from the Royal Barracks killed several rioters. City officials tried to &quot;smoke out hoarders of grain and to police food markets, but prices remained stubbornly high throughout the summer&quot;.

Similar skirmishes over food continued in different Irish cities throughout the summer of 1740. The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) began, interrupting trade as Spanish privateers captured ships bound for Ireland, including those carrying grain. Linen, salted beef and pickled butter were Ireland&#x27;s chief export earners, and the war endangered this trade as well.

==The cold returns==
In autumn 1740, a meagre harvest commenced and prices in the towns started to fall. Cattle began to recover. But in the dairying districts, cows had been so weak after the Frost that at least a third of them had failed to &quot;take bull,&quot; or become impregnated at breeding. This resulted in fewer calves, a shortage of milk, which was widely consumed, and a decline in butter production.

To make conditions worse, blizzards swept along the east coast in late October 1740 depositing snow and returned several times in November. A massive rain downpour on 9 December 1740 caused widespread flooding. A day after the floods, the temperature plummeted, snow fell, and rivers and other bodies of water froze. Warm temperatures followed the cold snap, which lasted about ten days. Great chunks of ice careened down the Liffey River through the heart of Dublin, overturning light vessels and causing larger vessels to break anchor.

The strange autumn of 1740 pushed food prices up. Dublin wheat prices on 20 December were at an all-time high. The widening wars in mid-December 1740 encouraged people with stored food to hoard it. The populace needed food, and riots erupted again in various cities throughout the country. By December 1740, signs were growing that full-blown famine and epidemic were upon the citizens of Ireland.

==Relief schemes==
The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Samuel Cooke, consulted with the Lords Justices – Archbishop Boulter; Henry Boyle, Speaker of the Commons; and Lord Jocelyn, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland – on 15 December 1740 to figure out a way to bring down the price of corn. Boulter launched an emergency feeding programme for the poor of Dublin at his own expense. The Privy Council instructed the High Sheriff in each county to count all stocks of grain in the possession of farmers and merchants and to report total cereal stocks in their county. 

The reports indicated a number of privately held stocks, for instance County Louth held over 85,000 barrels of grain, mainly oats, owned by some 1,655 farmers. Some major landowners, such as the widow of Speaker William Conolly, builder of Castletown House, distributed food and cash during the &quot;black spring&quot; of 1741 on their own initiative. The widow Conolly and other philanthropists hired workers to develop infrastructure or do work associated with local improvements: such as building an obelisk, paving, fencing, draining, making roads or canals, and cleaning harbours. In Drogheda, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, Henry Singleton, a citizen of the town, donated much of his private fortune for famine relief.

==Return of normal weather==
Five vessels loaded with grain, presumably from British America, reached Galway on the west coast in June 1741. In the first week of July 1741, grain prices at last decreased and old-hoarded wheat suddenly flooded the market. The quality of the Autumn harvest of 1741 was mixed. The food crisis was over, and seasons of rare plenty followed for the next two years.

==Death toll==
Documentation of deaths was poor during the Great Frost. Cemeteries provide fragmentary information, e.g., during February and March 1740, 47 children were buried in St. Catherine&#x27;s parish. The normal death rate tripled in January and February 1740, and burials averaged out about 50% higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737–1739, according to Dickson. Summing up all his sources, Dickson suggests that the famine resulted in the deaths of between 13 and 20% of the population.

Based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records, famine-related deaths may have totalled 300,000–480,000 in Ireland, with rates highest in the south and east of the country. This was a proportionately greater toll than during the Great Famine (1845–49). That famine, however, was unique in &quot;cause, scale and timing&quot;, persisting over several years.

==Summary==
The Irish Great Frost of 1740–1741 demonstrated human social behaviour under crisis conditions and the far-reaching effects of a major climate crisis. As conditions eased, &quot;the population entered into a period of unprecedented growth&quot;, although additional famines occurred during the eighteenth century. Dickson notes that an upsurge in migration out of Ireland in the years after the 1740–1741 crisis did not take place, perhaps in part because conditions improved relatively quickly although the most likely primary reason was that a transoceanic voyage was far beyond the means of most of the population at this time. Irish dendrochronologist Mike Baillie has confirmed tree ring patterns in 1740 that were consistent with severe cold.

The year 1741, during which the famine was at its worst and mortality was greatest, was known in folk memory as the &quot;year of the slaughter&quot; (or in Irish).

<doc id="167802" wikidata="Q43259" url="?curid=167802" title="No Doubt">
<text>No Doubt is an American rock band formed in Anaheim, California in 1986. For most of its career, the band has consisted of vocalist and founding member Gwen Stefani, guitarist Tom Dumont, bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young. Keyboardist Eric Stefani, Gwen&#x27;s brother, was also a member when the band started to release albums in 1992. Since the mid-1990s, trombonist Gabrial McNair and trumpeter Stephen Bradley have performed with the band as session and touring musicians.

Though its 1992 eponymous debut album failed to make an impact, its ska punk-inspired follow-up &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, more than triple the sales of its predecessor. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was released later the same year and benefited from the 1990s resurgence of third-wave ska, going on to achieve diamond certification. &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart, while &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, co-written by Stefani, was described as &quot;the most popular cut on the CD&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; (2000), did not match the success of their previous album, despite its Top 40 hit single &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot;. However, the album received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards. The following year, the band returned with the album &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (2001), which incorporated reggae and dancehall music. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;; &quot;Hella Good&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy award.

After a 2004 tour, the band members pursued solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled &quot;Push and Shove&quot; (2012), and released its lead single &quot;Settle Down&quot;. The band has sold over 33 million records worldwide.

==History==

===1986–1989: Formation, early years and line-up changes ===
In 1986, Eric Stefani and John Spence met at a Dairy Queen and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister Gwen Stefani (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez (trumpet), Alan Meade (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage.

Tony Kanal went to one of the band&#x27;s early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her. Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after. The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987, with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt&#x27;s set included &quot;Total Hate&quot;, &quot;Too Much Pressure&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Paulina&quot;, &quot;Gangsters&quot;, and the song &quot;No Doubt&quot;. Video clips from the party appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

In December 1987, Spence died by suicide, several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees. No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks with Alan Meade taking over vocals. When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer, and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California. In early 1988, Tom Dumont left Rising, a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister, stating that local metal bands &quot;were into drinking, wearing Spandex&quot; but that he wanted to focus on music. He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band&#x27;s guitarist. Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as their drummer the following year. During this time period, No Doubt played gigs at local colleges, Fender&#x27;s Grand Ballroom, The Whisky, The Roxy, many shows with The Untouchables, Fishbone, and a show with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Cal State Long Beach. Caseley left No Doubt in July 1989 for the US Navy Band.

===1990–1992: Self-titled debut album ===

Impressed by the presence of stage diving fans at No Doubt&#x27;s concerts and Gwen&#x27;s on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1990. No Doubt&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot;. Owing to the music world&#x27;s direct focus on grunge, No Doubt&#x27;s album was not supported by the record label, and was considered a commercial failure for selling only 30,000 copies. The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album, though Interscope refused to support the tour. The band failed to bring the audiences that it had attracted in southern California, and often found that &quot;No Doubt&quot; was not even available in the cities where they were playing. Eric Stefani began to withdraw from the group, vacillating between being in and out of the band, while Gonzalez left the band in 1992.

===1993–1997: Reorganization and career breakthrough ===

The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the cartoon TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed &quot;space&quot;. Unsure of what to do with the band, Interscope sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1993. No Doubt released &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot;, consisting of outtakes from its previous recording sessions, in 1995 on its own label, Beacon Street Records. Mixing 1980s punk rock and some grunge influences into the band&#x27;s sound, the album contains a rawer sound than &quot;No Doubt&quot;, and it sold more than three times as many copies as its predecessor. Later that year, Trauma Records released &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, much of which dealt with the relationship between Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani.

The release of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and the single &quot;Just a Girl&quot; allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success. No Doubt began touring in support of the album late that year, and it grew into a 27-month international tour. In 1996, the second single, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, was successful, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, a ballad written by Gwen and Eric Stefani about Gwen and Kanal&#x27;s break-up, was released as the third single and broke the previous record when it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay for sixteen non-consecutive weeks. No Doubt was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards. By the end of the year, half of the songs on &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; had been released as singles, and the album was certified eight times platinum. Later, they were nominated for two more Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, both for &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album diamond in February 1999, and with worldwide sales of sixteen million. Through the success of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album began again to sell copies, and reached total sales of over a quarter of a million copies.

The album&#x27;s release fueled a dispute between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt&#x27;s recording contract. Trauma sued for US$100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion and sought to have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected. No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was &quot;really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label.&quot; The case was settled out of court with a $3 million payment.

===1998–2003: Continued touring and new albums ===
The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot;, a live long-form video of the band&#x27;s performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, was released and &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded &quot;I Throw My Toys Around&quot; with Elvis Costello for &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, and it contributed to The Clash&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Burning London: The Clash Tribute&quot;. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Prince, Fishbone, and Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale&#x27;s band Bush. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song &quot;New&quot; on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Go&quot; in 1999. &quot;New&quot;, inspired by Gwen&#x27;s budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;.

In 2000, the band released &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, its follow-up to &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt&#x27;s previous work. The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani&#x27;s relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale. &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Also released as singles from the album were the tracks &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;. Lukewarm sales drastically shortened the tour that followed, appearing only in festival settings in L.A., Cincinnati, Nashville, Jacksonville and Miami. On August 10, No Doubt went on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; and performed a few of their songs, and were joined by friend Alain Johannes (of Eleven) and former member Eric Stefani.

After &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, the band returned to recording in January 2001. During this time, it contributed a cover version of Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; for the &quot;Zoolander&quot; soundtrack and recorded a song with Kelis for her album &quot;Wanderland&quot;. Stefani made high-profile appearances on Moby&#x27;s &quot;South Side&quot; and Eve&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot;. These appearances lent No Doubt credibility and an opportunity to explore new genres. Highly influenced by Jamaican dancehall music and recorded primarily in Jamaica, the band&#x27;s 2001 studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, produced two hit Grammy-winning singles, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, which featured Bounty Killer, and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, which featured &quot;the first lady of dancehall&quot;, Lady Saw. Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Running&quot; as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on &quot;Waiting Room&quot; from &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince&#x27;s &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; album, &quot;So Far, So Pleased&quot;. In November 2002, No Doubt made an appearance in the &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; episode &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;.
On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in Disneyland during the band&#x27;s appearance on (KROQ-FM) where they performed five songs. In January 2003, No Doubt performed in the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show.

===2003–2008: Greatest Hits and hiatus===
The album &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s commercially released singles, was released on November 25, 2003. It included a cover of the song &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, which had originally been a hit for synthpop group Talk Talk in 1984, and earned No Doubt a Grammy nomination for Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal. Additionally, a special 2-CD 2-DVD box set titled &quot;Boom Box&quot; was made available, which included the CDs &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; and &quot;Everything in Time&quot; and the DVDs &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot; and &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot;. Separately, &quot;Rock Steady Live&quot;, a DVD of the band performing in Long Beach from their Rock Steady tour was released in 2003 as well. The next year, the band was featured in a re-recording of the Toots and the Maytals classic song &quot;Monkey Man&quot; for the Grammy award winning True Love (Toots &amp; the Maytals album). The band also toured with Blink-182 in mid-2004, before embarking on a hiatus.

Lead singer Gwen Stefani began work on her 1980s-inspired new wave and dance-pop side project in 2003, which eventually evolved into the full-fledged solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, released on November 23, 2004. The album reached multi-platinum status in several countries, including a quintuple platinum certification in Canada and triple platinum in the US.

No Doubt was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.

Stefani launched her first solo arena tour in October 2005, which coincided with the news of her pregnancy (her son, Kingston James McGregor Rossdale, was born on May 26, 2006). She released her second solo dance-pop album, &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; in December 2006. Tony Kanal helped with the production of the album as well.

In early 2005, Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord, with friend and collaborator Ted Matson, and backed up Matt Costa on his 2005 tour. Adrian Young, the band&#x27;s drummer, did the drums for Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s 2004 tour and many of the tracks on Unwritten Law&#x27;s 2005 release &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Mourning&quot;, as well as featuring on several shows in 2006 for TheStart. Young also played on &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; runner-up Dilana&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot; album.

In 2008, Tony Kanal collaborated with pop rock artist Pink on the album &quot;Funhouse&quot;. Kanal co-produced &quot;Sober&quot;, co-wrote &quot;Funhouse&quot; and also sang back-up vocals on &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;.

===2008–2013: First reunion and comeback tour ===
With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began initial work on a new album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani&#x27;s tour was finished. However, songwriting was slow as Gwen Stefani was, at the time, pregnant with her second child. The album was produced by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent, who helped produce and mix &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.

No Doubt announced on their official website that they would tour in the summer of 2009 with Paramore, The Sounds, Janelle Monáe, Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry, Panic! at the Disco, and Matt Costa, all while finishing their upcoming album, which was set for release in 2010. As a special promotion for the tour, the band was giving away their entire music catalog free as a digital download with purchase of top-tier seating.

The band released another compilation album on November 2 called &quot;Icon&quot;, in preparation for their upcoming comeback album. &quot;Icon&quot; featured the same track listing as their previous compilation album &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; albeit with new artwork and a low price point.

On June 11, 2012, the band announced on their official website that the new album would be out on September 25, preceded by the first single on July 16. The album was titled &quot;Push and Shove&quot; and the first single was a song called &quot;Settle Down&quot;. The music video for &quot;Settle Down&quot; was directed by Sophie Muller (who has previously directed numerous music videos for No Doubt). &quot;Settle Down&quot; peaked at #34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the album peaking at #3. On November 3, 2012, the band pulled its music video &quot;Looking Hot&quot; from the Internet after receiving complaints that it was insensitive towards Native Americans.

As of February 1, 2013, the band stated via Twitter that they had &quot;Finished a week of songwriting&quot;, implying that they have more new tracks written. As of February 26, 2013, the band officially confirmed through their website that they had indeed begun working on new music as well as plans for an upcoming tour.

===2013–2015: Second hiatus and disbandment ===
In October 2013, Tom Dumont revealed via Twitter that the band was once again on hiatus, but hinted that they would regroup in 2014. No Doubt did reform for sporadic live performances during 2014 and 2015, among others at Global Citizen Earth Day Concert, Rock in Rio USA, Riot Fest, and KAABOO in Del Mar, California, but did not announce a headline tour or release any new music.

Around the release of her solo single &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, Gwen Stefani announced that No Doubt were working on a new album. However, during an interview with the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; in April 2015, Tony Kanal stated that the band was not working on any new material.

In a June 2016 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stefani expressed uncertainty over the future of No Doubt. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen with No Doubt. When Tony [Kanal] and I are connected creatively, it&#x27;s magic. But I think we&#x27;ve grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded [2012&#x27;s &quot;Push and Shove&quot;]. And I had a lot of guilt: &#x27;I have to do it.&#x27; That&#x27;s not the right setting to make music. There&#x27;s some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn&#x27;t get heard.&quot;

===2022–present: Second reunion, Coachella and future===
In an interview with WSJ Magazine in December 2022, when asked about a reunion, Stefani said &quot;What are the odds of anything? I was just on &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot;. She was one of my favorite celebrities when I was a little girl, and now I was just on the show with her. Anything can happen. We haven&#x27;t really talked about doing anything, but it feels like everyone is, right? All the &#x27;90s people — Blink-182 did an eight-month tour that sold out in like five minutes.&quot; However, when Nic Harcourt interviewed Adrian Young for AKG&#x27;s &quot;Stories Behind the Sessions&quot; (published in May 2023) and asked him if the world would see any more No Doubt music, Young replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think so. I think [&quot;Push and Shove&quot;] will remain our last album. And unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see us touring anymore either. I could be wrong, you never know, things could change. I would love to have that feeling again, connect with the fans, and it&#x27;s quite a shame we&#x27;re not playing live.&quot;

On January 16, 2024, the band teased a reunion show. On February 2, a source close to the band revealed to &quot;Us Weekly&quot; that “the whole group has some ideas for new material and are open to a tour directly after [their] performance.” They played a reunion show in April 2024, performing at Coachella, the first time they played together since 2015. On January 30, 2025, No Doubt performed another reunion show initially planned as a Gwen Stefani solo concert to support the aid and fundraising in response to the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Musical style and influences==
No Doubt&#x27;s musical style has been characterized as ska punk, ska, pop rock, new wave, alternative rock, pop-punk, reggae, reggae fusion, and punk rock. Some other genres the band has been described as include synth-pop, electropop, dancehall, third-wave ska, post-grunge, funk, and disco.

The band&#x27;s debut album blended the ska punk, alternative rock and new wave genres. However, the band utilized a punk rock sound in their second album &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; and their third album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, although the latter incorporated pop-punk and alternative rock influences. They later shed their punk rock roots for the following album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, utilizing influences from new wave music and pop rock.

The band completely altered their sound in their next album &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, incorporating Jamaican music influences from reggae fusion, rocksteady and dance-rock. However the band&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Push and Shove&quot; blended pop rock, new wave music and dancehall; the English electronic bands New Order and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) were cited as key influences on the album.

==Other appearances==
In 2009, No Doubt made an appearance on the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, playing a fictional band called &quot;Snowed Out&quot; in the episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot;. They performed a cover version of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;.

No Doubt played at the Bridge School Benefit organized by Neil Young on October 24 and 25, 2009, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.

On December 5, 2010, No Doubt performed a tribute to Paul McCartney at The Kennedy Center Honors, playing a medley of Beatles hits including &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;All My Loving&quot;, and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. The band performed for President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney, and Oprah Winfrey.

The band also appeared as guests on the Fox animated television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, in the season 5 episode &quot;Kidney Boy and Hamster Girl: A Love Story&quot;, and in an episode of the sketch comedy program &quot;Portlandia&quot;. They can also be seen in a scene of the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;. At the time Eric Stefani was one of the show&#x27;s animators, and inserted his sister and her bandmates behind Homer in the scene where the crowd riots against him.

==&quot;Band Hero&quot; lawsuit==
On November 4, 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that No Doubt had filed a lawsuit over its portrayal in the music video game &quot;Band Hero&quot;. The lawsuit alleged that the game had &quot;transformed No Doubt band members into a virtual karaoke circus act&quot;, singing dozens of songs the group neither wrote, popularized, nor approved for use in the game. The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited Activision, the game&#x27;s distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of No Doubt.

On February 15, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District affirmed the trial court&#x27;s denial of Activision&#x27;s special motion to strike No Doubt&#x27;s lawsuit as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, after an interlocutory appeal by Activision. The appellate court explained that the dispute arose from No Doubt&#x27;s discovery, two weeks before &quot;Band Hero&quot; went on sale, that its band members could be manipulated in the game to perform songs they would never perform in real life. The court then explained: &quot;The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani&#x27;s avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members&#x27; avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups.&quot; The court then ruled that Activision&#x27;s First Amendment defense was meritless, No Doubt had a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits, and that No Doubt was entitled to recover costs and attorney&#x27;s fees incurred in opposing Activision&#x27;s appeal.

In 2012, the issue was settled out of court, two weeks before scheduled trial date.

<text>The Bartholin&#x27;s glands (named after Caspar Bartholin the Younger; also called Bartholin glands or greater vestibular glands) are two pea-sized compound alveolar glands located slightly posterior and to the left and right of the opening of the vagina. They secrete mucus to lubricate the vagina.

They are homologous to bulbourethral glands in males. However, while Bartholin&#x27;s glands are located in the superficial perineal pouch in females, bulbourethral glands are located in the deep perineal pouch in males. Their duct length is 1.5 to 2.0 cm and they open into navicular fossa. The ducts are paired and they open on the surface of the vulva.

== Structure ==
The embryological origin of the Bartholin&#x27;s glands is derived from the urogenital sinus; therefore, the innervation and blood supply are via the pudendal nerve and external pudendal artery, respectively. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes and pelvic nodes provide lymphatic drainage.

These glands are pea-sized (0.5–1.0 cm) and are lined with columnar epithelium. The duct length is 1.5–2 cm and is lined with squamous epithelium. These are located just beneath the fascia and their ducts drain into the vestibular mucosa. These mucoid alkaline secreting glands are arranged as lobules consisting of alveoli lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Their efferent ducts are composed of transitional epithelium, which merges into squamous epithelium as it enters the distal vagina. The more proximal portions of the ductal system are lined by transitional epithelium and may be lined by columnar epithelium before arborization into glandular secretory elements.

These glands lie on the perineal membrane and beneath the bulbospongiosus muscle at the tail end of the vestibular bulb deep to the posterior labia majora. The intimate relation between the enormously vascular tissue of the vestibular bulb and the Bartholin&#x27;s glands is responsible for the risk of hemorrhage associated with the removal of this latter structure.

The openings of the Bartholin&#x27;s glands are located on the posterior margin of the introitus bilaterally in a groove between the hymen and the labium minus at the 4:00 and 8:00 o&#x27;clock positions. The glands duct opening is seen on the posterolateral aspect of the vestibule 3 to 4 mm outside the hymen or hymenal caruncles lateral to the hymenal ring.

==History==

Bartholin&#x27;s glands were first described in 1677 by the 17th-century Danish anatomist Caspar Bartholin the Younger (1655–1738). 
Earlier he jointly discovered the glands in cows with Joseph Guichard Duverney (1648-1730), a French anatomist. 
Some sources mistakenly ascribe their discovery to his grandfather, theologian and anatomist Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585–1629).

==Function==
Bartholin&#x27;s glands secrete mucus to provide vaginal lubrication during sexual arousal. The fluid may slightly moisten the labial opening of the vagina, serving to make contact with this sensitive area more comfortable. Fluid from the Bartholin&#x27;s glands is combined with other vaginal secretions as a &quot;lubrication fluid&quot; in the amount of about 6 grams per day, and contains high potassium and low sodium concentrations relative to blood plasma, with a slightly acidic pH of 4.7.

==Clinical pathology==
It is possible for the Bartholin&#x27;s glands to become blocked and inflamed resulting in pain. This is known as bartholinitis or a Bartholin&#x27;s cyst. A Bartholin&#x27;s cyst in turn can become infected and form an abscess. Adenocarcinoma of the gland is rare and benign tumors and hyperplasia are even more rare. Bartholin gland carcinoma is a rare malignancy that occurs in 1% of vulvar cancers. This may be due to the presence of three different types of epithelial tissue. Inflammation of the Skene&#x27;s glands and Bartholin glands may appear similar to cystocele.

==Other animals==
The major vestibular glands are found in many mammals such as cats, cows, and some sheep.

<text>Gwen Renée Stefani Shelton ( ; born October 3, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter and fashion designer. She is a member and lead vocalist of the band No Doubt, whose singles include &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, from their 1995 breakthrough studio album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, as well as &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; from later albums.

During the band&#x27;s hiatus, Stefani embarked on a solo pop career in 2004 by releasing her debut studio album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; Inspired by pop music from the 1980s, the album was a critical and commercial success. It spawned six singles, including &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot;, and &quot;Cool&quot;. &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart while also becoming the first US download to sell one million copies. In 2006, Stefani released her second studio album, &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;. Among the singles were its title track and &quot;Wind It Up&quot;, the former of which was number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 year-end chart of 2007. Her third solo album, &quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot; (2016), was her first solo album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Her fourth solo album and first full-length Christmas album, &quot;You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot;, was released in 2017 and charted 19 tracks on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Holiday Digital Song Sales component chart in the United States. Stefani has released several singles with husband Blake Shelton, including &quot;Nobody but You&quot; (2020), which reached number 18 in the US. In 2024, she released her fifth studio album &quot;Bouquet&quot;.

Stefani has won three Grammy Awards. As a solo artist, she has received an American Music Award, a Brit Award, a World Music Award, and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2023. In 2003, she debuted her clothing line L.A.M.B. and expanded her collection with the 2005 Harajuku Lovers line inspired by Japanese culture and fashion. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked Stefani the 54th most successful artist and 37th most successful Hot 100 artist of the 2000–2009 decade. VH1 ranked her 13th on their &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot; list in 2012. Stefani has sold more than 60 million records worldwide.

==Early life and education==
Gwen Renée Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, in Fullerton, California, and raised Catholic in nearby Anaheim. She was named after a stewardess in the 1968 novel &quot;Airport&quot;, and her middle name, Renée, comes from the Four Tops&#x27; 1967 version of the Left Banke&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot;. Her father Dennis Stefani is Italian American and worked as a Yamaha marketing executive. Her mother Patti (&quot;née&quot; Flynn) is Irish-American and worked as an accountant before becoming a homemaker. Stefani&#x27;s parents were fans of folk music and exposed her to music by artists like Bob Dylan and Emmylou Harris. Stefani has two younger siblings, Jill and Todd, and an older brother, Eric. Eric was the keyboardist for No Doubt before leaving the band to pursue a career in animation on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

She attended Loara High School, where she graduated in 1987. After high school, she attended Fullerton College and Cypress College. She then transferred to California State University, Fullerton, but dropped out to pursue her music career.

== Career ==
===1986–2004: Career beginnings and No Doubt===

Her brother Eric introduced Gwen to 2 Tone music by Madness and the Selecter, and, in 1986, he invited her to provide vocals for No Doubt, a ska band he was forming. She later became the sole lead singer when the other singer, John Spence, took his own life in December 1987. In 1991, the band was signed to Interscope Records. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1992, but its ska-pop sound was unsuccessful due to the popularity of grunge. Before the mainstream success of both No Doubt and Sublime, Stefani contributed guest vocals to &quot;Saw Red&quot; on Sublime&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot;. Stefani rejected the aggressiveness of female grunge artists and cited Blondie singer Debbie Harry&#x27;s combination of power and sex appeal as a major influence. No Doubt&#x27;s third album, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; (1995), which followed the self-released &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; (1995), took more than three years to make. Five singles were released from &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, which led the Hot 100 Airplay year-end chart of 1997. Stefani left college for one semester to tour for &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; but did not return when touring lasted two and a half years. The album was nominated for a Grammy and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide by 2004. In late 2000, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named her &quot;the Queen of Confessional Pop&quot;.

During the time when No Doubt was receiving mainstream success, Stefani collaborated on the singles &quot;You&#x27;re the Boss&quot; with the Brian Setzer Orchestra, &quot;South Side&quot; with Moby, and &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; with Eve. No Doubt released the less popular &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; in 2000, which expanded upon the new wave influences of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;. Most of the lyrical content focused on Stefani&#x27;s often rocky relationship with then-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and her insecurities, including indecision on settling down and having a child. The band&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, explored more reggae and dancehall sounds, while maintaining the band&#x27;s new wave influences. The album generated career-highest singles chart positions in the United States, and &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot; received Grammy Awards. A greatest hits collection, &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, which includes a cover of Talk Talk&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, was released in 2003. In 2002, Eve and Stefani won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot;.

===2004–2006: Solo debut and other ventures===

Stefani&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, was released on November 12, 2004. The album features several collaborations with producers and other artists, including Tony Kanal, Tom Rothrock, Linda Perry, André 3000, Nellee Hooper, the Neptunes and New Order. Stefani created the album to modernize the music she had listened to in high school, and &quot;L.A.M.B.&quot; takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as new wave, synthpop, and electro. Stefani&#x27;s decision to use her solo career as an opportunity to delve further into pop music instead of trying &quot;to convince the world of [her] talent, depth and artistic worth&quot; was considered unusual. The album was described as &quot;fun as hell but... not exactly rife with subversive social commentary&quot;. The album debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart at number seven, selling 309,000 copies in its first week. &quot;L.A.M.B.&quot; reached multi-platinum status in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.

The first single from the album was &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, which debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart, charted at number 47 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top ten on most other charts. The song served to explain why Stefani produced a solo album and discusses her fears in leaving No Doubt for a solo career as well as her desire to have a baby. &quot;Rich Girl&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. A duet with rapper Eve, and produced by Dr. Dre, it is an adaptation of a 1990s pop song by British musicians Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One, which itself is a very loose cover lyrically but closer melodically of &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;, from the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. &quot;Rich Girl&quot; reached the US and UK top ten. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; became Stefani&#x27;s first US and second Australian number-one single; it reached top ten elsewhere. The song was the first US music download to sell more than one million copies, and its brass-driven composition remained popular throughout 2005. The fourth single &quot;Cool&quot; was released shortly following the popularity of its predecessor, reaching the top 20 in US and UK. The song&#x27;s lyrics and its accompanying music video, filmed on Lake Como, depict Stefani&#x27;s former relationship with Kanal. &quot;Luxurious&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. &quot;Crash&quot; was released in January 2006 as the album&#x27;s sixth single in lieu of &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;″s sequel, which Stefani postponed because of her pregnancy.

In 2004, Stefani showed interest in making film appearances and began auditioning for films such as &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. She made her film debut playing Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot; in 2004. Scorsese, whose daughter was a No Doubt fan, showed reciprocal interest in casting Stefani after seeing her picture from a Marilyn Monroe-inspired photo shoot for &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; in 2003. To prepare for the role, Stefani read two biographies and watched 18 of Harlow&#x27;s films. Shooting her part took four to five days, and Stefani had few lines. Stefani lent her voice to the title character of the 2004 video game &quot;Malice&quot;, but the company opted not to use No Doubt band members&#x27; voices.

===2006–2013: &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; and return to No Doubt===

Stefani&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;, was released on December 1, 2006. Stefani continued working with Kanal, Perry, and the Neptunes, along with Akon and Tim Rice-Oxley from English rock band Keane. The album focuses more heavily on electronic and dance music for clubs than its predecessor. Its release coincided with the DVD release of Stefani&#x27;s first tour, entitled &quot;Harajuku Lovers Live&quot;. Sia Michel wrote that it &quot;has a surprisingly moody, lightly autobiographical feel ... but Stefani isn&#x27;t convincing as a dissatisfied diva&quot; and Rob Sheffield called the album a &quot;hasty return&quot; that repeats &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; with less energy.

&quot;Wind It Up&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, used yodeling and an interpolation of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and peaked in the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track reached the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; &quot;4 in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Now That You Got It&quot; which featured Damian Marley and &quot;Early Winter&quot;. To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated that she had no plans to continue work as a solo artist.

With Stefani promoting &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;, No Doubt began work on a new album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani&#x27;s Sweet Escape Tour was finished. In March 2008, the band started making posts concerning the progression of the album on their official fan forum. Stefani made a post on March 28, 2008, stating that songwriting had commenced but was slow on her end because she was pregnant with her second child. &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; became available on December 9, 2008, for the video game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;. Adrian Young played drums on Scott Weiland&#x27;s album &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot;. No Doubt headlined the Bamboozle 2009 festival in May 2009, along with Fall Out Boy. The band completed a national tour in mid-2009.

The new album &quot;Push and Shove&quot; was released on September 25, preceded by the first single, &quot;Settle Down&quot;, on July 16. The music video for &quot;Settle Down&quot; was directed by Sophie Muller (who has previously directed numerous music videos for No Doubt). Also around this time No Doubt were guest mentors for the UK version of &quot;The X-Factor&quot;. &quot;Settle Down&quot; peaked at 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the album peaking at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On November 3, 2012, the band pulled its music video &quot;Looking Hot&quot; from the Internet after receiving complaints that it was insensitive towards Native Americans. In January 2013, No Doubt make a cameo appearance in a hot air ballon for the third season of &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

===2014–2017: Comeback with &quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot; ===

On April 12, 2014, Stefani made a surprise appearance at the Coachella festival, where she joined Pharrell Williams onstage during his set to perform &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot;. On April 29, it was officially confirmed that Stefani would join the seventh season of &quot;The Voice&quot; as a coach, replacing Christina Aguilera. Nine years after the previous time, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Stefani appears as a featured artist on Maroon 5&#x27;s song &quot;My Heart Is Open&quot;, co-written by Sia, from the band&#x27;s album &quot;V&quot;, which was performed for the first time with Adam Levine and an orchestra at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Stefani also collaborated with Calvin Harris on the track &quot;Together&quot; from his album &quot;Motion&quot;.

On September 8, 2014, Stefani told MTV News during New York Fashion Week that she was working on both a No Doubt album and a solo album, and that she was working with Williams. Stefani released her comeback single &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; on October 20, 2014, co-written with producers Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella. &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that her third studio album was set to be released in December with Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. In late October, &quot;Spark the Fire&quot;, a new track from Stefani&#x27;s third album, was released. The song was produced by Pharrell Williams. On November 23, the full song premiered online. Both &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; and &quot;Spark the Fire&quot; were later scrapped from Stefani&#x27;s third album. On January 13, 2015, Stefani and Williams also recorded a song titled &quot;Shine&quot;, for the &quot;Paddington&quot; soundtrack. Stefani and Sia worked together on a ballad, called &quot;Start a War&quot; which was expected to be released on Stefani&#x27;s third studio album as well, but it was not included on the final cut. On July 10, 2015, American rapper Eminem featured Stefani on his single &quot;Kings Never Die&quot;, from the &quot;Southpaw&quot; film soundtrack. The track debuted and peaked at number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and matched first-week digital download sales of 35,000 copies.

On October 17, 2015, Stefani performed a concert as part of her MasterCard Priceless Surprises tour series at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, where she performed a new song about her breakup with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, titled &quot;Used to Love You&quot;. It was released as a download on October 20, 2015. The video was released the same day. The song was released to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 27, 2015. The track is the first official single off her third solo album &quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot;, which she began working on in mid-2015. Stefani said much of the previous material she worked on in 2014 felt forced and inauthentic, the opposite of what she had originally wanted. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Make Me Like You&quot;, was released on February 12, 2016. &quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot; was released on March 18, 2016, and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 84,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week, earning Stefani her first number-one album on the U.S. chart as a solo artist. To further promote the album, Stefani embarked on her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in the United States. Stefani voiced DJ Suki in the animated film &quot;Trolls&quot;, which was released on November 4, 2016. She is also included on five songs from the . Stefani twice performed as part of the &quot;Final Shows&quot; at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on October 29–30, before the venue&#x27;s closure due to The Irvine Company not renewing the venue&#x27;s land lease.

Stefani was interviewed for the documentary series &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, which was released in July 2017. The same month, she announced plans to release new music by the end of the year. In August, several song titles from the singer&#x27;s sessions were published on GEMA&#x27;s official website, suggesting that she may be recording a holiday album. The songwriting credits from the leaked tracks had Stefani collaborating with busbee, Blake Shelton, and Justin Tranter. The album, titled &quot;You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot;, was released on October 6, 2017. Its title track, featuring guest vocals from Shelton, was digitally distributed on September 22, 2017, as the lead single. To promote the record, Stefani hosted &quot;Gwen Stefani&#x27;s You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot;, an NBC Christmas television special that aired on December 12, 2017.

===2018–present: Las Vegas residency, &quot;The Voice&quot; and &quot;Bouquet&quot;===

Stefani&#x27;s first concert residency, titled Just a Girl: Las Vegas, began on June 27, 2018, at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas. It was originally scheduled to conclude on May 16, 2020, but the final eight shows were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show concluded on November 6, 2021. It was named after No Doubt&#x27;s song &quot;Just a Girl&quot;. Proceeds from the show ($1 per ticket) were donated to the organization Cure4Kids. A deluxe edition of &quot;You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot; was released in October 2018, and was promoted through the single &quot;Secret Santa&quot;. On June 22, 2019, Stefani performed at the Machaca Fest in Fundidora Park.

Stefani replaced Adam Levine as a coach for &quot;The Voice&quot;″s 17th season after Levine left the show after 16 seasons. Stefani was replaced by first-time coach Nick Jonas for the 18th season. She returned for her fifth season of &quot;The Voice&quot; 19th season as a replacement for Jonas. Her finalist Carter Rubin was named the winner, giving her the first victory as a coach after her fifth attempt, and the ninth coach (and fourth female after Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, and Kelly Clarkson) to do so.

On December 13, 2019, Stefani featured on Shelton&#x27;s single &quot;Nobody but You&quot; from his compilation album &quot;Fully Loaded: God&#x27;s Country&quot;. The song peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and 49 on the Canadian Hot 100. On July 24, 2020, Stefani and Shelton released another single titled &quot;Happy Anywhere&quot; inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic. Stefani was initially scheduled to perform at Lollapalooza&#x27;s 2020 festival, but it was postponed due to the pandemic. Lollapalooza was held as a four-day livestream in July and August 2020, but Stefani did not participate in it.

Stefani was featured on a Mark Ronson remix of Dua Lipa&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot;, which is included on Lipa&#x27;s remix album &quot;Club Future Nostalgia&quot; (2020). Stefani was initially approached to clear a &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; sample for the Mr Fingers&#x27; remix of Lipa&#x27;s &quot;Hallucinate&quot;, and then asked to be a part of the &quot;Physical&quot; remix. To promote 2020 reissued edition of &quot;You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot;, Stefani released a cover of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; as a single.

==Other ventures==
Stefani made most of the clothing that she wore on stage with No Doubt, resulting in increasingly eclectic combinations. Stylist Andrea Lieberman introduced her to haute couture clothing, which led to Stefani launching a fashion line named L.A.M.B. in 2004. The line takes influence from a variety of fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself. In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as &quot;a glorified merchandise line&quot;, with varied products including a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments. In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion dolls&quot;. The dolls are inspired by the clothes Stefani and the Harajuku Girls wore while touring for the album.

In late 2007, Stefani launched a perfume, L, as a part of her L.A.M.B. collection of clothing and accessories. The perfume has high notes of sweet pea and rose. In September 2008, Stefani released a fragrance line as a part of her Harajuku Lovers product line. There are five different fragrances based on the four Harajuku Girls and Stefani herself called Love, Lil&#x27; Angel, Music, Baby and G (Gwen). , Stefani has become the spokesperson for L&#x27;Oréal Paris. In 2016, Urban Decay released a limited edition cosmetic collection in collaboration with Stefani. After needing to wear glasses, she began designing eyewear. In 2016, Gwen began releasing eyewear under her fashion label L.A.M.B. She also began releasing affordable eyewear under the label GX, with Tura Inc.

In 2014, Stefani announced the production of an animated series about her and the Harajuku Girls. Along with Vision Animation and Moody Street Kids, Stefani has helped create the show which features herself, Love, Angel, Music, and Baby as the band, HJ5, who fight evil whilst trying to pursue their music career. Mattel was the global toy licensee and the series itself, &quot;Kuu Kuu Harajuku&quot; was distributed worldwide by DHX Media.

In 2018, Stefani had reportedly filed to trademark P8NT for a potential line of &quot;make-up, skincare, fragrance and hair dyes&quot;, and in March 2022, she launched a makeup brand called GXVE Beauty.

==Artistry==
AXS called Stefani a &quot;powerhouse&quot; vocalist with an &quot;incredible&quot; range. &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered Stefani&#x27;s vocals &quot;mannered&quot; and commended her for &quot;kick[ing] her vibrato addiction&quot;. IGN described Stefani as having a &quot;unique vocal prowess&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that Stefani had a &quot;brash alto&quot;.

Stefani&#x27;s debut album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; took influence from a variety of 1980s genres, which included electropop, new wave, dance-rock, hip hop, R&amp;B, soul, and disco music. Stefani cited early Madonna, Lisa Lisa, Club Nouveau, Prince, New Order and the Cure as major influences for the album. Several of the album&#x27;s tracks were designed for clubs, and contained electro beats meant for dancing. Referencing fashion and wealth in the album, the singer name-drops several designers who she considered inspirations in her personal career, such as John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood. Her second studio album &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; resembles musically its predecessor while exploring more modern pop sounds, dabbling heavily into genres such as dance-pop and rap. It carried on the same themes developed in &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, and was criticized for doing so.

&quot;This Is What the Truth Feels Like&quot;, the singer&#x27;s third album, continued Stefani&#x27;s endeavors with the pop genre, while incorporating music from a variety of other genres including reggae, disco, and dancehall, as well as the use of guitars. Stefani&#x27;s lyrics shifted towards events that had recently occurred in her personal life, such as her divorce from Rossdale, and new relationship with Shelton. The singer stated her album was more about forgiveness than revenge.

==Public image==

Stefani began wearing a bindi in the mid-1990s after attending several family gatherings with Tony Kanal, who is of Indian heritage. During No Doubt&#x27;s breakthrough, she wore the forehead decoration in several of the band&#x27;s music videos and briefly popularized it as an accessory. Since the 1995 music video for &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, Stefani has been known for her midriff and frequently wears tops that expose it. Her makeup design generally includes light face powder, bright red lipstick, and arched eyebrows; she wrote about the subject in the song &quot;Magic&#x27;s in the Makeup&quot; on the album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. Stefani is a natural brunette, but her hair has not been its natural color since she was in ninth grade. Since late 1994, she has usually had platinum blonde hair. Stefani discussed this in the song &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; on &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and played original blonde bombshell Jean Harlow in the 2004 biopic &quot;The Aviator&quot;. She dyed her hair blue in 1998 and pink in 1999; she appeared on the cover of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; with pink hair.

In 2006, Stefani modified her image, inspired by that of Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s character Elvira Hancock in the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. The reinvented image included a symbol consisting of two back-to-back &#x27;G&#x27;s, which appears on a diamond-encrusted key she wears on a necklace and which became a motif in the promotion of &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;. Stefani raised concerns in January 2007 about her rapid weight loss following her pregnancy. She later stated that she had been on a diet since the sixth grade to fit in size 4 clothing. A wax figure of Stefani was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas at The Venetian on September 22, 2010. The release of Stefani&#x27;s first solo album brought attention to her entourage of four Harajuku Girls, who appear in outfits influenced by Gothic Lolita fashion, and are named for the area around the Harajuku Station of Tokyo. Stefani&#x27;s clothing also took influence from Japanese fashion, in a style described as a combination between Christian Dior and Japan. The dancers are featured in her music videos, press coverage, and on the album cover for &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, with a song named for and dedicated to them on the album. They were also featured in, and the namesake for, Stefani&#x27;s Harajuku Lovers Tour. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that Stefani earned $27 million between June 2007 to June 2008 for her tour, fashion line and commercials, making her the world&#x27;s 10th highest paid music personality at the time.

== Achievements and legacy ==

Throughout her career as a solo artist, Stefani has won several music awards, including one Grammy Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, one American Music Award, one Brit Award, and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. With No Doubt, she has won two Grammy Awards. In 2005, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called her &quot;the only true female rock star left on radio or MTV&quot; and featured her on the magazine&#x27;s cover. Stefani received the Style Icon Award at the first People Magazine Awards in 2014. In 2016, the singer was honored at the Radio Disney Music Awards with a Hero Award, which is given to artists based on their personal contributions to various charitable works. In 2023, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2023, she was inducted into the inaugural Orange County Hall of Fame.

Stefani has been referred to as a &quot;Pop Princess&quot; by several contemporary music critics. In 2012, VH1 listed the singer at the number thirteen on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot;. Stefani&#x27;s work has influenced artists and musicians including Hayley Williams of Paramore, Best Coast, Kim Petras, Teddy Sinclair, Katy Perry, Charli XCX, Kesha, Ava Max, Marina Diamandis, Rita Ora, Keke Palmer, Bebe Rexha, Dua Lipa, the Stunners, Kelly Clarkson, Sky Ferreira, Kirstin Maldonado of Pentatonix, Olivia Rodrigo, and Cover Drive. The latter group, a quartet of Barbados musicians, claimed that both Stefani and No Doubt had helped influence their music, to which the lead singer of the group, Amanda Reifer, said that she would &quot;pass out&quot; if she ever met Stefani.

The lead single from &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, was considered by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; to be one of Stefani&#x27;s best singles, and would later place it at number sixteen on their &quot;Top 50 Singles of 2004&quot; list. &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; from &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; would go on to be the first song to digitally sell an excess of one million copies in the United States; it was certified platinum in both the United States and Australia, and peaked at number forty-one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s decade-end charts for 2000–09. Since its release in 2005, &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; has been called Stefani&#x27;s &quot;signature song&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Philanthropy==

Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Stefani donated $1 million to Save the Children&#x27;s Japan Earthquake–Tsunami Children in Emergency Fund. Stefani also ran an auction on eBay from April 11 to 25, 2011, allowing participants to bid on vintage clothing items from her personal wardrobe and custom T-shirts designed and signed by her, as well as an admission to a private Harajuku-themed tea party hosted by her on June 7, 2011, at Los Angeles&#x27; first Japanese-style maid café and pop art space, Royal/T, with proceeds from the auction going to Save the Children&#x27;s relief effort.

At the amfAR gala during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Stefani auctioned off the lacy black dress she wore at the event for charity, raising over $125,000. A representative for designer Michael Angel, who helped Stefani with the design and worked as a stylist, said that Angel created the gown, not Stefani. In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala. Stefani hosted a fundraiser with First Lady Michelle Obama in August 2012 at the singer&#x27;s Beverly Hills home.

The singer-songwriter supports the LGBT community. When asked in a 2019 &quot;Pride Source&quot; interview about how she would react if one of her children came out as gay, Stefani stated &quot;I would be blessed with a gay son; [...] I just want my boys to be healthy and happy. And I just ask God to guide me to be a good mother, which is not an easy thing at all.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stefani began dating her bandmate Tony Kanal soon after he joined the band. She stated that she was heavily invested in that relationship, saying in 2005, &quot;...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would let me have a baby with him.&quot; The band almost split up when Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;″s songs, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, and &quot;Hey You!&quot;, chronicle the ups and downs of their relationship. Stefani co-wrote her song &quot;Cool&quot; about their relationship as friends for her 2004 debut solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;

Stefani met Bush lead singer and guitarist Gavin Rossdale in 1995 when No Doubt and Bush performed at a holiday concert for radio station KROQ. They married on September 14, 2002, at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden in London. A second wedding was held in Los Angeles two weeks later. Stefani has three sons with Rossdale, born on May 26, 2006, August 21, 2008, and February 28, 2014. On August 3, 2015, Stefani filed for divorce from Rossdale, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Their divorce was finalized on April 8, 2016, in which Rossdale agreed to the &quot;unequal split&quot; of their assets.
Stefani announced her relationship with Blake Shelton, country music artist and &quot;The Voice&quot; co-star, in November 2015. Stefani and Shelton have collaborated on music numerous times since becoming a couple. In 2015, the musicians co-wrote the song &quot;Go Ahead and Break My Heart&quot; as they navigated the beginning of their relationship. The duet was featured on Shelton&#x27;s 2016 album, &quot;If I&#x27;m Honest&quot;. In 2020, their duets &quot;Nobody But You&quot; and &quot;Happy Anywhere&quot; both reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Country Airplay chart. They also collaborated on the song &quot;You Make It Feel Like Christmas&quot;, featured on Stefani&#x27;s 2017 holiday album of the same name. The couple announced their engagement on October 27, 2020, and married at a chapel on July 3, 2021, at Shelton&#x27;s Oklahoma ranch.

Stefani was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2020.

In a 2023 interview with &quot;Allure&quot; magazine, Stefani stated that her father&#x27;s job had him frequently traveling between California and Japan for 18 years. Speaking about her relationship with Japanese culture, she explained that &quot;That was my Japanese influence and that was a culture that was so rich with tradition, yet so futuristic [with] so much attention to art and detail and discipline and it was fascinating to me&quot;. She had visited Harajuku as an adult and referred to herself as a &quot;super fan&quot; of Japanese culture. In the same interview, Stefani commented that she was Japanese and &quot;identifies not just with Japan&#x27;s culture, but also with the Hispanic and Latin communities of Anaheim, California.&quot; Her comments have garnered criticism of cultural appropriation, with interviewers and writers clarifying that Stefani, who is Irish-American and Italian-American, is not Japanese.

<text>Stanley Melbourne Bruce, 1st Viscount Bruce of Melbourne (15 April 1883 – 25 August 1967) was an Australian politician, statesman and businessman who served as the eighth prime minister of Australia from 1923 to 1929. He held office as the leader of the Nationalist Party, having previously served as the treasurer of Australia from 1921 to 1923.

Born into a briefly wealthy Melbourne family, Bruce studied at the University of Cambridge and played a leading role in his family&#x27;s softgoods firm following the suicide of his father John Munro Bruce. He served on the front lines of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesman for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the Nationalist Party and prime minister Billy Hughes, who encouraged a political career. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1918, becoming member of parliament (MP) for the seat of Flinders. He was appointed as treasurer in 1921, before replacing Hughes as prime minister in 1923. He established an anti-socialist coalition government with the agrarian Country Party, working closely with Country leader Earle Page in an arrangement that pioneered the modern Liberal–National coalition.

In office, Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of Canberra. He implemented various reforms to the Australian federal system to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the Australian Federal Police and the CSIRO. Bruce&#x27;s &quot;men, money and markets&quot; scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia&#x27;s population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the British Empire. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia&#x27;s industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in 1929 prompted members of his own party into crossing the floor to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the 1929 election, Bruce lost his own seat, making him the only sitting prime minister to lose his seat until John Howard&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 election.

Although he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce&#x27;s service in the Lyons government was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the League of Nations, emerging as a tireless advocate for international co-operation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the developing world. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords, as well as the first Chancellor of the Australian National University. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be scattered over Canberra when he died.

==Early life==

Stanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in St Kilda, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children. He disliked his given name and throughout his life preferred to be known by his initials &quot;S.M.&quot;, even among close friends. His wife called him simply &quot;S&quot;. When he became prime minister he issued a note to the press asking newspapers to use his initials and not his given name.

Bruce&#x27;s father, John Munro Bruce, was born to Scottish parents in County Leitrim, Ireland, and had emigrated to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24. John Bruce became a talented businessman with &quot;a flair for buying and selling&quot;, which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce. As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria&#x27;s social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. He was prominent in the liberal protectionist political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister Alfred Deakin. John Bruce&#x27;s success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce&#x27;s birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in Toorak. However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted. Despite their family&#x27;s Presbyterian background, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now Melbourne Grammar School) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as Anglican. Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school, captain of its Australian football team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are scarlet and white. The house&#x27;s mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce&#x27;s bravery.

The economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897. The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley&#x27;s brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness. Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances. His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce&#x27;s beloved brother Ernest the recipient, like Stanley, of an MC for bravery, shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.
In the aftermath of his father&#x27;s death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family&#x27;s business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp &amp; Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.

By 1912 Bruce was a businessman and a successful barrister, and it was in this year Ethel Dunlop Anderson travelled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent squatter family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce&#x27;s interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony. Theirs was a close-knit relationship they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion. But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest&#x27;s daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce &quot;was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy&quot;.

==Military service==

Bruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the Australian Imperial Force. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain. Bruce enlisted and received a commission as a lieutenant on 7 February 1915 and was attached to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in Egypt, which was then assigned to the British 29th Division. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF). First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill had devised a strategy of capturing the Dardanelles from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However allied naval forces were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous Gallipoli Campaign.

Bruce&#x27;s regiment landed at Cape Helles in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the construction of trenches and as an able commander. His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose. He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at Suvla Bay, where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre for his service during these months, and rose to the rank of captain on 5 August. He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.

Although it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business. The War Office refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.

Having served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth. But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with &quot;a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared&quot;.

==Early years in politics==

Bruce&#x27;s popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal Nationalist Party. As Sir William Irvine had recently resigned from parliament to become Chief Justice of Victoria, there was to be a by-election for the Division of Flinders in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for. The Nationalist preselection for the seat attracted many candidates, and Sir Edward Mitchell, one of Australia&#x27;s leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister William Watt prevented the newly formed Country Party from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from Dandenong out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.

Speaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:
A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily shared by the vast majority of the population.
Bruce&#x27;s early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the Commonwealth Line. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies. The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed. Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia&#x27;s two representatives to the League of Nations in 1921 in Geneva, at which he passionately advocated for disarmament and greater international co-operation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League&#x27;s mission and potential for success.

===Treasurer, 1921–1923===
Returning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as Minister for Trade and Customs. Bruce was not interested he was the head of one of Australia&#x27;s largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce&#x27;s surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy-Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Bruce had only been in parliament for three years, yet his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business figures of the party. These figures had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union had also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.

Bruce and Hughes clashed in both style and ideology. Bruce found Hughes&#x27; management of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt that little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But he was a strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.

==Prime Minister, 1923–1929==

The Nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in the Australian House of Representatives in the 1922 election. Only three of these seats were picked up by the Labor Party though, and Labor still lacked the numbers to form government in their own right. Rather, a breakaway anti-Hughes Liberal Party took five government seats, while the Country Party increased their number to 14 and now held the balance of power. The only politically realistic option for the Nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with the Country Party. However, Country Party leader Earle Page refused to support a Nationalist government with Hughes as prime minister, and negotiations throughout January and February failed to break the impasse. Rather than risk being defeated in the legislature, which might have resulted in the Governor-General asking Labor to form government, Hughes surprised his colleagues by announcing his intention to resign on 2 February. With deputy leader Walter Massy-Greene having lost his seat at the 1922 election, Hughes now sent for Bruce to take over as leader of the party. After some reluctance, Bruce finally agreed, although Hughes later regretted the decision and became one of the new prime minister&#x27;s most outspoken detractors.

Bruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government. He convinced Hughes&#x27; long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up the support of the other former National Labor members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as Speaker of the House, effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter. But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of what became known as the Coalition an arrangement of electoral and political co-operation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page. Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however. As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11. Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet. The Nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and taxation policy compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of Bruce&#x27;s party. Page, who would serve as Treasurer and &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister throughout Bruce&#x27;s tenure, would become a great admirer of Bruce, stating, &quot;He was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity, and earned their loyalty as the reward for his wisdom and integrity.&quot;

Bruce took office on 9 February. His appointment as prime minister marked an important turning point in Australian political history. He was the first prime minister who had not been involved in the movement for Federation, who had not been a member of a colonial or state parliament, and who had not been a member of the original 1901 federal parliament. He was, in addition, the first prime minister to head a cabinet consisting entirely of Australian-born ministers. Yet Bruce himself was frequently caricatured in public as &quot;an Englishman who happened to have been born in Australia&quot;. He drove a Rolls-Royce, wore white spats, and was often seen as distant and lacking the common touch: characteristics that did little to personally endear him to the Australian public.

===&quot;Men, money and markets&quot;===

In 1923 Australia was prosperous by comparison with other developed nations of the period, having quickly rebounded economically after World War I. Unemployment and inflation were relatively low by international standards, and Commonwealth revenues had grown significantly since Australia became a federation. Australia was a vast and richly resourced country with fewer than six million inhabitants, and Bruce made it his government&#x27;s priority to develop Australia&#x27;s economy. In his first speech to the House of Representatives as prime minister, he outlined a comprehensive vision for Australia that centred on economic development, reform of the federal system, increased Commonwealth powers over industrial relations, a greater voice for Australia within the British Empire and the establishment of a national capital. He summarised this vision as a program of &quot;men, money and markets&quot;.

According to Bruce, men were needed to allow Australia&#x27;s extensive resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia&#x27;s land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia had the potential to be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys (&quot;passages&quot;). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce&#x27;s settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia&#x27;s rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England&#x27;s) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled.

Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets. In his campaign speech for the 1925 election, Bruce stated:It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble in many parts of the world.

Money was borrowed from Britain to fund the state&#x27;s programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce&#x27;s plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were &quot;conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook&quot; and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character ... Our financial resources are curtailed and there is an immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that we have to look at all our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the co-operation of the Commonwealth for the benefit of the States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.

The Bruce–Page plan of May 1923 put in motion efforts to coordinate state-federal operations in several areas, particularly infrastructure and rural development schemes. The &quot;Main Roads Development Act of 1923&quot; was one of the first and most important legislative accomplishments in this vein. The act leveraged Section 96 of the Constitution of Australia to grant financial assistance to the states by employing it to fund road construction and maintenance according to the plans of the federal transportation portfolio in effect allowing the Commonwealth to operate directly in what was constitutionality the exclusive domain of the state governments. The Act would provide a precedent for many types of &quot;special purpose payments&quot; that became a common feature of Australian federal fiscal relations. Despite some major successes, Bruce was more frequently frustrated by a lack of progress in many key areas of intergovernmental co-operation. The states could not be induced to standardise electrical power schemes, nor unify on track gauges, nor national health insurance despite years of work and solid arguments in favour.

Although men and money had been secured, the markets component of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain&#x27;s trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear was a factor in the Conservative government&#x27;s defeat in the December 1923 election. Baldwin&#x27;s successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce&#x27;s chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.

In 1927, Earle Page handed down the first budget in deficit for the coalition government, and Bruce recognised that Australia&#x27;s economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia&#x27;s level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, to be replaced by a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the &quot;Financial Agreement of 1927&quot;, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.

===Modernising government===

Bruce set about applying his business principles to his cabinet, putting his experience as both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members up to speed on the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.

Bruce also greatly strengthened the research and information-gathering capacity of the executive, and sought to make decisions and policy on the basis of the best available evidence and information. A record 22 Royal Commissions reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the time he left office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.
Under Bruce the Australian government also moved to its new permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated since the time of Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: &quot;For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation ... and sooner or later there would have to be a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices.&quot; This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament&#x27;s opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government&#x27;s time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce&#x27;s consternation.

===Imperial overtures===

Loyal to the concept of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged strengthening it through mutual economic development, greater political co-operation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger co-operation between Great Britain and her dominions in a wide range of areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey&#x27;s aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.

Bruce pushed for greater consultation and voice for the dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied for the creation of a Dominion Office separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce&#x27;s more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy co-operation.

Despite Australia&#x27;s greater representation in London after 1923, Bruce&#x27;s hope for collective imperial decision-making was dashed once more with the British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed with the decision ideologically and on the grounds that once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain&#x27;s and her dominions&#x27; opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the &quot;General Treaty&quot; with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European security arrangements, Bruce had criticised Britain&#x27;s signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was not binding on the dominions.

The 1926 Imperial Conference confirmed that Britain and her dominions were rapidly diverging in interests and that greater independence not greater co-operation was the most practical solution. Bruce recognised the empire had reached a turning point, but despite his optimism for a reinvigorated imperial system, there was little interest from other governments. His plan for greater economic and defensive co-operation was discussed, as well as a revival of imperial preference in trading arrangements, but such ideas were now politically unpalatable in Britain and failed to develop. His attitudes were almost the opposite of those held by the leaders of Canada, South Africa and the Irish Free State. As Prime Minister Baldwin remarked at the conference, &quot;If you, Mr Bruce, would use the word &#x27;Empire&#x27; a bit less and you Mr McGilligan would use it a bit more, then we would make better progress.&quot; Ultimately proposals for greater independence won out, and 1926 Imperial Conference recognised through the Balfour Declaration that dominions were essentially independent entities that freely associated as the British Commonwealth of Nations, though after much negotiation it stopped short of using the terms &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. Governors-General were redefined as representatives only of the British monarch, not the British government, and were obliged now to act only on the advice of their respective dominion governments. These changes were both symbolically and practically significant in the transformation of the dominions from colonies to independent nations. Bruce had mixed feelings about these developments; on the one hand he believed that the Empire was still a strong and vital international organisation playing a positive role in international affairs, but on the other hand he was disappointed that other member nations did not share his vision or commitment to maintaining its integrity and unity. Bruce did have some successes at the conference, however, expanding the work of the Imperial Economic Committee and increasing inter-empire co-operation in technical and scientific areas.

===Industrial relations===

Strikes and industrial unrest were frequent in the aftermath of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organisations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.

Bruce&#x27;s attitudes towards industrial relations were varied, and he was initially unsympathetic to either employer or employee complaints, believing the best resolutions to be those brokered between businesses and their employees. He frequently called upon both sides to embrace a spirit of co-operation. The situation became acute when waterfront workers led by the Seamen&#x27;s Union went on strike in 1925. This had severe and immediate effect on the Australian economy, reliant as it was on sea transportation for its imports and exports, a situation the Prime Minister recognised as untenable. With the union disregarding Commonwealth rulings on the dispute, Bruce rushed through the &quot;Navigation Act&quot; and the &quot;Immigration Act&quot;. The first allowed British and foreign shipping not working under Australian industrial awards to operate in Australian waters (although British vessels working in Australia would soon initiate a strike of their own). The second allowed the Commonwealth to deport any foreign-born person whom a special tribunal found guilty of &quot;disrupting the industrial life of the community&quot;. Key foreign-born strike leaders were immediately targeted for deportation, but New South Wales Premier Jack Lang refused to allow state police to serve summonses on two leading union leaders. Bruce responded with the &quot;Peace Officers Act&quot;, which re-established a Commonwealth police force.

These heavy-handed tactics drew outrage from the Labor Party, which challenged the Prime Minister to seek approval from the people. This Bruce did, and the elections of 1925 were Australia&#x27;s first &quot;red scare&quot; election. He campaigned for industrial peace and an increased Commonwealth role in securing it, but also denounced &quot;foreign agitators&quot; and &quot;class war&quot; in appealing for law and order on the waterfront. He openly challenged pre-existing federal arrangements, stating on the campaign trail that Australia &quot;should now consider whether that great historic instrument, the Constitution, meets the needs of to-day in the light of the developments which have taken place&quot;. The campaign was a success and the Bruce government was easily re-elected, increasing by 11 seats its majority over a disheartened ALP, whose leader Matthew Charlton was in poor health.

&quot;My government was returned to power on a clear issue and with a definite mission ... to introduce measures for the preservation of industrial peace&quot;, Bruce declared during his second term, and called a referendum to amend the Australian Constitution and bring industrial relations under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Attempts to amend the constitution for this purpose had been rejected narrowly in 1911, 1913 and 1919, but against a background of ongoing industrial strife, Bruce made clear the problems of mixed jurisdiction, confusing dual-awards, and insufficient regulatory and enforcement powers at the Commonwealth level. Controversially, he also formulated an &quot;essential services&quot; question to be put at the same time, giving the government the power to protect the public from any &quot;actual or probable disruption to essential services&quot;. These proposals drew hostile reception from many quarters even from future conservative prime minister Robert Menzies and both the Australian Labor Party and conservative groups were divided in opinion on the amendments, with the ALP eventually taking no fixed position on the questions. But by September the issue had drawn so much controversy and ill-feeling that it was no surprise for many commentators that the proposals failed to attract sufficient popular support to overcome the high bar for constitutional change.
The problems of industrial unrest continued to flare up, and the waterfront remained a flashpoint. In a review of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1928, Bruce required industrial courts to consider the economic effects of its awards in addition to the welfare of worker. Immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds. New industrial action led by the Waterside Workers Federation broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the &quot;red scare&quot; pitch for the 1928 election campaign, Bruce pushed the &quot;Transport Workers Act&quot; through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations. All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or &quot;dog collars&quot; as they were derisively known, to work. The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.

At the 1928 election Bruce&#x27;s government was returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists&#x27; parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed the leadership of the ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.

===Maritime industries crisis===
As early as 1927 economic indicators were signalling the onset of a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall in the cost of living. Australia&#x27;s debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia&#x27;s export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia&#x27;s credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce&#x27;s grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.

To make matters worse for the government, industrial unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised as one of the parliament&#x27;s most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister&#x27;s own party was breaking down underneath him. There had been no official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government&#x27;s existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, as a result of by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government&#x27;s most ardent opponents in 1929.

Worsening economic conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 Newcastle-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at Pelaw Main and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General John Latham pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate an end to the dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce&#x27;s own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.

Bruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that &quot;economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations.&quot; Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration. The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce&#x27;s own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states. Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration. For Bruce, the only inconceivable outcome now was that the status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged. The opposition to the proposal, which the Prime Minister introduced to the parliament as the &quot;Maritime Industries Bill&quot;, was swift and fierce. In 1929 over 150 unions and 700,000 workers were covered by Commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries although there was dissatisfaction in the coal and timber sectors, most were happy with their arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards. He defended his actions as being necessary to create certainty and end the duplication that had caused so many problems in recent years.

Other government decisions in 1929 had attracted controversy as well. Page handed down his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning debt crisis and introduced a new tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The tax was very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the &quot;Brigden Report&quot; of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.

The second reading of the &quot;Maritime Industries Bill&quot; passed by only four votes, with Hughes, Edward Mann and George Maxwell voting against the government. Hughes moved an amendment to the bill that stipulated it should only take effect after being approved by the people at a referendum or general election. Bruce ruled out any referendum, stating that the amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government and urged his party to vote it down. Nationalist MP Walter Marks and Independent MP William McWilliams joined the opposition, giving the opposition a one-vote majority. Bruce and his supporters now lobbied the Speaker, Sir Littleton Groom to make a deliberative vote in committee to tie the numbers, leaving the Committee chairman James Bayley with the casting (and presumably pro-government) vote. Groom refused, citing long-standing Westminster (though not Australian) parliamentary tradition of the speaker&#x27;s impartiality. Groom&#x27;s bitterness at having been dismissed by Bruce from the job of Attorney-General in 1925 had a significant bearing on his later decision.

A snap election was called, with Bruce taking his case to the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.

In the event, the government was soundly defeated on 12 October, losing more than half its seats in parliament. To add to his humiliation, Bruce was defeated in his own seat of Flinders by Labor challenger Jack Holloway. On paper, there was no indication that Bruce was in any danger of losing his seat; he held Flinders with a reasonably safe majority of 10.7 percent in 1928. However, on the second count Holloway picked up enough preferences from an independent Liberal candidate to give him the victory. Bruce was the first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat, a feat which would not be repeated until 2007. He was measured in defeat however, stating, &quot;The people have said they do not want my services, and I am going into the banishment to which they have sent me.&quot;

==Return to cabinet, 1931–1933==

Bruce returned to England after his defeat to holiday and attend to his business. Sir John Latham, took over as leader of the Nationalists. With the stock market crash in 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression in Australia, Bruce commented to his colleagues that their defeat was probably fortunate. But he ardently defended his government&#x27;s record, maintaining that the economic crisis was inevitable and that his own policies were justified attempts to try to strengthen the Australian economy. It was this defence that he mounted in April 1931 when he announced he would return to politics and seek to regain his seat of Flinders at the next election. By now the Nationalists had regrouped as the United Australia Party (UAP) under Joseph Lyons, who had defected with several others from the embattled Scullin government.

In November 1931 the Scullin government was defeated in parliament over its controversial Premiers&#x27; Plan, catching Bruce by surprise as he was in England attending to Paterson, Laing and Bruce affairs when a new election was called. The Scullin government was subsequently defeated in a landslide, losing a then-record 32 seats; the two Labor factions were cut down to only 18 seats between them. With Holloway having abandoned Flinders to run in the much friendlier Melbourne Ports, Bruce was returned &quot;in absentia&quot; to his old seat, regaining it with a swing of 18.5 percent. He was appointed assistant treasurer in the new Lyons government, Lyons having taken the treasury portfolio personally. Lyons leaned heavily on Bruce and Latham in his first six months of government, though Bruce had by now set his sights on international affairs rather than the domestic crisis.

Bruce led the Australian delegation to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain&#x27;s entry in the European Common Market in 1973.

After the success of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons appointed Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel&#x27;s home for the rest of their lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia&#x27;s burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government&#x27;s budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons&#x27; health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.

==High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, 1933–1945==

In September 1933, Bruce was appointed by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was due in part to the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia&#x27;s most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.

===League of Nations===

Bruce represented Australia at the League of Nations and successfully lobbied for Australia to participate as a member of the League Council from 1933 to 1936. He opposed action against Japan following the invasion of Manchuria in 1933, concerned as to Australia&#x27;s trading relationship with Japan and the potential future threat it posed to peace in the Pacific. He also attempted to steer the League away from sanctioning member nations, believing it yet lacked the military or economic sway to do so effectively and feared the breakdown of the League a prospect that loomed after Germany and Japan departed the body in 1933. During the Abyssinia Crisis, Bruce again counselled against partial sanctions, believing them the worst option as they would not stop the Ethiopian invasion and yet would alienate Italy then a potential ally against a rearming Nazi Germany. He further argued for much greater rearmament efforts in the United Kingdom and France to provide greater military capacity to enforce future decisions by the League. Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the Hoare–Laval Pact between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the Rhineland Crisis, although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions. He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 Montreux Conference, which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the Turkish Straits an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign. Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.P. Walters would later describe Bruce as &quot;the best, perhaps, of the many first-rate chairmen who presided over the Council, Conferences, or Committees of the League&quot;.

By 1937 Bruce&#x27;s attention had shifted to social and economic co-operation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large. He had taken a leading role in promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic co-operation through the League of Nations, working intensively with Frank L. McDougall and John Boyd Orr throughout the decade. In 1937 he presented a plan of &quot;economic appeasement&quot;, which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy. In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the Marshall Plan, Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism. 

I feel very strongly that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position ... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.

The plan was supported by Secretary-General Joseph Louis Anne Avenol, who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan. Critically, new British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into the development of the League, and the body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce&#x27;s earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international co-operation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.

===World War II===

In the events leading up to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement exercised with regards to the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the Anschluss and the Munich Crisis. Even during the &quot;phoney war&quot;, Bruce continued to advocate the implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament, the expansion of transnational trade, and global organisations capable of addressing the pressing social and economic questions that he felt were the recurrent causes of international conflict. He had become a close confidant of senior Conservative Party figures Anthony Eden and Neville Chamberlain in this period, and was strident in advancing the opinion of Australia (and the dominions more broadly) that negotiation and compromise with Nazi Germany was preferable to war. Bruce actively participated in the negotiations for the Munich Agreement. When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an independent and lead an all-party unity government. Such conditions were politically impossible to meet, and Robert Menzies was elected as the new leader of the UAP.
Britain&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain&#x27;s declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany. Winston Churchill&#x27;s accession as British Prime Minister in May 1940 brought Bruce into frequent conflict with the British government. Churchill saw the dominions as still semi-dependent colonies who were at London&#x27;s command whereas Bruce saw the Empire as a kind of international partnership and the dominions as rightful parties to the decision-making process. Britain&#x27;s preoccupation with the European theatre alarmed Australian politicians, given the tenuous position of Far Eastern possessions and the looming possibility of Japanese invasion.

After a string of defeats in the Far East, particularly the Fall of Singapore, the Australian government was finally successful in having Bruce accredited to the British War Cabinet and Pacific War Council as an Australian (and dominion) representative. 
However, Bruce soon became embroiled in the disputes over Churchill&#x27;s autocratic leadership style and his lack of consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.

==Food and Agriculture Organization, 1946–1951==

By the war&#x27;s end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin&#x27;s successor Ben Chifley that he would not object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and China that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international co-operation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of Eleanor Roosevelt, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs, Virginia, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.

As the war in Europe drew to a close and the United Nations Charter was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce&#x27;s name was among those being considered to become the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, with American Secretary of State Dean Acheson and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy. Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions. In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a &quot;world food board&quot; to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages. He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a world food reserve and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need. Bruce&#x27;s Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernisation, international development aid, commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947. The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.

Undeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.

==Later life==

Bruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956. He became the first Chancellor of the newly established Australian National University in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific. Bruce concluded that Australia&#x27;s position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:
[Australia] has become a bridgehead between East and West. It is now vital that Australia should understand the problems of the East, that she should do whatever is in her power to alleviate those problems, and that she should interpret the nature of those problems to the rest of the world.
The residential college Bruce Hall was named in his honour, and he remained active in the life of the university until his retirement from the position in 1961. Bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement, notably the National Bank of Australia, P&amp;O and the National Mutual Life Association. In 1947 he became the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords (Sir John Forrest had been granted a peerage but died before it could be invested).

Having been elevated to the peerage as &quot;Viscount Bruce of Melbourne&quot; by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, he would be an active participant in the chamber, attending regularly until his death. Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating. He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of Leander Club, while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.

==Death==

Bruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of deafness, but the death of his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of Billy Hughes&#x27; Cabinet. His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were scattered over Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him.

==Legacy and evaluation==

Despite his many accomplishments both at home and abroad, Bruce&#x27;s post-prime ministerial career was not well known in Australia, and most still harboured memories of his harsh anti-union legislation and his government&#x27;s landslide defeat in 1929. His public persona was one of an aloof man, too English for Australia in style and bearing. Upon his death in 1967, &quot;The Age&quot; of his hometown Melbourne remarked that &quot;for most Australians, he is little more than a shadow.&quot; Bruce spent much of his life and career in the United Kingdom, the country that conversely held him in high regard, but never forgot his Australian roots and for much of his career was a tireless advocate for its interests. In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world&#x27;s poorest.

Bruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition for these efforts. Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and &quot;forever buying into things that aren&#x27;t really my concern&quot;. But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both as prime minister and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir John Cockcroft to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was &quot;probably the outstanding Australian of our time&quot;. The &quot;Melbourne Sun&quot; agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was &quot;probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers&quot;.

<text>Rock Steady is the fifth studio album by American rock band No Doubt, released on December 11, 2001, by Interscope Records. The band began writing the album with initial recording sessions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, then traveled to London and Jamaica to work with various performers, songwriters, and producers. Sly &amp; Robbie, the Neptunes, and William Orbit were among the many artists the band collaborated with on the album.

As a result of these collaborations, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; touches on many musical styles, focusing on electropop, dancehall, and new wave. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation. Lead vocalist Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics quickly in comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale.

&quot;Rock Steady&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. The album was a commercial comeback for the band, surpassing sales of their previous album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; (2000). &quot;Rock Steady&quot; spawned four singles, two of which won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Rock Steady&quot; number 316 on its 2003 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background and production==
Every night on the tour to support their 2000 album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, No Doubt threw after-show parties where people danced to Jamaican dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont&#x27;s apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of &quot;Hey Baby&quot; emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed &quot;or find different words that inspire me.&quot; In contrast, for &quot;Rock Steady&quot; she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the &quot;initial spark&quot; from when the songs were conceived.

The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording &quot;Detective&quot;. There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song &quot;Underneath It All&quot; in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band &quot;spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music&quot;, according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track. They began work in the mid-afternoon and worked into the night, with an after-party following the session. The group collaborated with Sly &amp; Robbie, who produced &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and brought in dancehall toasters Lady Saw and Bounty Killer, and Steely &amp; Clevie, who produced &quot;Start the Fire&quot;.

The band returned from Jamaica and resumed work in June 2001, collaborating with producers Nellee Hooper and Timbaland. The Timbaland track, titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Fight&quot;, and a Dr. Dre-produced song titled &quot;Wicked Day&quot; were excluded from the album because their hip hop sounds did not work well on the album. The band then worked with producer and former Cars frontman Ric Ocasek in late June. Stefani commented that No Doubt worked with so many people for the record because none were available for the time needed to make an LP, but that she would have liked to work with Ocasek longer. The band and its A&amp;R manager Mark Williams chose collaborators based on how well they thought the person would fit the personality of the song that No Doubt had written. In late August, the band returned to London for Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent to polish off the songs with audio mixing.

==Music and lyrics==
The band members often did not play their standard instruments when working on the songs for &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. As a result, the album&#x27;s instrumentation contains less guitar and bass guitar than the band&#x27;s previous work. Many of the album&#x27;s sounds come from electronic keyboard effects, which bassist Tony Kanal called &quot;Devo-y bleeps and &quot;Star Wars&quot; noises&quot;. Dumont commented that many of the effects came from being unfamiliar with the equipment and &quot;just twiddling knobs&quot;. Dumont created an effect similar to that of an echo chamber by placing a microphone inside a metal garbage can with the can&#x27;s open end facing a drum kit. Richard B. Simon of MTV News asserted that the sound of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; was part of the decade nostalgia of the 1980s retro movement.

Stefani&#x27;s vocals range from innocent to seductive, sometimes transitioning from one to the other within a song. Her lyrics are based on her relationship with Rossdale, whom she married less than a year after the album&#x27;s release. Stefani is openhearted and unreserved as on &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, but her approach becomes more immediate and instinctive. The lyrics are more youthful than those on &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; and detail partying and feelings of lust. An overarching theme on the album is Stefani&#x27;s impatience in the couple&#x27;s long-distance relationship. She discusses wanting to see Rossdale on &quot;Making Out&quot; and &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, and she reveals her distrust in Rossdale on &quot;In My Head&quot;. On &quot;Hey Baby&quot; she gives an innocuous account of the debauchery between her bandmates and their groupies during parties, as she observes the party. The lyrics of &quot;Underneath It All&quot; question whether or not Rossdale is a good match for her, an issue resolved in the chorus, which was written based on a journal entry where Stefani wrote the line &quot;You&#x27;re lovely underneath it all&quot; about Rossdale.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; incorporates electropop, dancehall, new wave, reggae, and dance-pop. The album maintains many of the styles present in No Doubt&#x27;s previous work, while introducing influences from the music of Jamaica. &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Start the Fire&quot; all feature dancehall and ragga, an electronic-oriented subgenre, as well as guest toasters. The latter, written using backward string samples, also contains the band&#x27;s traditional ska and reggae sounds. Ocasek produced the new wave-influenced tracks &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, the former of which was described as sounding &quot;more like the Cars than the Cars&quot;. &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; was so strongly influenced by the Cars&#x27; work that Kanal apologized to Ocasek, though Ocasek apologized back that he had not seen the similarity. The synth-pop ballad &quot;Running&quot; was composed on a Yamaha keyboard purchased for Kanal in the 1980s and drew inspiration from the Thompson Twins. Its simple keyboard riff drew comparisons to the work of Depeche Mode, Erasure, and Yazoo.

Because of the number of collaborations, the album touches on several other styles. &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, a song written and sung with Prince for &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, evokes his R&amp;B style over a drum and bass beat. &quot;Hella Good&quot;, an electro-rock song co-written with hip hop production duo the Neptunes, is inspired by the funk songs of the late 1970s such as Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; and the Commodores&#x27; &quot;Brick House&quot;. William Orbit, best known for his work on Madonna&#x27;s electronica-oriented 1998 album &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, incorporates trance music in the production of &quot;Making Out&quot;. &quot;Detective&quot;, one of the five tracks produced by Hooper, takes slight influence from pop music. The album&#x27;s title track closes the album by tying together the many musical themes. It is a slow dub song, with acid house-style bleeps and moans.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Hey Baby&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Rock Steady&quot; in October 2001. The song peaked number at five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while reaching the top five in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Norway. The positive response to &quot;Hey Baby&quot; from radio stations and video channels prompted the band to push forward the release of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; from December 18 to December 11. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hella Good&quot;, was released on April 13, 2002, reaching number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also charted at number eight in Australia and number 12 in the UK.

&quot;Underneath It All&quot; was released as the third single on August 15, 2002. It became No Doubt&#x27;s highest-peaking single in the US to date, reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Internationally, the single saw limited success, reaching number eight in New Zealand, number 18 in the UK and number 28 in Australia. &quot;Running&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single on July 1, 2003. Peaking at number 62, &quot;Running&quot; became the band&#x27;s lowest-peaking single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 to date.

Following the success of the standard edition, two reissues of &quot;Rock Steady&quot;—a limited edition and a special edition—were released in October 2002, each of which including a bonus disc. The limited edition, released in North America, features acoustic live performances of &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Just a Girl&quot; recorded at 1LIVE in Cologne, Germany, in June 2002, as well as the music video for &quot;Underneath It All&quot;. The special edition, released in Europe, includes a remix of &quot;Hey Baby&quot; featuring Outkast and Killer Mike and another remix by F.A.B.Z.; Roger Sanchez&#x27;s remix of &quot;Hella Good&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2003; and a remix of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;″s lead single &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; by Philip Steir, who helped produce &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. The songs from the two-song bonus disc were released through North American iTunes Stores, and those from the four-song bonus disc were released in other countries. &quot;Rock Steady Live&quot;, a live DVD of No Doubt performing in 2002 in support of &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, was released in November 2003.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rock Steady&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 15 reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield wrote it was &quot;impressive to hear No Doubt summon the musical imagination to transcend the formula that used to imprison them&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to the album as &quot;a good, hooky, stylish mainstream pop record&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that there was &quot;something oddly flimsy&quot; about No Doubt that prevented it from becoming a milestone in pop music, but that the band&#x27;s &quot;party-throwing skills improve with each new gathering.&quot; Colleen Delaney of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; commented that the band sounded like it had &quot;growing pains&quot; and was unsure of its place in mainstream rock, predicting that No Doubt would either become a singles band &quot;or go all Radiohead on us and make an album of avant-jazz-electro-acid-funk-polka.&quot;

Many reviewers focused on the large number of styles that &quot;Rock Steady&quot; incorporates. Eden Miller of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, noting that &quot;Rock Steady&quot; maintains the introspection of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; without the latter&#x27;s &quot;longing and wistfulness&quot;, stated that &quot;it is to No Doubt&#x27;s credit...that they manage to keep the album together with little more than their collective personalities.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot;, however, called it &quot;an intermittently engaging but overall shapeless collection...the product of happy-go-lucky musicians who once cavorted in bad track suits but now spend their days commuting between London, Jamaica and Los Angeles seeking the wisdom of expensive studio geeks.&quot; Alex Needham of &quot;NME&quot; viewed the album&#x27;s &quot;enormous waterfront of styles&quot; positively, noting that it had many strong potential singles, but found that some of the &quot;empty-headed guitar pop&quot; on the second half of the album spoiled the listening experience. Kimberly Reyes of &quot;Time&quot; stated that &quot;Rock Steady&quot; was able to integrate ska, pop, New Wave, and dancehall &quot;without sounding contrived or chaotic&quot;. Reyes added that though the album lacked the energy and sales of No Doubt&#x27;s 1995 breakthrough album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; was &quot;their greatest effort to date...the sound of band dropping pretense to realize its potential.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commenting that &quot;[n]ot since Blondie [...] has a rock act so effortlessly, irreverently, and fashionably skidded across so many different genre boundaries at one time.&quot; Lisa Oliver of LAUNCHcast said that &quot;even with so many producers attempting to steer this bus along the superstar highway, they end up in a better-than-most parking lot&quot;.

==Accolades==
&quot;Rock Steady&quot; was ranked number 316 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in November 2003. &quot;Blender&quot; included the album on its April 2003 list of &quot;500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die!&quot;. In June 2003, it was included on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s list of &quot;50 Essential Pop Albums&quot;

&quot;Hey Baby&quot; won the award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, while &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and &quot;Hella Good&quot; received nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively. At the following year&#x27;s ceremony, &quot;Underneath It All&quot; earned the band their second consecutive Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;NME&quot; reviewer Alex Needham compared the album&#x27;s revival of No Doubt&#x27;s popularity to the performance of Madonna&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; debuted at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 254,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 11, 2002, and by July 2012, it had sold 2,842,000 copies in the United States.

The album was moderately successful outside the US. In Australia, it peaked at number 15 on the ARIA Albums Chart and spent nine non-consecutive weeks in the top 40. The album was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The album reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on July 22, 2013. It was also certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) on September 3, 2002. As of November 2003, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; had sold three million copies worldwide.

==Legacy and influence==
When singer-songwriter Jewel released her fifth album &quot;0304&quot; in June 2003, reinventing and sexualizing her public image, music critics identified &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; as influences on the album. Slant Magazine compared &quot;0304&quot;″s retro tribute to new wave music with that on &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; commented that Jewel had &quot;brushed up on two sacred pop texts, the Manual of Madonna and the Gospel According to Gwen&quot;. The magazine compared her use of a more restrained, throaty purr to Stefani&#x27;s vocals and noted &quot;0304&quot;″s use of &quot;jumpy bubblegum choruses and &quot;boop-boop-beeping&quot; keyboards&quot; as descendants of No Doubt&#x27;s production.

The cover art of fellow rock band Paramore’s second studio album &quot;Riot!&quot; (2007) resembles that of &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, featuring a similar word art design.

<doc id="167810" wikidata="Q15192747" url="?curid=167810" title="Defining vocabulary">
<text>A defining vocabulary is a list of words used by lexicographers to write dictionary definitions. The underlying principle goes back to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s notion that words should be defined using &#x27;terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained&#x27;, and a defining vocabulary provides the lexicographer with a restricted list of high-frequency words which can be used for producing simple definitions of any word in the dictionary.

Defining vocabularies are especially common in English monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionaries. The first such dictionary to use a defining vocabulary was the &quot;New Method English Dictionary&quot; by Michael West and James Endicott (published in 1935), a small dictionary written using a defining vocabulary of just 1,490 words. When the &quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&quot; was first published in 1978, its most striking feature was its use of a 2,000-word defining vocabulary based on Michael West&#x27;s General Service List, and since then defining vocabularies have become a standard component of monolingual learner&#x27;s dictionaries for English and for other languages.

Using a defining vocabulary is not without its problems, and some scholars have argued that it can lead to definitions which are insufficiently precise or accurate, or that words in the list are sometimes used in non-central meanings. The more common view, however, is that the disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages, and there is some empirical research which supports this position. Almost all English learner&#x27;s dictionaries have a defining vocabulary, and these range in size between 2000 and 3000 words, for example:
*&quot;Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English&quot;: approximately 2,000 words
*&quot;Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners&quot;: approximately 2,500 words
*&quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;: approximately 3,000 words

It is possible that, in electronic dictionaries at least, the need for a controlled defining vocabulary will disappear. In some online dictionaries, such as the &quot;Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners&quot;, every word in every definition is hyperlinked to its own entry, so that a user who is unsure of the meaning of a word in a definition can immediately see the definition for the word that is causing problems. However, this strategy works only if all the definitions are written in reasonably accessible language, which argues for some sort of defining vocabulary to be maintained in dictionaries aimed at language learners.

Intermediate-level language learners are likely to have receptive familiarity with most words in a typical 2,000-word defining vocabulary. To accommodate beginning-level learners, the defining vocabulary can be divided into two or more layers, where words in one layer are explained using only the simpler words from the previous layers. This strategy is used in the &quot;Learn These Words First&quot; multi-layer dictionary, where a 360-word beginning-level defining vocabulary is used to explain a 2,000-word intermediate-level defining vocabulary, which in turn is used to define the remaining words in the dictionary.

<doc id="167812" wikidata="Q1767176" url="?curid=167812" title="SimCity 2000">
<text>SimCity 2000 is a city-building simulation video game jointly developed by Will Wright and Fred Haslam of Maxis. It is the successor to &quot;SimCity Classic&quot; and was released for Apple Macintosh and MS-DOS personal computers in 1993, after which it was released on many other platforms over the following years, such as the Sega Saturn and SNES game consoles in 1995 and the PlayStation in 1996.

&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; is played from an isometric perspective as opposed to the previous title, which was played from a top-down perspective. The objective of the game is to create a city, develop residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure such as power and water facilities and collect taxes for further development of the city. Importance is put on increasing the standard of living of the population, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the region&#x27;s environmental situation to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt, as extreme deficit spending gets a game over.

&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; was critically praised for its vibrant and detailed graphics, improved control menu, gameplay and music. An approximate total of 4.23 million copies of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; have been sold, mainly in the United States, Europe and Japan. While its predecessor pioneered the city-building genre of video games, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; would become the model upon which subsequent urban simulators would be based over the course of the next decades.

==Gameplay==
The unexpected and enduring success of the original &quot;SimCity&quot;, combined with the relative lack of success with other &quot;Sim&quot; titles, finally motivated the development of a sequel. &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; was a major extension of the concept. It had a near-isometric dimetric view (similar to the earlier Maxis-published &quot;A-Train&quot;) instead of overhead, land could have different elevations, and underground layers were introduced for water pipes, subways and road tunnels.

New types of facilities include prisons, schools, libraries, museums, marinas, hospitals and arcologies. Players can build highways, roads, bus depots, railway tracks, subways, train depots and zone land for seaports and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles), solar and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plants. Most types of power plants have a limited life span and must be rebuilt periodically. Players can build highways to neighboring cities to increase trade and the population.

The budget and finance controls are also much more elaborate—tax rates can be set individually for residential, commercial and industrial zones. Enacting city ordinances and connecting to neighboring cities became possible. The budget controls are very important in running the city effectively.

Another new addition in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting &quot;Ruminate&quot; displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman.

Graphics were added for buildings under construction in the residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as darkened buildings depicting abandoned buildings as a result of urban decay.

News comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plants, recent disasters and opinion polls (highlighting city problems). &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children&#x27;s version, SimTown), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (&quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Herald&quot;, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by &quot;Miss Sim&quot;. Some headlines have no purpose whatsoever in the game, such as &quot;Bald Radio Found&quot; or &quot;Frog Convention&quot;.
Though there is no &quot;true&quot; victory sequence in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, the &quot;&quot; is a close parallel. An &quot;exodus&quot; occurs during the year 2051 or later, when 300 or more Launch Arcologies are constructed; the following January each one &quot;takes off&quot; into space so that their inhabitants can form new civilizations on distant worlds. This reduces the city&#x27;s population to those who are not living in the Launch Arcologies, but it also opens wide areas for redevelopment and returns their construction cost to the city treasury. This is related to the event in &quot;SimEarth&quot; where all cities are moved into rocket-propelled domes that then leave to &quot;found new worlds&quot; (leaving no sentient life behind).

The game also included several playable scenarios, in which the player must deal with a disaster (in most, but not all scenarios) and rebuild the city to meet a set of victory conditions. These were based in versions of real-life cities, and some were based on real events such as the Oakland firestorm of 1991, the 1989 Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South Carolina, the Great Flood of 1993 in Davenport, Iowa, or dealing with the 1970s economic recession in Flint, Michigan—but also included more fanciful ones such as a &quot;monster&quot; destroying Hollywood in 2001. More scenarios added with the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK) included a nuclear meltdown in Manhattan in 2007.

== Development ==

Fred Haslam recalled being pitched on a sequel for SimCity at a Maxis company dinner in December 1990, just as he and Will Wright had finished SimEarth. Wright had spent five years working on the original game and did not want to work on the sequel, delegating the task to Haslam. Haslam spent the first 8 months of 1991 working on a top-down two-dimensional game. At that point, Maxis had contracted to work on the game &quot;A-Train&quot;, which used near-isometric dimetric projection to represent the landscape. Maxis decided that the SimCity sequel should also use this graphical style. Haslam spent the next year trying to accomplish this task without success, at which point Will Wright joined the team.

Haslam and Wright worked together to complete the game, and each found their input complemented the other&#x27;s. Haslam gives examples such as including the square grid from A-Train, which Wright then removed for the underground view. Haslam also describes how Wright wanted to add labels for locations, which Haslam also used to signify neighbor connections. Wright&#x27;s other additions were arcologies, microsimulations, and the underground view. Haslam&#x27;s additions included the city newspaper (in place of the &#x27;score&#x27; from SimCity), free-size zoning, and the ability to issue bonds. Haslam coded the lists of variable terms in the newspaper headlines, with Debra Larson writing the actual newspaper articles. Other features were removed during the production process, such as zones for mining, farming and lumbering, one-way streets, and tidal waves.

The art team researched buildings extensively in creating the realistic look of the buildings. Jenny Martin, the art director, and her team were conscious of buildings having distinct identities: &quot;Cities don&#x27;t have one style, so we wanted to make a mix of the deco and the modern and the old style ornate buildings.&quot; 3 x 3 tile buildings were designed first, then were cut down to create 2 x 2 tile buildings, which were in turn cut down to create 1 x 1 tile buildings. Using Electronic Arts&#x27; Deluxe Paint on 486 PCs, Jenny and her team of four worked full-time on the art and appearance of the game for four months.

There are only about ten minutes of music in the game. The music lead, Sue Kasper, was told to make the music moody and dark, like in Blade Runner. However she stated she was held back in this goal by the limited capability of sound cards at the time to sustain long notes. &quot;One of the limitations you&#x27;re working with is sustain. To have it really moody and dark you need a lot of sustainy-type sounds&quot;. The music team had to include multiple MIDI files for the DOS and Windows releases. Different versions of each MIDI file were optimised for different cards. CD-quality sound was not used because of the storage required. Many versions of the base game shipped on two 1.44 Mb floppy disks. To include the 10 minutes of music at CD quality would have required over 100 Mb of space. The 10 minutes of MIDI music by comparison took up only around 100 Kb of space.

Maxis had a reputation for including extra information in their manuals beyond that which was needed to play the game. With this in mind, documentation manager Michael Bremer had initially wanted to write about trends in city planning. However, while researching this topic, he learned that most cities are not planned at all. So Bremer took a subjective view of the city, and included &quot;people&#x27;s opinions, in words and pictures, of what &quot;city&quot; means to them. There&#x27;re a few poems, some drawings, some photos, a couple of essays... I think it all turned out great&quot;.

==Expansion==
In 1994, Maxis released an expansion pack to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; called &quot;Scenarios Vol. I: Great Disasters&quot;, which included new scenarios based on a number of possible disasters. These disasters generally destroy the city and require the player to rebuild the city. They include: A UFO attack, two nuclear meltdown scenarios, two major chemical spill scenarios, a large flood, a major hurricane, two firestorm scenarios, a volcano, an earthquake, a high power microwave beam misfire, riots, and a typhoon.

Alongside the &quot;Great Disasters Scenarios&quot; package came the introduction of a separate toolset called the &quot;SimCity Urban Renewal Kit&quot; (&quot;SCURK&quot; for short). It enabled players to modify the images used in-game to represent various buildings in much the same manner as general image manipulation software. The player was able to create basic bitmap files of a standard size with a standard 256 color palette. The use of limited palette cycling, which permitted animation, was also possible.

A number of pre-altered graphics packages were distributed, including some which replaced the reward buildings with images of various well known international buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, but most buildings were made by fan-artists and shared on the Internet. Several &quot;SCURK&quot; designs influenced the designs of &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;″s original buildings. The cities made in SCURK can be saved and played in &quot;SimCity 2000.&quot; SCURK can also be used to create custom cities for &quot;SimCopter&quot; and &quot;Streets of SimCity&quot;.

==Special editions==
===&quot;SimCity 2000 Special Edition&quot;===
A re-packaged version of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, SimCity 2000 Special Edition (also known as the &quot;CD Collection&quot;), was released on February 7, 1995 for Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS. In addition to containing &quot;All expansions&quot;, it also featured the &quot;SimCity Urban Renewal Kit&quot;, the Vol. 1 scenario pack, remade music, new cities selected by Maxis from a 1994 competition, bonus scenarios and cities, and movies.

The movies were a first for Maxis; &quot;SimCity 2000-SE&quot; was the first &quot;Sim&quot; game to feature produced videos. These videos included the introduction movie and four commentary videos by Will Wright; the latter were accessed via the &quot;WillTV&quot; application that came with the game.

The most recent operating system that the Windows 95 version of the game will install under is Windows XP 32-bit. Various incompatibility ills with the save/load dialogs for later 64bit OS&#x27;s can be cured with 3rd party patches.

In December 2014 Electronic Arts offered SimCity 2000 Special Edition as a free download for an unspecified limited time. Unlike the original release versions of the game, this downloadable version requires connectivity to the Electronic Arts servers for saves and gameplay. It is the DOS Special Edition with the WillTV movies, packaged with preconfigured DOSBox running at fixed 640x480 and an automatic installer to run in modern Windows.

===&quot;SimCity 2000 Network Edition&quot;===
&quot;SimCity 2000 Network Edition&quot;, sometimes unofficially referred to as the &quot;Gold Edition&quot;, was released in 1996 for Windows 32-bit only. The game features slightly different gameplay in network mode, where mayors may start with more money, but must buy land before building upon it. Players (up to 4) of the Network Edition have the ability to share in-game resources and to compete or cooperate with other cities. This edition of the game was advertised in the radio stations of a later game by Maxis, Streets of SimCity.

This version also features a revamped user interface. Instead of a static toolbar, items are accessed via cascading menus from the right of the screen, resulting in more screen real-estate for &quot;SimCity&quot; itself, without sacrificing functionality.

This edition of the game has trouble running on operating systems based on the Windows NT kernel. Third party fixes include a Network Interoperability Patch, a Network Launcher / Browser / Server Patch to improve slow server response and browse game IP addresses, an updated help file, and a full screen utility.

==Ports==
&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; has been released on a wide range of platforms and version since its debut in 1993, ranging from ports of personal computers and video game consoles.

===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (RISC OS)===
A port for Acorn RISC OS was released in 1995. The conversion was performed by Krisalis Software which had ported the original SimCity to the platform. Music differed from the original.

===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom)===
The first console port for the game was the version for the Super Famicom/Super NES, ported by HAL Laboratory and published through Imagineer exclusively in Japan in May 1995. North American and European releases followed suit through THQ&#x27;s Black Pearl Software label in Late 1996, near the end of the Super Nintendo&#x27;s life span.

Due to the Super NES&#x27; hardware limitations, the game was heavily limited in content and graphics. It featured controls made to work with a controller (as like with the Super NES port of the original SimCity, there is no support for the Super NES Mouse accessory), longer load and screen scrolling times, and limits to only six maps per game under a single save slot. Removals include difficulty settings, a single newspaper no matter what size the city is, fewer songs, only five scenarios and the removal of the Riot and Volcano disasters. All team names, city names, and mayor names were limited to 8 characters, whereas the PC version allows for up to 32 characters.

Additions include some new population gifts; a bigger city hall at 1,000,000 population, a TV station at 2,000,000 population, and a rocket launching pad at 3,000,000 population. The player can see an actual launch of a single launch arco by achieving 5,000,000 population in the last scenario. Being developed in Japan, the stock photographs featured are replaced with images that resemble something from anime or manga.

===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (Sega Saturn)===
The Sega Saturn port of the game was one of the first titles announced for the system, back in August 1994. Maxis developed the title as with the computer versions, with an in-house team at Sega providing additional support. It was first released in Japan in September 1995 before shortly being released in North America and Europe.

The Saturn had several changes when compared to the original version of the game to take advantage of its functionalities and limitations. The graphics were enhanced to showcase the power of the console&#x27;s hardware with 3D animations for the buildings in the building query windows, and the buildings would change their appearances between 1950, 2000 and 2050. Taking advantage of CD-ROM technology, the game features a full CD-quality soundtrack as well as higher-quality sound effects and some FMV sequences including the opening which displays a scene of the Alien/Monster chasing a Launch Arco in space. The game, however, runs far slower than the original versions and is missing a few features including some of the disasters. The Braun Llama Dome doesn&#x27;t appear in this version, instead, a Space Terminal which assists in the launching of the Arco appears instead. In the Japanese release of the game, the statue awarded after reaching 30,000 population was replaced with one featuring Sonic the Hedgehog.

The scenarios from the Great Disasters expansion pack was also included.

===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (PlayStation)===
The PlayStation version of the game was released in November 1996.

This version of the game is based on the Sega Saturn port, although cities do not evolve over the years and the game runs at a lower framerate. Two major additions include some extra scenarios from the Great Disasters expansion pack, including one that involves a new volcano forming in Portland (destroying most of the city, and requiring the mayor to rebuild it); and to tour your city from a car&#x27;s perspective. The Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. scenarios are on the disk but are not used.

This version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe for both PSP and PS3 on November 20, 2008, and in North America on August 28, 2009.

===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (Nintendo 64)===
A Japan-only release of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; for the Nintendo 64 on January 30, 1998, produced and published by Imagineer Co., Ltd.

It featured some additional features, mainly mini-games, a dating game, TV to replace the newspaper, horse races and monster breeding, among others, all of them in 3D. A few new &quot;natural&quot; disasters were also included, most of them being giant monster attacks (players were able to use their monster to fight against them).

===&quot;SimCity 64&quot;===

Another Japan-only release, &quot;SimCity 64&quot; was based on the SimCity 2000 game but was heavily customized for the Nintendo 64DD game system. The ability to view the city at night was added, pedestrian level free-roaming of a city, and individual road vehicles and pedestrians controlled by their own AI wandered the player&#x27;s city. Cities in the game are also presented in much more advanced 3D graphics, making SimCity 64 the first true 3D SimCity game.
===&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; (Game Boy Advance)===
Released by Destination Software in 2003, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; for the Game Boy Advance featured most of the same content as previous versions, but several features are omitted, such as launch arcos. The water system is also omitted, either to improve the gameplay experience on the device, or due to the device&#x27;s technical limitations.

===&quot;SimCity 2000 v1.01c&quot; (IBM OS/2 Warp)===
Released by WinWare February 6, 1996, ported by Mark A. Pietras, Micheal A. Pitts, James R. Thomas.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; was the ninth best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, selling 1.4 million units. During 1996 alone, it achieved sales of 500,000 copies. According to PC Data, &quot;SimCity 2000 SE&quot; was the United States&#x27; 20th-best-selling computer game during the January–November 1998 period. According to Maxis&#x27;s Lucy Bradshaw, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; achieved global sales of 3.4 million units across all platforms by January 2002.

===Critical reception===
Comparing its improvement over the first &quot;SimCity&quot; to &quot;watching the part in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; where the color kicks in&quot;, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1993 praised &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; for Macintosh as &quot;basically the same game, but now it&#x27;s the way you always wish it was when you played the first version&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s reviewer, an author of a book on its predecessor, wrote in 1994 that &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; for Macintosh offered &quot;plenty of new challenges&quot;, fixed &quot;virtually every criticism I leveled at the game&quot; in the book, and &quot;is without question a superior program&quot;. He concluded that it was &quot;more fun than the original &quot;SimCity&quot; ... It&#x27;s Sim-ply irresistible&quot;. The magazine said that the CD version&#x27;s &quot;multimedia enhancements make for a more accessible and enjoyable product&quot;.

&quot;SimCity 2000&quot; was named Best Simulation at the 1994 Codie awards, the fifth win in a row for Maxis. It was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Strategy Game of the Year award in June 1994, losing to &quot;Master of Orion&quot;. The editors wrote, &quot;This advanced city simulator adds many of the features and considerations that were previously lacking in the original &quot;SimCity&quot;.&quot; It was also a finalist for &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot;″s 1993 &quot;Best Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;X-Wing&quot;.

In 1994 &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; the 7th best computer game ever, and &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; named it the best computer game of all time, writing, &quot;Near perfect in conception and execution, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; does what most games never even dream of.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the personal computer versions as number 33 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;easily one of the most enthralling games playable.&quot; In August 2016, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; placed 13th on Time&#x27;s The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Sim City 2000 70th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In the same issue, GamesMaster rated the Sega Saturn version 10th in its &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; won &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1994&quot; Origins Award.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 35th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;&quot;lots&quot; of fun&quot;.

===Console ports===
&quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s Reader Cross Review gave the Super Famicom version of the game a 6 out of 10. Andromeda of &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that it suffers from an awkward control interface and repetitive music, but offers more than the Super NES version of the original and is an overall worthwhile purchase for simulation fans.

Ed Lomas of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; criticized the slow scrolling in the Saturn port but applauded the game itself for its depth, realism, and addictiveness, calling it &quot;one of the few games that appeals to just about everyone. It ... has the strange ability to convert full-time arcade shooter fans into around the clock urban planners with a sense of civic duty.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; commented that the Saturn port contains all the considerable content of the PC version and is good fun to play, but has worse graphics and more slowdown than the PC version does, even when running on computers which are much less powerful than the Saturn.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the Saturn version &quot;is a carbon copy of the latest installment of this city-planning simulation game, and, as such, it carries with it the monstrously addictive quality and absorbing challenge of all &quot;SimCity&quot; games.&quot; He said that the one major problem is the Saturn version&#x27;s lack of mouse support. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s brief review said that the expanded menu &quot;bogs 2000 down a little&quot; but that the game would still be enjoyable for fans of the series.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; applauded the PlayStation version for including mouse support, declaring the game the killer app for the PlayStation Mouse. They criticized the port&#x27;s interface and low resolution graphics, which Dan Hsu felt were enough to ruin the game, but were unanimously pleased with the addictive simulation gameplay. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the game is &quot;a true, if uninspired, descendant&quot; of the original &quot;SimCity&quot;. He praised the addition of the 3D &quot;ride-through&quot; feature in the PlayStation version, but complained of the clunky interface when using the PlayStation joypad. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; contended that the slow and confusing interface of the PlayStation conversion ruin any enjoyment that might be found in the game. IGN staff erroneously criticized the PlayStation version for lacking mouse support, and said the game doesn&#x27;t compare well to other simulation titles, but nonetheless assessed it as &quot;worth it&quot; for fans of the genre.

===Promotion===
In March 1994, Maxis arranged with Compute! Publications to have a contest for &quot;Compute!&quot; magazine readers to design original cities with the game. Compute! handled the judging of entries submitted via posted floppy disks. The contest anticipated a minimum of five winning contestants and a maximum of twenty. The winners were awarded $50, a $50 software package from Maxis and a $15 hint book from Compute!. The contest ended by the beginning of the next month.

===Legacy===
In December 2012, the Museum of Modern Art acquired &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; to its permanent collection of video games. As one of the more complex and longer games in the exhibition, the game is presented as a specially-designed demo.

Several games were released as spinoffs to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.
*&quot;SimHealth&quot; – Released in 1994, the game simulated President Bill Clinton&#x27;s healthcare reform proposals for the US; designed for a niche audience at best, the simulation never achieved great popularity. It featured a user interface that resembled a city in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.
*&quot;SimCopter&quot; – An arcade helicopter flight simulator based on the cities of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, &quot;SimCopter&quot; was published in 1996. It had the capability of importing &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; cities and allowing the user to pilot a helicopter around them and accomplish missions such as rescuing people or putting out a fire.
*&quot;Streets of SimCity&quot; – Published in 1997, &quot;Streets of SimCity&quot; was a racing game based on the &quot;SimCopter&quot; engine. In addition to racing, it also featured courier missions and vehicular combat

<doc id="167813" wikidata="Q1750905" url="?curid=167813" title="SimCity 3000">
<text>SimCity 3000 is a city building simulation video game released in 1999, and the third major installment in the &quot;SimCity&quot; series. It was published by Electronic Arts (EA) and developed by series creator Maxis. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, and, through an arrangement with Loki Games, Linux.

==Gameplay==
There are many changes between &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; and its immediate predecessor &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. These changes span both the integral city management aspects of the game, as well as its graphical and landscape aspects. More and newer city services are featured. These changes create a greatly different experience from that of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

The most notable change is the addition of the concept of waste management. In &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, garbage begins to accumulate when the city grows to a medium size, and must be disposed of at the expense of the city. Farms and agricultural structures are also introduced, appearing on large light industrial zones in a city with low land value and little pollution. A new zoning density was also added, totaling three densities, compared to &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;″s two.

In addition to their limited life span, power plants and other utility buildings were also made vulnerable to decreasing maximum output due to age. All power plants have a life span, and additionally, the water facilities now have a life span as well.

Although the concept of neighbor cities was introduced in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, it was greatly expanded upon in &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;. New for players is interaction with neighbouring cities, negotiating rudimentary business deals with other mayors, such as the sale or purchase of water, electricity or waste management services. These generate a monthly charge which is either added to or deducted from the player&#x27;s treasury, in accordance with the deal. Canceling a neighbor deal would incur a penalty, unless the deal was cancelled when the other city wished to renegotiate.

Although not strictly a city management aspect, &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; simulates the effect of land value on construction much more realistically than in &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. In &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, land value creates very distinct neighborhoods which tend to contain narrow income bands, creating well-defined slums, middle class areas, and wealthy areas. Land value is also determined by the city center effect where buildings that are at the city center have higher land values and those buildings on the borders have lower land values.

Business deals were another new concept to &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;; by allowing certain structures, such as a maximum security prison, to be built within the city, the player can receive a substantial amount of funds from them. Business deal structures, however, tend to have negative effects on the city, such as reduced land value.

There are several changes to the graphical interface in &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;. Although the game retains the pseudo-isometric dimetric perspective of its predecessor, the actual landscape became more complex and colorful. In &quot;SimCity&quot; and &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, the playable landscape is mostly brown, while in &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, the playable landscape is a more realistic green color, along with other colors that progressively change by height, from beige (beach sand) to green to brown (bare ground) to white (snow). In &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, land could either be flat or sloped, and all slopes were of the same steepness. In &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, there are five distinct steepness of slope, creating more varied landscapes. There are different types of trees which can appear on the playable map, ranging from small, deciduous trees to towering redwoods.

===Advisors and petitioners===
&quot;SimCity 3000&quot; and its revision, &quot;Unlimited&quot;, feature seven advisors, each covering a specific issue (city finances, transportation, environmental issues, city planning, safety, health and education, and city utilities), who help players make proper decisions in the game by providing recommendations and advice. As opposed to previous versions of &quot;SimCity&quot;, these advisors have names and give in-depth advice, rather than brief summaries of the situation in their department.

There are also petitioners, many of whom are citizens of the city, that request players to modify city policies, such as lowering tax rates, or enacting an ordinance. Some are outside interests, often pushing proposals which would harm the city (i.e. building a casino, which would attract crime) in exchange for a boost to its financial coffers. The mayors of the four cities neighboring at each of the edges of the city&#x27;s map (a feature carried over from &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;) also chime in if the player&#x27;s city is connected to them by road or rail, to request that the player&#x27;s city handle their city services (trash disposal, water, power, etc.) in exchange for financial compensation, or offer that the neighbor handles the city services for the player&#x27;s city in exchange for a fee.

===News tickers===
In addition to advisors, a news ticker scrolls along the bottom of the screen, displaying pertinent information about the city in the form of news stories, such as indicating that the city needs more schools, or how well a particular city department is functioning. Generally, when things were going very well in a city, the news ticker would display headlines which are comical, or even nonsensical and often seemingly useless to the player. Examples of such headlines being: &quot;After 36 years of marriage, man discovers wife to be form of rare yucca plant,&quot; or &quot;(City Name) prints all wrong numbers in phone book, leads to 15 marriages&quot; or quotes from a &quot;Tommy B. Saif.&quot;

Other headlines may be labeled &quot;(City Name) News Ticker&quot; or &quot;From the Desk of Wise Guy Sammy&quot;. On occasions, the ticker will even provide a foreshadowing of an approaching disaster, for example, sometimes reading &quot;Did you feel that big truck pass by? What? It wasn&#x27;t a truck?&quot;, or &quot;Mrs. SimLeary buys prize-winning cow&quot;, or perhaps another quote from a set range of different headlines before a disaster occurs.

===Landmarks===
Real world landmarks are also introduced in &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, but are mostly for aesthetic purposes (though placing a building would open up an option in the city ordinances window for tourism advertising), and are free of construction cost. Examples of landmarks featured in the original &quot;SC3K&quot; include the Parthenon, the CN Tower, Notre Dame, the Bank of China Tower, the Empire State Building, the Pharos of Alexandria and the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center with each tower a separate building, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, as well as the Fernsehturm TV Tower in Berlin.

===Music===
Another major change from &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; is the addition of a live music score, whose lead composer is Jerry Martin. The new soundtrack incorporates new-age and live jazz songs, with David Lauser on drums and Darol Anger on violin.

==Development==
Prior to the acquisition of &quot;Sim&quot; developer Maxis by Electronic Arts in 1997, plans were originally made in 1996 to develop &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; as a fully 3D game, in tune with the emergence of 3D video games. Although the idea was deemed impractical by employees for being too graphically demanding, Maxis management pushed for the concept, and the game was developed for a year. When the game was first unveiled in the 1997 E3, it was &quot;an experience still regarded as an embarrassment.&quot; The 3D version of the game was expected to become a flop, and its future release was even thought to be the fatal blow to an already poorly performing Maxis, which had failed to release profitable titles in the years since &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

Following the signing of the acquisition deal, Maxis assured the public that &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; was still set to be released in December 1997. After EA completed acquisition of Maxis, Luc Barthelet was assigned by EA as the new general manager of Maxis. He was troubled by the 3D &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, questioning the viability of a game with such graphics. Eventually, the 3D version was completely scrapped, Lucy Bradshaw was brought in from EA in November 1997 to lead the &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; project, and a new revision based on &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;″s pseudo-isometric dimetric projection and sprite-based graphics was redeveloped from scratch. The new plan focused on retaining the core engine of the game, improving more minor features in the game instead, such as larger maps, new zoom levels, and additional gameplay parameters.

The second version of &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; would receive a more positive reception during its appearance in 1998 E3, and was well-received after its release in February 1999 (although Maxis originally intended the game to be released by Christmas 1998; regardless, EA willingly waited until the game was completed).

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;SimCity 3000&quot; shipped 1 million copies in its debut six months. In the German market, it received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) by the end of May 1999, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It was the United States&#x27; best-selling computer game during the first half of 1999, and by the end of September had sold 470,000 units in the country. This drew revenues of almost $20 million. It claimed second place for the year overall—behind &quot;Rollercoaster Tycoon&quot;—with sales of 657,514 copies and revenues of $26.8 million. This gross was the highest that year for a computer game in the United States. In 2000, &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;&#x27; placed ninth in the United States, with another 385,001 units sold. This earned an additional $10.5 million in revenue.

In the United States, the game&#x27;s &quot;Unlimited&quot; edition alone sold 1.1 million copies and earned $27.5 million by August 2006, after its release in January 2000. &quot;Edge&quot; ranked it as the country&#x27;s sixth best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006, and the highest-selling &quot;SimCity&quot; title during that period. Combined sales of all &quot;SimCity&quot; computer games released between January 2000 and August 2006, including &quot;SimCity 3000 Unlimited&quot;, had reached 3.4 million units in the United States by the latter date. &quot;SimCity 3000: UK Edition&quot; received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

According to Maxis&#x27;s Lucy Bradshaw, &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; achieved global sales of 4.6 million units by January 2002. Using data from product registrations, she explained that the overall series&#x27; userbase was three-fourths male and one-fourth female at that time. The game sold 5 million copies worldwide by 2007.

===Reviews and awards===
&quot;SimCity 3000&quot; received positive reviews. IGN gave it a 9.0, praising sound, gameplay, graphics, and lasting appeal.
GameSpot gave it an 8.5 and praised its graphics while criticizing the adviser system. &quot;SimCity 3000 Unlimited&quot; has also gained critical acclaim with IGN giving it a 9.1 praising its presentation and graphics. The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;SimCity&quot; for &quot;PC Strategy Game of the Year&quot; at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, although the game lost to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;SimCity 3000&quot; is great fun and loaded with interesting, mind-absorbing gameplay.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Expanded edition===
In May 2000, the game was re-released under different names in different regions, such as SimCity 3000 Unlimited (in North America and Oceania), SimCity 3000 Deutschland (Germany), SimCity 3000 Edition Mondiale (France), SimCity 3000 Korea (South Korea), Mahanakhon 3000 (Thailand) SimCity 3000 UK Edition (UK and Ireland) and SimCity 3000 World Edition (other countries), among others. This added, among other things, East Asian and European building sets, additional terrain colors and vegetation types, a snapshot feature, additional music, an improved version of the Building Architect Tool (a pseudo-3D design tool based on cubes), four additional disasters (such as locusts and space junk), additional landmarks (like the Seoul Tower and Helsinki Cathedral), new reward buildings, thirteen scenarios (along with an editor based on Microsoft Access) and a new FMV intro.

Premade cities are also available, including (London and Liverpool for the UK), Berlin (with the Berlin Wall), Madison, Madrid, Moscow and Seoul. The game also includes city terrains based on the geography of real cities, including Hong Kong and Chicago. At the time of the game&#x27;s release, EA launched a website for &quot;Simcity 3000 Unlimited&quot; which allowed users to exchange their creations. The site, formerly located at www.simcity.com/us/exchange/ (for North American territories), is no longer available and can only be accessed with an archiving tool.

&quot;SimCity 3000 Unlimited&quot; was re-released digitally on GOG.com on July 14, 2016 and later on Steam on March 7, 2024

===&quot;SimCity DS&quot;===
&quot;SimCity DS&quot; is a heavily modified version of &quot;SimCity 3000&quot; for the Nintendo DS released in Japan on February 22, 2007, North America on June 19, 2007, and Europe on June 22, 2007. The game inherits &quot;SC3K&quot;″s graphics, but makes use of the handheld&#x27;s dual screens to display additional interfaces. Console-specific features are also included, such as the use of the console&#x27;s integrated microphone, which is used to blow out fires, and the touchscreen, which is used to control the interface. The game also features a &quot;Save the City&quot; mode, in which the player must help one of several cities recover from a disaster and reach a specific target to succeed.

===Linux===

Loki Entertainment released SimCity 3000 Deutschland, SimCity 3000 Unlimited, and SimCity 3000 World Edition for Linux.

===iPhone and iPod Touch===
A version of &quot;SimCity 3000&quot;, known as &quot;SimCity for iPhone&quot;, was released in 2008 for the iPhone and iPod Touch.

<doc id="167815" wikidata="Q190211" url="?curid=167815" title="Douglas DC-3">
<text>The Douglas DC-3 is a propeller-driven airliner manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company, which had a lasting effect on the airline industry in the 1930s to 1940s and World War II.

It was developed as a larger, improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2.

It is a low-wing metal monoplane with conventional landing gear, powered by two radial piston engines of . Although the DC-3s originally built for civil service had the Wright R-1820 Cyclone, later civilian DC-3s used the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engine.

The DC-3 has a cruising speed of , a capacity of 21 to 32 passengers or 6,000 lbs (2,700 kg) of cargo, and a range of , and can operate from short runways.
The DC-3 had many exceptional qualities compared to previous aircraft. It was fast, had a good range, was more reliable, and carried passengers in greater comfort. Before World War II, it pioneered many air travel routes. It was able to cross the continental United States from New York to Los Angeles in 18 hours, with only three stops.
It is one of the first airliners that could profitably carry only passengers without relying on mail subsidies. In 1939, at the peak of its dominance in the airliner market, around ninety percent of airline flights on the planet were by a DC-3 or some variant.

Following the war, the airliner market was flooded with surplus transport aircraft, and the DC-3 was no longer competitive because it was smaller and slower than aircraft built during the war. It was made obsolete on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-4 and Convair 240, but the design proved adaptable and was still useful on less commercially demanding routes.
Civilian DC-3 production ended in 1943 at 607 aircraft. Military versions, including the C-47 Skytrain (the Dakota in British RAF service), and Soviet- and Japanese-built versions, brought total production to over 16,000.

Many continued to be used in a variety of niche roles; 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were estimated to be still flying in 2013; by 2017 more than 300 were still flying. As of 2023 it is estimated about 150 are still flying.

==Design and development==
&quot;DC&quot; stands for &quot;Douglas Commercial&quot;. The DC-3 was the culmination of a development effort that began after an inquiry from Transcontinental and Western Airlines (TWA) to Donald Douglas. TWA&#x27;s rival in transcontinental air service, United Airlines, was starting service with the Boeing 247, and Boeing refused to sell any 247s to other airlines until United&#x27;s order for 60 aircraft had been filled. TWA asked Douglas to design and build an aircraft that would allow TWA to compete with United. Douglas&#x27; design, the 1933 DC-1, was promising, and led to the DC-2 in 1934. The DC-2 was a success, but with room for improvement.
The DC-3 resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO C. R. Smith to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the DC-2 to replace American&#x27;s Curtiss Condor II biplanes. The DC-2&#x27;s cabin was wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths. Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American&#x27;s intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The new aircraft was engineered by a team led by chief engineer Arthur E. Raymond over the next two years, and the prototype DST (Douglas Sleeper Transport) first flew on December 17, 1935 (the 32nd anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; flight at Kitty Hawk) with Douglas chief test pilot Carl Cover at the controls. Its cabin was wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. No prototype was built, and the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line for delivery to American Airlines.

The DC-3 and DST popularized air travel in the United States. Eastbound transcontinental flights could cross the U.S. in about 15 hours with three refueling stops, while westbound trips against the wind took hours. A few years earlier, such a trip entailed short hops in slower and shorter-range aircraft during the day, coupled with train travel overnight.

Several radial engines were offered for the DC-3. Early-production civilian aircraft used either the 9-cylinder Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 or the 14-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp, but the Twin Wasp was chosen for most military versions and was also used by most DC-3s converted from military service. Five DC-3S &quot;Super DC-3s&quot; with Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 Twin Wasps were built in the late 1940s, three of which entered airline service.

===Production===
Total production including all military variants was 16,079. More than 400 remained in commercial service in 1998. Production was:
* 607 civilian variants
* 10,048 military C-47 and C-53 derivatives built at Santa Monica, California, Long Beach, California, and Oklahoma City
* 4,937 built under license in the Soviet Union (1939–1950) as the Lisunov Li-2 (NATO reporting name: Cab)
* 487 Mitsubishi Kinsei-engined aircraft built by Showa and Nakajima in Japan (1939–1945), as the L2D Type 0 transport (Allied codename Tabby)

Production of DSTs ended in mid-1941 and civilian DC-3 production ended in early 1943, although dozens of the DSTs and DC-3s ordered by airlines that were produced between 1941 and 1943 were pressed into the US military service while still on the production line. Military versions were produced until the end of the war in 1945. A larger, more powerful Super DC-3 was launched in 1949 to positive reviews. The civilian market was flooded with second-hand C-47s, many of which were converted to passenger and cargo versions. Only five Super DC-3s were built, and three of them were delivered for commercial use. The prototype Super DC-3 served the US Navy with the designation YC-129 alongside 100 R4Ds that had been upgraded to the Super DC-3 specifications.

===Turboprop conversions===

From the early 1950s, some DC-3s were modified to use Rolls-Royce Dart engines, as in the Conroy Turbo Three. Other conversions featured Armstrong Siddeley Mamba or Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A turbines.

The Greenwich Aircraft Corp DC-3-TP is a conversion with an extended fuselage and with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-65AR or PT6A-67R engines fitted.

The Basler BT-67 is a conversion of the DC-3/C-47. Basler refurbishes C-47s and DC-3s at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, fitting them with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-67R turboprop engines, lengthening the fuselage by with a fuselage plug ahead of the wing, and some local strengthening of the airframe.

South Africa-based Braddick Specialised Air Services International (commonly referred to as BSAS International) has also performed Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 turboprop conversions, having performed modifications on over 50 DC-3/C-47s / 65ARTP / 67RTP / 67FTPs.

==Operational history==



American Airlines inaugurated passenger service on June 26, 1936, with simultaneous flights from Newark, New Jersey and Chicago, Illinois. Early U.S. airlines like American, United, TWA, Eastern, and Delta ordered over 400 DC-3s. These fleets paved the way for the modern American air travel industry, which eventually replaced trains as the favored means of long-distance travel across the United States. A nonprofit group, Flagship Detroit Foundation, continues to operate the only original American Airlines Flagship DC-3 with air show and airport visits throughout the U.S.

In 1936, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines received its first DC-3, which replaced the DC-2 in service from Amsterdam via Batavia (now Jakarta) to Sydney, by far the world&#x27;s longest scheduled route at the time. In total, KLM bought 23 DC-3s before the war broke out in Europe. In 1941, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) DC-3 pressed into wartime transportation service was bombed on the ground at Suifu Airfield in China, destroying the outer right wing. The only spare available was that of a smaller Douglas DC-2 in CNAC&#x27;s workshops. The DC-2&#x27;s right wing was removed, flown to Suifu under the belly of another CNAC DC-3, and bolted up to the damaged aircraft. After a single test flight, in which it was discovered that it pulled to the right due to the difference in wing sizes, the so-called DC-2½ was flown to safety.

During World War II, many civilian DC-3s were drafted for the war effort and more than 10,000 U.S. military versions of the DC-3 were built, under the designations C-47, C-53, R4D, and Dakota. Peak production was reached in 1944, with 4,853 being delivered. The armed forces of many countries used the DC-3 and its military variants for the transport of troops, cargo, and wounded. Licensed copies of the DC-3 were built in Japan as the Showa L2D (487 aircraft); and in the Soviet Union as the Lisunov Li-2 (4,937 aircraft).

After the war, thousands of cheap ex-military DC-3s became available for civilian use. Cubana de Aviación became the first Latin American airline to offer a scheduled service to Miami when it started its first scheduled international service from Havana in 1945 with a DC-3. Cubana used DC-3s on some domestic routes well into the 1960s.

Douglas developed an improved version, the Super DC-3, with more power, greater cargo capacity, and an improved wing, but with surplus aircraft available for cheap, they failed to sell well in the civilian aviation market. Only five were delivered, three of them to Capital Airlines. The U.S. Navy had 100 of its early R4Ds converted to Super DC-3 standard during the early 1950s as the Douglas R4D-8/C-117D. The last U.S. Navy C-117 was retired July 12, 1976. The last U.S. Marine Corps C-117, serial 50835, was retired from active service during June 1982. Several remained in service with small airlines in North and South America in 2006.

The United States Forest Service used the DC-3 for smoke jumping and general transportation until the last example was retired in December 2015.

A number of aircraft companies attempted to design a &quot;DC-3 replacement&quot; over the next three decades (including the very successful Fokker F27 Friendship), but no single type could match the versatility, rugged reliability, and economy of the DC-3. While newer airliners soon replaced it on longer high-capacity routes, it remained a significant part of air transport systems well into the 1970s as a regional airliner before being replaced by early regional jets.

=== DC-3 in the 21st century===
Perhaps unique among prewar aircraft, the DC-3 continues to fly in active commercial and military service as of 2021, eighty-six years after the type&#x27;s first flight in 1935, although the number is dwindling due to expensive maintenance and a lack of spare parts. There are small operators with DC-3s in revenue service and as cargo aircraft. Applications of the DC-3 have included passenger service, aerial spraying, freight transport, military transport, missionary flying, skydiver shuttling and sightseeing. There have been a very large number of civil and military operators of the DC-3/C-47 and related types, which would have made it impracticable to provide a comprehensive listing of all operators.

A common saying among aviation enthusiasts and pilots is &quot;the only replacement for a DC-3 is another DC-3&quot;.
Its ability to use grass or dirt runways makes it popular in developing countries or remote areas, where runways may be unpaved.

The oldest surviving DST is N133D, the sixth Douglas Sleeper Transport built, manufactured in 1936. This aircraft was delivered to American Airlines on 12 July 1936 as NC16005. In 2011 it was at Shell Creek Airport, Punta Gorda, Florida. It has been repaired and has been flying again, with a recent flight on 25 April 2021. The oldest DC-3 still flying is the original American Airlines &quot;Flagship Detroit&quot; (c/n 1920, the 43rd aircraft off the Santa Monica production line, delivered on 2 March 1937), which appears at airshows around the United States and is owned and operated by the Flagship Detroit Foundation.

The base price of a new DC-3 in 1936 was around $60,000–$80,000, and by 1960 used aircraft were available for $75,000. In 2023, flying DC-3s can be bought from $400,000-$700,000.

As of 2024, the Basler BT-67 with additions to handle cold weather and snow runways are used in Antarctica including regularly landing at the South Pole during the austral summer.

=== DC-3 on display in museums ===
Douglas C-47-DL serial number 41-7723 is on display at Pima Air &amp; Space Museum near Tucson, Arizona. The aircraft was previously displayed at the United States Air Force Museum.

<text>The Motion Picture Production Code was a set of industry guidelines for the self-censorship of content that was applied to most motion pictures released by major studios in the United States from 1934 to 1968. It is also popularly known as the Hays Code, after Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays&#x27;s leadership, the MPPDA, later the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Motion Picture Association (MPA), adopted the Production Code in 1930 and began rigidly enforcing it in 1934. The Production Code spelled out acceptable and unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.

From 1934 to 1954, the code was closely associated with Joseph Breen, the administrator appointed by Hays to enforce the code in Hollywood. The film industry followed the guidelines set by the code well into the late 1950s, but it began to weaken, owing to the combined impact of television, influence from foreign films, controversial directors (such as Otto Preminger) pushing boundaries, and intervention from the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1968, after several years of minimal enforcement, the Production Code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system.

==Background==
In the 1920s, Hollywood was rocked by a number of notorious scandals, such as the murder of William Desmond Taylor and the alleged rape of Virginia Rappe by popular movie star Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, which brought widespread condemnation from religious, civic and political organizations. Many felt that the film industry had always been morally questionable, and political pressure was increasing, with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred film censorship bills in 1921. In 1922, as they were faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds and potentially thousands of inconsistent, easily changed decency laws in order to show their films, the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option, enlisting Presbyterian elder Will H. Hays, Postmaster General under former President Warren G. Harding and former head of the Republican National Committee, to rehabilitate Hollywood&#x27;s image. The move mimicked the decision that Major League Baseball had made in hiring judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis as League Commissioner the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the 1919 World Series gambling scandal; &quot;The New York Times&quot; even called Hays the &quot;screen Landis&quot;. Hays was paid the lavish sum of $100,000 a year , and served for 25 years as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), where he &quot;defended the industry from attacks, recited soothing nostrums, and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities&quot;.

In 1924, Hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed &quot;the Formula&quot;, which the studios were advised to heed, and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of films they were planning on producing. In 1915, the Supreme Court had decided unanimously in &quot;Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio&quot; that free speech did not extend to motion pictures. While there had been token attempts to clean up the films before (such as when the studios formed the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI) in 1916), little had come of the efforts. New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the following year, with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film, but many of these were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage, a frequent source of subsequent screen material, had topless shows, performances filled with curse words, adult subject matter, and sexually suggestive dialog. Early in the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what was acceptable in New York might not be so in Kansas. Filmmakers were facing the possibility that many states and cities would adopt their own codes of censorship, necessitating a multiplicity of versions of films made for national distribution. Self-censorship was deemed a preferable outcome.

In 1927, Hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship. Irving G. Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Sol Wurtzel of Fox Film Corporation, and E. H. Allen of Paramount Pictures responded by collaborating on a list they called the &quot;Don&#x27;ts and Be Carefuls&quot;, based on items that were challenged by local censor boards. This list consisted of eleven subjects best avoided and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The list was approved by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Hays created the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) to oversee its implementation; however, there was still no way to enforce tenets. The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.

==Pre-Code: &quot;Don’ts&quot; and &quot;Be Carefuls&quot;, as proposed in 1927==
In a resolution passed on June 29, 1927, the MPPDA codified lists of &quot;don&#x27;ts&quot; and &quot;be carefuls&quot; into what they colloquially called their &quot;Magna Charta&quot;. Many of these would later become key points in the Code.

===Don&#x27;ts===
&quot;Those things which are included in the following list shall not appear in pictures produced by the members of this Association, irrespective of the manner in which they are treated&quot;:

===Be Carefuls===
&quot;Special care [must] be exercised in the manner in which the following subjects are treated, to the end that vulgarity and suggestiveness may be eliminated and that good taste may be emphasized&quot;:

==Creation==
In 1929, Catholic layman Martin Quigley, editor of the prominent trade paper &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;, and Jesuit priest Father Daniel A. Lord, created a code of standards and submitted it to the studios. Lord was particularly concerned with the effects of sound film on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. In February 1930, several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, met with Lord and Quigley. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was the responsibility of the SRC (Studio Relations Committee, precursor to the PCA) headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, a former American Red Cross Executive Secretary) to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required. On March 31, the MPPDA agreed it would abide by the Code. The production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience, making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences.

==Contents==
The code was divided into two parts. The first was a set of &quot;general principles&quot; which prohibited a picture from &quot;lowering the moral standards of those who see it&quot;, so as not to wrongly influence a specific audience of views including, women, children, lower-class, and those of &quot;susceptible&quot; minds, called for depictions of the &quot;correct standards of life&quot;, and lastly forbade a picture to show any sort of ridicule towards a law or &quot;creating sympathy for its violation&quot;. The second part was a set of &quot;particular applications&quot;, which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted. Some restrictions, such as the ban on homosexuality or on the use of specific curse words, were never directly mentioned, but were assumed to be understood without clear demarcation. The Code also contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated advertising copy and imagery.

Homosexuals were &quot;de facto&quot; included under the proscription of sex perversion, and the depiction of miscegenation (by 1934, defined only as sexual relationships between black and white races) was forbidden. It also stated that the notion of an &quot;adults-only policy&quot; would be a dubious, ineffective strategy that would be difficult to enforce; however, it did allow that &quot;maturer minds may easily understand and accept without harm subject matter in plots which does younger people positive harm&quot;. If children were supervised and the events implied elliptically, the code allowed &quot;the possibility of a cinematically inspired thought crime&quot;.

The code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside marriage, which were forbidden to be portrayed as attractive or beautiful, were to be presented in a way that would not arouse passion or make them seem permissible. Any sexual act considered perverted, including any suggestion of same-sex relationships, sex or romance, was ruled out.

All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience, or the audience must at least be aware that such behavior is wrong, usually through &quot;compensating moral value&quot;. Authority figures had to be treated with respect, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers, and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule.

The entire document was written with Catholic undertones, and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be &quot;morally evil in its effects&quot;, and its &quot;deep moral significance&quot; was unquestionable. It was initially decided to keep the Catholic influence on the Code secret. A recurring theme was &quot;that throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong, and good is right&quot;.

==Enforcement==
===Pre-Code Hollywood===


On February 19, 1930, &quot;Variety&quot; published the entire content of the Code, and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete; however, the men obliged to enforce the code—Jason Joy (head of the committee until 1932) and his successor, James Wingate—were generally unenthusiastic and/or ineffective. &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, the first film the office reviewed, which was passed by Joy with no revisions, was considered indecent by a California censor. Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films and there were definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen. Joy had to review 500 films a year with a small staff and little power. He was more willing to work with the studios, and his creative writing skills led to his hiring at Fox. On the other hand, Wingate struggled to keep up with the flood of scripts coming in, to the point where Warner Bros.&#x27; head of production Darryl Zanuck wrote him a letter imploring him to pick up the pace. In 1930, the Hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film, and instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them. Complicating matters, the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision in the hands of the studios.

One factor in ignoring the code was the fact that some found such censorship prudish, owing to the libertine social attitudes of the 1920s and early 1930s. This was a period in which the Victorian era was sometimes ridiculed as being naïve and backward. When the Code was announced, the liberal periodical &quot;The Nation&quot; attacked it, stating that if crime were never to be presented in a sympathetic light, then taken literally that would mean that &quot;law&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; would become one and the same; therefore, events such as the Boston Tea Party could not be portrayed. If clergy must always be presented in a positive way, then hypocrisy could not be dealt with either.&quot; The Outlook&quot; agreed and, unlike &quot;Variety&quot;, predicted from the beginning that the Code would be difficult to enforce. The Great Depression of the 1930s led many studios to seek income by any way possible. Since films containing racy and violent content resulted in high ticket sales, it seemed reasonable to continue producing such films. Soon, the flouting of the code became an open secret. In 1931, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that &quot;the Hays moral code is not even a joke any more; it&#x27;s just a memory&quot;; two years later &quot;Variety&quot; followed suit.

===Breen era===
On June 13, 1934, an amendment to the Code was adopted, which established the Production Code Administration (PCA) and required all films released on or after July 1, 1934, to obtain a certificate of approval before being released. The PCA had two offices: one in Hollywood and the other in New York City. The first film to receive an MPPDA seal of approval was &quot;The World Moves On&quot; (1934). For over 30 years, virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code. The Production Code was not created or enforced by federal, state, or city government; the Hollywood studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship, preferring self-regulation to government regulation.

Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit, wrote: &quot;Silent smut had been bad. Vocal smut cried to the censors for vengeance.&quot; Thomas Doherty, Professor of American studies at Brandeis University, has defined the code as &quot;no mere list of Thou-Shalt-Nots, but a homily that sought to yoke Catholic doctrine to Hollywood formula. The guilty are punished, the virtuous rewarded, the authority of church and state is legitimate, and the bonds of matrimony are sacred.&quot; What resulted has been described as &quot;a Jewish-owned business selling Catholic theology to Protestant America&quot;.

Joseph I. Breen, a prominent Catholic layman who had worked in public relations, was appointed head of the PCA. Under Breen&#x27;s leadership, which lasted until his retirement in 1954, enforcement of the Production Code became notoriously rigid. Even cartoon sex symbol Betty Boop had to change her characteristic flapper personality and dress, adopting an old-fashioned, near-matronly appearance. However, by 1934, the prohibition against miscegenation was defined only as sexual relationships between black and white races.

The first major instance of censorship under the Production Code involved the 1934 film &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot;, in which brief nude scenes involving a body double for actress Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan were edited out of the master negative of the film. By the time the Code became fully functional by January 1935, several films from the pre-Code era and the transition period beginning in July 1934 were pulled from release exchanges (with some of them never seeing public release again), which led studios to remake some of its early 1930s-era films in later years: 1941 saw the release of remakes of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, both having had very different pre-Code versions released ten years prior.

The Hays Code also required changes regarding adaptations of other media. For instance, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; could not retain a major element from Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1938 novel where the narrator discovers that her husband (the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter) killed his first wife (the titular Rebecca) and she makes light of it, since it followed Rebecca having strongly provoked and taunted him. As having a major character get away with murder and living happily ever after would have been a flagrant violation of the Code, Hitchcock&#x27;s version had Rebecca die in an accident with Maxim de Winter being only guilty for hiding the facts of her death. The 2020 remake, not bound by the Code, restored du Maurier&#x27;s original plot element.

The PCA also engaged in political censorship. When Warner Bros. wanted to make a film about Nazi concentration camps, the production office forbade it, citing the prohibition on depicting &quot;in an unfavorable light&quot; another country&#x27;s &quot;institutions [and] prominent people&quot;, with threats to take the matter to the federal government if the studio went ahead. This policy prevented a number of anti-Nazi films being produced. In 1938, the FBI unearthed and prosecuted a Nazi spy ring, subsequently allowing Warner to produce &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; (1939), with The Three Stooges&#x27; short subject &quot;You Nazty Spy!&quot; (1940) being the first Hollywood film of any sort to openly spoof the Third Reich&#x27;s leadership, followed soon after by &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.

Breen&#x27;s power to change scripts and scenes angered many writers, directors and Hollywood moguls. Breen influenced the production of &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), objecting to any explicit reference to Rick and Ilsa having slept together in Paris, and to the film mentioning that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants; ultimately, both remained strongly implied in the finished version. Adherence to the Code also ruled out any possibility of the film ending with Rick and Ilsa consummating their adulterous love, making inevitable the ending with Rick&#x27;s noble renunciation, one of &quot;Casablanca&quot;″s most famous scenes.
Some of Hollywood&#x27;s creative class managed to find positives in the Code&#x27;s limitations however. Director Edward Dmytryk later said that the Code &quot;had a very good effect because it made us think. If we wanted to get something across that was censorable... we had to do it deviously. We had to be clever. And it usually turned out to be much better than if we had done it straight.&quot;

Outside the mainstream studio system, the code was sometimes flouted by Poverty Row studios, while exploitation film presenters operating on the territorial (state-rights) distribution system openly violated it through the use of loopholes, masquerading the films as morality tales or muckraking exposés. One example of this is &quot;Child Bride&quot; (1938), which featured a nude scene involving a twelve-year-old child actress (Shirley Mills). 

Newsreels were mostly exempt from the Code, although their content was mostly toned down by the end of 1934 as the result of public outrage over the coverage of the killings of John Dillinger in July, and of &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson and three girls in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the latter two occurring during the same week in November, not deviating much from the Code until World War II. 

However, the most famous defiance of the code was the case of &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, a western produced by Howard Hughes, which was denied a certificate of approval after it was completed in 1941 since the film&#x27;s advertising focused particular attention on Jane Russell&#x27;s breasts. When the film&#x27;s initial 1943 release was shuttered by the MPPDA after a week, Hughes eventually persuaded Breen that this did not violate the code and the film could be shown, although without a seal of approval. The film eventually got a general release in 1946. The David O. Selznick production &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; was also released in 1946 without the approval of the Hays Office, featuring several on-screen deaths, adultery and displays of lust.

The financial success of both films became deciding factors in the weakening of the Code in the late 1940s, when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and miscegenation were allowed in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948) and &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949), respectively. In 1951, the MPAA revised the code to make it more rigid, spelling out more words and subjects that were prohibited. That same year however, MGM head Louis B. Mayer, one of Breen&#x27;s foremost allies, was ousted after a series of disputes with the studio&#x27;s production head, Dore Schary, whose preference for gritty &quot;social realism&quot; films was often at odds with the Hays Office. In 1954, Breen retired, largely because of ill health, and Geoffrey Shurlock was appointed as his successor.

===Post-Breen era===
Hollywood continued to work within the confines of the Production Code throughout the late 1940s and 1950s, but during this time, the film industry was faced with very serious competitive threats. The first threat came from television, a new technology that did not require Americans to leave their houses to see motion pictures. Hollywood needed to offer the public something it could not get on television, which itself was under an even more restrictive censorship code.

In addition to the threat of television, the industry was enduring a period of economic difficulties that were compounded by the result of &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; (1948), in which the Supreme Court outlawed vertical integration as it had been found to violate anti-trust laws, and studios were not only forced to give up ownership of theaters, but they were also unable to control what exhibitors offered.

This led to increasing competition from foreign films which were not bound by the Code, such as Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948), released in the United States in 1949. In 1950, film distributor Joseph Burstyn released &quot;The Ways of Love&quot;, which included &quot;The Miracle&quot;, a short film originally part of &quot;L&#x27;Amore&quot; (1948), an anthology film directed by Roberto Rossellini. This segment was considered to mock the Nativity, so the New York State Board of Regents (in charge of film censorship in the state) revoked the film&#x27;s license. The ensuing lawsuit, &quot;Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson&quot; (dubbed the &quot;Miracle Decision&quot;), was resolved by the Supreme Court in 1952, which unanimously overruled its 1915 decision (&quot;Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio&quot;), and held that motion pictures were entitled to First Amendment protection, and thus the short could not be banned. This reduced the threat of government regulation, which had formerly been cited as justification for the Production Code, and the PCA&#x27;s powers over the Hollywood industry were greatly reduced.
Two Swedish films, &quot;One Summer of Happiness&quot; (1951), and Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Summer with Monika&quot; (1953) were released in 1955 as exploitation movies, their success leading to a wave of sexually-provocative European product reaching American theaters. Some British films, such as &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Leather Boys&quot; (1964), challenged traditional gender roles, and openly confronted the prejudices against homosexuals, all in clear violation of the Hollywood Production Code.

Furthermore, the postwar years saw a gradual, if moderate, liberalization of American culture. A boycott by the National Legion of Decency no longer guaranteed a film&#x27;s commercial failure (to the point several films were no longer condemned by the Legion by the 1950s), and several aspects of the Code had slowly lost their taboo. In 1956, areas of the Code were rewritten to accept subjects such as miscegenation, adultery, and prostitution. For example, a proposed remake of &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, a pre-Code film dealing with prostitution, was canceled by MGM twice, in 1940 and in 1946, as the character Anna was not allowed to be portrayed as a prostitute. By 1962, such subject matter was acceptable, and the original film was given a seal of approval.

Two 1956 films, &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; and &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, generated great controversy involving the PCA. The first dealt with the deaths of children, including that of the &quot;wicked child&quot; protagonist Rhoda at the end, which had been the result of changing the ending from the original novel to abide with the Code&#x27;s &quot;crime must pay&quot; rule. On the other hand, the second film was vociferously attacked by religious and moral leaders, partly because of its provocative publicity, while the MPAA attracted great criticism for approving a film that ridiculed law enforcement and often used racial epithets. However, the Legion&#x27;s condemnation of the film did not attract a unified response from religious authorities, some of which considered that other films, including &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (released that same year), had a similar amount and intensity of sensuous content.
During the 1950s, studios found ways of both complying with the code, while at the same time circumventing it. In 1956, Columbia acquired an art-house distributor, Kingsley Productions, that specialized in importing foreign art films, in order to distribute and capitalize on the notoriety of the film &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956). Columbia&#x27;s agreement with the MPAA forbade it from distributing a film without a seal of approval, but the agreement did not specify what a subsidiary could do. Thus, exempt from the rules imposed by the code, subsidiary distributors were utilized, and even created by major studios such as Columbia, in order to defy and weaken the code. United Artists followed suit and bought art film distributor Lopert Films in 1958, and within a decade all the major studios were distributing foreign art films. 

Author Peter Lev writes:
Explicit sexuality became expected in foreign films, to such an extent that &quot;foreign film&quot;, &quot;art film&quot;, &quot;adult film&quot; and &quot;sex film&quot; were for several years almost synonyms.&lt;br&gt;

Beginning in the late 1950s, increasingly explicit films began to appear, such as &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959), &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1960), often dealing with adult subjects and sexual matters that had not been seen in Hollywood films since enforcement of the production code began in 1934. The MPAA reluctantly granted the seal of approval for these films, although not until certain changes were made. Owing to its themes, Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959) was not granted a certificate of approval, but still became a box office smash, and as a result, it further weakened the authority of the Code.

At the forefront of contesting the Code was director Otto Preminger, whose films violated the Code repeatedly in the 1950s. His 1953 film &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;, about a young woman who tries to play two suitors off against each other by claiming that she plans to keep her virginity until marriage, was released without a certificate of approval by United Artists, the first production distributed by a member of the MPAA to do so. He later made &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), which portrayed the prohibited subject of drug abuse, and &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959), which dealt with murder and rape. Like &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, Preminger&#x27;s films were direct assaults on the authority of the Production Code, and their success hastened its abandonment. 

In 1964, the Holocaust film &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Rod Steiger, was initially rejected because of two scenes in which actresses Linda Geiser and Thelma Oliver fully expose their breasts, and also because of a sex scene between Oliver and Jaime Sánchez that was described as &quot;unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful&quot;. Despite the rejection, the film&#x27;s producers arranged for Allied Artists to release the film without the Production Code seal, with the New York censors licensing the film without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. The producers appealed the rejection to the MPAA. On a 6–3 vote, the MPAA granted the film an exception, conditional on &quot;reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable&quot;. The requested reductions of nudity were minimal, and the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film&#x27;s producers.

&quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. The exception to the code was granted as a &quot;special and unique case&quot; and was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; at the time as &quot;an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent&quot;. In &quot;Pictures at a Revolution&quot;, a 2008 study of films during that era, Mark Harris wrote that the MPAA approval was &quot;the first of a series of injuries to the Production Code that would prove fatal within three years&quot;.

===Abandonment===
In 1963, MPAA president Eric Johnston, who had previously &quot;liberalized&quot; the Code, died. The next three years were marked by a power struggle between two factions, which led to an erratic application of the Code. Finally, the &quot;liberal&quot; faction prevailed by 1966, installing Jack Valenti as the Association&#x27;s new head. The chaos of the interim period had rendered enforcement impossible and Valenti, an opponent of the Production Code, began working on a rating system under which film restrictions would lessen, an idea that had been considered as early as 1960 in response to the success of the non-approved &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; and &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;.

In 1966, Warner Bros. released &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, the first film to feature the &quot;Suggested for Mature Audiences&quot; (SMA) label. As the PCA board was divided about censoring the film&#x27;s explicit language, Valenti negotiated a compromise: the word &quot;screw&quot; was removed, but other language remained, including the phrase &quot;hump the hostess&quot;. The film received Production Code approval despite the previously prohibited language.

That same year, the British-produced, American-financed film &quot;Blowup&quot; was denied Production Code approval for its various instances of nudity, foreplay and intercourse. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released it anyway, under a specially-created pseudonym, Premier Productions. This was the first instance of an MPAA member company directly producing a film without an approval certificate. Also, the original, lengthy code was replaced by a list of eleven points outlining that the boundaries of the new code would be current community standards and good taste. Any film containing content deemed suitable for older audiences would feature the SMA label in its advertising. With the creation of this new label, the MPAA unofficially began classifying films.

The MPAA film rating system went into effect on November 1, 1968, with the four rating symbols: &quot;G&quot; meaning suggested for general exhibition (persons of all ages admitted), &quot;M&quot; meaning suggested for mature audiences, &quot;R&quot; meaning suggested as restricted (persons under 16 not admitted unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian), and &quot;X&quot; meaning persons under 16 would not be admitted. By the end of 1968, Geoffrey Shurlock stepped down from his post, and the PCA effectively dissolved, being replaced by the Code and Rating Administration (CARA), headed by Eugene Dougherty. The CARA would replace &quot;Code&quot; with &quot;Classification&quot; in 1978.

In 1969, the Swedish film &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;, directed by Vilgot Sjöman, was initially banned in the U.S. for its frank depiction of sexuality; however, this was overturned by the Supreme Court. In 1970, because of confusion over the meaning of &quot;mature audiences&quot;, the M rating was changed to &quot;GP&quot; meaning &quot;for general exhibition, but parental guidance is suggested&quot;, then in 1972 to the current &quot;PG&quot;, for &quot;parental guidance suggested&quot;. In 1984, in response to public complaints regarding the severity of horror elements in PG-rated titles such as &quot;Gremlins&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, the &quot;PG-13&quot; rating was created as a middle tier between PG and R. In 1990, the X rating was replaced by &quot;NC-17&quot; (under 17 not admitted) because of the former&#x27;s stigma, being associated with pornography; as the X rating was not trademarked by the MPAA (which expected producers would prefer to self-rate such product), it was soon appropriated by adult bookstores and theaters, which marketed their products as being rated X, XX and XXX.

As the American Humane Association depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor the sets used for production, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 also corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on sets. The association did not regain its access until 1980.

<text>The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) is a British symphony orchestra based in London.

The RPO was established by Thomas Beecham in 1946. In its early days, the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham&#x27;s death in 1961, the RPO&#x27;s fortunes declined steeply. The RPO battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after a report by the Arts Council of Great Britain recommended that it should receive public subsidy. A further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra&#x27;s right to call itself &quot;Royal&quot; could be withdrawn.

In 2004, the RPO acquired its first permanent London base, at Cadogan Hall in Chelsea. The RPO also gives concerts at the Royal Festival Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and venues around the UK and other countries. Since the start of the 2021–2022 season, the orchestra&#x27;s musical director has been Vasily Petrenko.

==History==

===Origins===

In 1932, Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with the backing of rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham&#x27;s return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back and, in October, they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months, Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again, it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham responded, &quot;I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.&quot; In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge&#x27;s new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO. His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in &quot;the most auspicious circumstances and &quot;éclat&quot;&quot;.

In 1946, Beecham reached an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society: his orchestra would replace the LPO at all the Society&#x27;s concerts. He thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the &quot;Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;, an arrangement approved by George VI. Beecham arranged with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne seasons. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. The music critic Lyndon Jenkins writes:

===Beecham&#x27;s orchestra===
Beecham appointed Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, and they started recruiting. At the top of their list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain&#x27;s orchestral leaders at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.
On 11 September 1946, the Royal Philharmonic assembled for its first rehearsal. Four days later it gave its first concert, at the Davis Theatre, Croydon. Beecham telegraphed a colleague, &quot;Press virtually unanimous in praise of orchestra. First Croydon concert huge success&quot;. Beecham and the orchestra played a series of out-of-town engagements before venturing a first London concert on 26 October. &quot;The Times&quot; then spoke of &quot;a hall filled with golden tone which enveloped the listener&quot;. Before its London debut the orchestra made its first recording and, within two years, had made more than 100.

Within a few months, Pennington was forced to resign when the British Musicians&#x27; Union discovered that he was not one of its members. He was succeeded by his deputy Oscar Lampe, &quot;a man who eschewed most social graces but played the violin divinely&quot;, according to Jenkins. In the early days, the orchestra comprised 72 players, all on yearly contract to Beecham, giving him first call on their services, subject to reasonable notice, but not otherwise restricting their freedom to play for other ensembles. A review of the London orchestral scene of the late 1940s said of the RPO and its main rival: &quot;The Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic share a very serious disability: that neither is a permanently constituted orchestra. Both assemble and disperse more or less at random ... there is no style which is distinctively RPO or Philharmonia.&quot;

Brain continued to play first horn for both orchestras; otherwise, from the early 1950s, there was generally more stability of orchestral personnel. In particular, the RPO became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, in which Jackson was joined by Jack Brymer (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon) and Terence MacDonagh (oboe). &quot;The Independent&quot; described them as &quot;arguably the finest ever wind section ... [they] became known as &#x27;The Royal Family&#x27;.&quot;

The RPO toured the United States in 1950, the first British orchestra to visit America since the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1912. This was a long-cherished plan of Beecham&#x27;s, who had been unable to take the LPO to the US in the 1930s. He arranged 52 concerts in 45 cities in 64 days. The tour was described by Brain&#x27;s biographers Gamble and Lynch as a huge success. It began on 13 October in Hartford, Connecticut and finished on 15 December in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The concerto soloists were the pianist Betty Humby Beecham (the conductor&#x27;s second wife) and orchestral principals: David McCallum (violin), Anthony Pini (cello) and the four members of the &quot;Royal Family&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Olin Downes wrote of &quot;magnificent music-making by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic&quot;. The following year, assessing all the London orchestras, Frank Howes, music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, concluded that the RPO &quot;comes nearest in quality and in consistency of style to the great international orchestras&quot;.

The orchestra&#x27;s first appearance at the Proms took place in August 1952, conducted by Basil Cameron. Beecham made his Proms debut two years later, conducting the RPO in a programme of music by Berlioz, Schubert and Sibelius; &quot;The Times&quot; commented on &quot;an evening of magnificent playing&quot;. In 1957, Beecham and the RPO made a European tour, beginning at the Salle Pleyel in Paris and ending at the Musikverein in Vienna.

Beecham conducted the RPO in his last concert, given at Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the &quot;Magic Flute&quot; Overture, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Military&quot; Symphony, Beecham&#x27;s own Handel arrangement &quot;Love in Bath&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, &quot;On the River&quot; by Delius, and the &quot;Bacchanale&quot; from Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, with Delius&#x27;s &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; as an encore. Beecham suffered a heart attack the following month, from which he did not recover; he died in March 1961.

===1961–2000===

Rudolf Kempe, who had been appointed associate conductor in 1960, became principal conductor in 1961 and music director in 1962. Beecham&#x27;s widow ran the affairs of the orchestra as best she could, but some senior players including Brymer and MacDonagh were unhappy with the management and they left. The orchestra reorganised itself in 1963 as a self-governing limited company, but almost immediately encountered difficulties. The Royal Philharmonic Society decided not to engage the RPO for its concerts; Glyndebourne booked the LPO instead of the RPO from 1964 onwards. The RPO was also excluded from the London Orchestral Concert Board&#x27;s schedule of concerts, which meant that it was denied the use of London&#x27;s main concert venue, the Royal Festival Hall. Kempe resigned, although he returned shortly afterwards. Helped by strong support from Sir Malcolm Sargent, the orchestra successfully mounted its own concerts at a cinema in Swiss Cottage, to the north-west of the Festival Hall. A 1965 report to the Arts Council by a committee chaired by Alan Peacock recommended that all four independent London orchestras should receive adequate public subsidy.

The severance of the tie with the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1963 turned out to be temporary, but for three years it threatened to deprive the RPO of the &quot;Royal&quot; in its title. The matter was resolved in 1966, when, on the advice of Roy Jenkins who, as Home Secretary, had responsibility for such matters, the Queen conferred the title unconditionally on the orchestra.
The RPO celebrated its silver jubilee in 1971. On 15 September, the orchestra returned to Croydon, where it had made its debut 25 years earlier. The theatre in which it had first played had been demolished and the anniversary concert was therefore given at the Fairfield Halls. The programme consisted of the overture to &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto, and Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;. Sir Adrian Boult conducted, and Clifford Curzon was the soloist. Five members of the original orchestra were still in the RPO for the jubilee concert: Leonard Brain (brother of Dennis), principal cor anglais; Lewis Pocock, co-principal timpani; Ernest Ineson, double bass; John Myers, viola; and Albert Pievsky, violin.

The RPO gave Kempe the title of &quot;Conductor for Life&quot; in 1970. Kempe stepped down from the orchestra in 1975, the year before his death. Antal Doráti succeeded Kempe as chief conductor from 1975 to 1978. As in his earlier spells with the LSO and BBC Symphony Orchestra, he was not greatly liked by his players, but raised their standard of playing and imposed discipline.

In 1984, a new threat to the orchestra emerged, where a review carried out on behalf of the Arts Council by the journalist William Rees-Mogg opined that England lacked &quot;a great eastern symphony orchestra&quot;: the suggestion was that the RPO should move to Nottingham. Another Arts Council report of the same period recommended that the RPO should supplement the LSO as resident orchestra at the Barbican Centre; neither proposal came to fruition. During the 1980s, the British government imposed strict constraints on public spending; to make up for lost revenue, the RPO, in common with the other self-governing London orchestras, was forced into increased reliance on business sponsorship as a primary source of funds. The &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, recording this, comments, &quot;Such sponsorship is, however, subject to changing circumstances and thus less secure in the long term.&quot;

Since 1993, the RPO has had a community and education programme, later given the title of &quot;RPO Resound&quot;. It aims to increase &quot;access to and engagement with world-class music-making.&quot; It has worked in venues including homeless shelters, hospices, youth clubs and prisons.

On 7 April 1994, the RPO, with guest leader Hugh Bean, was joined by the Cappella Giulia of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica and the Accademia Filarmonica Romana, cellist Lynn Harrell and actor Richard Dreyfuss, in the Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah, conducted by Gilbert Levine. This concert was attended by Pope John Paul II, Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, and President of Italy Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and was broadcast throughout Europe via Eurovision and on PBS stations throughout the United States. It was released on CD by Justice Records and as video by Time-Warner.

===21st century===

The orchestra gives an annual series of concerts at the Festival Hall and, since 2004, has had a permanent home at Cadogan Hall, a former church in Chelsea, converted into a 900-seat concert hall and rehearsal space. At the Royal Albert Hall in London, the RPO gives performances ranging from large-scale choral and orchestral works to evenings of popular classics.

The RPO returned to international television on 29 July 2005, when it was joined by the London Philharmonic Choir and soloists Bozena Harasimowicz, Monica Groop, Jerry Hadley, and Franz-Josef Selig performing Beethoven&#x27;s Missa Solemnis under the baton of Gilbert Levine in Cologne Cathedral. This performance was televised by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), 3sat and PBS and was released on DVD by Arthaus Musik.

The orchestra maintains a regional touring programme, taking in venues throughout the UK, and has established residencies in Aylesbury, Crawley, Croydon, Dartford, High Wycombe, Ipswich, Lowestoft, Northampton and Reading. The RPO regularly tours overseas; since 2010 it has played in Azerbaijan, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, Turkey and the US. In 2010–11 and two subsequent seasons the RPO was the resident orchestra for a series of concerts in Montreux, Switzerland. In 2010 the orchestra toured England, with a repertoire preponderantly of Beethoven, including the Violin Concerto in which Pinchas Zukerman was both soloist and conductor. In the same year, another tour featured Maxim Shostakovich conducting the music of his father, Dmitri Shostakovich. The RPO continues to feature at the Proms. In December 2015, RPO gave a concert with Sezen Aksu at Zorlu PSM. In November 2019, the Royal Albert Hall announced the RPO as its official associate orchestra, with an initial contract of 5 years.

The orchestra&#x27;s community and education activities have continued into the 21st century. In May 2013, six youth ensembles from London boroughs and a 3,500-strong choir of children from local primary schools were given the chance to perform alongside members of the RPO at the Albert Hall. They played a piece composed by participants from all six musical ensembles.

In November 2022, three performances by the orchestra were released on streaming service On Air. Recorded at BBC Television Centre, performances of &quot;The Rite Of Spring&quot;, &quot;The Firebird&quot; and &quot;Petrushka&quot; by Igor Stravinsky were captured. In 2023, RPO musicians were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

In March 2024, the RPO announced the appointment of Sarah Bardwell as its next managing director, in succession to James Williams.

==Players and conductors==
Among the well-known musicians who have been RPO principals in the mid-1950s and later, string players include Steven Staryk (leader, 1957–1959), Raymond Cohen (leader, 1959–1966), Alan Loveday (leader, 1967–1971), Erich Gruenberg (leader, 1972–1976), Barry Griffiths (leader, 1976–1989), Jonathan Carney (leader, 1991–1994), Clio Gould (leader, 2002-2016) and Frederick Riddle (viola, 1953–1977). Among the woodwind principals have been Geoffrey Gilbert (flute, 1957–1961), James Galway (flute, 1967–1969), Antony Pay (clarinet, 1968–1978) and Michael Chapman (bassoon, 1978–1999). Principals in the brass section have included Alan Civil (horn, 1952–1955), Philip Jones (trumpet, 1956–1960), Elgar Howarth (trumpet, 1963–1969) and Martin Owen (horn, 1998–2008).

Chief conductors since Dorati have been Walter Weller (1980–1985), André Previn (1985–1992), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1987–1994), Yuri Temirkanov (1992–1998) and Daniele Gatti (1996–2009). Charles Dutoit was artistic director and principal conductor from 2009 until January 2018, when he resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct.

From 1992 to 2000, Peter Maxwell Davies was associate conductor and composer to the RPO. Other conductors with close ties to the orchestra have included Sir Charles Groves, Vernon Handley, Sir Charles Mackerras, Yehudi Menuhin, Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Leopold Stokowski. Grzegorz Nowak was appointed principal associate conductor in 2008, and in the following year, Pinchas Zukerman became the RPO&#x27;s principal guest conductor.

Vasily Petrenko first guest-conducted the RPO in March 2016. In July 2018, the RPO announced the appointment of Petrenko as its new music director, with an initial contract of five years from the 2021–2022 season. In April 2024, the RPO announced the appointment of Joe Hisaishi as its next composer-in-association. In April 2024, the RPO announced the extension of Petrenko&#x27;s contract as its music director through the 2029-2030 season.

==Recordings==

From the RPO&#x27;s earliest days to the end of Beecham&#x27;s life, they made numerous recordings for His Master&#x27;s Voice, CBS and RCA Victor. Among the works they recorded EMI chose several to be reissued at the end of the twentieth century in its &quot;Great Recordings of the Century&quot; series. They included a Delius programme; a Grieg programme; French ballet music; short works by Bizet, Chabrier, Fauré and Saint-Saëns; Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No 4 and &quot;Nutcracker&quot; Suite; Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; Symphony, Clarinet Concerto (Brymer) and Bassoon Concerto (Brooke); and Schubert&#x27;s 3rd, 5th and 6th Symphonies.

After Beecham&#x27;s death, the RPO made many recordings for Decca, sometimes under pseudonyms such as the &quot;Beecham Symphony Orchestra&quot;, the &quot;London Festival Orchestra&quot; and the &quot;Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra&quot;. In the 1960s, the RPO also recorded commercially with such conductors as Sir John Barbirolli, Fritz Reiner, Charles Munch, Georges Prêtre, Kempe, Previn and Stokowski. Soloists included Earl Wild, Shura Cherkassky, Alan Civil and Luciano Pavarotti.

Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; with the RPO in 1964. Colin Davis made some of his earliest recordings with the orchestra, including Mozart and Rossini overtures, Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;. From 1964 to 1979 the RPO was engaged by Decca to record Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. The orchestra has also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, Lyrita, Philips, Pye and Unicorn-Kanchana.

In 1986, the orchestra launched RPO Records, claimed to be &quot;the world&#x27;s first record label to be owned by a symphony orchestra&quot;. Recordings available on the RPO label in 2013 ranged from core symphonic repertoire and Tchaikovsky ballet scores to film music by various composers, light music by Burt Bacharach and Richard Rodgers, and an album called &quot;Symphonic Rock&quot;, described as &quot;Over 3 hours of classic rock anthems and pop tracks with an orchestral twist&quot;.

==Non-classical work==
As well as performing works from the classical repertoire, the RPO has recorded a number of film scores, including those for Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. Other scores recorded by the RPO are Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, and &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

With Tony Bremner, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra rerecorded symphonic suites from various episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. These recordings were released in 1985 under Label &quot;X&quot; in two volumes.

In 1987, the RPO established a sister ensemble, the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, which plays lighter classics. It succeeded a similar group, the Royal Philharmonic Pops Orchestra. In 1989, the RPO recorded the flamenco album &quot;Soy Gitano&quot; (I am a gipsy man) with Camarón de la Isla.

RPO players have been involved with many performances away from the classical repertory. In the 1960s, they pioneered the &quot;mixed media&quot; concert, appearing with The Nice rock band. Later non-classical ventures included &quot;Yanni Live at the Acropolis&quot;, a concert held in Greece in 1993, conducted by Shahrdad Rohani; In 1992 UEFA commissioned the orchestra and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields chorus to record the UEFA Champions League Hymn. Jamaican reggae singers John Holt and Freddie McGregor performed with the Orchestra in 2003 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London.

<doc id="167823" wikidata="Q841486" url="?curid=167823" title="Isometric projection">
<text>Isometric projection is a method for visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions in technical and engineering drawings. It is an axonometric projection in which the three coordinate axes appear equally foreshortened and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees.

== Overview ==
The term &quot;isometric&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;equal measure&quot;, reflecting that the scale along each axis of the projection is the same (unlike some other forms of graphical projection).

An isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; axes are all the same, or 120°. For example, with a cube, this is done by first looking straight towards one face. Next, the cube is rotated ±45° about the vertical axis, followed by a rotation of approximately 35.264° (precisely arcsin or arctan , which is related to the Magic angle) about the horizontal axis. Note that with the cube (see image) the perimeter of the resulting 2D drawing is a perfect regular hexagon: all the black lines have equal length and all the cube&#x27;s faces are the same area. Isometric graph paper can be placed under a normal piece of drawing paper to help achieve the effect without calculation.

In a similar way, an &quot;isometric view&quot; can be obtained in a 3D scene. Starting with the camera aligned parallel to the floor and aligned to the coordinate axes, it is first rotated horizontally (around the vertical axis) by ±45°, then 35.264° around the horizontal axis.

Another way isometric projection can be visualized is by considering a view within a cubical room starting in an upper corner and looking towards the opposite, lower corner. The &quot;x&quot;-axis extends diagonally down and right, the &quot;y&quot;-axis extends diagonally down and left, and the &quot;z&quot;-axis is straight up. Depth is also shown by height on the image. Lines drawn along the axes are at 120° to one another.

In all these cases, as with all axonometric and orthographic projections, such a camera would need a object-space telecentric lens, in order that projected lengths not change with distance from the camera.

The term &quot;isometric&quot; is often mistakenly used to refer to axonometric projections, generally. There are, however, actually three types of axonometric projections: &quot;isometric&quot;, &quot;dimetric&quot; and &quot;oblique&quot;.

==Rotation angles==
From the two angles needed for an isometric projection, the value of the second may seem counterintuitive and deserves some further explanation. Let&#x27;s first imagine a cube with sides of length 2, and its center at the axis origin, which means all its faces intersect the axes at a distance of 1 from the origin. We can calculate the length of the line from its center to the middle of any edge as using Pythagoras&#x27; theorem . By rotating the cube by 45° on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, the point (1, 1, 1) will therefore become (1, 0, ) as depicted in the diagram. The second rotation aims to bring the same point on the positive &quot;z&quot;-axis and so needs to perform a rotation of value equal to the arctangent of which is approximately 35.264°.

==Mathematics==
There are eight different orientations to obtain an isometric view, depending into which octant the viewer looks. The isometric transform from a point &quot;a&quot; in 3D space to a point &quot;b&quot; in 2D space looking into the first octant can be written mathematically with rotation matrices as:
formula_1

where &quot;α&quot; = arcsin(tan 30°) ≈ 35.264° and &quot;β&quot; = 45°. As explained above, this is a rotation around the vertical (here &quot;y&quot;) axis by &quot;β&quot;, followed by a rotation around the horizontal (here &quot;x&quot;) axis by &quot;α&quot;. This is then followed by an orthographic projection to the &quot;xy&quot;-plane:
formula_2

The other 7 possibilities are obtained by either rotating to the opposite sides or not, and then inverting the view direction or not.

== History and limitations ==
First formalized by Professor William Farish (1759–1837), the concept of isometry had existed in a rough empirical form for centuries. From the middle of the 19th century, isometry became an &quot;invaluable tool for engineers, and soon thereafter axonometry and isometry were incorporated in the curriculum of architectural training courses in Europe and the U.S.&quot; According to Jan Krikke (2000) however, &quot;axonometry originated in China. Its function in Chinese art was similar to linear perspective in European art. Axonometry, and the pictorial grammar that goes with it, has taken on a new significance with the advent of visual computing&quot;.
As with all types of parallel projection, objects drawn with isometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. While advantageous for architectural drawings where measurements need to be taken directly, the result is a perceived distortion, as unlike perspective projection, it is not how human vision or photography normally work. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right or above. This can appear to create paradoxical or impossible shapes, such as the Penrose stairs.

==Usage in video games and pixel art==
Isometric video game graphics are graphics employed in video games and pixel art that utilize a parallel projection, but which angle the viewpoint to reveal facets of the environment that would otherwise not be visible from a top-down perspective or side view, thereby producing a three-dimensional effect. Despite the name, isometric computer graphics are not necessarily truly isometric—i.e., the , , and axes are not necessarily oriented 120° to each other. Instead, a variety of angles are used, with dimetric projection and a 2:1 pixel ratio being the most common. The terms &quot; perspective&quot;, &quot; view&quot;, &quot;2.5D&quot;, and &quot;pseudo 3D&quot; are also sometimes used, although these terms can bear slightly different meanings in other contexts.

Once common, isometric projection became less so with the advent of more powerful 3D graphics systems, and as video games began to focus more on action and individual characters. However, video games utilizing isometric projection—especially computer role-playing games—have seen a resurgence in recent years within the indie gaming scene.

<doc id="167835" wikidata="Q314350" url="?curid=167835" title="Antoine Bourdelle">
<text>Antoine Bourdelle (; 30 October 1861 – 1 October 1929), born Émile Antoine Bordelles, was an influential and prolific French sculptor and teacher. He was a student of Auguste Rodin, a teacher of Giacometti and Henri Matisse, and an important figure in the Art Deco movement and the transition from the Beaux-Arts style to modern sculpture.

His studio became the Musée Bourdelle, an art museum dedicated to his work, located at 18, rue Antoine Bourdelle, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, France.

==Early life and education==
Émile Antoine Bourdelle was born at Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne in France on 30 October 1861. His father was a wood craftsman and cabinet-maker. In 1874, at the age of thirteen, he left school to work in his father&#x27;s workshop, and also began carving his first sculptures of wood.

In 1876, with the assistance of writer Émile Pouvillon, he received a scholarship to attend the School of Fine Arts in Toulouse, though he remained fiercely independent and resisted the formal program. In 1884, at the age of twenty-four, he earned second place in the competition to enter the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. There he worked in the studio of Alexandre Falguière and frequented the studio of Jules Dalou, who was his neighbor.

== Career ==

In 1885 he participated in the annual Salon of artists and won an honorable mention for his work, &quot;The First Victory of Hannibal&quot;. He rented a studio at 16 Impasse du Main, next to the painters Eugène Carrière and Jean-Paul Laurens. He worked in this studio until his death.

In 1887, he quit the studio of Falguièr, and, moved by the music of Beethoven, he made his first of what would eventually be some forty sculptures of the composer. In September 1893 Bourdelle joined the studio of Auguste Rodin. His collaboration with Rodin lasted fifteen years. In 1895, he received his first official commission, a war monument for the city of Montauban. His proposed plans, different from traditional monuments, created a scandal. Rodin intervened on his behalf, and the monument was finally erected in 1902.

In 1900, Bourdelle demonstrated his independence from Rodin&#x27;s style with a bust of Apollo. In the same year, Bourdelle, Rodin and the sculptor Desbois opened a free school of sculpture, the Institut Rodin-Debois-Bourdelle. One of the students was Henri Matisse, who later produced some remarkable sculpture, but the school did not last long.
In 1905, Bourdelle had his first personal exhibition, in the gallery of the foundry-owner Hébrand. With the support of Hébrand and the material assistance of his foundry, Bourdelle was able to make larger works and earn greater recognition. His father died in 1906, and Bourdelle changed his first name to simply Antoine, after his father. He married his second wife, Cléopatre Sevastos (1892-1972), who was of Greek origin. She and their daughter, Rhodia, became a frequent inspiration for his works.

In 1908, Bourdelle left the studio of Rodin and set out on his own. In 1909 he exhibited a new work, &quot;Hercules the Archer&quot; at the annual Salon of the Societé Nationale des Beaux-Arts. He began to teach at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, where his students included Giacometti, Isaac Frenkel and Adaline Kent.

In 1913 the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was inaugurated, with decoration on the facade and the interior atrium designed by Bourdelle. This work announced the debut of the Art Deco style, and was an important step towards modernism. He was a participant in the 1913 Armory Show in New York, a founder and vice-president of the Parisian Salon des Tuileries. He remained in Paris during the First World War, working on a commission for an art patron from Argentina, Rodolfo Acorta, a monument to General Alvear, which was inaugurated in Buenos Aires in 1925. In 1929, his first major public sculpture in Paris, the monument to the Polish poet Mickiewicz, was inaugurated on Place d&#x27;Alma.

== Death and legacy ==

Bourdelle, in poor health, died at Le Vésinet, near Paris, on 1 October 1929 and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris, France.

=== Museums ===
Today the Musée Bourdelle in Paris sits amidst brick houses at 18 rue Antoine Bourdelle, a small street between the Gare Montparnasse and the offices of the famous French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;. The museum consists of Bourdelle&#x27;s house, studio, and garden where he worked from 1884 to 1929.

In the 1930s his widow opened his art studio for viewings. In 1949, the atelier of Bourdelle was donated by his former spouse Cléopâtre and his daughter to the city of Paris and it was opened as the Musée Bourdelle, additionally the street was renamed as rue Antoine Bourdelle.

In 1904, Bourdelle married artist Stephanie van Parys (also known as Vanparys, 1877–1945). His wife often served as a model for Bourdelle; by 1910 they had divorced. Together with van Parys they had a son, Pierre Bourdelle (c.1903–1966) and Pierre became an artist most active in the United States, and notable for his work at Cincinnati Union Terminal in 1933.

Bourdelle married in 1918 his former art student, Cléopâtre Sevastos (1882–1972), who also served as his model. Together with Sevastos they had a daughter, Rhodia Bourdelle (her married name was Dufet, Dufet–Bourdelle, 1911–2002) and she was an art curator.

== Honors ==
In 1909 he was named Knight of the Legion of Honor, in 1919 &quot;Officier&quot; of the Legion of Honor, and in 1924 became a Commander of the Legion of Honor.

<text>The Massacre of Glencoe took place in Glen Coe in the Argyll region of the Scottish Highlands on 13 February 1692. An estimated 30 members and associates of Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by Scottish government forces, allegedly for failing to pledge allegiance to the new monarchs, William III and Mary II.

Although the Jacobite rising of 1689 had largely been suppressed by May 1690, a continuing need to police the Highlands diverted military resources from the Nine Years&#x27; War in Flanders. In late 1690, clan leaders loyal to the exiled House of Stuart agreed to swear allegiance to William and Mary, in return for a cash payment of £12,000. However, disagreements over how to divide this meant by December 1691 none of the clans had taken the oath. 

In response, Lord Stair, Scottish Secretary of State, decided to show the consequences of further delay. While others, including the Keppoch MacDonalds, also missed the deadline, the Glencoe MacDonalds appear to have been selected due to a combination of clan politics, and a reputation for lawlessness.

While similar events were not unknown in earlier Scottish history, this was no longer the case by 1692, and the brutality of the massacre shocked contemporaries. It became a significant element in the persistence of Jacobitism in the Highlands during the first half of the 18th century, and remains a powerful symbol to this day.

== Background ==
Some historians argue the late 17th-century Scottish Highlands were more peaceful than often suggested, the exception being Lochaber, identified as a refuge for cattle raiders and thieves by government officials, other chiefs and Gaelic poets. Much of this instability was blamed on the questionable legal status of the Keppoch estates, ostensibly held on a lease from the head of Clan Mackintosh, though disputed by the Keppoch MacDonald chief. Four Lochaber clans were consistently identified as prone to lawlessness; the Glencoe and Keppoch MacDonalds, the MacGregors, and Camerons. 

Levies from all four served in the Independent Highland Companies used to suppress the Conventicles in 1678–80. They also took part in the raid led by the Marquess of Atholl that followed Argyll&#x27;s Rising in 1685. Primarily directed against Lowland migrants settled in Cowal and Kintyre, the damage inflicted by Atholl&#x27;s raid destabilised large parts of the central and southern Highlands. In September 1688, James VII and II outlawed the Keppoch MacDonalds, shortly before he was deposed by the November 1688 Glorious Revolution.

In March 1689, James landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his kingdoms, with Camerons and Keppoch MacDonalds among those who joined Viscount Dundee for a supporting campaign in Scotland. Victory over a government army at Killiecrankie on 27 July cost the lives of Dundee and 600 Highlanders, while organised Jacobite military resistance largely ended after Cromdale in May 1690. However, the ongoing need to police the Highlands used resources needed for the Nine Years&#x27; War in Flanders, while close links between Western Scotland and Ulster meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other. Since peace in the Highlands required control of Lochaber, achieving this had wider strategic importance than might appear.

==Oath of allegiance to William and Mary==
After Killiecrankie, the Scottish government tried to negotiate a settlement with the Jacobite chiefs, terms varying based on events in Ireland and Scotland. In March 1690, Secretary of State Lord Stair offered to pay £12,000 in return for their agreement to take an oath of allegiance to William and Mary. The chiefs agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, with John Campbell, Earl of Breadalbane, signing for the government. Crucially, it did not specify how the money was to be divided, and disputes over this delayed the oath. In addition, Breadalbane argued part of it was owed him as compensation for damage done to his estates by the Glencoe MacDonalds.

The Battle of Aughrim on 12 July ended Jacobite chances of victory in the Williamite War in Ireland, and any immediate prospects of a Stuart restoration. On 26 August, the Scottish government issued a Royal Proclamation that offered a pardon to anyone taking the oath prior to 1 January 1692, with severe reprisals for those who did not. Two days later, secret articles began circulating which cancelled the Achallader agreement in the event of a Jacobite invasion. These were allegedly signed by all the attendees, including Breadalbane, who claimed they had been manufactured by the MacDonald chief Glengarry. Stair&#x27;s letters now focused on enforcement, reflecting his belief that forged or not, none of the signatories intended to keep their word.

In early October, the Jacobite chiefs asked the exiled James II for permission to take the oath unless he could mount an invasion before the deadline, a condition they knew was impossible. A document granting his approval was sent from Saint-Germain on 12 December and received by Glengarry on 23 December, who did not share it until 28th. While his reasons for the delay are unclear, one suggestion attributes it to an internal power struggle between Episcopalian MacDonalds like Glencoe, and the Catholic minority headed by Glengarry. 

As a result, it was not until 30 December that MacIain of Glencoe left for Fort William to take the oath from its commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Hill. Since he was not authorised to accept it, Hill sent MacIain to Inveraray with a letter for Sir Colin Campbell, the local magistrate. He administered the oath on 6 January, after which MacIain returned home. 

Glengarry himself did not take the oath until 4 February, while others did so by proxy, but only MacIain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the Scottish Privy Council. Stair&#x27;s letter of 2 December to Breadalbane shows the decision to make him an example was taken well before the deadline for the oath, originally as a much bigger operation; &#x27;...the clan Donell must be rooted out and Lochiel. Leave the McLeans to Argyll...&#x27; 

In January, Stair wrote three letters in quick succession to Sir Thomas Livingstone, military commander in Scotland; on the 7th, the intention was to &#x27;...destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheal&#x27;s lands, Kippochs, Glengarrie and Glenco...;&#x27; on the 9th, &#x27;...their chieftains all being papists, it is well the vengeance falls there; for my part, I regret the MacDonalds had not divided and...Kippoch and Glenco are safe.&#x27; The last, on 11 January, states; &#x27;...my lord Argile tells me Glenco hath not taken the oaths at which I rejoice...&#x27;

The Scottish Parliament passed a Decree of Forfeiture in 1690, depriving Glengarry of his lands, but he continued to hold Invergarry Castle, whose garrison included the senior Jacobite officers Alexander Cannon and Thomas Buchan. This suggests the Episcopalian Glencoe MacDonalds only replaced the Catholic Glengarry as the target on 11 January; MacIain&#x27;s son John MacDonald told the 1695 Commission the soldiers came to Glencoe from the north &#x27;...Glengarry&#x27;s house being reduced.&#x27;

The targeting of the Glencoe MacDonalds appears to have been driven by a variety of factors. After two years of negotiations, Stair was under pressure to ensure the deal stuck, while Argyll was competing for political influence with his kinsman Breadalbane, who also found it expedient to concur with the plan. Glengarry managed to eliminate an internal rival, was pardoned and had his lands returned by the Williamite government, while enhancing his reputation with the exiled court in Saint-Germain by being the last to swear.

==The Massacre==
In late January 1692, approximately 120 men from the Earl of Argyll&#x27;s Regiment of Foot arrived in Glencoe. Their commander was Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, an impoverished local landowner whose niece was married to one of MacIain&#x27;s sons. Campbell carried orders for &#x27;free quarter&#x27;, an established alternative to paying taxes in what was a largely non-cash society. The Glencoe MacDonalds had themselves been similarly billeted on the Campbells when serving with the Highland levies used to police Argyll in 1678.

On 12 February, Hill ordered Lieutenant Colonel James Hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from Glencoe at Kinlochleven. Meanwhile, another 400 men under Major Duncanson would join Glenlyon and sweep northwards up the glen, killing anyone they found, removing property and burning houses. Later that evening, Glenlyon received orders from Duncanson carried by Thomas Drummond, who commanded the Argylls&#x27; Grenadier company and was thus Glenlyon&#x27;s superior. His presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced, since witnesses later claimed he shot two people who asked Glenlyon for mercy.

In letters written on 30 January to Hamilton and Hill, Stair expresses concern that the MacDonalds would escape if warned, and emphasises the need for secrecy. This correlates with evidence from James Campbell, one of Glenlyon&#x27;s company, stating that they had no knowledge of the plan until the morning of 13 February. MacIain was killed, although his two sons escaped, and the 1695 Commission was given various figures for the number of casualties. The often-quoted figure of 38 dead was provided by Hamilton&#x27;s men, who were at the opposite end of the glen from where the killing took place, while the MacDonalds themselves claimed &#x27;the number they knew to be slaine were about 25&#x27;. Modern research estimates deaths resulting from the Massacre as &#x27;around 30&#x27;, while claims others died of exposure cannot be substantiated.

Since he arrived two hours late at 7:00 am, Duncanson joined Glenlyon only after most of the killings had been carried out, then advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock. Hamilton was not in position at Kinlochleven until 11:00; his detachment included two lieutenants, Francis Farquhar and Gilbert Kennedy, who often appear in anecdotes claiming they &#x27;broke their swords rather than carry out their orders.&#x27; This differs from their testimony to the Commission and is unlikely since they arrived hours after the killings, which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen.

In May, fears of a French invasion meant the Argylls were posted to Brentford in England, then Flanders, where they served until the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1697 when the regiment was disbanded. No action was taken against those involved; Glenlyon died in Bruges in August 1696, Duncanson was killed in Spain in May 1705, while Drummond survived to take part in another famous Scottish disaster, the Darien scheme.

==Investigation==
On 12 April 1692, the &quot;Paris Gazette&quot; published a copy of Glenlyon&#x27;s orders, allegedly found in an Edinburgh tavern and taken to France. Despite criticism of the government, there was little sympathy for the MacDonalds, Livingstone writing &quot;it&#x27;s not that anyone thinks the thieving tribe did not deserve to be destroyed, but that it should have been done by those quartered amongst them makes a great noise.&quot; The motivation for investigating the affair was largely political; having served in the old and new regimes, Stair was unpopular with supporters of both.

In the debate that followed, Colonel Hill claimed most Highlanders were peaceful, and even in Lochaber, He argued lawlessness was deliberately encouraged by leaders like Glengarry, while &quot;the midle sort of Gentrey and Commons...never got anything but hurt from it.&quot; The 1693 Highland Judicial Commission encouraged using the law to resolve issues like cattle theft, but the clan chiefs opposed it as reducing control over their tenants.

The issue appeared settled until the English Licensing of the Press Act 1662 expired in May 1695. The result was a huge increase in the number of political pamphlets published in London, among them &quot;Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &amp;c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe, Gaffney&quot;. Written by Jacobite activist Charles Leslie, it focused on William&#x27;s alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Johan de Witt, with Glencoe and other crimes as secondary charges.

A Commission was set up to determine whether there was a case to answer under &#x27;Slaughter under trust&#x27;, a Scottish act introduced in 1587 to reduce endemic feuding. The law applied to murder committed in &quot;cold-blood&quot;, when articles of surrender had been agreed, or hospitality accepted. It was first used in 1588 against Lachlan Mor Maclean, whose objections to his mother&#x27;s second marriage led him to murder his new stepfather, John MacDonald, and 18 members of the wedding party. Interpretation varied, such as in the cases of James MacDonald, who locked his parents in their house before setting it on fire in 1597, and the killing of prisoners after the 1647 Battle of Dunaverty. Both were deemed to have been committed in &quot;hot blood&quot;, and thus excluded.

As a capital offence and treason, it was an awkward weapon with which to attack Stair, since William himself signed the orders, and the intent was widely known in government circles. The Commission instead considered whether participants had exceeded orders, not their legality, and concluded Stair and Hamilton had a case to answer, but left the decision to William. While Stair was dismissed as Secretary of State, he returned to government in 1700 and was made an earl by the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne. An application by the survivors for compensation was ignored; they rebuilt their houses, and participated in the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings. An archaeological survey in 2019 showed Glencoe was occupied until the Highland Clearances of the mid-18th century.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
The brutality of the Massacre shocked Scottish society and became a Jacobite symbol of post-1688 oppression. In 1745, Prince Charles ordered Leslie&#x27;s pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes reprinted in the Edinburgh &quot;Caledonian Mercury&quot;. Glencoe then largely disappeared from public knowledge until it was referenced by historian Thomas Macaulay in his 1850 &quot;History of England&quot;. He sought to exonerate William from every one of Leslie&#x27;s charges, and is the origin of the claim that the Massacre was simply part of an ongoing feud between the MacDonalds and Clan Campbell.

Victorian era Scotland developed values that were both Unionist and Imperialist, while also being uniquely Scottish. Historical divisions meant this was largely expressed through a shared cultural identity, while the teaching of Scottish, rather than British history, virtually disappeared from universities. One modern historian suggests this meant that instead of being analysed as an historical event, Glencoe was incorporated into &#x27;the emotional trappings of the Scottish past...bonnie Scotland of the bens, glens and misty shieling, the Jacobites, Mary, Queen of Scots, tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary.&#x27; 

Even when the study of Scottish history re-emerged in the 1950s, Leslie&#x27;s writings continued to shape views of William&#x27;s reign as disastrous for Scotland. The Massacre became one of several incidents used to illustrate this perspective, others including the Darien scheme, the famine of the late 1690s, and the 1707 Union. 

The Massacre is still commemorated in an annual ceremony by the Clan Donald Society. Initiated in 1930, this is held at the Upper Carnoch memorial, a tapering Celtic cross installed in 1883 at the eastern end of Glencoe village. Another memorial includes the Henderson Stone, a granite boulder south of Carnach, originally known as the &#x27;Soldier&#x27;s Stone&#x27;. In the late 19th century, it was renamed &quot;Clach Eanruig&quot;, or &#x27;Henry&#x27;s Stone&#x27;, after the man reputed to be Piper to MacIain.

== In popular culture ==
Glencoe was a popular topic with 19th-century poets, notably Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Massacre of Glencoe&quot;. It was used as a subject by Thomas Campbell and George Gilfillan, as well as by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in her 1823 work &quot;Glencoe&quot;, T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Rannoch, by Glencoe&quot; and &quot;Two Poems from Glencoe&quot; by Douglas Stewart.

The massacre is alluded in Beethoven&#x27;s 25 25 Irish songs, WoO 152.

Examples in literature include &quot;The Masks of Purpose&quot; by Eric Linklater, and the novels &quot;Fire Bringer&quot; by David Clement-Davies, &quot;Corrag&quot; (known as &quot;Witch Light&quot; in paperback) by Susan Fletcher and &quot;Lady of the Glen&quot; by Jennifer Roberson. William Croft Dickinson references Glencoe in his 1963 short story &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;. &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; author, George R. R. Martin, cites the Glencoe Massacre as one of two historical influences on the infamous &quot;Red Wedding&quot; in his 2000 book &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;.

In 1962, Jim McLean wrote the song &quot;The Massacre Of Glencoe&quot;, which was published under Duart Music. The song was later adapted and performed by The Corries, as well as adapted for the Highland Bagpipes by various artists. In 1972 the Scottish band Nazareth released the song &quot;1692 (Glencoe Massacre)&quot; on their album, &quot;Exercises&quot;.

In the eleventh episode of Mad Men&#x27;s seventh season, Pete Campbell&#x27;s daughter is refused admission into Greenwich Country Day School directly by the headmaster, a MacDonald, over Clan Campbell&#x27;s role in the massacre.

The event is the name sake to the traditional Piobaireachd &quot;Massacre of Glencoe&quot;. The original author is unknown, however numerous settings exist, the most common source being Donald MacDonald&#x27;s.

==Recent archaeological work==
After the Massacre, the Glencoe MacDonalds rebuilt their homes; a military survey undertaken between 1747 and 1755 shows seven separate settlements along the glen, each containing between six and eleven buildings. In 2018, a team of archaeologists organised by the National Trust for Scotland began surveying several areas related to the massacre, with plans to produce detailed studies of their findings. 

Work in the summer of 2019 focused on the settlement of Achadh Triachatain, or Achtriachtan, at the extreme end of the glen; home to an estimated 50 people, excavations show it was rebuilt after 1692 and still occupied in the mid-18th century. A hoard of coins was found in a house linked to MacIain in August 2023, which archaeologists believe may have been hidden there by a victim of the Massacre.

In 2021, a full-size reconstruction of one of the buildings excavated at Achtriachtan was created using traditional techniques and materials at the National Trust for Scotland Visitor Centre.

<doc id="167852" wikidata="Q1464634" url="?curid=167852" title="GNU TeXmacs">
<text>GNU TeXmacs is a scientific word processor and typesetting component of the GNU Project. It originated as a variant of GNU Emacs with TeX functionalities, though it shares no code with those programs, while using TeX fonts. It is written and maintained by Joris van der Hoeven and a group of developers. The program produces structured documents with a WYSIWYG user interface. New document styles can be created by the user. The editor provides high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX and other fonts for publishing professional looking documents.

== Background ==
As a structured WYSIWYG editor and document preparation system, TeXmacs is similar to earlier structured document editors, such as Interleaf (first release 1985), Framemaker (1986), SoftQuad Author/Editor (1988), Lilac, (1991), and Thot; there was also academic research into interactive editing of complex typographical constructs represented logically.

In the 2000s and 2010s, interest on interactive editing of structured text encouraged the development of programs intended for scholars in the humanities; an example of this is CWRC-Writer, a visual XML editor with &quot;Close-to-WYSIWYG editing and enrichment of scholarly texts with meaningful visual representations of markup&quot;.

On another side of the editing and document preparation world, a program for visual interaction with structured texts written in LaTeX is LyX, which does not aim at WYSIWYG editing but at visual representation of the structure (WYSIWYM).

==Features==

Like in many WYSIWYG editors (such as Microsoft Word), authors manipulate a document on screen which should print to a similar-looking paper copy. The goal of TeXmacs is to provide a WYSIWYG editor that nevertheless makes it possible to write correctly structured documents with aesthetically pleasing typesetting results. Despite its name, TeXmacs is not a front-end to TeX or LaTeX. However, TeXmacs documents can be converted to either TeX or LaTeX. LaTeX also can be imported (to some extent), and both import from and export to HTML, Scheme, Verbatim, and XML is provided; the HTML export is stylable with CSS (since version 1.99.14). There is a converter for MathML as well, and TeXmacs can output PDF and PostScript for printing.

TeXmacs can handle mathematical formulas, tables, images, cross-references and citations. It can be used as a front-end to a number of computer algebra systems such as Maxima, FriCAS and SageMath, and can in turn integrate some of their output into its typesetting. TeXmacs also supports a Scheme extension language called Guile for customizing the program and writing extensions.

It also features a presentation mode and a small technical drawing editor and there are plans to evolve towards a complete scientific office suite with spreadsheet capabilities. An implementation of spreadsheets is present starting from version 1.99.12; spreadsheets in TeXmacs can take advantage of plugins (for example Python or Maxima) to compute cell values.

TeXmacs currently runs on most Unix-based architectures including Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin, Haiku and macOS. Along with the Cygwin version, a native port is available for Microsoft Windows.

=== The TeXmacs editor ===
In the TeXmacs editor structure and appearance of the document are represented at the same time; the structure is made evident to the user by surrounding logical units of the document in nested focus frames carrying color cues that are displayed according to the movement of the cursor. A detailed description of the structure in the proximity of the cursor is provided in the footer of the editor window, finely selectable with left-right arrow presses. In the editor it is possible to switch between text mode and source mode editing, and support for the composition of macros is present; the source editor is syntax-aware.

=== Mathematical typography ===
TeXmacs facilitates the inputting of mathematical formulas by mapping sequences of keyboard presses to symbols. For example, the symbol formula_1 can be input by typing .

Some symbols have no such representation (formula_2 for instance). These can be input with key (e.g. for formula_2 the key presses are . This keyboard-based entry differs from other formulae editors, that tend to provide point-and-click menus for this task.

=== Batch processing ===
It is possible to use TeXmacs as a batch processor (which is LaTeX&#x27;s usual operation mode), using X virtual framebuffer to avoid opening unwanted windows while processing. For example, the command

generates a PDF file &quot;article.pdf&quot; from a TeXmacs document &quot;article.tm&quot;.

==The TeXmacs format==

All TeXmacs documents or document fragments can be thought of as trees (the concept of tree exists as well in the SGML markup language, to which the Texmacs format is similar). For instance, the tree

represents the formula

:formula_4

(written here with the TeX markup used by Wikipedia) and is turned by TeXmacs&#x27; own typesetting engine into a typeset formula, here inserted as an image:

TeXmacs trees are represented in TeXmacs files as strings, and in the TeXmacs editor as the typeset representation of the document together with its interactive behaviour. In the on-screen representation of the TeXmacs tree, the cursor movement represents the movement inside the tree. On disk, three representations of the TeXmacs format exist: a native representation, an XML representation and a representation with Scheme S-expressions; the Scheme representation is useful for the interfacing with Scheme programs.

== Typesetting and document control ==
The typesetting process converts TeXmacs trees into boxes. Evaluation of TeXmacs trees proceeds by reduction of the primitives, that is by evaluation of macro applications. The typesetting primitives are designed to be very fast and are built-in into the editor; the rendering of many of the primitives can be customized through the built-in environment variables; the stylesheet language allows users to write new primitives as macros on top of the built-in primitives.

TeXmacs uses a global algorithm for &quot;line-breaking&quot; (similar to the TeX one) and in addition uses a global algorithm for &quot;page-breaking&quot;; the page-breaking algorithm takes into account floating objects (figures, table, footnotes) and multi-column content.

=== Document control ===
Documents can be controlled through a native macro system and through Guile-Scheme. It is possible to customize the editor&#x27;s menus and keybindings and to act programmatically on the document tree.

==== TeXmacs macros ====
TeXmacs macros provide a means of structured input (as in TeX/LaTeX) and they are immediately typeset, at the same time maintaining editable input fields. They are written in source code, although the WYSIWYG editor can aid in their composition through the translation of visual structures into their syntax.

==== Document control through Scheme ====
Scheme is embedded in TeXmacs through GNU Guile; the editor itself can be controlled in this way: menus and keybindings can be customized. Scheme commands can be invoked interactively inside TeXmacs documents, can be invoked from the command line and from inside TeXmacs macros. TeXmacs trees can be passed to Scheme in different forms: as &quot;passive trees&quot; (convenient to manipulate content directly using standard Scheme routines on lists), as &quot;active trees&quot; (keep track of the position of the tree inside the global document tree and can be used to programmatically modify documents), and in a &quot;hybrid&quot; representation.

==== Graphics ====
Graphics objects are also part of the TeXmacs format and can be manipulated programmatically from Scheme. An example of TeXmacs graphics generated in a TeXmacs Scheme session is shown below together with the session which generated the image. Images generated programmatically in a Scheme session can also be edited using the internal drawing editor, as they are inserted in the document as a tree; Scheme scripts can also be executed through the codice_1 TeXmacs macro—in this case only the typeset material is available in the document and no direct editing is possible (the modifications must be made within the Scheme code).
Scheme] (define pi (acos -1))
;; A function to define a point in the TeXmacs graphics format using two coordinates
Scheme] (define (pt x y)
 ‘(point ,(number-&gt;string x) ,(number-&gt;string y)))
;; Set points
Scheme] (define xC (- (* 2 (cos (/ pi 3)))))
Scheme] (define yC (* 2 (sin (/ pi 3))))
Scheme] (define pA (pt -2 0))
Scheme] (define pB (pt 2 0))
Scheme] (define pC (pt xC yC))
Scheme] (define tA (pt -2.3 -0.5))
Scheme] (define tB (pt 2.1 -0.5))
Scheme] (define tC (pt (- xC 0.2) (+ yC 0.2)))
;; Generate graphics
Scheme] (stree-&gt;tree
 ‘(with &quot;gr-geometry&quot; (tuple &quot;geometry&quot; &quot;400px&quot; &quot;300px&quot; &quot;center&quot;)
 (graphics
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;blue&quot; (text-at (TeXmacs) ,(pt -0.55 -0.75)))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;black&quot; (arc ,pA ,pC ,pB))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;black&quot; (line ,pA ,pB))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;red&quot; (cline ,pA ,pB ,pC))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;black&quot; (text-at &quot;A&quot; ,tA))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;black&quot; (text-at &quot;B&quot; ,tB))
 (with &quot;color&quot; &quot;black&quot; (text-at &quot;C&quot; ,tC)))))

==Supported back ends==

TeXmacs has back-ends supporting many technologies.

* Programming languages: CLISP, CMUCL, Python, QCL, R, Shell
* Computer algebra systems: Axiom, Giac, Macaulay 2, Mathematica, Maxima, MuPAD, PARI/GP, Reduce, SageMath, Yacas
* Numeric matrix systems: GNU Octave, Matlab, Scilab
* Plotting packages: gnuplot, Graphviz, XYpic, Mathemagix
* Other: DraTeX, Eukleides, GTybalt, Lush, Juris-M, and Zotero

=== Embedding editable plugin output ===
Plugin output can be embedded within TeXmacs documents using &quot;executable switches&quot;; in this way one can switch back and forth between a given input to the system and the corresponding output, which blends seamlessly in the document.

<doc id="167853" wikidata="Q182873" url="?curid=167853" title="Corinth Canal">
<text>The Corinth Canal () is an artificial canal in Greece that connects the Gulf of Corinth in the Ionian Sea with the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean Sea. It cuts through the narrow Isthmus of Corinth and &quot;separates&quot; the Peloponnese peninsula from the rest of the Greek mainland. The canal was dug through the Isthmus at sea level and has no locks. It is in length and only 24.6 metres (80.7 feet) wide at sea level, making it impassable for many modern ships. It is currently of little economic importance and is mainly a tourist attraction.

The Corinth canal concept originated with Periander of Corinth in the 7th century BC. Daunted by its enormity, he chose to implement the &quot;Diolkos&quot;, a land trackway for transporting ships, instead. Construction of a canal finally began under Roman Emperor Nero in 67 AD, using Jewish prisoners captured during the First Jewish–Roman War. However, the project ceased shortly after his death. In subsequent centuries, the idea intrigued figures like Herodes Atticus in the second century and, following their conquest of the Peloponnese in 1687, the Venetians. Despite their interest, neither of them undertook the construction.

Construction finally recommenced in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but, due to the canal&#x27;s narrowness, navigational problems, and periodic closures to repair landslides from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic expected by its operators.

==History==
===Ancient attempts===
Several rulers of antiquity dreamed of digging a cutting through the isthmus. The first to propose such an undertaking was the tyrant Periander in the 7th century BC. The project was abandoned and Periander instead constructed a simpler and less costly overland portage road, named the &quot;Diolkos&quot; or stone carriageway, along which ships could be towed from one side of the isthmus to the other. Periander&#x27;s change of heart is attributed variously to the great expense of the project, a lack of labour or a fear that a canal would have robbed Corinth of its dominant role as an entrepôt for goods. Remnants of the &quot;Diolkos&quot; still exist next to the modern canal.

The Diadoch Demetrius Poliorcetes (336–283 BC) planned to construct a canal as a means to improve his communication lines, but dropped the plan after his surveyors, miscalculating the levels of the adjacent seas, feared heavy floods.

The philosopher Apollonius of Tyana prophesied that anyone who proposed to dig a Corinthian canal would be met with illness. Three Roman rulers considered the idea but all suffered violent deaths; the historians Plutarch and Suetonius both wrote that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar considered digging a canal through the isthmus but was assassinated before he could begin the project. Caligula, the third Roman Emperor, commissioned a study in 40 AD from Egyptian experts who claimed incorrectly that the Corinthian Gulf was higher than the Saronic Gulf. As a result, they concluded, if a canal were dug the island of Aegina would be inundated. Caligula&#x27;s interest in the idea got no further as he too was assassinated before making any progress.
The emperor Nero was the first to attempt to construct the canal, personally breaking the ground with a pickaxe and removing the first basket-load of soil in 67 AD, but the project was abandoned when he died shortly afterwards. The Roman workforce, consisting of 6,000 Judean prisoners of war, started digging trenches from both sides, while a third group at the ridge drilled deep shafts for probing the quality of the rock (which were reused in 1881 for the same purpose). According to Suetonius, the canal was dug to a distance of four stades – approximately – or about a tenth of the total distance across the isthmus. A memorial of the attempt in the form of a relief of Hercules was left by Nero&#x27;s workers and can still be seen in the canal cutting today. Other than this, as the modern canal follows the same course as Nero&#x27;s, no remains have survived.

The Greek philosopher and Roman senator Herodes Atticus is known to have considered digging a canal in the 2nd century AD, but did not get a project under way. The Venetians also considered it in 1687 after their conquest of the Peloponnese but likewise did not initiate any work on the ground.

===Construction of the modern canal===
The idea of a canal was revived after Greece gained formal independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. The Greek statesman Ioannis Kapodistrias asked a French engineer to assess the feasibility of the project but had to abandon it when its cost was assessed at 40 million gold francs—far too expensive for the newly independent country. Fresh impetus was given by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and, the following year, the government of Prime Minister Thrasyvoulos Zaimis passed a law authorizing the construction of a Corinth canal. French entrepreneurs were put in charge but, following the bankruptcy of the French company that had attempted to dig the Panama Canal, French banks refused to lend money, and the company went bankrupt as well. A fresh concession was granted to the &quot;Société Internationale du Canal Maritime de Corinthe&quot; in 1881, which was commissioned to construct the canal and operate it for the next 99 years. Construction was formally inaugurated on 23 April 1882 in the presence of King George I of Greece.
The company&#x27;s initial capital was 30,000,000 francs (US$6.0 million in the money of the day), but after eight years of work, it ran out of money, and a bid to issue 60,000 bonds of 500 francs each flopped when less than half of the bonds were sold. The company&#x27;s head, István Türr, went bankrupt, as did the company itself and a bank that had agreed to raise additional funds for the project. Construction resumed in 1890, when the project was transferred to a Greek company, and was completed on 25 July 1893 after eleven years&#x27; work.

=== After completion ===
The canal experienced financial and operational difficulties after completion. The narrowness of the canal makes navigation difficult. Its high walls funnel wind along its length, and the different times of the tides in the two gulfs cause strong tidal currents in the channel. For these reasons, many ship operators were unwilling to use the canal, and traffic was far below predictions. Annual traffic of just under 4 million net tons had been anticipated, but by 1906 traffic had reached only half a million net tons annually. By 1913, the total had risen to 1.5 million net tons, but the disruption caused by World War I resulted in a major decline in traffic.
Another persistent problem was the heavily faulted nature of the sedimentary rock, in an active seismic zone, through which the canal is cut. The canal&#x27;s high limestone walls have been persistently unstable from the start. Although it was formally opened in July 1893 it was not opened to navigation until the following November, due to landslides. It was soon found that the wake from ships passing through the canal undermined the walls, causing further landslides. This required further expense in building retaining walls along the water&#x27;s edge for more than half of the length of the canal, using 165,000 cubic metres of masonry. Between 1893 and 1940, it was closed for a total of four years for maintenance to stabilise the walls. In 1923 alone, 41,000 cubic metres of material fell into the canal, which took two years to clear out.

Serious damage was caused to the canal during World War II. On 26 April 1941, during the Battle of Greece between defending Allied troops and the invading forces of Nazi Germany, German parachutists and glider troops attempted to capture the main bridge over the canal. The bridge was defended by British and Anzac forces and had been wired for demolition. The Germans surprised the defenders with a glider-borne assault in the early morning of 26 April and captured the bridge, but the British set off the charges and destroyed the structure. Other authors maintain that German pioneers cut the detonation wires, and a lucky hit by British artillery triggered the explosion, or that they were set off by a rifle shot from one of the British sappers. The bridge was replaced by a combined rail/road bridge built in 25 days by the IV Ferrovieri Battalion of the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s Ferrovieri Engineer Regiment. Following the Axis occupation of Greece the Allies made several attempts to block the canal but without success. 

In October 1944, as German forces retreated from Greece, the canal was put out of action by German &quot;scorched earth&quot; operations. German forces used explosives to trigger landslides to block the canal, destroyed the bridges and dumped locomotives, bridge wreckage and other infrastructure into the canal to hinder repairs. The United States Army Corps of Engineers began to clear the canal in November 1947 and reopened it for shallow-draft traffic by 7 July 1948, and for all traffic by that September.

===Modern use===
Because the canal is difficult to navigate for large vessels, it is mostly used by smaller recreational boats. A notable exception occurred on 9 October 2019, when the cruise ship MS &quot;Braemar&quot; became the widest and longest ship to transit the canal.
The canal closed at the beginning of 2021 after a landslide. It re-opened in June 2022 until October 2022. After further safety measures, the canal reopened on June 1, 2023.

==Layout==
The canal consists of a single channel deep, excavated at sea level (thus requiring no locks), measuring long by wide at sea level and wide at the bottom. The rock walls, which rise above sea level, are at a near-vertical 80° angle. The canal is crossed by a railway line, a road and a motorway at a height of about . In 1988, submersible bridges were installed at sea level at each end of the canal, by the eastern harbour of Isthmia and the western harbour of Poseidonia, providing two additional crossings for road traffic.

Although the canal saves the journey around the Peloponnese, it is too narrow for modern ocean freighters, as it can accommodate ships only of a width up to and draft up to . In October 2019, with over 900 passengers on board, a wide and long Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines cruise ship successfully traversed the canal to set a new record for longest ship to pass through the canal. Ships can pass through the canal only one convoy at a time on a one-way system. Larger ships have to be towed by tugs. The canal is currently used mainly by tourist ships; around 11,000 ships per year travel through the waterway.

<doc id="167854" wikidata="Q653953" url="?curid=167854" title="Microcredit">
<text>Microcredit is the extension of very small loans (microloans) to impoverished borrowers who typically lack collateral, steady employment, and a verifiable credit history. It is designed to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. Many recipients are illiterate, and therefore unable to complete paperwork required to get conventional loans. As of 2009 an estimated 74 million people held microloans that totaled nearly US$40 billion. Grameen Bank reports that repayment success rates are between 95 and 98 percent.
The first economist who had invented the idea of microloans was Jonathan Swift in the 1720s. Microcredit is part of microfinance, which provides a wider range of financial services, especially savings accounts, to the poor. Modern microcredit is generally considered to have originated with the Grameen Bank founded in Bangladesh in 1983 by their current Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. Many traditional banks subsequently introduced microcredit despite initial misgivings. The United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit. As of 2012, microcredit is widely used in developing countries and is presented as having &quot;enormous potential as a tool for poverty alleviation.&quot; 

Some argue that microcredit has not had a positive impact on gender relationships, does not alleviate poverty, has led many borrowers into a debt trap and constitutes a &quot;privatization of welfare&quot;.
The first randomized evaluation of microcredit, conducted by Mr. Abhijit Banerjee and others, showed mixed results: there was no effect on household expenditure, gender equity, education or health, but the number of new businesses increased by one third compared to a control group. Some of this increase in the number of businesses can be due to &#x27;informal intermediation&#x27; documented by Frithjof Arp and collaborators: Philanthropic, low-interest-rate microcredit fosters unintended entrepreneurship where some borrowers split loans they receive and on-lend to less-entrepreneurial borrowers.

==History==
Ideas relating to microcredit can be found at various times in modern history. Jonathan Swift inspired the Irish Loan Funds of the 18th and 19th centuries. John Wesley began a microcredit scheme in 1746. His journal on 17/1/1748 records:I made a public collection toward a lending stock for the poor. Our rule is, to lend only twenty shillings at once, which is repaid weekly within three months. I began this about a year and a half ago: thirty pounds sixteen shillings were then collected; and out of this, no less than two hundred and fifty-five persons have been relieved in eighteen months.In the mid-19th century, Individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner wrote about the benefits of numerous small loans for entrepreneurial activities to the poor as a way to alleviate poverty. At about the same time, but independently to Spooner, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural Germany.

===Comilla model===
In the 1950s, Akhtar Hameed Khan began distributing group-oriented credit in East Pakistan. Khan used the Comilla Model, in which credit is distributed through community-based initiatives. The project failed due to the over-involvement of the Pakistani government, and the hierarchies created within communities as certain members began to exert more control over loans than others.

===Modern microcredit===

The origins of microcredit in its current practical incarnation can be linked to several organizations founded in Bangladesh, especially the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank, which is generally considered the first modern microcredit institution, was founded in 1983 by Muhammad Yunus. Yunus began the project in a small town called Jobra, using his own money to deliver small loans at low-interest rates to the rural poor. Grameen Bank was followed by organizations such as BRAC in 1972 and ASA in 1978. Microcredit reached Latin America with the establishment in Bolivia in 1986 of PRODEM, a bank that later transformed into the for-profit BancoSol. In Chile, BancoEstado Microempresas is the primary microcredit institution. Microcredit quickly became a popular tool for economic development, with hundreds of institutions emerging throughout the third world. Though the Grameen Bank was formed initially as a non-profit organization dependent upon government subsidies, it later became a corporate entity and was renamed Grameen II in 2002. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his work providing microcredit services to the poor.

==Principles==

===Economic principles===
Microcredit organizations were initially created as alternatives to the &quot;loan sharks&quot; known to take advantage of clients. Indeed, many microlenders began as non-profit organizations and operated with government funds or private subsidies. By the 1980s, however, the &quot;financial systems approach&quot;, influenced by neoliberalism and propagated by the Harvard Institute for International Development, became the dominant ideology among microcredit organizations. The neoliberal model of microcredit can also be referred to as the institutionist model, which promotes applying market solutions as a viable way to address social problems. The commercialization of microcredit officially began in 1984 with the formation of Unit Desa (BRI-UD) within the Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Unit Desa offered &#x27;kupedes&#x27; microloans based on market interest rates.

Yunus has sharply criticized the shift in microcredit organizations from the Grameen Bank model as a non-profit bank to for-profit institutions:I never dreamed that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks ... There are always people eager to take advantage of the vulnerable. But credit programs that seek to profit from the suffering of the poor should not be described as &quot;microcredit,&quot; and investors who own such programs should not be allowed to benefit from the trust and respect that microcredit banks have rightly earned.Many microcredit organizations now function as independent banks. This has led to their charging higher interest rates on loans and placing more emphasis on savings programs. Notably, Unit Desa has charged in excess of 20 percent on small business loans. The application of neoliberal economics to microcredit has generated much debate among scholars and development practitioners, with some claiming that microcredit bank directors, such as Muhammad Yunus, apply the practices of loan sharks for their personal enrichment. Indeed, the academic debate foreshadowed a Wall-street style scandal involving the Mexican microcredit organization Compartamos.

Even so, the numbers indicate that ethical microlending and investor profit can go hand-in-hand. In the 1990s a rural finance minister in Indonesia showed how Unit Desa could lower its rates by about 8% while still bringing attractive returns to investors.

===Group lending===

Though lending to groups has long been a key part of microcredit, microcredit initially began with the principle of lending to individuals. Despite the use of solidarity circles in 1970s Jobra, Grameen Bank and other early microcredit institutions initially focused on individual lending. (A solidarity circle is a group of borrowers that provide mutual encouragement, information, and assistance in times of need, though loans remain the responsibility of individuals.)
Indeed, Muhammad Yunus propagated the notion that every person has the potential to become an entrepreneur. Yunus saw poverty eradication as being in the hands of the individual. Because of this, he promoted private ownership, and consequently, neoliberalism. The use of group-lending was motivated by economics of scale, as the costs associated with monitoring loans and enforcing repayment are significantly lower when credit is distributed to groups rather than individuals. Many times the loan to one participant in group-lending depends upon the successful repayment from another member, thus transferring repayment responsibility off of microcredit institutions to loan recipients.

===Lending to women===
Microcredit is a tool that can possibly be helpful to reduce the feminization of poverty in developing countries. Lending to women has become an important principle in microcredit, with banks and NGOs such as BancoSol, WWB, and Pro Mujer catering to women exclusively. Pro Mujer also implemented a new strategy to combine microcredits with health-care services, since the health of their clients is crucial to the success of microcredits. Though Grameen Bank initially tried to lend to both men and women at equal rates, women presently make up ninety-five percent of the bank&#x27;s clients. Women continue to make up seventy-five percent of all microcredit recipients worldwide. Exclusive lending to women began in the 1980s when Grameen Bank found that women have higher repayment rates, and tend to accept smaller loans than men. 

==Examples==

===Bangladesh===
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh is the oldest and probably best-known microfinance institution in the world. Grameen Bank launched their US operations in New York in April 2008. Bank of America has announced plans to award more than $3.7 million in grants to nonprofits to use in backing microloan programs. The Accion U.S. Network, the US subsidiary of the better-known Accion International, has provided over $450 million in microloans since 1991, with an over 90% repayment rate. One research study of the Grameen model shows that poorer individuals are safer borrowers because they place more value on the relationship with the bank. Even so, efforts to replicate Grameen-style solidarity lending in developed countries have generally not succeeded. For example, the Calmeadow Foundation tested an analogous peer-lending model in three locations in Canada during the 1990s. It concluded that a variety of factors—including difficulties in reaching the target market, the high risk profile of clients, their general distaste for the joint liability requirement, and high overhead costs—made solidarity lending unviable without subsidies. Microcredits have also been introduced in Israel, Russia, Ukraine and other nations where micro-loans help small business entrepreneurs overcome cultural barriers in the mainstream business society. The Israel Free Loan Association (IFLA) has lent more than $100 million in the past two decades to Israeli citizens of all backgrounds.

=== India ===
In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) finances more than 500 banks that on-lend funds to self-help groups (SHGs). SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom the majority are women from the poorest castes and tribes. Members save small amounts of money, as little as a few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund. In Asia borrowers generally pay interest rates that range from 30% to 70% without commission and fees. Nearly 1.4 million SHGs comprising approximately 20 million women now borrow from banks, which makes the Indian SHG-Bank Linkage model the largest microfinance program in the world. Similar programs are evolving in Africa and Southeast Asia with the assistance of organizations like IFAD, Opportunity International, Catholic Relief Services, Compassion International, CARE, APMAS, Oxfam, Tearfund and World Vision.

=== United States ===
In the United States, microcredit has generally been defined as loans of less than $50,000 to people—mostly entrepreneurs—who cannot, for various reasons, borrow from a bank. Most nonprofit microlenders include services like financial literacy training and business plan consultations, which contribute to the expense of providing such loans but also, those groups say, to the success of their borrowers. One such organization in the United States, the Accion U.S. Network is a nonprofit microfinance organization headquartered in New York, New York. It is the largest and only nationwide nonprofit microfinance network in the US. The Accion U.S. Network is part of Accion International, a US-based nonprofit organization operating globally, with the mission of giving people the financial tools they need to create or grow healthy businesses. The domestic Accion programs started in Brooklyn, New York, and grew from there to become the first nationwide network microlender. US microcredit programs have helped many poor but ambitious borrowers to improve their lot. The Aspen Institute&#x27;s study of 405 microentrepreneurs indicates that more than half of the loan recipients escaped poverty within five years. On average, their household assets grew by nearly $16,000 during that period; the group&#x27;s reliance on public assistance dropped by more than 60%. Several corporate sponsors including Citi Foundation and Capital One launched Grameen America in New York. Since then the financial outfit—not bank—has been serving the poor, mainly women, throughout four of the city&#x27;s five boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens) as well as Omaha, Nebraska and Indianapolis, Indiana. In four years, Grameen America has facilitated loans to over 9,000 borrowers valued over $35 million. It has had, as Grameen CEO Stephen Vogel notes, &quot;a 99 percent repayment rate&quot;.

===Peer-to-peer lending over the Web===
The principles of microcredit have also been applied in attempting to address several non-poverty-related issues. Among these, multiple Internet-based organizations have developed platforms that facilitate a modified form of peer-to-peer lending where a loan is not made in the form of a single, direct loan, but as the aggregation of a number of smaller loans—often at a negligible interest rate.

Examples of platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs via Internet are Kiva, Zidisha, and the Microloan Foundation. Another internet-based microlender, United Prosperity (now defunct), uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries. From 2008 through 2014, Vittana allowed peer-to-peer lending for student loans in developing countries.

==Impact of microcredit==

The impact of microcredit is a subject of some controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers&#x27; children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US, UK and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.

Critics say that microcredit, if not carefully directed, may not increase incomes, and may drive poor households into a debt trap. They add that the money from loans may be used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it may fail to empower women, and that it may not improve health or education.

The available evidence indicates that in many cases microcredit has facilitated the creation and the growth of businesses. It has often generated self-employment, but it has not necessarily increased incomes after interest payments. In some cases it has driven borrowers into debt traps. Some studies suggest that microcredit has not generally empowered women. Microcredit has achieved much less than what its proponents said it would achieve, but its negative impacts have not been as drastic as some critics have argued. Microcredit is just one factor influencing the success of a small businesses, whose success is influenced to a much larger extent by how much an economy or a particular market grows.

Unintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediation: some entrepreneurial borrowers may become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance may split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to loan sharks at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.

==Improvement==

Many scholars and practitioners suggest an integrated package of services (&quot;a credit-plus&quot; approach) rather than just providing credits. When access to credit is combined with savings facilities, non-productive loan facilities, insurance, enterprise development (production-oriented and management training, marketing support) and welfare-related services (literacy and health services, gender and social awareness training), the adverse effects discussed above can be diminished. Some argue that more experienced entrepreneurs who are getting loans should be qualified for bigger loans to ensure the success of the program.

One of the principal challenges of microcredit is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets. The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital. Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform Kiva charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%. Rather, the principal reason for the high cost of microcredit loans is the high transaction cost of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size. Microcredit practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable. The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world&#x27;s poorest people pay the world&#x27;s highest cost for small business growth capital. The high costs of traditional microcredit loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Borrowers who do not manage to earn a rate of return at least equal to the interest rate may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans. According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans. In recent years, microcredit providers have shifted their focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Analyst David Roodman contends that in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.

Professor Dean Karlan from Yale University advocates also giving the poor access to savings accounts.

<text>The Usual Suspects is a 1995 American crime thriller film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite and Kevin Spacey.

The plot follows the interrogation of Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint, a small-time con man, who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. Through flashback and narration, Kint tells an interrogator a convoluted story of events that led him and his criminal companions to the boat, and of a mysterious crime lord—known as Keyser Söze—who controlled them. The film was shot on a $6 million budget and began as a title taken from a column in &quot;Spy&quot; magazine called &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, after one of Claude Rains&#x27; most memorable lines in the classic film &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and Singer thought that it would make a good title for a film.

The film was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and then initially released in a few theaters. It received favorable reviews and was eventually given a wider release. The praise went towards the mystery elements, the screenplay, the plot twist and Spacey&#x27;s performance. McQuarrie won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film as having the 35th-greatest screenplay of all time.

== Plot ==
While lying badly wounded on a ship docked in San Pedro Bay, career criminal Dean Keaton is approached by a shadowy figure whom he calls &quot;Keyser,&quot; who shoots him dead and sets fire to the ship. The next day, the police recover 27 bodies and only two survivors: Arkosh Kovash (&quot;Ákos Kovács&quot;), a Hungarian mobster hospitalized with severe burns; and Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint, a physically disabled con artist. U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan flies to Los Angeles from New York City to interrogate Verbal. The men are left alone in a borrowed office belonging to LAPD police sergeant Jeff Rabin while FBI agent Jack Baer visits a hospitalized Kovács. In an extended flashback, Verbal relates the events that led him, Keaton and their associates onto the ship.

Six weeks earlier in New York City, Keaton and Verbal are arrested alongside fellow criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockney and placed in a police lineup as suspects in a truck hijacking that none of them admits to participating in. As the five bond in the police station&#x27;s holding cell, McManus proposes that they pull a heist to get revenge on the NYPD. Trying to go straight, Keaton initially refuses but eventually agrees to help rob a jewel smuggler being escorted by corrupt cops, netting millions in emeralds, and getting over fifty cops arrested after leaking their activities to the press. They then go to California to fence the jewels through a man named Redfoot, who connects them with another jewel heist. The heist goes badly, and they&#x27;re forced to kill their target, who is revealed to be carrying synthetic heroin. 

Shortly after, the men learn that the job was arranged by a lawyer named Kobayashi, who claims to be a representative of Keyser Söze—a mysterious Turkish crime lord who passed into legend after killing his own family while they were held hostage by his Hungarian rivals. Having vanished after killing his family and massacring his rivals, Söze supposedly only conducts business from the shadows via his underlings, most of whom are unaware that they work for him. To most of the criminal underworld, he is a fearsome urban legend, with most unsure whether he truly exists.

Kobayashi tells the men that Söze arranged for their arrests in New York after they attracted his attention by unwittingly stealing from him, but he is willing to spare their lives in exchange for them destroying a shipment of $91 million worth of cocaine being brought to San Pedro Bay by Argentinian drug dealers to be sold to a Hungarian gang. Though initially reluctant to take the job, they relent after Fenster is killed while attempting to flee, and after Kobayashi threatens their loved ones when they attempt to ambush him in his office.

During Kujan&#x27;s interrogation, he learns that there was no cocaine on the ship, and Söze was seen on board. At the hospital, Baer learns that Kovács has seen Söze, and has a sketch artist begin drawing a picture of him. At the conclusion of Verbal&#x27;s flashback, he and his companions attack the ship and kill numerous Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters before discovering that there is no cocaine onboard. An unseen assailant kills Hockney, McManus, Keaton and a prisoner in one of the ship&#x27;s cabins. The mysterious figure then sets fire to the ship as Verbal looks on from a hiding place on the dock.

Kujan learns that the prisoner killed on the ship was Arturo Marquez, a smuggler who escaped prosecution by claiming that he could identify Söze. Rather than dealing cocaine, the Argentinians were actually planning to sell Marquez—the only man who could identify Söze—to his rivals. He also learns that Marquez was represented by lawyer Edie Finneran, Keaton&#x27;s girlfriend, who was recently murdered. Armed with this information, Kujan deduces that Keaton was actually Keyser Söze: he organized the assault on the boat as a pretext for assassinating Marquez and faking his death. Verbal finally confesses that Keaton was behind everything, but refuses to testify in court. Verbal&#x27;s bail is posted, and he is released.

Moments later, Kujan realizes that Verbal fabricated his entire story, improvising on the spot by piecing together details from random items in Rabin&#x27;s cluttered office. Verbal walks outside, gradually losing his limp and flexing his supposedly disabled hand. As Kujan pursues Verbal, a fax arrives at the police station with the sketch artist&#x27;s facial composite of Söze, which resembles Verbal. Moments before Kujan arrives on the scene, Verbal enters a car driven by &quot;Kobayashi&quot; and leaves.

==Cast==
* Kevin Spacey as Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint:Singer and McQuarrie sent the screenplay for the film to Spacey without telling him which role was written for him. Spacey called Singer and told them that he was interested in the roles of Keaton and Kujan but was also intrigued by Kint who, as it turned out, was the role McQuarrie wrote with Spacey in mind.
* Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton:Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a party and asked him to do the film. He read the screenplay and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter&#x27;s vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where Byrne lived, and make it in five weeks.
* Chazz Palminteri as Agent Dave Kujan:Singer had always wanted Palminteri for the film, but he was always unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in &quot;Heat&quot;. Pacino would later say it was the one film he has most regretted turning down. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film&#x27;s financial backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent releases of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; and &quot;Bullets Over Broadway.&quot;
* Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus:Baldwin was tired of doing independent films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him what it was like to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed Baldwin.
* Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster:Spacey suggested del Toro for the role. The character was originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film&#x27;s casting director and told them that he did not want to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character&#x27;s only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze&#x27;s power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster&#x27;s unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.
* Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney:He met with Singer about doing the film, but when he heard that two other actors were auditioning for the role, he came back, auditioned, and got the part.
* Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi
* Suzy Amis as Edie Finneran, Keaton&#x27;s attorney and girlfriend
* Giancarlo Esposito as FBI Agent Jack Baer
* Dan Hedaya as Sergeant Jeff Rabin
* Cástulo Guerra as Arturo Marquez
* Morgan Hunter as Ákos Kovács
* Peter Greene as Redfoot (uncredited)
* Scott B. Morgan as Keyser Söze (in flashbacks) (uncredited)

== Production ==
=== Origins ===
Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey at a party after a screening of Singer&#x27;s first film, &quot;Public Access&quot;, at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. Spacey had been encouraged by a number of people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and his screenwriting partner Christopher McQuarrie, that he wanted to be in whatever film they did next. Singer read a column in &quot;Spy&quot; magazine called &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; after Claude Rains&#x27; line in &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, &quot;I guess it&#x27;s about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up,&quot; which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: &quot;five guys who meet in a line-up,&quot; Singer remembers. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, &quot;All of you can go to Hell.&quot; Singer then asked the question, &quot;What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?&quot; McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and disappears. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.

Söze&#x27;s character is based on John List, a New Jersey accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost two decades, assuming a new identity before he was ultimately apprehended. McQuarrie based the name of Keyser Söze on one of his previous supervisors, Kayser Sume, at a Los Angeles law firm where he worked, but decided to change the last name because he thought that his former boss would object to how it was used. He found the word &quot;söze&quot; in his roommate&#x27;s English-to-Turkish dictionary, which translates as &quot;talk too much&quot;. All the characters&#x27; names are taken from staff members of the law firm at the time of his employment. McQuarrie had also worked for a detective agency, and this influenced the depiction of criminals and law enforcement officials in the script.

Singer described the film as &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; meets &quot;Rashomon,&quot; and said that it was made &quot;so you can go back and see all sorts of things you didn&#x27;t realize were there the first time. You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around.&quot; He also compared the film&#x27;s structure to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot;.

=== Pre-production ===
McQuarrie wrote nine drafts of his screenplay over five months, until Singer felt that it was ready to shop around to the studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the role of Agent Dave Kujan went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film&#x27;s producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were able to offer the actors only salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie&#x27;s script and the chance to work with one another. That money fell through, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.

About casting, Singer said, &quot;You pick people not for what they are, but what you imagine they can turn into.&quot; To research his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only one side of his body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster&#x27;s distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character&#x27;s unusual speech patterns came from the realization that &quot;the purpose of my character was to die.&quot; Del Toro told Singer, &quot;It really doesn&#x27;t matter what I say, so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible.&quot;

=== Filming ===
The budget was set at $5.5 million, and the film was shot in 35 days in Los Angeles, San Pedro, and New York City. Spacey said that they shot the interrogation scenes with Palminteri over a span of five to six days. These scenes were also shot before the rest of the film. The police lineup scene ran into scheduling conflicts because the actors kept blowing their lines. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would feed the actors questions off-camera and they improvised their lines. When Stephen Baldwin gave his answer, he made the other actors break character. Byrne remembers that they were often laughing between takes and &quot;when they said, &#x27;Action!&#x27;, we&#x27;d barely be able to keep it together.&quot; Spacey also said that the hardest part was not laughing through takes, with Baldwin and Pollak being the worst culprits. Their goal was to get the usually serious Byrne to crack up. They spent all morning trying unsuccessfully to film the scene. At lunch, a frustrated Singer angrily scolded the five actors, but, when they resumed, the cast continued to laugh through each take. Byrne remembers, &quot;Finally, Bryan just used one of the takes where we couldn&#x27;t stay serious.&quot; Singer and editor John Ottman used a combination of takes and kept the humor in to show the characters bonding with one another.

While Del Toro told Singer how he was going to portray Fenster, he did not tell his cast members, and in their first scene together none of them understood what Del Toro was saying. Byrne confronted Singer and the director told him that for the lockup scene, &quot;If you don&#x27;t understand what he&#x27;s saying maybe it&#x27;s time we let the audience know that they don&#x27;t need to know what he&#x27;s saying.&quot; This led to the inclusion of Kevin Pollak&#x27;s improvised line, &quot;What did you say?&quot;

The stolen emeralds were real gemstones on loan for the film.

Singer spent an 18-hour day shooting the underground parking garage robbery. According to Byrne, by the next day Singer still did not have all of the footage that he wanted, and refused to stop filming in spite of the bonding company&#x27;s threat to shut down the production.

In the scene in which the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his cigarette at McManus&#x27; face. The scene was originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus&#x27;s chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin&#x27;s face by accident. Baldwin&#x27;s reaction is genuine.

Despite enclosed practical locations and a short shooting schedule, cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel &quot;developed a way of shooting dialogue scenes with a combination of slow, creeping zooms and dolly moves that ended in tight close-ups,&quot; to add subtle energy to scenes. &quot;This style combined dolly movement with &quot;imperceptible zooms&quot; so that you&#x27;d always have a sense of motion in a limited space.&quot;

In December 2017, amid several sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey, Byrne said that, at one point during shooting, production was shut down for two days because Spacey made unwanted sexual advances toward a younger actor. Singer, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct against minors, has denied that Spacey behaved inappropriately on the set of the film. However, Kevin Pollak, in a 2018 episode of his podcast &quot;Kevin Pollak&#x27;s Chat Show&quot;, told another version of the story involving Spacey engaging in sexual acts with Singer&#x27;s young French boyfriend with only several days left in the production, which disrupted filming and led to a bitter ruination of their relationship.

=== Post-production ===
During the editing phase, Singer thought that they had completed the film two weeks early, but woke up one morning and realized that they needed that time to put together a sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was Söze—and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have &quot;the punch that Chris had written so beautifully.&quot; According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character&#x27;s name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, &quot;Who is Keyser Söze?&quot; posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character&#x27;s name.

Singer wanted the music for the boat heist to resemble Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1. The ending&#x27;s music was based on a k.d. lang song.

== Release ==
Gramercy ran a pre-release promotion and advertising campaign before &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; opened in the summer of 1995. Word of mouth marketing was used to advertise the film, and buses and billboards were plastered with the simple question, &quot;Who is Keyser Söze?&quot;

The film was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and was well received by audiences and critics. The film was then given an exclusive run in Los Angeles, where it took a combined $83,513, and New York City, where it made $132,294 on three screens in its opening weekend. The film was then released in 42 theaters where it earned $645,363 on its opening weekend. It averaged a strong $4,181 per screen at 517 theaters and the following week added 300 locations. It eventually made $23.3 million in the United States and Canada. It grossed $43.6 million internationally for a worldwide total of $66.9 million.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; has received a rating of 87%, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Expertly shot and edited, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; gives the audience a simple plot and then piles on layers of deceit, twists, and violence before pulling out the rug from underneath.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert, in a review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times,&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that it was confusing and uninteresting: &quot;To the degree that I do understand, I don&#x27;t care.&quot; He also included the film in his &quot;most hated films&quot; list. &quot;USA Today&quot; rated the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;one of the most densely plotted mysteries in memory—though paradoxically, four-fifths of it is way too easy to predict.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Spacey, saying his &quot;balls-out brilliant performance is Oscar bait all the way.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson wrote: 

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised the performances of the cast: &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the film&#x27;s ending: &quot;The film&#x27;s coup de grace is as elegant as it is unexpected. The whole movie plays back in your mind in perfect clarity—and turns out to be a completely different movie to the one you&#x27;ve been watching (rather better, in fact).&quot;

=== Accolades ===

At the 68th Academy Awards, Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Christopher McQuarrie won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In his acceptance speech, Spacey said, &quot;Well, whoever Keyser Söze is, I can tell you he&#x27;s gonna get gloriously drunk tonight.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
On June 17, 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; was acknowledged as the tenth-best mystery film. Verbal Kint was voted the #48 villain in &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; in June 2003.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; cited the film as one of the &quot;13 must-see heist movies&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Keyser Söze #69 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll. In August 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; among Kevin Spacey&#x27;s greatest film performances.

In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay #35 on its list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written.

==Remake==
In India, a critically panned Hindi-language adaptation of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, titled &quot;Chocolate&quot;, was released in 2005.
