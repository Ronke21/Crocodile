<text>Safari is a web browser developed by Apple. It is built into several of Apple&#x27;s operating systems, including macOS, iOS, iPadOS and visionOS, and uses Apple&#x27;s open-source browser engine WebKit, which was derived from KHTML.

Safari was introduced in Mac OS X Panther in January 2003. It has been included with the iPhone since the first-generation iPhone in 2007. At that time, Safari was the fastest browser on the Mac. Between 2007 and 2012, Apple maintained a Windows version, but abandoned it due to low market share. In 2010, Safari 5 introduced a reader mode, extensions, and developer tools. Safari 11, released in 2017, added Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which uses artificial intelligence to block web tracking. Safari 13 added support for Apple Pay, and authentication with FIDO2 security keys. Its interface was redesigned in Safari 15.

== History and development ==
=== Background ===
Netscape Navigator rapidly became the dominant Mac browser after its 1994 release, and eventually came bundled with Mac OS. In 1996, Microsoft released Internet Explorer for Mac (IE), and Apple released the Cyberdog internet suite, which included a web browser. In 1997, Apple shelved Cyberdog, and reached a five-year agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on the Mac, starting with Mac OS 8.1. Netscape continued to be preinstalled on all Macintosh systems. Microsoft continued to update IE for Mac, which was ported to Mac OS X DP4 in May 2000.

=== Conception ===
Apple introduced the Safari web, on January 7, 2003. At the time, Steve Jobs called Safari, “a turbo browser for Mac OS X.” Apple created Safari for speed, calling it the fastest browser for the Mac. Jobs compared it to Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Chimera (later renamed Camino), showing that Safari was faster. The second reason that Apple created Safari was to innovate; Apple wanted to make the best browser ever. During development, several codenames were used including &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;iBrowse&quot; and &quot;Alexander&quot; (a reference to conqueror Alexander the Great, an homage to the Konqueror web browser).

=== Safari 1 ===
On January 7, 2003, at Macworld San Francisco, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced Safari that was based on WebKit, the company&#x27;s internal fork of the KHTML browser engine. Apple released the first beta version exclusively on Mac OS X the same day. After that date, several official and unofficial beta versions followed until version 1.0 was released on June 23, 2003. On Mac OS X v10.3, Safari was pre-installed as the system&#x27;s default browser, rather than requiring a manual download, as was the case with the previous Mac OS X versions. Safari&#x27;s predecessor, the Internet Explorer for Mac, was then included in 10.3 as an alternative.

=== Safari 2 ===
In April 2005, Engineer Dave Hyatt fixed several bugs in Safari. His experimental beta passed the Acid2 rendering test on April 27, 2005, marking it the first browser to do so. Safari 2.0 which was released on April 29, 2005, was the sole browser Mac OS X 10.4 offered by default. Apple touted this version as it was capable of running a 1.8x speed boost compared to version 1.2.4 but it did not yet feature the Acid2 bug fixes. These major changes were initially unavailable for end-users unless they privately installed and compiled the WebKit source code or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at OpenDarwin. Version 2.0.2, released on October 31, 2005, finally included the Acid2 bug fixes.

In June 2005 in response to KHTML criticisms over the lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development source code and bug tracking of WebCore and JavaScriptCore to OpenDarwin. They have also open-sourced WebKit. The source code is for non-renderer aspects of the browser such as its GUI elements and the remaining proprietary. The final stable version of Safari 2 and the last version released exclusively with Mac OS X, Safari 2.0.4, was updated on January 10, 2006, for Mac OS X. It was only available within Mac OS X Update 10.4.4, and it delivered fixes to layout and CPU usage issues among other improvements.

=== Safari 3 ===
On January 9, 2007, at Macworld San Francisco, Jobs unveiled that Safari 3 was ported to the newly-introduced iPhone within iPhone OS (later called iOS). The mobile version was capable of displaying full, desktop-class websites. At WWDC 2007, Jobs announced Safari 3 for Mac OS X 10.5, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. He ran a benchmark based on the iBench browser test suite comparing the most popular Windows browsers to the browser, and claimed that Safari had the fastest performance. His claim was later examined by a third-party site called &quot;Web Performance&quot; over HTTP load times. They verified that Safari 3 was indeed the fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was only negligibly faster than Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla Firefox when it came to static content from the local cache.

The initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, contained several bugs and a zero day exploit that allowed remote code executions. The issues were then fixed by Apple three days later on June 14, 2007, in version 3.0.1. On June 22, 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance problems, and other security issues. Safari 3.0.2 for Windows handled some fonts that were missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others. The iPhone was previously released on June 29, 2007, with a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device. The version number of Safari as reported in its user agent string is 3.0 was in line along with the contemporary desktop editions.

The first stable, non-beta version of Safari for Windows, Safari 3.1, was offered as a free download on March 18, 2008. In June 2008, Apple released version 3.1.2, which addressed a security vulnerability in the Windows version where visiting a malicious web site could force a download of executable files and execute them on the user&#x27;s desktop. Safari 3.2, released on November 13, 2008, introduced anti-phishing features using Google Safe Browsing and Extended Validation Certificate support. The final version of Safari 3 was version 3.2.3, which was released on May 12, 2009, with security improvements.

=== Safari 4 ===

Safari 4 was released on June 8, 2009. It was the first version that had completely passed the Acid3 rendering test, as well as the first version to support HTML5. It incorporated WebKit JavaScript engine SquirrelFish that significantly enhanced the browser&#x27;s script interpretation performances by 29.9x. SquirrelFish was later evolved to SquirrelFish Extreme, later also marketed as Nitro, which had 63.6x faster performances. A public beta of Safari 4 was experimented in February 24, 2009.

Safari 4 relied on Cover Flow to run the History and Bookmarks, and it featured Speculative Loading that automatically pre-loaded document information that is required to visit a particular website. The top sites can be displayed up to 24 thumbnails based on the frequently visited sites in a startup. The desktop version of Safari 4 included a redesign similar to that of the iPhone. The update also commissioned many developer tool improvements including Web Inspectors, CSS element viewings, JavaScript debuggers and profilers, offline tables, database management, SQL support and resource graphs. In additions to CSS retouching effects, CSS canvas, and HTML5 content. It replaced the initial Mac OS X-like interface with native Windows themes on Windows using native font renderings.

Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on June 17, 2009, and fixed Faces bugs in iPhoto &#x27;09. Safari 4 in Mac OS X v10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; has built-in 64-bit support, which makes JavaScript load up to 50% faster. It also has native crash resistances that would maintain it intact if a plugin like Flash player crashes, though other tabs or windows would not be affected. Safari 4.0.4, the final version which was released on November 11, 2009, for both Mac and Windows, which further improved the JavaScript performances.

=== Safari 5 ===

Safari 5 was released on June 7, 2010, and was the final version (version 5.1.7) for Windows. It featured a less distractive reader view, and had a 30x faster JavaScript performances. It incorporated numerous developer tool improvements including HTML5 interoperability, and the accessibility to secure extensions. The progress bar was re-added in this version as well. Safari 5.0.1 enabled the Extensions PrefPane by default, rather than requiring users to manually set it in the Debug menu.

Apple exclusively released Safari 4.1 concurrently with Safari 5 for Mac OS X Tiger. It included many features that were found in Safari 5, though it excluded the Safari Reader and Safari Extensions. Apple released Safari 5.1 for both Windows and Mac on July 20, 2011, for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion; it was faster than Safari 5.0, and included the new Reading List feature. The company simultaneously announced Safari 5.0.6 in late June 2010 for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, though the new functions were excluded from Leopard users.

Several HTML5 features were provided in Safari 5. It added supports for full-screen video, closed caption, geolocation, EventSource, and a now obsolete early variant of the WebSocket protocol. The fifth major version of Safari added supports for Full-text search, and a new search engine, Bing. Safari 5 supported Reader, which displays web pages in a continuous view, without advertisements. Safari 5 supported a smarter address field and DNS prefetching that automatically found links and looked up addresses on the web. New web pages loaded faster using Domain Name System (DNS) prefetching. The Windows version received an extra update on Graphic acceleration as well. The blue inline progress bar was returned to the address bar; in addition to the spinning bezel and loading indicator introduced in Safari 4. Top Sites view now had a button to switch to Full History Search. Other features included Extension Builder for developers of Safari Extensions. Other changes included an improved inspector. Safari 5 supports Extensions, add-ons that customize the web browsing experience. Extensions are built using web standards such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

=== Safari 6 ===

Safari 6.0 was previously referred to as Safari 5.2 until Apple changed the version number at WWDC 2012. The stable release of Safari 6 coincided with the release of OS X Mountain Lion on July 25, 2012, and was integrated within OS. As a result, it was no longer available for download from Apple&#x27;s website or any other sources. Apple released Safari 6 via Software Update for users of OS X Lion. It was not released for OS X versions before Lion or for Windows. The company later quietly removed references and links for the Windows version of Safari 5. Microsoft had also removed Safari from its browser-choice page.

On June 11, 2012, Apple released a developer preview of Safari 6.0 with a feature called iCloud Tabs, which syncs with open tabs on any iOS or other OS X device that ran the latest software. It updated new privacy features, including an &quot;Ask websites not to track me&quot; preference and the ability for websites to send OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion users notifications, though it removed RSS support. Safari 6 had the Share Sheets capability in OS X Mountain Lion. The Share Sheet options were: Add to Reading List, Add Bookmark, Email this Page, Message, Twitter, and Facebook. Tabs with full-page previews were added, too. The sixth major version of Safari, it added options to allow pages to be shared with other users via email, Messages, Twitter, and Facebook, as well as making some minor performance improvements. It added supports for in CSS. Additionally, various features were removed including Activity Window, a separate Download Window, direct support for RSS feeds in the URL field, and bookmarks. The separate search field and the address bar were also no longer available as a toolbar configuration option. Instead, it was replaced by the smart search field, a combination of the address bar and the search field.

=== Safari 7 ===

Safari 7 was announced at WWDC 2013, and it brought a number of JavaScript performance improvements. It made uses of Top Site and Sidebar, Shared Links, and Power Saver which paused unused plugins. Safari 7 for OS X Mavericks and Safari 6.1 for Lion and Mountain Lion were all released along with OS X Mavericks in the special event on October 22, 2013.

=== Safari 8 ===
Safari 8 was announced at WWDC 2014 and was released for OS X Yosemite. It included the JavaScript API WebGL, stronger privacy management, improved iCloud integration, and a redesigned interface. It was also faster and more efficient, with additional developer features including JavaScript Promises, CSS Shapes &amp; Composting mark up, IndexedDB, Encrypted Media Extensions, and SPDY protocol.

=== Safari 9 ===
Safari 9 was announced in WWDC 2015 and was shipped with OS X El Capitan. New features included audio muting, more options for Safari Reader, and improved autofill. It was not fully available for the previous OS X Yosemite.

=== Safari 10 ===

Safari 10 was shipped with macOS Sierra and released for OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan on September 20, 2016. It had a redesigned Bookmark and History views, and double-clicking will centralized focus on a particular folder. The update redirected Safari extensions to be saved directly to Pocket and Dic Go. Software improvements included Autofill quality from the Contrast card and Web Inspector Timelines Tab, in-line sub-headlines, bylines, and publish dates. This version tracks and re-applies zoomed level to websites, and legacy plug-ins were disabled by default in favor of HTML5 versions of websites. Recently closed tabs can be reopened via the History menu, or by holding the &quot;+&quot; button in the tab bar, and using Shift-Command-T. When a link opens in a new tab; it is now possible to hit the back button or swipe to close it and go back to the original tab. Debugging is now supported on the Web Inspector. Safari 10 also includes several security updates, including fixes for six WebKit vulnerabilities and issues related to Reader and Tabs. The first version of Safari 10 was released on September 20, 2016, and the last version (10.1.2) was released on July 19, 2017.

=== Safari 11 ===
Safari 11 was released on September 19, 2017 for OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra, ahead of macOS High Sierra&#x27;s release. It was included with High Sierra. Safari 11 included several new features such as Intelligent Tracking Prevention which aimed to prevent cross-site tracking by placing limitations on cookies and other website data. Intelligent Tracking Prevention allowed first-party cookies to continue track the browser history, though with time limits. For example, first-party cookies from ad-tech companies such as Google/Alphabet Inc., were set to expire in 24-hours after the visit.

=== Safari 12 ===

Safari 12 was released for macOS Mojave on September 24, 2018. It was also available to macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra on September 17, 2018. Safari 12 included several new features such as Icons in tabs, Automatic Strong Passwords, and Intelligent Tracking Prevention 2.0. Safari version 12.0.1 was released on October 30, 2018, within macOS Mojave 10.14.1, and Safari 12.0.2 was released on December 5, 2018, under macOS 10.14.2. Support for developer-signed classic Safari Extensions has been dropped. This version would also be the last that supported the official Extensions Gallery. Apple also encouraged extension authors to switch to Safari App Extensions, which triggered negative feedback from the community.

=== Safari 13 ===
Safari 13 was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019. Safari 13 included several new features such as prompting users to change weak passwords, FIDO2 USB security key authentication support, Sign in with Apple support, Apple Pay on the Web support and increased speed and security. Safari 13 was released on September 20, 2019, on macOS Mojave and macOS High Sierra, and later shipped with macOS Catalina.

=== Safari 14 ===
In June 2020 it was announced that macOS Big Sur will include Safari 14. According to Apple, Safari 14 is more than 50% faster than Google Chrome. Safari 14 introduced new privacy features, including Privacy Report, which shows blocked content and privacy information on web pages. Users will also receive a monthly report on trackers that Safari has blocked. Extensions can also be enabled or disabled on a site-by-site basis. Safari 14 introduced partial support for the WebExtension API used in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Opera, making it easier for developers to port their extensions from those web browsers to Safari. Support for Adobe Flash Player will also be dropped from Safari, 3 months ahead of its end-of-life. A built-in translation service allows translation of a page to another language. Safari 14 was released as a standalone update to macOS Catalina and Mojave users on September 16, 2020. It added Ecosia as a supported search engine.

=== Safari 15 ===
Safari 15 was released for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina on September 20, 2021, and later shipped with macOS Monterey. It featured a redesigned interface and tab groups that blended better into the background. There were also a new home page and extension supports on the iOS and iPadOS editions. Starting with this update, Safari versions would support iOS and iPadOS, ending the iOS version of separate updates.

=== Safari 16 ===
Safari 16 was released for iOS 16, macOS Monterey and macOS Big Sur on September 12, 2022, and later shipped with macOS Ventura and iPadOS 16. Safari 16 added support for non-animated AVIF and contains several bug fixes and feature polishing. Safari 16 also includes shared tab groups, vertical tab support, website settings synchronization between devices connected to a same iCloud account, the ability to add backgrounds for a start page, new languages for built-in translation, built-in image translation, and new options to edit strong passwords. iOS 16.4 also introduced Web Push notifications.

=== Safari 17 ===
Safari 17 was released in September 2023 with iOS 17, iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma. It includes a feature named &quot;Profiles&quot;, which allows users to separate their browsing sessions for different use cases. Every profile has a special favorites bar, navigation history, extensions, tab groups, and cookies. Just like iOS 16.4, Safari 17 introduces web apps that can be added to the dock. Cookies are copied into web apps so that users stay logged in the web app if they already are in Safari. Safari can also now read pages with a new option in the navigation bar menu.

New privacy features include locked private browsing when not in use, tracking-free URLs, private relay based on the country’s location and time instead of general position.

Safari has also been adapted to Vision Pro with a new spatial UI, and Apple has redesigned the Develop menu for web developers.

Safari 17 added AV1 hardware decoding support for devices with hardware decoding support.
=== Safari 18 ===
Safari 18 was released in September 2024 with iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, and for the first time, visionOS 2. Like Safari 15, it redesigns the interface, but not limited to the start page and reader mode (which is now called Reader).

A new feature, AI-powered &quot;Highlights&quot; have been introduced, which will automatically detect relevant information on a page and highlight it as you browse.

Other new features include a redesigned unified menu which is now on all versions of the browser, previously it was exclusive to iOS and iPadOS along with the compact mode on macOS, and faster loading times.

=== iOS versions ===
Starting iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Safari would now ship the same features as the macOS version, which also included the name of the updates, ending the separate iOS version.
=== Safari Technology Preview ===
Safari Technology Preview was first released alongside OS X El Capitan 10.11.4. Safari Technology Preview releases include the latest version of WebKit, which included Web technologies in the future stable releases of Safari so that developers and users can install the Technology Preview release on a Mac, test those features, and provide feedback.

=== Safari Developer Program ===
The Safari Developer Program was a program dedicated to in-browser extension and HTML developers.
It allowed members to write and distribute extensions for Safari through the Safari Extensions Gallery. It was initially free until it was incorporated into the Apple Developer Program in WWDC 2015, which costs $99 a year. The charges prompted frustrations from developers. Within OS X El Capitan, Apple implemented the Secure Extension Distribution to further improve its security, and it automatically updated all extensions within the Safari Extensions Gallery.

===Version compatibility===
== Features ==
Until Safari 6.0, it included a built-in web feed aggregator that supported the RSS and Atom standards. Current features included Private Browsing (a mode in which the browser retains no record of information about the user&#x27;s web activity), the ability to archive web content in WebArchive format, the ability to email complete web pages directly from a browser menu, the ability to search bookmarks, and the ability to share tabs between all Mac and iOS devices running appropriate versions of software via an iCloud account.

=== Web compatibility ===
In Safari&#x27;s early years, it pioneered several HTML5 features that are now standard, such as the Canvas API.

In 2015, Safari was criticized for failing to keep pace with some modern web technologies.

=== Intelligent Tracking Prevention ===
In September 2017, Apple announced that it would use artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce the ability of advertisers to track Safari users as they browse the web. Cookies used for tracking will be allowed for 24 hours, then disabled, unless the AI system judges that the user wants to keep the cookie. Major advertising groups objected, saying it will reduce the free services supported by advertising, while other experts praised the change.

=== Plugin support===
Apple used a remotely updated plug-in blacklist to prevent potentially dangerous or vulnerable plugins from running on Safari. Initially, Flash and Java contents were blocked on some early versions of Safari. Since Safari 12, support for NPAPI plugins (except for Flash) has been completely dropped. Safari 14 finally dropped support for Adobe Flash Player.

=== WebExtension support ===
Beginning in 2018, Apple made technical changes to Safari&#x27;s content blocking functionality which prompted backlash from users and developers of ad blocking extensions, who said the changes made it impossible to offer a similar level of user protection found in other browsers. Internally, the update limited the number of blocking rules which could be applied by third-party extensions, preventing the full implementation of community-developed blocklists. In response, several developers of popular ad and tracking blockers announced their products were being discontinued, as they were now incompatible with Safari&#x27;s newly limited content blocking features. Beginning with Safari 13, popular extensions such as uBlock Origin no longer work with Safari.

=== iCloud sync ===
Safari can sync bookmarks, history, reading list, and tabs through iCloud. This happens by default if a user&#x27;s Mac, iPhone or iPad is logged in to iCloud, but syncing can be disabled in the Settings app (on iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings (on Mac).

iCloud Tabs lets users see a list of their other devices&#x27; open tabs that have not been added to a tab group. On iOS and iPadOS, these iCloud Tabs are shown below the grid of open tabs. On the Mac, they are shown at the bottom of the Tab Overview, or in an optional iCloud Tabs toolbar item.

=== Tab Groups ===
Safari 15 added tab groups. These tab groups, and the tabs they contain, can be synced across devices; when a tab is opened in a tab group on one device, it is added to that tab group on all devices, without needing to manually open it through iCloud Tabs. macOS Ventura added Shared Tab Groups, which can be shared through iMessage. New tabs and closed tabs will sync for all participants, and a small thumbnail with users&#x27; profile pictures will be visible on the tab they are currently viewing.

=== Handoff ===
Safari supports the Handoff feature, which allows users to continue where they left off on another device.

=== Sidebar ===
The Safari sidebar was introduced in Safari 8 as a way to access Bookmarks, Reading List, and Shared Tabs. The sidebar got its biggest update in Safari 16, when it added support for vertical tabs. This allows users to see their tabs arranged vertically in addition to the horizontal tab view in the top Toolbar.

=== Visual Look Up ===
This feature allows users to quickly learn more about landmarks, works of art, and more by selecting an image or a photo. Users can also easily lift the subject of an image from Safari, remove its background, and paste it into other apps like Messages and Notes.

=== Live Text ===
Live Text enables users to interact with text within any image or paused video, allowing functionalities such as copying, translating, or looking up text without leaving Safari.

=== Translation ===
Safari’s translation feature now allows for instant translation of entire web pages and supports text in images and paused video, broadening its multilingual capabilities.

=== Quick Note ===
The Quick Note feature lets users capture thoughts or jot down ideas while browsing, directly within Safari. This functionality integrates with the Notes app, providing a streamlined way to save and manage notes.

=== Passkeys ===
Safari now supports Passkeys, a password-less authentication method that provides end-to-end encryption for login credentials. Passkeys sync securely across devices via iCloud Keychain and offer protection against phishing and data leaks.

=== Highlights ===
A new feature powered by machine learning, Highlights automatically surfaces contextual information like summaries, quick links, and related content based on web activity. This makes it easier to discover additional content without leaving the page.

=== Distraction Control ===
Distraction Control lets users hide specific elements on a webpage that might be visually disruptive, allowing for a cleaner browsing experience and improved focus on the content.

=== Link Tracking Protection ===
Safari now removes tracking parameters from shared URLs, preventing third-party sites from tracking the user’s navigation behavior. This feature is enabled by default in Messages, Mail, and Private Browsing mode.

== Architecture ==
On macOS, Safari is a Cocoa application. It uses Apple&#x27;s WebKit for rendering web pages and running JavaScript. WebKit consists of WebCore (based on Konqueror&#x27;s KHTML engine) and JavaScriptCore (originally based on KDE&#x27;s JavaScript engine, named KJS). Like KHTML and KJS, WebCore and JavaScriptCore are free software and released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Some Apple improvements to the KHTML code were merged back into the Konqueror project. Apple has also released some additional codes under the open source 2-clause BSD-like license. The version of Safari included in Mac OS X v10.6 (and later versions) is compiled for 64-bit architecture. Apple claimed that running Safari in 64-bit mode would increase rendering speeds by up to 50%.

WebKit2 has a multiprocess API for WebKit, where the web-content is handled by a separate process than the application using WebKit. Apple announced WebKit2 in April 2010. Safari for OS X switched to the WebKit2 API with version 5.1. Safari for iOS switched to WebKit2 with iOS 8.

Safari has support for WebAssembly (Wasm), including some extensions, but one of them WasmGC has been off by default, since Safari Technology Preview 167, in 2023 and not having it (by default in Safari) has been blocking cross-platform software, many programming languages need it enabled in practice. It was still off by default in Safari 18, but changed to enabled on August 8, 2024 by the developers (so will likely be on in Safari 19, if not sooner, catching up with other web browsers like Google&#x27;s Chrome on e.g. Android).

== Other platforms ==

=== iOS/iPadOS ===
Safari for iPhone was released along with the original iPhone. It was well-received at the time of release, with news outlets calling it &quot;far superior&quot; to other mobile browsers at the time.
Safari has also been available for iPadOS since its split from the main iOS operating system. With the release of iPadOS 13, Safari for iPad&#x27;s user agent was changed to present itself to websites as Safari for Mac and shows the desktop version of websites, except in the miniature Slide Over multitasking view. Apple improved multitouch compatibility for desktop websites through a number of tweaks to the WebKit engine, for example with heuristics to determine whether to translate a tap into a hover or a click. The iPadOS version also gained a download manager, support for Media Source Extensions to allow users to watch Netflix in Safari, and support for the custom keyboard shortcuts in web apps like Gmail, which override Safari&#x27;s own keyboard shortcuts. External webcam support for websites was later added also.

The browser has continued to receive updates with new releases of iOS, such as the addition of browsing profiles for different use cases with iOS 17, and a locked private browsing feature. iOS 15 added support for third-party browser extensions, which can be downloaded and installed through corresponding apps via the App Store. Extensions available included VPNs and content blockers. Universal extensions that also worked with the Mac version of Safari can be created via a WebExtensions API.

=== visionOS ===
A Safari version for visionOS released with the launch of the Apple Vision Pro headset in 2024, with features specific to the platform such as moving browser windows around in virtual space. &quot;The Verge&quot; said it was the headset&#x27;s &quot;killer app&quot; at launch, due to its versatility and potential for web experiences.

=== Windows ===
Safari for Windows was introduced along with the 3.0 version for Mac at Apple&#x27;s WWDC conference in 2007, in an effort to increase overall Safari market share. It supported Windows XP and Vista at launch. &quot;Wired&quot;, in a review, praised its speed but criticised bugs at launch.

After Safari&#x27;s release, Apple Software Update, an updater program bundled with QuickTime and iTunes for Windows, automatically selected Safari for installation, as a &quot;recommended&quot; program. This was criticized by John Lilly, then-CEO of Mozilla, who said it &quot;borders on malware distribution practices&quot;. By late 2008, Apple Software Update stopped installing new software by default, though it still offered Safari in its list of available programs (with its checkbox unticked).

Safari for Windows was discontinued after version 5.1.7 released in 2010.

== Market share ==

In 2009, Safari had a market share of 3.85%. It remained stable in that rank for five years with market shares of 5.56% (2010), 7.41% (2011), 10.07% (2012), and 11.77% (2013). In 2014, it caught up with Firefox with a market share of 14.20%. In 2015, Safari became the second most-used web browser worldwide after Google Chrome, and had a market share of 13.01%. From 2015 to 2020, it occupied market shares of 14.02%, 14.86%, 14.69%, 17.68% and 19.25%, respectively. , Google Chrome continued to be the most popular browser with Safari (19.22%) following behind in second place.

In May 2022, according to StatCounter, Apple&#x27;s Safari dropped to the third most popular desktop browser after being overtaken by Microsoft Edge. Safari was then used by 9.61% of desktop computers worldwide. One year later, Safari retook second place.

== Criticism ==

=== Security updates for Snow Leopard and Windows ===
Software security firm Sophos detailed how Snow Leopard and Windows users were not supported by the Safari 6 release at the time, while there were over 121 vulnerabilities left unpatched on those platforms. Since then, Snow Leopard has had only three minor version releases of Safari (the most recent in September 2013), and Windows has had none. While no official word has been released by Apple, the indication is that these are the final versions available for these operating systems, and both retain significant security issues.

=== Potential anticompetitive practices ===
Apple has been criticized for anticompetitive practices related to Safari on iOS. Before iOS 14 (2020), users could not change their default browser, so links always opened in Safari. App Store rules still require all third-party iOS browsers to use Safari&#x27;s WebKit browser engine, inheriting its limitations. Apple&#x27;s stated motivation for this browser engine restriction was to increase security, an argument disputed by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority. The European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act regulation, passed in 2022, requires Apple to allow alternative browser engines. In response, Google and Mozilla began porting their browser engines to iOS.

=== Payments from Google ===
In a November 2023 disclosure, during the ongoing antitrust trial against Google, an economics professor at the University of Chicago revealed that Google pays Apple 36% of all search advertising revenue generated when users access Google through the Safari browser. The revenue generated from Safari users has been kept confidential, but the 36% figure suggests that it is likely in the tens of billions of dollars.

Both Apple and Google have argued that disclosing the specific terms of their search default agreement would harm their competitive positions. However, the court ruled that the information was relevant to the antitrust case and ordered its disclosure. This revelation has raised concerns about the dominance of Google in the search engine market and the potential anticompetitive effects of its agreements with Apple.

<text>The Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC; or ) is a group of college- and university-based officer-training programs for training commissioned officers of the United States Armed Forces.

While ROTC graduate officers serve in all branches of the U.S. military, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Space Force, and the U.S. Coast Guard do not have their own respective ROTC programs; rather, graduates of Naval ROTC programs have the option to serve as officers in the Marine Corps contingent on meeting Marine Corps requirements. Graduates of Air Force ROTC also have the option to be commissioned in the Space Force as a Space Operations Officer.

In 2020, ROTC graduates constituted 70 percent of newly commissioned active-duty U.S. Army officers, 83 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Marine Corps officers (through NROTC), 61 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Navy officers and 63 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Air Force officers, for a combined 56 percent of all active-duty officers in the Department of Defense commissioned that year. Under ROTC, a student may receive a competitive, merit-based scholarship covering all or part of college tuition, textbooks and lab fees, in return for an active-duty service obligation after graduation (or completion of a graduate degree under an approved education delay). ROTC students attend college like other students, but also receive basic military training and officer training for their chosen branch of service through the ROTC unit at or nearby the college. The students participate in regular drills during the school year and off-campus training opportunities during the summer.

Army ROTC units are organized as brigades, battalions and companies. Air Force ROTC units are detachments with the students organized into wings, groups, squadrons and flights. Army and Air Force ROTC students are referred to as cadets. Naval ROTC units are organized as battalions and also include NROTC students under &quot;Marine Option&quot; who will eventually be commissioned as officers in the Marine Corps. Marine NROTC students may be formed in a separate company when the program includes sufficient numbers. All Naval ROTC students are referred to as midshipmen. Some of the summer training that is offered to cadets in the Army ROTC program are: Airborne, Air Assault, Mountain Warfare, WHINSEC and other related schools. In addition to their mandatory 20 day Field Training (FT) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, typically between their sophomore and junior year. Air Force ROTC cadets are also eligible for Airborne training under the tutelage of the Army at Fort Moore, Georgia. Naval ROTC midshipmen will participate in summer cruise programs every summer, either afloat or ashore, similar to their U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen counterparts.

==History==
===Concept===

The concept of training reserve military officers in civilian colleges and universities in United States was created by the founder of Norwich University, Alden Partridge, who was a former United States Military Academy instructor. Partridge, who founded Norwich in Northfield, Vermont in 1819 as the &quot;American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy,&quot; promoted the idea of &quot;citizen soldiers,&quot; men trained to act in a military capacity when their nation required but capable of fulfilling standard civilian functions in peacetime. The Morrill Act of 1862 established land-grant colleges. Part of the federal government&#x27;s requirement for these schools was that they include military tactics as part of their curriculum. Another root of the modern ROTC program comes from the &quot;Plattsburg Idea&quot;. In 1915, Major General Leonard Wood instituted the Citizen&#x27;s Military Training Camps (not to be confused with the later CMTC of the interwar period), the first series of training camps to make officers out of civilians. For the first time in history, an attempt was made to provide a condensed course of training and commissioning competent reserve line officers after only a summer of military training.

===Formal establishment and World War I===

In 1916, the provision to formally establish ROTC was advocated to Congress by a delegation from Ohio including William Oxley Thompson, President of the Ohio State University. On February 7, 1916, Ralph D. Mershon, a graduate of Ohio State, testified before the committee as a professional engineer. Present to testify as an advocate of a Reserve Engineers Corps, he expanded his remarks to argue in favor of the &quot;Ohio Plan&quot;. Mershon noted:

: &quot;... the transformation that will take place in one term of drill in a man just off the farm and very clumsy when he enters college, and who at the end of a term is &#x27;set up&#x27;, carries himself well, looks neat in his uniform, and has acquired a measure of self-respect, and the respect of his colleagues, to an extent he would not have had without the military training.&quot;

Congress agreed, and the ROTC provision was included in the final version of the National Defense Act of 1916. The first ROTC unit was at Harvard in 1916.

Over 5,000 men arrived at Plattsburgh, New York, in May 1917 for the first of the officer training camps. By the end of 1917, over 17,000 men had been trained. By the eve of its entry into World War I, the U.S. had a prepared corps of officers including one of the earliest Plattsburgh graduates, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.

===Interwar period===

====Senior division and the Organized Reserve====

Beginning in 1919, many of the ROTC programs established during World War I resumed enrollments, and many new programs were organized. The National Defense Act of 1920 continued ROTC, and by the end of 1921, about 180 senior division programs were active at civilian and military colleges and universities. The branches of ROTC units offered at each college or university was based upon the kind of Organized Reserve units organized in the vicinity by the War Department; the actual organization of each type of ROTC unit attempted to conform to standard tables of organization of each branch unit. Most schools offered only one program, usually infantry, although some of the larger institutions or military colleges offered multiple branches that a cadet could consider. Only six Air Corps programs were ever established; they produced few graduates, and all were eliminated in 1936 and replaced with less expensive units, mostly infantry, at other schools. By 1928, ROTC units were commissioning 6,000 Organized Reserve second lieutenants per year. In 1935, funding for all medical ROTC programs was cut by Congress as a cost-saving measure, but they were restored the following year, when another seventeen programs of various branches were established or reestablished, giving ROTC a presence in all 48 states, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii, including programs at four historically black colleges or universities. 

The first two years of the course consisted of basic knowledge and skills common to all soldiers, while the advanced course consisted of branch-specific knowledge. In many schools, primarily land-grant and military colleges and universities, all four years were mandatory for male students. In some schools, only the first two years were mandatory. Even if a student completed all four years, he was not required to take a commission, nor did completion of the four-year program guarantee it. Cadets pursuing a commission typically attended a summer camp after their junior or senior year. Cadets from a given school would attend en masse at a Regular Army installation and go through training conducted by a unit of the same branch as that of the ROTC unit. Most often, units of the same branch from several different schools would attend at the same time. The camps lasted four weeks and served as a training, orientation, and leadership evaluation opportunity for the cadets. Once a cadet completed the four-year course and the summer camp, he was offered a commission as a second lieutenant if the school&#x27;s Professor of Military Science and Tactics considered the young man of sufficient character and ability to serve as an officer in the Army of the United States.

Before the mid-1920s, new Reserve second lieutenants were assigned to Organized Reserve units of their branch located in the vicinity of their residences; this resulted in both formal and informal &quot;feeder&quot; relationships between schools and units located in their vicinities. In 1926-1927, the War Department also authorized Reserve officers to be assigned to &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) units. A formal affiliation program between many RAI units, including nearly all of the infantry regiments, and nearby schools was initiated. Typically, in the case of a regiment, the school&#x27;s Professor of Military Science and Tactics or the senior Regular Army officer assigned to the ROTC program was designated the regimental commander, with other Regular Army instructors assigned key positions within the regiment. However, the RAI affiliation program proved taxing for Regular Army officers who had to devote their attention to both the program and their assigned unit; by 1933, command of all RAI units was turned over to Reserve officers.

====Junior division====

During the 1930s, there were junior ROTC programs in some larger city high schools, such as in Memphis, Tennessee, Charlotte, North Carolina, Kansas City, Missouri, and New Orleans, Louisiana.

===World War II===

The extent of the U.S. Army&#x27;s mobilization before its involvement in World War II—“a state neither of war nor of peace&quot;—disrupted the Organized Reserve. Beginning in mid-1940, large numbers of Reserve officers began to be called to active duty individually and assigned to expanding Regular Army units, and to National Guard units after the mobilization of that component was authorized in August. On 30 June 1940, 2,710 Reserve officers were on active duty, but by 15 May 1941, the number was over 46,000, and by 30 June, 57,309. The need for young, qualified company-grade officers (lieutenants and captains) was acute, and by mid-1941, 75 to 90 percent of the officers in Regular Army units and 10 percent in National Guard units were Reserve officers. By December 1941, 80,000 Reserve officers were on active duty. By the end of 1942, 140,000 officers holding Reserve commissions through various paths were on active duty, but by that date, 12,100 who had been previously commissioned &quot;had not received such orders,&quot; mainly for reasons like being over-age in grade, found medically disqualified for active service, deferred due to academics or civilian employment, or lack of vacancies.

On 6 February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9049, which ordered &quot;into the active military service of the United States...for the duration of the present war and for six months after the termination thereof...each of the organizations and units and all of the personnel of the Organized Reserve not already in such service;&quot; because most Reserve officers were already on active duty, this amounted to a “public relations” document. Because of the course of the mobilization of 1940–1941, &quot;few of the Reserve officers originally assigned to...units were available for duty with them. Consequently, the units as activated bore small resemblance to those of peacetime.&quot;

The advanced ROTC program was suspended in its entirety in the spring of 1943 in concert with the institution of the Army Specialized Training Program, and no new contracts were issued for the duration of the war. The basic ROTC curriculum was kept intact as part of the military indoctrination for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program for 17 year olds. At this time, several major categories of ROTC students existed:

* Members of the normal college class of 1942, who had completed a full four-year program plus the summer camp.
* Members of the normal college class of 1943 who had chosen to accelerate their studies via summer sessions offered in 1942 that gave a full semester or quarter of credit. These men graduated with a completed advanced course minus the summer camp at the end of 1942 if on the semester calendar, or in the early spring of 1943 if on the quarter calendar. These men, along with the members of the normal class of 1943, then went directly to officer candidate schools.
* Members of the normal college class of 1944 who had taken the 1942 summer session. These men graduated in the fall of 1943 with a partially complete (either three semesters out of four or four quarters out of six) advanced course. These men also went directly to officer-candidate schools, although some men attending institutions on the quarter calendar were allowed to remain in school through the summer quarter to ease congestion in officer-candidate schools.
* Members of the normal college class of 1945 who had taken the 1942 summer session, called &quot;ROTC juniors.&quot; If their institution was on the semester calendar, they were due to begin advanced ROTC in the spring semester of 1943. They, along with the remaining members of the normal class of 1944, were sent to basic training after the spring semester ended. 

After returning from basic training in the early fall of 1943, the ROTC juniors were allowed to resume their civilian curricula at the institutions they were attending or act as instructors in basic ROTC, which functioned as military indoctrination for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program until called to officer candidate school. These men were only attached to the ASTP for administrative purposes.

===Cold War===

Compulsory participation in ROTC for all male students at many civilian institutions was common until the 1960s. However, because of the protests connected with opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, compulsory ROTC was dropped in favor of voluntary programs. In some places, opposition was so severe that ROTC was expelled from campus altogether, although it was always possible to participate in off-campus ROTC. By the early 1980s, there was noticeably less resentment of the military on campus, as students&#x27; feelings about Vietnam became less vivid. 

As of 2021, more than 1,700 high schools have Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) programs.

In the 21st century, the debate often focused around the Congressional don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell law, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and in force until 2011, which forbade homosexuals serving in the United States military from disclosing their sexual orientation at the risk of expulsion. Some schools believed this legal mandate would require them to waive or amend their non-discrimination policies.

In recent years, concerted efforts are being made at some Ivy League universities that have previously banned ROTC (including Columbia) to return ROTC to campus. The Harvard ROTC program was reinstated effective March 4, 2011 following enactment of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

Under current law, there are three types of ROTC programs administered, each with a different element.

* The first are the programs at the six senior military colleges, also known as military schools. These institutions grant baccalaureate degrees (at a minimum) and organize all or some of their students into a corps of cadets under some sort of military discipline. Those participating in the cadet program must attend at least 2 years of ROTC education.
* The second are programs at &quot;civilian colleges&quot;. As defined under Army regulations, these are schools that grant baccalaureate or graduate degrees and are not operated on a military basis.
*The third category is programs at military junior colleges (MJC). These are military schools that provide junior college education (typically A.S. or A.A. degree). These schools do not grant baccalaureate degrees but they meet all other requirements of military colleges (if participating in the Early Commissioning Program) and cadets are required to meet the same military standards as other schools (if enrolled in ECP), as set by Army Cadet Command. Cadets can be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army Reserve/Army National Guard as graduating sophomores. Upon commissioning, these lieutenants are required to complete their bachelor&#x27;s degree at another institution (of the lieutenant&#x27;s choosing) while serving in their units. Upon receiving their bachelors, ECP lieutenants can assess active duty and go onto active duty as a first lieutenant. Only the Army currently offers an Early Commissioning Program. In time of war, MJC&#x27;s have played a significant role in producing officers for the Army. During the Vietnam war, the requirement to complete one&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s degree was not in effect. Therefore, upon commissioning lieutenants went straight onto active duty.

One difference between civilian colleges and the senior or junior military colleges is enrollment option in ROTC. ROTC is voluntary for students attending civilian colleges and universities. However, with few exceptions (as outlined in both Army regulations and federal law) it is required of students attending the senior and junior military colleges. Another major difference between the senior military colleges and civilian colleges is that under federal law, graduates of the SMCs are guaranteed active duty assignments if requested with the approval of the school&#x27;s professor of military science.

==U.S. Army ROTC==


The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (AROTC) program is the largest branch of ROTC, as the Army is the largest branch of the military. There are over 20,000 ROTC cadets in 273 ROTC programs at major universities throughout the United States. These schools are categorized as Military Colleges (MC), Military Junior Colleges (MJC) and Civilian Colleges (CC). Army ROTC provides the majority of the Army&#x27;s officer corps; the remainder comes from West Point, Officer Candidate School (OCS), or direct commissions.

AROTC offers scholarships based on the time of enrollment in the program. Newly graduated seniors in high school can enter the program with a full four-year scholarship while college students can enroll later and earn a scholarship that would cover the remainder of their college career. Additional scholarships are available depending on the Cadet&#x27;s involvement in the Army National Guard, Reserves, or intentions to become Active-Duty status after graduation.

The two-year scholarship is available for students with two academic years of college remaining. An applicant for a two-year or four-year scholarship must meet the following requirements:
* Be a U.S. citizen
* Have a high school diploma or equivalent
* Be between ages 17 and 27
* Have a college GPA of at least 2.5
* Meet the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT)

The applicant must agree to accept a commission and serve in the Army on active duty or in a reserve component (U.S. Army Reserve or Army National Guard).

The four-year scholarship is for students who receive it out of high school or before entering college. The four-year scholarship can be extended with the same conditions to a 5-year scholarship if the major is in Engineering.

Campus-based three-year, two-and-a-half-year, and two-year scholarships are available for students already enrolled in a college or university with three (or two) academic years remaining.

An applicant for a campus-based scholarship must meet all AROTC administrative and academic requirements as well as have a minimum SAT score of 1000 or ACT score of 19.

Once a prospect has shown interest in the AROTC program they can compete in a scholarship board. If the prospect boards well the AROTC program&#x27;s Professor of Military Science may submit them for selection of a scholarship. Numerous factors will influence this decision.

Typically the summer between the academic junior and senior years of school, Cadets attend Advance Camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Here, each cadet would be evaluated on leadership skills. The course was set up for a month of training with other peers and evaluated by Army Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers. Advance Camp is the United States Army&#x27;s largest training event.

==U.S. Naval ROTC==

The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) program was founded in 1926 and the U.S. Marine Corps joined the program in 1932. The naval NROTC program is offered at over 150 colleges nationwide.

==U.S. Air Force ROTC==

The first Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (then Air ROTC) units were established between 1920 and 1923 at the University of California, Berkeley, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois, the University of Washington, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Texas A&amp;M University. After World War II, the Air Force established ROTC units at 77 colleges and universities throughout the United States.

==Non-U.S. ROTC programs==
Other national armed forces in countries with strong historical ties to the United States have ROTC programs.
* ROTC in the Philippines began in 1912 during American territorial rule with the creation of the first unit at the University of the Philippines. The National ROTC Alumni Association (NRAA) of the Philippines estimates that 75 percent of the officer corps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines come from ROTC.
* ROTC in South Korea started in 1961.
* ROTC in Taiwan started in the 1960s with training courses being severely reduced over the years as an experiment before it was implemented again in 1997.

Other countries have also institutionalized reservist training programs. Reserve Officer Training in Russia began in the 1920s. Brazil has had the CPOR and the NPOR since 1928, the difference being that officers trained by the CPOR choose their area of specialization, while officers trained by the NPOR learn from their local army base.

==Student Army Training Corps (SATC)==
During World War I, the United States created the Student Army Training Corps in an effort to encourage young men to simultaneously receive a college education and train for the military. Students were authorized to participate beginning in the summer of 1917, and training camps were held in the summer of 1918.

Enrollment in the SATC was voluntary, and 525 universities enrolled 200,000 total students on October 1, 1918, the first day SATC units were authorized to formally organize on college campuses. Students who joined the SATC received the rank of private in the army, and some advanced to leadership roles including sergeant.

When the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war, the Army&#x27;s need for more soldiers and officers ended. The SATC was disbanded in December 1918, and its members were honorably discharged from the military.

===Notable members===

<text>The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime () is Norway&#x27;s central unit for fighting economic and environmental crimes. The unit, created in 1989, has its main office in Oslo.

Økokrim is both a police unit and a prosecution authority. The current director is Pål Lønseth. The unit is organized in multidisciplinary teams headed by public prosecutors. Each team has a specific field of expertise, such as corruption, computer crime or fraud.

==Cases==
The organization has played an important role in some major legal cases. In 2003, Økokrim arrested Mullah Krekar, alleged leader of the Kurdish Islamist group, Ansar al-Islam.

===2002===
After Jon Lech Johansen released DeCSS, he was taken to court by Økokrim. The trial opened in the Oslo District Court on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty and the defense, by Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else&#x27;s information, since Johansen owned the DVDs himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, acquitting Johansen of all charges.

===2003===
Økokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 to the Johansen verdict and on 28 February that the Borgarting Court of Appeal had agreed to hear the case. Johansen&#x27;s second DeCSS trial began on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. Økokrim did make a further appeal of the case to the Supreme Court.

===2006===
In 2006, Økokrim filed indictments were filed against four members of The 5 Percent Community for breach of trust with fraudulent intent. The main individuals responsible, including Henrik Ellefsen and Jørn Ronnie Tagge, were convicted on charges of fraud in December 2007.

===2011===
In 2011 the agency investigated 28 cases. 28 persons were convicted, and the conviction rate was 86%.

===2012===
The agency&#x27;s desired conviction rate is 90%.

===2016===
On 8 March 2016, Økokrim seized the Popcorn-Time.no domain name. The site did not host the Popcorn Time application but instead had articles and links to sites that offered the application.

<text>Tony Harrison (born 30 April 1937) is an English poet, translator and playwright. He was born in Beeston, Leeds and he received his education in Classics from Leeds Grammar School and Leeds University. He is one of Britain&#x27;s foremost verse writers and many of his works have been performed at the Royal National Theatre. He is noted for controversial works such as the poem &quot;V&quot;, as well as his versions of dramatic works: from ancient Greek such as the tragedies &quot;Oresteia&quot; and &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, from French Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, from Middle English &quot;The Mysteries&quot;. He is also noted for his outspoken views, particularly those on the Iraq War. In 2015, he was honoured with the David Cohen Prize in recognition for his body of work. In 2016, he was awarded the Premio Feronia in Rome.

==Works==

Adaptation of the English Medieval Mystery Plays, based on the York and Wakefield cycles, &quot;The Mysteries&quot;, were first performed in 1985 by the Royal National Theatre. Interviewed by Melvyn Bragg for BBC television in 2012, Harrison said: &quot;It was only when I did the Mystery Plays and got Northern actors doing verse, that I felt that I was reclaiming the energy of classical verse in the voices that it was created for.&quot;

One of his best-known works is the long poem &quot;V&quot; (1985), written during the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, and describing a trip to see his parents&#x27; grave in Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, &quot;now littered with beer cans and vandalised by obscene graffiti&quot;. The title has several possible interpretations: victory, versus, verse, insulting V sign etc. Proposals to screen a filmed version of &quot;V&quot; by Channel 4 in October 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press, some broadsheet journalists, and MPs, apparently concerned about the effects its &quot;torrents of obscene language&quot; and &quot;streams of four-letter filth&quot; would have on the nation&#x27;s youth. Indeed, an Early Day Motion entitled &quot;Television Obscenity&quot; was proposed on 27 October 1987 by a group of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), who condemned Channel 4 and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The motion was opposed only by MP Norman Buchan, who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem. The broadcast went ahead and, after widespread press coverage, the uproar subsided. Gerald Howarth MP said that Harrison was &quot;Probably another bolshie poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us&quot;. When told of this, Harrison retorted that Howarth was &quot;Probably another idiot MP wishing to impose his intellectual limitations on the rest of us&quot;.

==Reception==
Richard Eyre calls Harrison&#x27;s 1990 play, &quot;The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus&quot; &quot;among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s&quot;. Jocelyn Herbert, famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison is aware of the dramatic visual impact of his ideas: &quot;The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants.&quot;

Edith Hall has written that she is convinced that Harrison&#x27;s 1998 film-poem &quot;Prometheus&quot; is &quot;artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class&quot; at the end of the twentieth century, and considers it as &quot;the most important adaptation of classical myth for a radical political purpose for years&quot; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;most brilliant artwork, with the possible exception of his stage play &quot;The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus&quot;&quot;.

Professor Roger Griffin of the Department of History at Oxford Brookes University, in his paper &quot;The palingenetic political community: rethinking the legitimation of totalitarian regimes in inter-war Europe&quot;, describes Harrison&#x27;s film-poem as &quot;magnificent&quot; and suggests that Harrison is trying to tell his audience
&quot;To avoid falling prey to the collective mirage of a new order, to stay wide awake while others succumb to the lethe of the group mind, to resist the gaze of modern Gorgons&quot;.

<text>Dame Carol Ann Duffy (born 23 December 1955) is a Scottish poet and playwright. She is a professor of contemporary poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was appointed Poet Laureate in May 2009, and her term expired in 2019. She was the first female poet laureate, the first Scottish-born poet and the first openly lesbian poet to hold the Poet Laureate position.

Her collections include &quot;Standing Female Nude&quot; (1985), winner of a Scottish Arts Council Book Award; &quot;Selling Manhattan&quot; (1987), which won a Somerset Maugham Award; &quot;Mean Time&quot; (1993), which won the Whitbread Poetry Award; and &quot;Rapture&quot; (2005), which won the T. S. Eliot Prize. Her poems address issues such as oppression, gender, and violence, in accessible language.

==Early life==
Carol Ann Duffy was born into a Roman Catholic family in the Gorbals, considered a poor part of Glasgow. She was the daughter of Mary (née Black) and Frank Duffy, an electrical fitter. Her mother&#x27;s parents were Irish, and her father had Irish grandparents. The eldest of five siblings, she has four brothers: Frank, Adrian, Eugene and Tim. The family moved to Stafford, England, when Duffy was six years old. Her father worked for English Electric. A trade unionist, he stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party in 1983 in addition to managing Stafford F.C.

Duffy was educated in Stafford at Saint Austin&#x27;s RC Primary School (1962–1967), St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent School (1967–1970), and Stafford Girls&#x27; High School (1970–1974), her literary talent encouraged by two English teachers, June Scriven at St Joseph&#x27;s, and Jim Walker at Stafford Girls&#x27; High. She was a passionate reader from an early age, and always wanted to be a writer, producing poems from the age of 11. When one of her English teachers died, she wrote:
==Career==
When Duffy was 15, June Scriven sent her poems to &quot;Outposts&quot;, a publisher of pamphlets, where it was read by the bookseller Bernard Stone, who published some of them. When she was 16, she met Adrian Henri, 39 at the time, one of the Liverpool poets, and decided she wanted to be with him; she then lived with him for 10 years until they split in 1982. &quot;He gave me confidence,&quot; she said, &quot;he was great. It was all poetry, very heady, and he was never faithful. He thought poets had a duty to be unfaithful.&quot;

She applied to the University of Liverpool to be near him, and began a philosophy degree there in 1974. She had two plays performed at the Liverpool Playhouse, wrote a pamphlet, &quot;Fifth Last Song&quot;, and received an honours degree in philosophy in 1977. She won the National Poetry Competition in 1983. She worked as poetry critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 1988 to 1989, and was editor of the poetry magazine, &quot;Ambit&quot;. In 1996, she was appointed as a lecturer in poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and later became creative director of its Writing School.

Duffy was a contender for the post of Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1999 after the death of Ted Hughes, but lost out to Andrew Motion. Duffy said she would not have accepted the position at that time anyway, because she was in a relationship with Scottish poet Jackie Kay, had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention. In the same year, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

She was appointed as Poet Laureate on 1 May 2009, when Motion&#x27;s 10-year term was over. Duffy was featured on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; with Melvyn Bragg in December 2009 and on 7 December she presented the Turner Prize to artist Richard Wright.

Duffy received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2009.

In 2015, Duffy was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy.

===Poet laureate===
In her first poem as poet laureate, Duffy tackled the scandal over British MPs&#x27; expenses in the format of a sonnet. Her second, &quot;Last Post&quot;, was commissioned by the BBC to mark the deaths of Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, the last remaining British soldiers to fight in World War I. Her third, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas 2009&quot;, addresses current events such as species extinction, the climate change conference in Copenhagen, the banking crisis, and the war in Afghanistan. In March 2010, she wrote &quot;Achilles (for David Beckham)&quot; about the Achilles tendon injury that left David Beckham out of the English football team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup; the poem was published in &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; and treats modern celebrity culture as a kind of mythicisation. &quot;Silver Lining,&quot; written in April 2010, acknowledges the grounding of flights caused by the ash of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. On 30 August 2010 she premièred her poem &quot;Vigil&quot; for the Manchester Pride Candlelight Vigil in memory of LGBTQ people who have lost their lives to HIV/AIDS.

Duffy wrote a 46-line poem, &quot;Rings,&quot; for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The poem celebrates the rings found in nature and does not specifically mention the couple&#x27;s names. It begins &quot;for both to say&quot; and continues: &quot;I might have raised your hand to the sky / to give you the ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings of your eyes / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, / ...&quot;. She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work was sent to the couple as a wedding gift. Duffy also wrote the poem &quot;The Throne,&quot; which she composed for the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation.

In &quot;Stylist&quot; magazine, Duffy said of becoming poet laureate: &quot;There&#x27;s no requirement. I do get asked to do things and so far I&#x27;ve been happy to do them.&quot; She also spoke about being appointed to the role by Queen Elizabeth II, saying: &quot;She&#x27;s lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an &#x27;audience&#x27; with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me.&quot;

Duffy stood down as laureate in May 2019.

==Poetry==

===Style===
Duffy&#x27;s work explores both everyday experience and the rich fantasy life of herself and others. In dramatizing scenes from childhood, adolescence, and adult life, she discovers moments of consolation through love, memory, and language. Charlotte Mendelson writes in &quot;The Observer&quot;:

Part of Duffy&#x27;s talent – besides her ear for ordinary eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety – is her ventriloquism. Like the best of her novelist peers ... she slides in and out of her characters&#x27; lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter ... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets – that is, she makes it look easy.

Of her own writing, Duffy has said: &quot;I&#x27;m not interested, as a poet, in words like &#x27;plash&#x27;—Seamus Heaney words, interesting words. I like to use simple words, but in a complicated way.&quot; She told &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;Like the sand and the oyster, it&#x27;s a creative irritant. In each poem, I&#x27;m trying to reveal a truth, so it can&#x27;t have a fictional beginning.&quot;

Duffy rose to greater prominence in UK poetry circles after her poem &quot;Whoever She Was&quot; won the Poetry Society National Poetry Competition in 1983.
In her first collection, &quot;Standing Female Nude&quot; (1985), she uses the voices of outsiders, for example in the poems &quot;Education for Leisure&quot; and &quot;Dear Norman.&quot; Her next collection, &quot;Feminine Gospels&quot; (2002), continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, &quot;Rapture&quot; (2005), is a series of intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the £10,000 T. S. Eliot Prize. In 2007, she published &quot;The Hat&quot;, a collection of poems for children. Online copies of her poems are rare, but her poem dedicated to U A Fanthorpe, &quot;Premonitions,&quot; is available through &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and several others via &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;.

===In schools===
Duffy&#x27;s poems are studied in British schools at ISC, GCSE, National 5, A-level, and higher levels. In August 2008, her &quot;Education for Leisure,&quot; a poem about violence, was removed from the GCSE AQA Anthology, following a complaint about its references to knife crime and a goldfish being flushed down a toilet. The poem begins: &quot;Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God.&quot; The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish. The budgie panics and the cat hides. It ends with him, or her, or them, leaving the house with a knife. &quot;The pavements glitter suddenly. I touch your arm.&quot;

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, schools were urged to destroy copies of the unedited anthology, though this was later denied by AQA. Duffy called the decision ridiculous. &quot;It&#x27;s an anti-violence poem,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a plea for education rather than violence.&quot; She responded with &quot;Mrs Schofield&#x27;s GCSE&quot;, a poem about violence in other fiction, and the point of it. &quot;Explain how poetry/pursues the human like the smitten moon/above the weeping, laughing earth ...&quot; The Mrs. Schofield of the title refers to Pat Schofield, an external examiner at Lutterworth College, Leicestershire, who complained about &quot;Education for Leisure,&quot; calling it &quot;absolutely horrendous.&quot;

For the new National Qualifications Higher English Course in Scotland, Duffy&#x27;s agents, RCW Literacy Agency, refused permission for her poem, &quot;Originally,&quot; to be reproduced in the publicly accessible version of the paper.

===&quot;Anthologise&quot; annual competition for schools===
In 2011 Duffy, spearheaded a new poetry competition for schools, named &quot;Anthologise&quot;. The competition is administered by the Poetry Book Society and was launched by the Duchess of Cornwall in September 2011. School students aged 11–18 from around the UK were invited to create and submit their own anthologies of published poetry. The 2011 &quot;Anthologise&quot; judges were Duffy; Gillian Clarke (National Poet for Wales); John Agard; Grace Nichols and Cambridge Professor of Children&#x27;s Poetry, Morag Styles. The first ever winners of &quot;Anthologise&quot; were the sixth form pupils of Monkton Combe School, Bath, with their anthology titled &quot;The Poetry of Earth is Never Dead&quot;, which was described by Duffy as &quot;assured and accomplished as any anthology currently on the bookshelves.&quot;

===Plays and songs===
Duffy is also a playwright, and has had plays performed at the Liverpool Playhouse and the Almeida Theatre in London. Her plays include &quot;Take My Husband&quot; (1982), &quot;Cavern of Dreams&quot; (1984), &quot;Little Women, Big Boys&quot; (1986) &quot;Loss&quot; (1986), &quot;Casanova&quot; (2007). Her radio credits include an adaptation of &quot;Rapture&quot;. Her children&#x27;s collections include &quot;Meeting Midnight&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Oldest Girl in the World&quot; (2000). She also collaborated with the Manchester composer, Sasha Johnson Manning, on &quot;The Manchester Carols&quot;, a series of Christmas songs that premiered in Manchester Cathedral in 2007.

She also participated in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty-Six Books&quot;, for which she wrote a piece based on a book of the King James Bible.

A modernised adaptation of &quot;Everyman&quot; by Duffy, with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role, was performed at the Royal National Theatre from April to July 2015.

==Personal life==
At the age of 16, Duffy began a relationship with poet Adrian Henri, living with him until 1982. Duffy later met poet Jackie Kay, with whom she had a 15-year relationship. During her relationship with Kay, Duffy gave birth to a daughter, Ella (born 1995), whose biological father is fellow poet Peter Benson.

Raised in her parents&#x27; Roman Catholic faith, Duffy became an atheist when she was 15. However, she has spoken of the influence her religious upbringing has had on her poetry, stating: &quot;Poetry and prayer are very similar.&quot;

She is a lesbian.

<text>Post-production is part of the process of filmmaking, video production, audio production, and photography. Post-production includes all stages of production occurring after principal photography or recording individual program segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge/Focal Press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional first part of the post-production process, non-linear (analog) film editing, has mostly been replaced by digital or video editing software, which operates as a non-linear editing (NLE) system. The advantage of non-linear editing is the ability to edit scenes out of order, thereby making creative changes at will. This flexibility facilitates carefully shaping the film in a thoughtful, meaningful way for emotional effect.

Once the production team is satisfied with the picture editing, the editing is said to be &quot;locked&quot;. At this point the turnover process begins, in which the picture is prepared for lab and color finishing, and the sound is &quot;spotted&quot; and turned over to the composer and sound designers for sound design, composing, and sound mixing.

==Processes==
Post-production consists of many different processes grouped under one name. These typically include:
* When content is shot on film it is typically transferred to video, DPX, OpenEXR with a telecine or a more modern motion picture film scanner.
*Editing the content of the film or television program.
* Writing, recording and re-recording, and editing the soundtrack.
* Adding visual effects – mainly computer-generated imagery (CGI) which is then composited into the frame.
* Sound design, sound effects, ADR, Foley, and music, culminating in a process known as sound re-recording or mixing with professional audio equipment.
*Stereoscopic 3D conversion in the case of content that was shot in 2D which is scheduled to have a 3D release
*Color grading (and color correction) in a color suite.
*Subtitling, closed captioning, or dubbing.

The post-production phase of creating a film usually takes longer than the actual shooting of the film. It can take several months to complete, because it includes the complete editing, color correction, and the addition of music and sound. The process of editing a movie is also seen as the second directing, because through post-production it is possible to change the intention of the movie. 

Furthermore, through the use of color grading tools and the addition of music and sound, the atmosphere of the movie can be heavily influenced. For instance, a blue-tinted movie is associated with a cold atmosphere. The choice of music and sound increases the effect of the scenes shown to the audience.

==Television==
In television, the phases of post-production include: editing, video editing, color correction, assembly, sound editing, re-recording, animation and visual effects insertions, combining separately edited audio and video tracks back together and delivery for broadcast.

==Photography==

Professional post-producers usually apply a certain range of image editing operations to the raw image format provided by a photographer or an image bank. There is a range of proprietary and free and open-source software, running on a range of operating systems available to do this work.

The first of post-production usually requires loading the raw images into the post-production software. If there is more than one image, and they belong to a set, ideally post-producers try to equalize the images before loading them. After that, if necessary, the next step would be to cut the objects in the images with the Pen Tool for a perfect and clean cut. The next stage would be cleaning the image using tools such as the healing tool, clone tool, and patch tool.

The next stages depend on what the client ordered. If it is a photo montage, the post-producers would usually start assembling the different images into the final document, and start to integrate the images with the background.

In advertising, it usually requires assembling several images together in a photo composition.

Types of work usually done:
* Advertising that requires one background (as one or more images to assemble) and one or more models. (Usually, the most time-consuming, as often these are image bank images which do not have much quality, and they all have different light and color as they were not controlled by only one photographer in one set location)
* Product-photography that usually requires several images of the same object with different lights, and assembled together, to control light and unwanted reflections, or to assemble parts that would be difficult to get in one shot, such as a beer glass for beer advertising. (Sometimes to composite one image of a beer glass it requires four or five images: one for the base, one for the beer, one for the label, one for the foam, and one or more for splashing beer if that is desired)
* Fashion photography that usually requires heavy post-production for editorial or advertising

==Music==
Techniques used in music post-production include (short for compositing, or compiling the best portions of multiple takes into a single composite take), timing and pitch correction (perhaps through beat quantization), and adding effects. This process is typically referred to as mixing and can also involve equalization and adjusting the levels of each individual track to provide an optimal sound experience. Contrary to the name, post-production may occur at any point during the recording and production process.

<doc id="166858" wikidata="Q1035150" url="?curid=166858" title="Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons">
<text>Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, often shortened to Captain Scarlet, is a British science fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 for ITC Entertainment. It is the sixth Anderson series to be filmed using a form of electronic marionette puppetry dubbed &quot;Supermarionation&quot; combined with scale model special effects. Running to thirty-two 25-minute episodes, it was first broadcast on ITV regional franchises between 1967 and 1968 and has since aired in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

Set in 2068, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; presents a &quot;&quot; between Earth and the Mysterons, a race of Martians who possess partial control over matter. When a misunderstanding causes human astronauts to attack their city on Mars, the Mysterons swear revenge and launch reprisals against Earth. These are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. In the first episode, Spectrum agent Captain Scarlet acquires the Mysterons&#x27; self-healing power of &quot;retrometabolism&quot; and is rendered &quot;indestructible&quot;, being able to recover from injuries that would normally be fatal. Scarlet immediately becomes Spectrum&#x27;s top asset in its fight against the Mysterons.

&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, the eighth of the Andersons&#x27; ten puppet series, was preceded by &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and followed by &quot;Joe 90&quot; and &quot;The Secret Service&quot;. In terms of visual aesthetic, it marked a departure from earlier series in its use of puppets that were sculpted to realistic body proportions. Repeated several times in the UK, it has generated tie-ins ranging from toy cars and action figures to audio plays and novels, as well as strips in the weekly children&#x27;s comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot;.

Compared to earlier Anderson productions, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; is widely regarded as &quot;darker&quot; in tone and less suited to children because of its violent content, as well as its themes of alien aggression and interplanetary war. The change in puppet design has divided opinion and the decision to make the protagonist &quot;indestructible&quot; has been brought into question. The series has been praised for its use of a multinational, multiethnic puppet cast and depiction of a utopian future Earth. A computer-animated remake, &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;, first aired in 2005.
==Plot==

The series begins in 2068. In the first episode, the crew of the &quot;Zero-X&quot; spacecraft are investigating the surface of Mars after mysterious radio signals are found to be coming from the planet. The source is discovered to be an alien city, which the astronauts destroy in a missile attack after mistaking a surveillance device for a weapon. The city&#x27;s inhabitants, the Mysterons, are a collective of sentient computers that possess partial control over matter and communicate in a deep, echoing voice. After using their power of &quot;reversing matter&quot; to rebuild their city, they vow revenge for humanity&#x27;s unwarranted aggression and declare war on Earth.

Reversing matter, also called &quot;retrometabolism&quot;, enables the Mysterons to re-create people and objects as facsimiles that they can control. They use it to wage a &quot;&quot; against Earth, issuing threats against specific targets (from world leaders and military installations to whole cities and continents) and then destroying and reconstructing whatever instruments are needed (whether humans or objects) to carry out their plans. The Mysterons&#x27; presence is indicated by twin circles of green light that they project onto scenes of destruction and reconstruction. Although the Mysterons are able to influence events from Mars, their actions on Earth are usually performed by their replicated intermediaries.

&quot;Zero-X&quot; mission leader Captain Black becomes the Mysterons&#x27; primary agent when they seize control of his mind. Prior to the events of the series, Black was an officer in Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation that mobilises all its resources to counter the Mysteron threat. Spectrum&#x27;s senior agents hold military ranks and colour codenames. They are posted to the organisation&#x27;s headquarters, Cloudbase—an airborne aircraft carrier stationed above the Earth&#x27;s surface—where they answer to its commander-in-chief, Colonel White. Cloudbase is defended by Angel Interceptor fighters flown by an all-female team of pilots led by Destiny Angel. The base&#x27;s computer systems are controlled by White&#x27;s assistant, Lieutenant Green. Spectrum also incorporates a fleet of armoured Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPVs), which are hidden in secret locations around the world, as well as patrol cars, maximum-security transports, passenger jet aircraft and machine gun-equipped helicopters.

Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum&#x27;s top asset in its fight against the Mysterons following the events of the first episode, in which the Mysterons attempt to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The Mysterons engineer a road accident that kills the original Scarlet and replace him with a reconstruction. After being shot by Captain Blue and falling to its death from the top of a tower, the reconstruction returns to life with the consciousness of the original Scarlet restored, and is thereafter free of Mysteron control. With his new Mysteron body, Scarlet possesses two extraordinary abilities: he can sense other reconstructions nearby; and if he is injured or killed, his retrometabolism restores him to full health, making him virtually &quot;indestructible&quot;. As hostilities with Mars continue, Scarlet repeatedly sacrifices himself to thwart the Mysterons, secure in the knowledge that he will return to face them again.

Over the course of the series, it is found that Mysteron reconstructions are particularly vulnerable to electricity and can be identified through X-rays, which cannot penetrate their alien biology. These discoveries allow Spectrum to develop two anti-Mysteron devices, the Mysteron Gun and Mysteron Detector. A three-episode story arc focuses on the discovery of a Mysteron outpost on the Moon, its destruction by Spectrum, and Spectrum&#x27;s efforts to negotiate with the Mysterons after converting the base&#x27;s power source into an interplanetary communication device. A failed attempt to survey Mars from space, aborted military conferences and the sabotaged construction of a new Earth space fleet prevent Spectrum from taking the fight to the Mysterons, and the organisation twice fails to capture Captain Black. In the penultimate episode, the Mysterons destroy Cloudbase itself, but this is revealed to be a nightmare dreamt by one of the Angels. The final episode is a clip show that leaves the conflict between Earth and Mars unresolved.

==Production==
===Development===

When efforts to secure a US network broadcast of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; fell through in July 1966, Lew Grade, the owner of AP Films (APF), capped &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; Series Two at six episodes and cancelled the production. Having overseen APF&#x27;s work since the making of &quot;Supercar&quot; in 1960, Grade was keen for Supermarionation to penetrate the lucrative American market and believed that a new concept would stand a better chance of landing a network sale than a second series of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Gerry Anderson was therefore required to come up with an idea for a new series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero is unexpectedly murdered partway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now returning to this idea, Anderson realised that a major selling point could be a character who is killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the start of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war between Earth and its neighbour and a security organisation being called on to defend humanity. After further thought, Anderson decided that &quot;Scarlet&quot; would be a suitably unusual name for the organisation&#x27;s &quot;indestructible&quot; top agent, while his partner could be called &quot;Blue&quot;. From this, Anderson resolved that all the personnel would have colour codenames and the organisation would be called &quot;Spectrum&quot;. Aware that white light is composed of—and can be broken down into—the colours of the spectrum, he named Spectrum&#x27;s leader Colonel White.
Intrigued by the phrase &quot;life as we know it&quot;, Anderson wanted to set his enemy aliens apart from the conventional extraterrestrials of 1960s TV and film. Therefore, while devising the Mysterons, he worked from a basis of &quot;life as we &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; know it&quot;, making the aliens a collective of sentient computers rather than organic life forms (though their exact nature is not explicitly stated in the series itself). The intention was that the original Mysterons were extragalactic beings that established a base on Mars in the distant past. In the early 20th century they abandoned the planet, leaving their computers behind.

Anderson&#x27;s memories of the Second World War provided inspiration for a number of design aspects. For example, he remembered that during the Battle of Britain, RAF pilots had struggled to counter German attacks quickly, because having to take off from the ground meant that it took a long time to intercept the enemy. He therefore made Spectrum&#x27;s headquarters, Cloudbase, an airborne aircraft carrier. According to Anderson, the Mysteron rings were inspired by a TV advertisement for wool that featured the Woolmark logo being projected onto a woman.

With &quot;The Mysterons&quot; as their working title, the Andersons wrote a pilot script in August 1966. This differed significantly from the completed first episode. It had been conceived that Scarlet&#x27;s Mysteron reconstruction would be resurrected using an advanced computer, after which he would no longer be truly flesh and blood but a &quot;mechanical man&quot; akin to an android. Another plan, also dropped, was for each episode to feature a &quot;guest star&quot; puppet voiced by a famous actor: the World President, for example, was intended to be voiced by Patrick McGoohan.

With Gerry Anderson serving primarily as executive producer, most of the writing was done by Tony Barwick, who had written for &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Initially &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;″s script editor, Barwick went on to author 18 episodes himself while substantially revising other writers&#x27; work. Discussing his writing in a 1986 interview, Barwick compared the premise and characters of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; to those of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;—for example, likening Spectrum to International Rescue, and the character of Captain Black to recurring &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; villain The Hood.

===Casting and characters===

&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; had the largest regular character voice cast of any Supermarionation production. Its use of a British protagonist was a departure from earlier series like &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, whose lead characters had been written as Americans to increase their appeal to the profitable US market. Stephen La Rivière suggests that the producers had been encouraged to give greater prominence to British characters following the transatlantic success of UK series like &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Baron&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;, which had made it &quot;altogether more acceptable to have English lead characters&quot;. Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett argue that the voice acting in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was less exaggerated than before, relating this to the puppets&#x27; transition to realistic proportions. According to Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, the proliferation of British accents from &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; to &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; changed the sound of Supermarionation and its impression on the viewer.

Francis Matthews, who supplied the voice of Captain Scarlet, had turned down offers to voice characters in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. According to Matthews, Gerry Anderson went to great lengths to cast him after being impressed by his imitation of Cary Grant in a radio programme, and the actor did indeed model the voice of Scarlet on Grant&#x27;s Anglo-American accent. Anderson, however, stated in his biography that the Grant impression was Matthews&#x27; choice at audition, and while it was not the kind of voice he had in mind, he was happy for Matthews to use it.

Matthews&#x27; co-star in the film &quot;&quot; (1966) had been Bud Tingwell, who was chosen to voice Cloudbase medical officer Dr Fawn. Tingwell, who had provided voices for &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; Series Two and &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, had been recommended by fellow Australian Ray Barrett, a regular voice artist on &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Due to theatre commitments, Tingwell left the series following the completion of the first 12 episodes. Also departing at that time was Paul Maxwell, the voice of Captain Grey (and previously Steve Zodiac in &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; and Captain Travers in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;), who left to take up the role of Steve Tanner in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In Tingwell and Maxwell&#x27;s absence, Fawn and Grey&#x27;s roles were reduced to a handful of non-speaking appearances, though guest characters voiced by the two actors can be heard in flashbacks to earlier episodes.

Cy Grant, the voice of Lieutenant Green, had been known to the Andersons for his appearances on &quot;Tonight&quot;, in which he sang calypsos inspired by current affairs. The casting of Grant led to that of Ed Bishop as Captain Blue. Bishop, who was working in theatre and had the same agent as Grant, recalled in an interview: &quot;And [my agent&#x27;s representative] said, &#x27;Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we&#x27;ve just taken on a new, young American actor&#x27;—shows you how long ago it was—&#x27;a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop. And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?&#x27;&quot;

Donald Gray, who had been typecast after playing Detective Mark Saber in &quot;The Vise&quot;, was resorting to voice work to sustain his acting career. He had three regular roles in &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;: Colonel White, the Mysterons and Captain Black (who, after being taken over by the Mysterons, speaks in their voice). The deep, echoing tones of Black and the Mysterons were created by recording Gray&#x27;s lines at high speed and then playing them back at normal speed. However, this was not always applied consistently, causing the pitch of the Mysteron voice to differ in some episodes.

The voice of Captain Ochre was provided by Jeremy Wilkin, who had voiced Virgil Tracy in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; Series Two. Captain Magenta was voiced by Gary Files, who had played supporting voices in &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;. Liz Morgan, who was new to the Anderson productions, voiced Destiny and Rhapsody Angels. Sylvia Anderson, the voice of Lady Penelope in &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; took the role of Melody Angel, while Canadian actress Janna Hill voiced Symphony. Morgan was additionally cast as Harmony Angel and voiced the character in five episodes. About a third of the way through the dialogue recording sessions, the role was transferred to Chinese actress Lian-Shin, who voiced the character in only one episode (&quot;The Launching&quot;) but was credited for 20 episodes.

Supporting character voices were performed by Anderson, Files, Hill, Maxwell, Morgan, Tingwell and Wilkin. Completing the credited cast were David Healy and Martin King. Shane Rimmer, previously heard as Scott Tracy in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, made several uncredited voice contributions in addition to writing for the series. Neil McCallum voiced guest characters in four episodes but was also uncredited. After &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, six members of the voice cast continued their association with the Andersons. Healy voiced Shane Weston in &quot;Joe 90&quot; and Files voiced Matthew Harding in &quot;The Secret Service&quot;. Wilkin, Morgan and King all had various supporting roles in these two series. Bishop later played Commander Ed Straker in &quot;UFO&quot;, the Andersons&#x27; first live-action series.

Character dialogue was recorded once a fortnight, with the cast working through up to four episodes per session, at the Anvil Films Recording Studio (now Denham Film Studios) in Buckinghamshire. Each actor was paid 15 guineas (15 pounds and 15 shillings; ) per episode, plus repeat fees, no matter how many lines he or she spoke. As the actors were not given the opportunity to tour the puppet studios until their work was finished, they had no visualisation of their characters during the dialogue recording. This was to Morgan&#x27;s regret: &quot;We all said that we wished we had seen the puppets before doing the dialogue, as it would have been helpful to have something physical to base the voices on. I knew that Destiny was French and that Rhapsody had to be frightfully &#x27;Sloaney&#x27;, but that was about it.&quot;

===Design and effects===
The scale model-making and special effects were handled by a separate unit headed by effects director Derek Meddings. It comprised two full-time crews and a &quot;second unit&quot; responsible for shots depicting flying aircraft. One of the series&#x27; technical innovations was that the noses of miniature vehicles would now &quot;dip&quot; as they came to a stop, to imitate the sudden application of brakes on a life-sized vehicle. The vehicles were designed by Meddings or his assistant Mike Trim. The former created Cloudbase, the SPV and the Angel fighter (the last of these during a flight to New York), while the latter produced many of the series&#x27; minor vehicles. The Cloudbase filming model proved too heavy to be suspended on wires, so was mounted on a pole instead. Some of Trim&#x27;s creations, such as the Spectrum Patrol Car, were originally meant to appear in only one episode, but proved to be so popular with the producers that they became regular features. As production continued, Trim&#x27;s responsibilities grew as Meddings devoted more of his time to &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;.

====Puppet design====

Supermarionation—a technique by which puppets&#x27; mouth movements were electronically synchronised with recorded dialogue—was first employed during the production of &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot; in 1960. On all the Anderson series prior to &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, the solenoid that powered the automatic mouth movements had been housed in the cranium, which caused the puppets&#x27; heads to appear disproportionately large compared to the rest of their bodies. Upsizing the bodies to match the heads would not have been practical, as the puppets would have become too heavy to operate effectively and it would have meant having to enlarge all the sets as well. The oversized heads gave the puppets a caricatured look that frustrated Gerry Anderson, who wanted the design to use natural body proportions. Before the pre-production of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, producers Reg Hill and John Read created a new type of puppet with the solenoid built into the chest, enabling the heads to be reduced to a realistic size.

After being sculpted in Plasticine, the puppet heads were moulded on a silicone rubber base and finished in fibreglass. At heights ranging from (approximately one-third life size), the new generation of puppets were no taller or shorter than their predecessors. As in earlier series, the main characters were given interchangeable heads with a range of expressions; these included &quot;smiler&quot;, &quot;frowner&quot; and &quot;blinker&quot; heads. Because episodes would be filmed in pairs on separate stages, the &quot;expressionless&quot; versions were made in duplicate. The costumes were designed by Sylvia Anderson, who drew inspiration from the work of Pierre Cardin (in particular, his 1966 &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; collection) when devising the Spectrum uniforms.

Despite their realistic form, the new puppets were even harder to animate on set, ironically making the design &quot;less&quot; life-like than Gerry Anderson had intended. The switch to accurate proportions upset the puppets&#x27; weight distribution. When standing, they often had to be held in place with clamps and tape to prevent them from wobbling. The smaller heads made it harder to obtain close-ups. Additionally, as most of the wires were headmounted, the smaller head size reduced the puppeteers&#x27; control, making movements jerkier. To limit the amount of movement required, characters were often shown sitting at moving desks or standing on moving walkways. For example, Colonel White has a rotating desk and Lieutenant Green operates the Cloudbase computer from a sliding chair. Puppeteer Jan King commented:

The &quot;under-controlled&quot; puppets described by King had no wires and were manipulated from the waist. One advantage of this method was that a puppet could pass through a doorway without necessitating a break in the shot. For scenes with characters sitting in aircraft cockpits, the crew built variations on the under-controlled design that comprised only a head and torso. These were operated using levers and wires located underneath the set.

Scarlet&#x27;s appearance has been compared to that of his voice actor, Francis Matthews, as well as Roger Moore. Ed Bishop, the voice of Captain Blue, believed that the character was modelled on him. However, sculptor Terry Curtis said that he used himself as the template and simply added a blond wig when he learnt that Bishop was to voice the character. A &quot;James Bond&quot; fan, Curtis based Captain Grey on Sean Connery and Destiny Angel on Ursula Andress, Connery&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Dr No&quot; (1962). Lieutenant Green was modelled on Cy Grant, who voiced the character; Rhapsody Angel on Jean Shrimpton; Melody Angel on Eartha Kitt; and Harmony Angel on Tsai Chin.

On earlier series, guest characters had been sculpted and re-sculpted in clay episode by episode. For &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;, these roles were played by a &quot;repertory company&quot; of over 50 permanent puppets that were made to the same standards of workmanship as the main characters. Called &quot;revamps&quot;, these puppets were superficially altered for each new role by changing the colours or styles of their wigs, or adding or removing facial hair or eyeglasses. Puppets from &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; appeared in supporting roles in the last two Supermarionation series, &quot;Joe 90&quot; and &quot;The Secret Service&quot;.

=====Response to puppets=====

The redesigned puppets have attracted a mixed response from crew members and commentators. Some of the crew believed that the new marionettes lacked the charm of the previous generation due to the accurate proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane recalled that when he first saw the prototype, &quot;it was as if there was a little dead person in [the box] ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd.&quot; Sculptor John Brown remembered putting the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and gauging his colleagues&#x27; reactions: &quot;When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn&#x27;t like it, some did.&quot; It has been argued that facial expression was sacrificed to make the overall appearance more realistic. Curtis recalls:

Fellow sculptor John Blundall called the new design &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He criticised attempts to make the puppets appear more life-like, reasoning that &quot;we always try to do with puppets what you can&#x27;t do with humans.&quot; He suggested that the move from caricature to realism came at the expense of &quot;character and personality&quot;, arguing that &quot;if the puppet appears completely natural, the audience no longer has to use its imagination.&quot; Effects director Derek Meddings thought that while the new puppets made &quot;very convincing miniature people&quot;, they were flawed because viewers &quot;couldn&#x27;t identify one from the other. The heads were so small they didn&#x27;t have any character to their faces.&quot; From a practical perspective, supervising puppeteer Christine Glanville considered the puppets &quot;awful&quot;, remembering that their smaller, lighter heads would not move smoothly: &quot;If you wanted them to turn their heads, then more often than not there would be someone out of shot, with their fingers just above the puppet&#x27;s head, actually turning it round.&quot;

Anderson said that he pushed for the new design to satisfy the audience, regarding it not as &quot;a case of moving to a new technique, but more a case of incorporating new ideas with existing methods.&quot; In later years he expressed doubts about the wisdom of the redesign: &quot;[T]he problem was that exact and precise movements became more vital than ever and that caused us terrible difficulties.&quot;

The new design has been well received by Vincent Terrace, Jeff Evans and John Peel. Praising the transfer of the electronics from the heads to the bodies, Evans describes the puppets as &quot;perfect in proportion&quot;. Peel argues that the increased realism would not have put off audiences familiar with the earlier design. A contrary view is held by Daniel O&#x27;Brien, who states that the loss of the puppets&#x27; &quot;idiosyncratic character&quot; reduced them to the level of &quot;deluxe Action Men&quot;. Commenting on the costume design, Mark Bould praises the series&#x27; &quot;commitment to fashion&quot; and especially commends the design of the Angel uniforms.

====Opening and closing titles====

All episodes, except the first, have two title sequences. The first of these, incorporating the title card and principal production credits, is set in a run-down alleyway and presented from the point of view of an unseen gunman. Turning a corner, he comes face to face with Captain Scarlet and opens fire, only to be shot dead by a single round from Scarlet&#x27;s handgun. The words &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; appear letter by letter in time with the seven strikes of the series&#x27; signature drumbeat composed by Barry Gray. This sequence is intended to demonstrate Scarlet&#x27;s indestructibility, the bullets from the assassin&#x27;s machine gun having no effect on the captain. The sequence is accompanied by a voiceover from Ed Bishop stating:

A number of variations have been used. In the first episode, the voiceover runs:


An alternative version, rarely used, runs: &quot;One man. A man who is different. Chosen by fate. Caught up in Earth&#x27;s unwanted conflict with the Mysterons. Determined. Courageous. Indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.&quot; Later prints feature an additional voiceover by Donald Gray, warning the audience: &quot;Captain Scarlet is indestructible. You are not. Remember this. Do not try to imitate him.&quot; This served to establish the background to the series and warn younger viewers not to put themselves at risk by copying Scarlet&#x27;s actions. It was used either on its own or following the &quot;One man ...&quot; voiceover.

From the second episode, &quot;Winged Assassin&quot;, the opening scenes are followed by a secondary title sequence introducing Captain Blue, Colonel White, the Angels and Captain Black. As the Mysterons announce their latest threat against Earth, the Mysteron rings pass over the characters in various environments, demonstrating the aliens&#x27; omnipresence. At the same time, the characters&#x27; codenames are flashed on-screen. The Mysterons invariably begin their threats with the words: &quot;This is the voice of the Mysterons. We know that you can hear us, Earthmen.&quot;

The closing titles were originally intended to show images of printed circuit boards and other electronic components to reflect the early concept of Scarlet being a &quot;mechanical man&quot;. In the completed sequence, these are replaced with paintings depicting Scarlet in various moments of peril. The paintings were created by comics artist Ron Embleton, who would later illustrate the adult comic strips &quot;Oh, Wicked Wanda!&quot; and &quot;Sweet Chastity&quot; for &quot;Penthouse&quot;. In 2005, the Animation Art Gallery in London released limited-edition prints of the paintings signed by Francis Matthews.

In Japan, the original opening titles were replaced with a montage of action clips from various episodes accompanied by an upbeat song performed by children. This version is included in the special features of the &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; DVD box set.

===Filming===
The first episode, &quot;The Mysterons&quot;, began filming on 2 January 1967 after two months&#x27; pre-production. The budget for the series was set at £1.5 million (about £ million in ). At an average cost of £46,000 per episode, or £2,000 per minute, it was the most expensive Anderson production to date. The previous month, APF had been renamed &quot;Century 21 Productions&quot;.

By the time &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; entered production, many of the directors on earlier Anderson series—including Alan Pattillo, David Elliott and David Lane—had either left the company or were committed to &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;. Although Lane, Brian Burgess and Desmond Saunders reprised directorial duties for at least one episode each, the Andersons were forced to promote some of the junior production personnel to replace the outgoing directors. Among these were camera operator Alan Perry and art assistant Ken Turner. Other directors were recruited from outside the company; one of them was Robert Lynn, who had been an assistant director on feature films. After directing the first episode himself, Saunders stayed with the production as its &quot;supervising director&quot; to guide the new recruits.

&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was filmed in a set of converted factory units on the Slough Trading Estate, which had served as Century 21&#x27;s studios since the making of &quot;Stingray&quot; in 1964. Continuing a practice begun on earlier series, episodes were filmed in pairs on separate stages to speed up production. Filming overlapped with the &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; shoot, which was being conducted on a different stage. Production design duties were split between Keith Wilson and John Lageu, the latter being responsible for the technical elements of the sets. The Mysteron rings were created by panning a transparency of two green circles using a slide projector, a technique suggested by producer Reg Hill.

When the series started airing in September 1967, principal photography had been completed on the first 20 episodes. The puppet footage for each episode usually took two weeks, or 11 working days, to shoot. Although filming of the series was scheduled to take eight months, the demands of the &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; shoot caused it to overrun, finally concluding in November 1967.

===Music===
The music for &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was composed by Barry Gray, who had scored all prior Supermarionation series. The opening theme—&quot;The Mysterons&quot;—was produced electronically and accompanied by a seven-note staccato drumbeat introducing Scarlet. Gerry Anderson, who had intended this to be more like a traditional fanfare, said of his initial response: &quot;I thought, &#x27;Christ, is this all he could produce?&#x27; Looking back on it, however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well.&quot; The drumbeat had two other functions: to cut from one scene to another, with the shot alternating between the previous scene and the next in time with each beat; and to cut into and out of each episode&#x27;s midpoint advert break, where it was accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo.

Two versions of the ending theme—&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;—were recorded. The first version, used on the first 14 episodes, is entirely instrumental except for the lyrics &quot;Captain Scarlet!&quot;, repeated at intervals by a vocalist ensemble including Ken Barrie. Each instance is followed by a vocoded repetition supplied by Gray himself, the final two forming a ternary with the word &quot;Indestructible!&quot;. The instrumental was later reworked as a song with lyrics performed by The Spectrum, a London boy band who shared their name with the fictional organisation. Formed in 1960 and signed to RCA Victor, the group were being promoted as a British imitation of The Monkees. They were brought to the Andersons&#x27; attention by Gerry&#x27;s chauffeur, who had heard them on the radio, and signed a contract with Century 21 worth £100,000. At their early concerts in 1977, Siouxsie and the Banshees performed a spoof of the ending theme with extra lyrics mocking Scarlet.

Between March and December 1967, Gray also recorded incidental music for 18 episodes. The remaining 14 re-used these scores, supplemented by cues produced for earlier Anderson series. Compared to &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the incidental music for &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was recorded with smaller ensembles: no episode features more than 16 instruments.

In their notes on the CD release, Ralph Titterton and Tim Mallett write that the &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; soundtrack has a &quot;military feel&quot; that favours percussion, brass and wind instruments, in contrast with the full orchestral sound of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Gray preferred traditional instruments for much of the action, limiting electronic music to scenes set in outer space and an echoing four-note motif that serves to identify the Mysterons. Scarlet&#x27;s motif, featured in incidental music as well as both versions of the ending theme, is a variation emphasising the captain&#x27;s nature as an ex-Mysteron. Gray performed some of the series&#x27; electronic music himself.

====Commercial releases====
In 1967, Century 21 Records released an extended play titled &quot;TV Themes from Captain Scarlet&quot;, which included commercial re-recordings of the series&#x27; opening and closing themes. The soundtrack has since had two CD releases: the first by Silva Screen Records; the second by Fanderson, the official Gerry Anderson fan club. Fanderson&#x27;s version was available exclusively to club members and contained music from every episode except &quot;The Heart of New York&quot; and &quot;Treble Cross&quot; (which contain no original music) and &quot;Traitor&quot; (whose cue recordings are lost). The tracks from each release are listed below.

Reviewing the 2003 soundtrack, Bruce Eder of AllMusic describes the collection of theme and incidental music as &quot;a strange mix of otherworldly &#x27;music of the spheres&#x27;, late–50s/early–60s &#x27;space-age pop&#x27;, &#x27;British Invasion&#x27; beat, Scottish folk-inspired tunes, kids-style &#x27;Mickey Mouse&#x27; scoring, martial music, light jazz, and light classical&quot;. He singles out the two versions of &quot;White as Snow&quot; from the episode of the same name, &quot;Cocktail Music&quot; from the episode &quot;Model Spy&quot; and a piano piece from &quot;The Inquisition&quot; (which Gray performed himself) for special praise. In his BBC Online review, Peter Marsh suggests that the grimness of the music reflects the series&#x27; use of realistic puppets and its presentation of death, as well as its alien villains and lack of humour. He comments that &quot;dissonant vibraphone chords shimmer under hovering, tremulous strings contrasted with urgent, militaristic drums and pulsing brass—driving the action ever onto its climax (and, no doubt, a big explosion).&quot;

===Broadcast history===
&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; had its official UK premiere on 29 September 1967 on the ATV Midlands franchise of the ITV network. The first episode was seen by an estimated 450,000 viewers, a figure considered promising. Exactly five months earlier, this episode had been broadcast in the London area as an unscheduled late-night test transmission. The series officially debuted in London and Scotland on 1 October, with the Granada, Anglia, Channel, Southern and Westward franchises following later that month. By the end of 1967, 4.95 million UK households—equivalent to 10.9 million people—were watching the series. In the Midlands, viewing figures had risen to 1.1 million halfway through the run.

By the start of 1968, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was being broadcast in all parts of the UK. The series would go on to be shown in more than 40 other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. In the United States, it aired in first-run syndication. Only six episodes were shown in the Netherlands.

UK re-runs varied by franchise. Granada, Harlech and Tyne Tees Television repeated the series until 1972, while in the Midlands, it aired four times in colour between 1969 and 1974. By contrast, Yorkshire Television did not run it again until the 1980s, by which time various ITV franchises were still repeating the series on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The series was later shown in segmented form on Night Network.

&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was subsequently acquired by the BBC, which on 1 October 1993 began the series&#x27; first networked (UK-wide) run on BBC2. The first episode achieved viewing figures of four million, the channel&#x27;s third-largest audience that week. In September 2001, the BBC began repeating the series in digitally-remastered form. Following the September 11 attacks, the episode order was changed: &quot;Winged Assassin&quot; (in which the Mysterons destroy an airliner) and &quot;Big Ben Strikes Again&quot; (in which they hi-jack a nuclear device), were postponed due to perceived similarities between the plots and real-world events. These episodes were eventually broadcast in November and December 2001.

In June 2024, UK channel Talking Pictures TV started a repeat run on Saturday afternoons. The same month, MeTV Toons in the US began airing various Anderson series, including &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. 

===Home video===
The series&#x27; first VHS release in the UK was by Precision Video in 1982. Precision was later acquired by Channel 5 Video (a partnership of PolyGram and Heron International), which issued further &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; volumes during the 1980s. Between 2001 and 2002, Carlton Video re-released the series both in volumes and as a box set. These featured the remastered picture and sound quality that had been introduced for the 2000s repeats. The box set included an extra tape containing a behind-the-scenes feature, &quot;Captain Scarlet: The Indestructible&quot;.

Since September 2001, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; has also been available on Region 2 DVD in both its original mono soundtrack and new Dolby Digital surround sound. Bonus features include audio commentaries by Gerry Anderson on two episodes, &quot;The Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Attack on Cloudbase&quot;. As with the VHS versions, the DVDs have also been released as a box set; this includes an extra disc featuring a production documentary, &quot;Captain Scarlet S.I.G.&quot;, along with a set of five alternative title sequences. A Region 1 box set by A&amp;E Home Video was released in 2002. In 2004, Imavision released a French-language box set for the Canadian market.

In 2017, the series&#x27; 50th anniversary year, UK company Network Distributing announced that it was releasing &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; on Blu-ray Disc with all episodes remastered in high definition using the original 35 mm film negatives. The Blu-rays were released between 2017 and 2018, both in volumes and as a box set.

==Reception==
Given Grade&#x27;s surprise cancellation of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, Gerry Anderson had little hope of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; running for more than one series. According to Anderson: &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect it to continue. I simply went to Lew and asked, &#x27;What&#x27;s the next thing you want us to do?

&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; is widely regarded as &quot;darker&quot; or more &quot;mature&quot; in tone than earlier Supermarionation productions. According to Andrew Billen: &quot;Whereas &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; was about rescuing people, &quot;Scarlet&quot; was about damnation, the soul of a resurrected man being fought for between Captain Scarlet and the equally indestructible Captain Black. It was Anderson&#x27;s Gothic period.&quot; Marcus Hearn comments that the series has a &quot;militaristic&quot; feel, with less emphasis on &quot;characterisation and charm&quot; than before. For Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, the optimism of &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; is noticeably absent, with heroism and unqualified victories replaced by desperate games of &quot;damage limitation&quot; as Scarlet and Spectrum rush to counter every Mysteron move, sometimes unsuccessfully. The series&#x27; presentation of death and destruction has prompted questions about its suitability for younger viewers: media historian Daniel O&#x27;Brien notes that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; is &quot;rated by some as the most violently destructive children&#x27;s show ever&quot;. The horror of the Mysterons has been recognised: in 2003, the aliens&#x27; depiction was ranked 82nd in the Channel 4 list show &quot;100 Greatest Scary Moments&quot;.

Commentators have drawn parallels between &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and the state of international relations in the 1960s. According to Robert Sellers, the series arose from contemporary &quot;sci-fi obsession with alien forces infiltrating society&quot;, influenced by fears about the Cold War and communism. Nicholas J. Cull writes that the &quot;war of nerves&quot; between Earth and Mars echoed real-world geopolitical conflict, while the &quot;enemy within&quot; scenario of Martians taking over humans was derived from films like &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956). Mark Bould argues that the series &quot;seemed in tune with a decade of civil disobedience and anti-imperialist guerrilla wars&quot;—a view echoed by Rebecca Feasey of the University of Edinburgh, who regards it as one of several that &quot;exploited the fears of 1960s America&quot; through its portrayal of &quot;civil disobedience and the potentially negative impact of new technologies&quot;. Since 2001, comparisons have been made to the September 11 attacks and War on Terror. Sangster and Condon state that for the 1960s, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was &quot;incredibly perceptive&quot; in its portrayal of the Mysterons, whose tactics they liken to terrorism.

To others, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; remains a &quot;camp classic&quot;. According to Bould, it is one of several Anderson productions that depict a &quot;utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity.&quot; He adds that the series espouses &quot;Euro-cool consumerism&quot;. The concept of a world government, a recurring concept in Supermarionation productions, was influenced by Anderson: &quot;I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future ... we had the United Nations and I imagined that the world would come together and there would be a world government.&quot; On the depiction of technology, Peter Wright notes the &quot;qualified technophilia&quot; that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; shares with &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

The series has been criticised for its &quot;static&quot; camerawork, the puppets&#x27; limited mobility making dynamic shots a rarity. Criticism has also been directed at the characterisation and writing. Sangster and Condon regard the plots as straightforward and the characters perhaps &quot;even more simplistic&quot; than those of &quot;Stingray&quot;. Some have blamed the return to 25-minute episodes, coming after &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;″ 50-minute format, for a lack of subplots and perceived drop in the quality of the storytelling. In a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; as &quot;hard-nosed stuff&quot; that lacked humour, adding: &quot;It was all for the American market and to that extent there was no deep characterisation. [The characters] all balanced one against the other.&quot; Sylvia Anderson likened the presentation to that of a &quot;comic strip&quot;, arguing that the action format came at the expense of the character development. In contrast, Jeff Evans considers the characters &quot;more detailed&quot; than before, arguing that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was the first Anderson production to give them &quot;private lives and real identities&quot;. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping praise the writing, judging it &quot;neither as silly as previous Anderson efforts, nor as po-faced as later ones&quot;.

Comparing it to &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, John Peel summarises &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; as &quot;better puppets, bigger action and a huge step backwards in stories&quot;, arguing that the superior special effects were to the detriment of the writing. He compares this to the relative failure of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; following the success of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;: &quot;[Gerry] Anderson made the same mistake that George Lucas made, assuming that if the effects were praised in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the public wanted a show with more effects.&quot; Peel also finds fault with Scarlet himself, arguing that an &quot;indestructible&quot; hero who risks his safety to thwart enemies was a poor role model for impressionable children and made the episode endings predictable. Sangster and Condon give a similar assessment, commenting that Scarlet&#x27;s abilities weaken the suspense and make him &quot;a difficult hero to believe in&quot;.

Considered a cult classic by some, &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; came 33rd in a 2007 &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll for best science fiction series of all time. It was ranked 51st in Channel 4&#x27;s list show &quot;100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV Shows&quot; (2001). Cornell, Day and Topping suggest that the series could be Gerry Anderson&#x27;s best production. Anderson&#x27;s own verdict was downbeat: &quot;Nothing was as successful as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; was very successful, but once you&#x27;ve had a smash hit, everything tends to look less successful in comparison.&quot;

===Race, gender and symbolism===
&quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; has received comment both positive and negative for its use of female and ethnic minority characters. This is an aspect which, according to O&#x27;Brien, gives the series a &quot;more cosmopolitan&quot; feel than &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Around the time of the 1993 repeats on BBC2, the series drew criticism for its use of the codenames &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; in reference to the benevolent Colonel White and the villainous Captain Black, which some commentators interpreted as a form of negative black-and-white dualism. Rejecting claims of racist stereotyping, Anderson pointed out that the series features heroic non-whites in the form of Lieutenant Green, Melody Angel and Harmony Angel. Green is the only black male regular character in any of the Supermarionation series.

For Sellers, the inclusion of Green and especially Melody Angel, a black female character, shows that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was &quot;actually ahead of its time in respect to race relations&quot;. He regards the Angels&#x27; all-female composition as significant from the perspective of women&#x27;s emancipation. O&#x27;Brien is less complimentary on the Angels, arguing that while they were progressive for the 1960s, to newer audiences they come across as a &quot;conventionally sexist male fantasy&quot;.

The characters&#x27; diversity in terms of race and gender has been highly regarded in academic publications. Bould praises the &quot;beautiful, multiethnic, female Angel fighter pilots&quot; and &quot;secondary roles played by capable women&quot;. In a 2003 interview, Anderson noted the efforts made to feature minorities: &quot;... I think people who make television programmes have a responsibility, particularly when children are watching avidly and you know their minds can be affected almost irreversibly as they grow up. We were very conscious of introducing different ethnic backgrounds.&quot;

Cy Grant, the voice of Green, believed that &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; had both positive multicultural value and an allegorical nature. He argued that religious symbolism was implied, with Colonel White serving as an analogue for God, Captain Black as the Devil and Scarlet as the Son of God. The allegory extended to Cloudbase, which represented Heaven and was guarded by a fleet of fighters called &quot;Angels&quot;. On dualism, he argued: &quot;The &#x27;darkness&#x27; of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift—the struggle of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27;—of the Western world as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and light are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift.&quot;

==Other media==
The ATV game show &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;, hosted by Bob Monkhouse, used &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; as the theme for its 1967 Christmas special. Broadcast live on 23 December, the programme featured guest appearances from Francis Matthews and The Spectrum.

Since its first run, the series has been supplemented by merchandise ranging from toy action figures to video games. Among the early tie-ins were a series of five audio plays published by Century 21 Records in 1967. Released on EP record, each play was approximately 21 minutes long and featured the voice cast from the TV series. Angus P. Allan wrote the first play, &quot;Introducing Captain Scarlet&quot; (set during the denouement of the first TV episode) as well as &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet of Spectrum&quot;. The other two—&quot;Captain Scarlet is Indestructible&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet versus Captain Black&quot;—were written by his assistant, Richard O&#x27;Neill. To mark &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;″s 50th anniversary in 2017, Big Finish Productions digitally remastered the plays and re-released them on CD. The seven-disc set also includes audio adaptations of eight of the TV episodes, narrated by Ed Bishop as Captain Blue.

During the 1960s, Century 21 granted more than 60 licences for &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; products and released a range of friction-drive model vehicles through its subsidiary Century 21 Toys. Meccano Ltd manufactured &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; Dinky Toys to great success: its SPV was its best-selling die-cast toy of all time and continued to be manufactured until 1976. Waddingtons released a &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; board game based on snakes and ladders. In 1993, Vivid Imaginations launched a new toy range to coincide with the BBC2 repeats.

===Books and comics===
Between 1967 and 1968, Armada Books published three &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; children&#x27;s novels by John William Jennison (who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;John Theydon&quot;): &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Silent Saboteur&quot; and &quot;The Angels and the Creeping Enemy&quot;. As implied by its title, the third novel features the Spectrum Angels as the main characters. In 1993, Young Corgi Books released children&#x27;s novelisations of &quot;The Mysterons&quot;, &quot;Lunarville 7&quot;, &quot;Noose of Ice&quot; and &quot;The Launching&quot;.

From September 1967, comic strips based on the series were printed in &quot;TV Century 21&quot; (later &quot;TV21&quot;), published by City Magazines in association with Century 21. The comic had already featured &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; strips as well as crossovers between the three, indicating that they were set in a shared fictional world of the 2060s. &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; was integrated into this setting. Elements of the new series, including Captain Black, had been introduced as early as June 1967. The initial &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; strips were drawn by Ron Embleton, who was succeeded first by Mike Noble and then by Jim Watson. Frank Bellamy drew five strips. After the TV series finished its original run, the comic continued the story of Spectrum and the Mysterons, with later adventures showing the Mysterons deactivating their city on Mars and relinquishing their control over Black. Scarlet, meanwhile, leaves Spectrum to combat Earth-bound threats. The Mysterons eventually reawaken, prompting Scarlet and Spectrum to resume their struggle. &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; also appeared in &quot;TV21&quot; and Century 21 annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969. In September 1969, it was dropped from &quot;TV21&quot;.

The series&#x27; &quot;TV21&quot; debut had been preceded by spin-off adventures in the sister comics &quot;Lady Penelope&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot;. In January 1967, &quot;Lady Penelope&quot; launched a comic strip about the Angel pilots; this introduced no elements of the Spectrum Organisation until August 1967. It eventually ran until May 1968. &quot;Solo&quot; printed two strips: the first from June to September 1967; the second, following a merger with City&#x27;s &quot;TV Tornado&quot;, from September 1967 to February 1968. The first, &quot;The Mark of the Mysterons&quot;, bore little relation to the series besides featuring the Mysterons as villains; it was set in the 1960s and the presentation was similar to that of &quot;The Invaders&quot;. The second, simply titled &quot;The Mysterons&quot;, had the aliens travel to the Andromeda Galaxy on a campaign of conquest.

After the series&#x27; discontinuation in Century 21 and City titles, Polystyle Publications printed further strips in &quot;Countdown&quot; comic and annuals in 1971 and 1972. From 1993 to 1994, Fleetway Editions published a &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; comic to coincide with the series&#x27; first run on BBC2. New annuals were published by Grandreams in 1993 and 1994 and by Carlton Books in 2001.

In Japan, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; serialised a manga adaptation of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; between 1967 and 1968. A separate adaptation was published in &quot;Shōnen Book&quot; from January to August 1968.

===Video games===
Between 2002 and 2006, three &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; video games were released. A further game was cancelled.

==Later productions==

Since the 1980s, the rights to the ITC catalogue have changed hands several times. They were first acquired by PolyGram Entertainment, then, following a partial sale to the BBC, by Carlton International. In 2004, Carlton merged with Granada to form ITV plc. The rights to &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; and other Anderson series now reside with the subsidiary company ITV Studios.

In the early 1980s, Robert Mandell and ITC New York combined several episodes of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; into two compilation films: &quot;Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet vs. the Mysterons&quot;. Promoted as &quot;Super Space Theater&quot;, these were broadcast on US cable TV in the aim of reviving syndication sales. Other Anderson productions, including &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, received similar treatments. Released on British VHS in January 1982, &quot;Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars&quot; was &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;″s UK home video debut. In November 1988, it aired as the second episode of the movie-mocking series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; on Minnesota TV station KTMA.

Plans for a live-action film adaptation, announced by Gerry Anderson in 2000 and 2002, remain undeveloped.

===Remake===
In 1999, Anderson supervised the production of a computer-animated test film, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons&quot;, to explore the possibility of updating some of his 1960s puppet series for a 21st-century audience. Produced by the Moving Picture Company under the working title &quot;Captain ScarletThe New Millennium&quot;, the four-minute film was made using a combination of Maya animation software and motion capture technology. Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprised the voices of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Set a few years after the Mysterons end hostilities against Earth, the film features the return of Captain Black, setting the stage for a revival of the war with Mars. The film was screened at a Fanderson convention in 2000 and a science lecture in 2001. It was released on Blu-ray in 2017.

Plans for a full computer-animated &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; series eventually resulted in &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot;. A reboot of the original, this was first broadcast on the ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;Ministry of Mayhem&quot; in 2005. In a nod to Supermarionation, the animation used to make the series was promoted as &quot;Hypermarionation&quot;. &quot;New Captain Scarlet&quot; was the last TV series to be produced by Anderson, who died in 2012.

<text>The Upper Goyt Valley is the southern section of the valley of the River Goyt in North West England.

== Position ==
The source of the Goyt River is on Axe Edge Moor above Goyt&#x27;s Moss to the south. The western side of the valley is a long ridge, running from Shining Tor to Windgather Rocks, which forms the county boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire; the boundary formerly followed the river itself. The eastern side of the valley rises to Burbage Edge, overlooking Buxton, and Combs Moss.

The old stone Derbyshire Bridge gets its name from it being at the historic boundary from Cheshire into Derbyshire. The road south out of the Goyt Valley is one-way and crosses the bridge.

== History ==
The Street Roman road runs alongside Errwood Reservoir and to the west of Fernilee Reservoir.

The disused Cromford and High Peak Railway line (which connected the High Peak canal at Whaley Bridge with the River Derwent in Cromford since 1831) runs along the east side of the reservoirs. This stretch of the railway line was closed in 1896. 

The Fernilee gunpowder mill operated in the valley from about 1800 at the site of Fernilee Reservoir. It was acquired in 1888 by Chilworth Gunpowder Company and expanded before closing in 1920, after numerous fatal accidents.

Errwood Hall was the Victorian mansion of the Grimshawe family, built in about 1840 but it is now in ruins. Below Foxlow Edge there is a Spanish shrine, built in 1889 in memory of Miss Dolores (a friend of the Grimshawe family). The shrine is a designated Grade II listed building.

A local legend tells that Pym Chair is the spot where a highway man called Pym robbed passers by on the packhorse route. However another story is that Pym was a preacher who gave sermons there.

=== Reservoirs ===
The valley floor is now dominated by two drinking-water reservoirs, fed by the River Goyt. Both reservoirs were built by the Stockport Corporation Waterworks (after they acquired the Grimshawe estate) to provide drinking water for Stockport town and the surrounding area. Fernilee Reservoir was completed in 1938 and the hamlet of Goyt&#x27;s Bridge and Errwood Hall were destroyed to prevent any pollution of the water. Errwood Reservoir was completed in 1967. A spectacular suspension bridge once crossed the river but it was demolished to make way for Errwood Reservoir. An old packhorse bridge was saved and reconstructed near Goytsclough Quarry. The reservoirs and much of the surrounding land is currently owned by United Utilities.

== Moorland ==
The open gritstone moorlands of the Upper Goyt Valley (Wild Moor, Goyt&#x27;s Moss, Burbage Edge, Shining Tor to Cats Tor ridge and Hop Moor) are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Heather is the main plant but the heathland is habitat for a variety of native grasses, rushes, sedges and shrubs including bilberry, crowberry, cowberry and cross-leaved heath. Hare’s-tail cottongrass and sphagnum moss are common along the Shining Tor ridge. The area is important for upland breeding birds including a large population of golden plover, as well as red grouse, curlew, lapwing, whinchat, snipe, twite, ring ouzel and merlin. Along Goyt’s Clough (by the River Goyt from Derbyshire Bridge down to Errwood Reservoir) there are common sandpiper and dipper and the old commoner woodland includes oak, birch, rowan and alder.

== Tourism ==
The valley has been a popular tourist destination since the 19th century.

Errwood Sailing Club operates at Errwood Reservoir.

The Peak District Boundary Walk from Buxton follows the disused railway line into the Valley from the south east, crosses the Errwood Dam and then tracks along the west side of the Fernilee reservoir.

There are two large car parks in the central valley at The Street and Errwood Hall. There are smaller car parks at Derbyshire Bridge to the south and at the northern end of Fernilee Reservoir. There are extensive footpaths through the valley.

<text>A sprachbund (, from , &#x27;language federation&#x27;), also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, or diffusion area, is a group of languages that share areal features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. The languages may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related, but the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. 

A grouping of languages that share features can only be defined as a sprachbund if the features are shared for some reason other than the genetic history of the languages. Without knowledge of the history of a regional group of similar languages, it may be difficult to determine whether sharing indicates a language family or a sprachbund.

==History==
In a 1904 paper, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship (&quot;rodstvo&quot;) and those arising from convergence due to language contact (&quot;srodstvo&quot;).

Nikolai Trubetzkoy introduced the Russian term ( &#x27;language union&#x27;) in a 1923 article.
In a paper presented to the first International Congress of Linguists in 1928, he used a German calque of this term, &quot;Sprachbund&quot;, defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax, morphological structure, cultural vocabulary and sound systems, but without systematic sound correspondences, shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary.

Later workers, starting with Trubetzkoy&#x27;s colleague Roman Jakobson,
have relaxed the requirement of similarities in all four of the areas stipulated by Trubetzkoy.

A rigorous set of principles for what evidence is valid for establishing a linguistic area has been presented by Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith-Stark.

==Examples==

===The Balkans===

The idea of areal convergence is commonly attributed to Jernej Kopitar&#x27;s description in 1830 of Albanian, Bulgarian and Romanian as giving the impression of (), which has been rendered by Victor Friedman as &quot;one grammar with three lexicons&quot;.

The Balkan Sprachbund comprises Albanian, Romanian, the South Slavic languages of the southern Balkans (Bulgarian, Macedonian and to a lesser degree Serbo-Croatian), Greek, Balkan Turkish, and Romani. 

All but one of these are Indo-European languages but from very divergent branches, and Turkish is a Turkic language. Yet they have exhibited several signs of grammatical convergence, such as avoidance of the infinitive, future tense formation, and others. 

The same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related, such as the other Romance languages in relation to Romanian, and the other Slavic languages such as Polish in relation to Bulgaro-Macedonian.

===Mainland Southeast Asia===
Languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area have such great surface similarity that early linguists tended to group them all into a single family, although the modern consensus places them into numerous unrelated families. The area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien (or Miao–Yao), Tai–Kadai, Austronesian (represented by Chamic) and Mon–Khmer families.

Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.
A well-known example is the similar tone systems in Sinitic languages (Sino-Tibetan), Hmong–Mien, Tai languages (Kadai) and Vietnamese (Austroasiatic). Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (but no tonal distinctions on checked syllables ending in a stop consonant), which was followed by a tone split where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled. These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until André-Georges Haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.

Similarly, the unrelated Khmer (Mon–Khmer), Cham (Austronesian) and Lao (Kadai) languages have almost identical vowel systems.
Many languages in the region are of the isolating (or analytic) type, with mostly monosyllabic morphemes and little use of inflection or affixes, though a number of Mon–Khmer languages have derivational morphology.
Shared syntactic features include classifiers, object–verb order and topic–comment structure, though in each case there are exceptions in branches of one or more families.

===Indian subcontinent===
In a classic 1956 paper titled &quot;India as a Linguistic Area&quot;, Murray Emeneau laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent&#x27;s Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were areal features, the result of diffusion during sustained contact. These include retroflex consonants, echo words, subject–object–verb word order, discourse markers, and the quotative.

Emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the Indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Munda and Tibeto-Burman. This concept provided scholarly substance for explaining the underlying Indian-ness of apparently divergent cultural and linguistic patterns. With his further contributions, this area has now become a major field of research in language contact and convergence.

===Northeast Asia===
Some linguists, such as Matthias Castrén, G. J. Ramstedt, Nicholas Poppe and Pentti Aalto, supported the idea that the Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic families of Asia (and some small parts of Europe) have a common ancestry, in a controversial group they call Altaic. Koreanic and Japonic languages, which are also hypothetically related according to some scholars like William George Aston, Shōsaburō Kanazawa, Samuel Martin and Sergei Starostin, are sometimes included as part of the purported Altaic family. This latter hypothesis was supported by people including Roy Andrew Miller, John C. Street and Karl Heinrich Menges. Gerard Clauson, Gerhard Doerfer, Juha Janhunen, Stefan Georg and others dispute or reject this. A common alternative explanation for similarities among the &quot;Altaic&quot; languages, such as vowel harmony and agglutination, is that they are due to areal diffusion.

The Qinghai–Gansu sprachbund, in the northeastern part of the Tibetan plateau spanning the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and Gansu, is an area of interaction between varieties of northwest Mandarin Chinese, Amdo Tibetan and Mongolic and Turkic languages.

===Western Europe===
&quot;Standard Average European&quot; (&quot;SAE&quot;) is a concept introduced in 1939 by Benjamin Whorf to group the modern Indo-European languages of Europe which shared common features. Whorf argued that these languages were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and grammar, vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins, idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities; in essence creating a continental . His point was to argue that the disproportionate degree of knowledge of SAE languages biased linguists towards considering grammatical forms to be highly natural or even universal, when in fact they were only peculiar to the SAE language group.

Whorf likely considered Romance and West Germanic to form the core of the SAE, i.e. the literary languages of Europe which have seen substantial cultural influence from Latin during the medieval period. The North Germanic and Balto-Slavic languages tend to be more peripheral members.

Alexander Gode, who was instrumental in the development of Interlingua, characterized it as &quot;Standard Average European&quot;. The Romance, Germanic, and Slavic control languages of Interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the SAE .

The Standard Average European is most likely the result of ongoing language contact in the time of the Migration Period and later, continuing during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Inheritance of the SAE features from Proto-Indo-European can be ruled out because Proto-Indo-European, as currently reconstructed, lacked most of the SAE features.

==Proposed examples==

Language families that have been proposed to actually be sprachbunds

* Pama–Nyungan languages of Australia
* Afro-Asiatic languages, proposed by G. W. Tsereteli to be a sprachbund rather than a language family. However, the linguistic consensus is that Afro-Asiatic is a valid language family.

<text>In photography, exposure is the amount of light per unit area reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic image sensor. It is determined by shutter speed, lens f-number, and scene luminance. Exposure is measured in units of lux-seconds (symbol lxs), and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance in a specified region.

An &quot;exposure&quot; is a single shutter cycle. For example, a long exposure refers to a single, long shutter cycle to gather enough dim light, whereas a multiple exposure involves a series of shutter cycles, effectively layering a series of photographs in one image. The accumulated &quot;photometric exposure&quot; (&quot;H&quot;v) is the same so long as the total exposure time is the same.

==Definitions==

===Radiant exposure===
Radiant exposure of a &quot;surface&quot;,
denoted &quot;H&quot;e (&quot;e&quot; for &quot;energetic&quot;, to avoid confusion with photometric quantities) and measured in , is given by
:formula_1
where
*&quot;E&quot;e is the irradiance of the surface, measured in ;
*&quot;t&quot; is the exposure duration, measured in s.

===Luminous exposure===
Luminous exposure of a &quot;surface&quot;, denoted &quot;H&quot;v (&quot;v&quot; for &quot;visual&quot;, to avoid confusion with radiometric quantities) and measured in , is given by
:formula_2
where
*&quot;E&quot;v is the illuminance of the surface, measured in lx;
*&quot;t&quot; is the exposure duration, measured in s.

If the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface, that is, weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity, the exposure is still measured in radiometric units (joules per square meter), rather than photometric units (weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye). Only in this appropriately weighted case does the &quot;H&quot; measure the effective amount of light falling on the film, such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light.

Many photographic materials are also sensitive to &quot;invisible&quot; light, which can be a nuisance (see UV filter and IR filter), or a benefit (see infrared photography and full-spectrum photography). The use of radiometric units is appropriate to characterize such sensitivity to invisible light.

In sensitometric data, such as characteristic curves, the &quot;log exposure&quot; is conventionally expressed as log10(&quot;H&quot;). Photographers more familiar with base-2 logarithmic scales (such as exposure values) can convert using .

==Optimum exposure==
&quot;Correct&quot; exposure may be defined as an exposure that achieves the effect the photographer intended.

A more technical approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful exposure range, sometimes called its dynamic range. If, for any part of the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as &quot;black&quot; (underexposed) or &quot;white&quot; (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe &quot;detail&quot;. Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that &#x27;significant&#x27; areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film&#x27;s useful exposure range. This ensures that no &#x27;significant&#x27; information is lost during capture.

The photographer may carefully overexpose or underexpose the photograph to &quot;eliminate&quot; &quot;insignificant&quot; or &quot;unwanted&quot; detail; to make, for example, a white altar cloth appear immaculately clean, or to emulate the heavy, pitiless shadows of film noir. However, it is technically much easier to discard recorded information during post processing than to try to &#x27;re-create&#x27; unrecorded information.

In a scene with strong or harsh lighting, the &quot;ratio&quot; between highlight and shadow luminance values may well be larger than the &quot;ratio&quot; between the film&#x27;s maximum and minimum useful exposure values. In this case, adjusting the camera&#x27;s exposure settings (which only applies changes to the whole image, not selectively to parts of the image) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights; it cannot bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time. Methods for dealing with this situation include: using what is called fill lighting to increase the illumination in shadow areas; using a graduated neutral-density filter, flag, scrim, or gobo to reduce the illumination falling upon areas deemed too bright; or varying the exposure between multiple, otherwise identical, photographs (exposure bracketing) and then combining them afterwards in an HDRI process.

===Overexposure and underexposure===


A photograph may be described as &quot;overexposed&quot; when it has a loss of highlight detail, that is, when important bright parts of an image are &quot;washed out&quot; or effectively all white, known as &quot;blown-out highlights&quot; or &quot;clipped whites&quot;. A photograph may be described as &quot;underexposed&quot; when it has a loss of shadow detail, that is, when important dark areas are &quot;muddy&quot; or indistinguishable from black, known as &quot;blocked-up shadows&quot; (or sometimes &quot;crushed shadows&quot;, &quot;crushed blacks&quot;, or &quot;clipped blacks&quot;, especially in video). As the adjacent image shows, these terms are technical ones rather than artistic judgments; an overexposed or underexposed image may be &quot;correct&quot; in the sense that it provides the effect that the photographer intended. Intentionally over- or underexposing (relative to a standard or the camera&#x27;s automatic exposure) is casually referred to as &quot;exposing to the right&quot; or &quot;exposing to the left&quot; respectively, as these shift the histogram of the image to the right or left.

==Exposure settings==
===Manual exposure===
In manual mode, the photographer adjusts the lens aperture and/or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure. Many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure, but also decreases the depth of field, and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur.

&quot;Manual&quot; exposure calculations may be based on some method of light metering with a working knowledge of exposure values, the APEX system and/or the Zone System.

===Automatic exposure===
A camera in automatic exposure or autoexposure (usually initialized as AE) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match (as closely as possible) the subject&#x27;s mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph. For most cameras, this means using an on-board TTL exposure meter.

Aperture priority (commonly abbreviated as &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;Av&quot; for &quot;aperture value&quot;) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter priority (often abbreviated as &quot;S&quot;, or &quot;Tv&quot; for &quot;time value&quot;) mode gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera&#x27;s exposure meter.

===Exposure compensation===
The purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject&#x27;s mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it has to make a number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the &quot;reference&quot; exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately &quot;overexpose&quot; or &quot;underexpose&quot; in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.

Cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter&#x27;s estimate of appropriate exposure. Frequently calibrated in stops, also known as EV units, a &quot;+1&quot; exposure compensation setting indicates one stop more (twice as much) exposure and &quot;–1&quot; means one stop less (half as much) exposure.

Exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode, as it allows the photographer to &quot;bias&quot; the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure. On low-end video camcorders, exposure compensation may be the only manual exposure control available.

==Exposure control==
An appropriate exposure for a photograph is determined by the sensitivity of the medium used. For photographic film, sensitivity is referred to as film speed and is measured on a scale published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Faster film, that is, film with a higher ISO rating, requires less exposure to make a readable image. Digital cameras usually have variable ISO settings that provide additional flexibility. Exposure is a combination of the length of time and the illuminance at the photosensitive material. Exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed, and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance. Slower shutter speeds (exposing the medium for a longer period of time), greater lens apertures (admitting more light), and higher-luminance scenes produce greater exposures.

An approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day using ISO 100 film, an aperture of and a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second. This is called the sunny 16 rule: at an aperture of on a sunny day, a suitable shutter speed will be one over the film speed (or closest equivalent).

A scene can be exposed in many ways, depending on the desired effect a photographer wishes to convey.

==Reciprocity==

An important principle of exposure is reciprocity. If one exposes the film or sensor for a longer period, a reciprocally smaller aperture is required to reduce the amount of light hitting the film to obtain the same exposure. For example, the photographer may prefer to make his sunny-16 shot at an aperture of (to obtain a shallow depth of field). As is 3 stops &quot;faster&quot; than , with each stop meaning double the amount of light, a new shutter speed of (1/125)/(2·2·2) = 1/1000 s is needed. Once the photographer has determined the exposure, aperture stops can be traded for halvings or doublings of speed, within limits.

The true characteristic of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear (see sensitometry), but it is close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second. Outside of this range, it becomes necessary to increase the exposure from the calculated value to account for this characteristic of the emulsion. This characteristic is known as &quot;reciprocity failure&quot;. The film manufacturer&#x27;s data sheets should be consulted to arrive at the correction required, as different emulsions have different characteristics.

Digital camera image sensors can also be subject to a form of reciprocity failure.

==Determining exposure==
The Zone System is another method of determining exposure and development combinations to achieve a greater tonality range over conventional methods by varying the contrast of the film to fit the print contrast capability. Digital cameras can achieve similar results (high dynamic range) by combining several different exposures (varying shutter or diaphragm) made in quick succession.

Today, most cameras automatically determine the correct exposure at the time of taking a photograph by using a built-in light meter, or multiple point meters interpreted by a built-in computer, see metering mode.

Negative and print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas (film dislikes being starved of light), with digital favouring exposure for highlights. See latitude below.

==Latitude==

Latitude is the degree by which one can over, or under expose an image, and still recover an acceptable level of quality from an exposure. Typically negative film has a better ability to record a range of brightness than slide/transparency film or digital. Digital should be considered to be the reverse of print film, with a good latitude in the shadow range, and a narrow one in the highlight area; in contrast to film&#x27;s large highlight latitude, and narrow shadow latitude. Slide/Transparency film has a narrow latitude in both highlight and shadow areas, requiring greater exposure accuracy.

Negative film&#x27;s latitude increases somewhat with high ISO material, in contrast digital tends to narrow on latitude with high ISO settings.
===Highlights===

Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme brightness are described as having &quot;blown-out highlights&quot; or &quot;flared highlights&quot;.

In digital images this information loss is often irreversible, though small problems can be made less noticeable using photo manipulation software. Recording to RAW format can correct this problem to some degree, as can using a digital camera with a better sensor.

Film can often have areas of extreme overexposure but still record detail in those areas. This information is usually somewhat recoverable when printing or transferring to digital.

A loss of highlights in a photograph is usually undesirable, but in some cases can be considered to &quot;enhance&quot; appeal. Examples include black and white photography and portraits with an out-of-focus background.

===Blacks===
Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme darkness are described as &quot;crushed blacks&quot;. Digital capture tends to be more tolerant of underexposure, allowing better recovery of shadow detail, than same-ISO negative print film.

Crushed blacks cause loss of detail, but can be used for artistic effect.

<text>The River Dane is a tributary of the River Weaver that originates in the Peak District area of England. The name of the river (earlier &quot;Daven&quot;) is probably from the Old Welsh &quot;dafn&quot;, meaning a &quot;drop or trickle&quot;, implying a slow-moving river.

== Course ==
It forms the border between first Cheshire and Derbyshire on the west and east, and then between Cheshire and Staffordshire where it then flows north-west through Cheshire before meeting the Weaver in Northwich.

The river rises close to the source of the River Goyt just to the south west of Buxton, at Dane Head on Axe Edge Moor. Flowing southwest, it forms county borders for around before flowing west through Congleton and past Holmes Chapel. The point on the river where the three counties meet, at Panniers&#x27; Pool Bridge, is called Three Shire Heads (sometimes Three Shires Head). Passing just north of Middlewich, it merges first with the River Croco near the site of the old Roman fort in Harbutt&#x27;s Field, and then with the River Wheelock near the aqueduct carrying the Trent and Mersey Canal, and runs the remaining north to Northwich where it flows into the River Weaver.

The River Dane is the longest, cleanest and thought to be the fastest flowing river through Cheshire. The route of the Dane is followed as closely as possible by the Dane Valley Way, a walking route from Buxton to Northwich.

Although the main river is part of the Mersey catchment and flows into the Irish Sea, a portion of the water can be diverted via canal feeders into Rudyard Lake and subsequently the Caldon Canal. This water discharges eventually into the River Trent and ultimately into the North Sea, having crossed the English watershed.

== History ==
In 1451 when the River Dane flooded in Congleton, it destroyed the town&#x27;s corn mill, half of the timber-framed buildings and the wooden bridge over the river. To prevent it happening again, the river was diverted away from the town. Congleton&#x27;s textile industry grew from the 14th century, with many water-powered mills built along the river by the 18th century.

A small stone bridge over the river near Holmes Chapel, Hermitage Bridge, was built in 1772 by a local ironmaster. Some years the river floods widely across the meadows here. Nearby a tall red brick railway viaduct, built in 1841, spans the broad Dane Valley between Holmes Chapel and Twemlow. It has 23 arches and is Grade II listed. It crosses the River Dane at Saltersford, where Cheshire salt traders once drove their horse-drawn carts through a ford along the toll road. 

Reading downstream, the following crossings are all designated listed buildings or scheduled monuments: Dane Bridge, Hug Bridge, Lymford Bridge (early 19th century), Dane Aqueduct over the Macclesfield Canal (1830), Congleton Railway Viaduct (West Coast Main Line, 1849), Colley Mill Bridge, Havannah Bridge (early to mid-19th century, originally leading to a cigar factory), Hermitage Bridge (1772) and Shipbrook Bridge.

<text>The River Manifold is a river in Staffordshire, England. It is a tributary of the River Dove (which also flows through the Peak District, forming the boundary between Derbyshire and Staffordshire).

The Manifold rises at Flash Head just south of Buxton near Axe Edge, at the northern edge of the White Peak, known for its limestone beds. It continues for before it joins the Dove. For part of its course, it runs underground (except when in spate), from Wetton Mill to Ilam. During this section it is joined by its major tributary, the River Hamps.

Villages on the river include Longnor, Hulme End and Ilam.

Its name may come from Anglo-Saxon &quot;manig-fald&quot; = &quot;many folds&quot;, referring to its meanders.

==Manifold Way==
The Manifold Way is an long-distance footpath and cycle track from Hulme End to Waterhouses, along the former route of the narrow-gauge (2&#x27; 6&quot;) Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway which operated between 1904 and 1934. Opened in July 1937 after the LMS handed over the trackbed to Staffordshire County Council, it is tarmacked throughout.

The Manifold Valley Visitor Centre is housed in Hulme End Station, which also has a model of the railway.

==Limestone crags and caves==
The limestone cliffs that fringe the valley contain several rock-climbing areas, and named rock features, including Thor&#x27;s Cave () and Beeston Tor (), which overlooks the confluence with the River Hamps.

==Mining in the Manifold valley==

The Manifold valley was famous for the mining of copper and lead, and the mines at Ecton were some of the richest in the country. The discovery of Stone Age implements in some of the caves imply that minerals were mined around the Manifold valley thousands of years ago. Nowadays there is little trace of the industry that made many people (mainly the Duke of Devonshire who at one time owned the Ecton mines) very rich. The main areas of interest are around Ecton where the old spoil banks and the old engine house still remain.

==Ecology==
The river has been noted as being important for European bullhead and lamprey. In the underground section of the river where it resurfaces at Ilam, the bullhead have no pigmentation. It was previously a stronghold for white-clawed crayfish, but most of the river&#x27;s population were wiped out by crayfish plague in 2008. Crayfish have been noted in the tributaries of the Manifold and it is hoped that re-colonisation can be achieved by the surviving upstream crayfish.

<text>These are [[dam]]s and [[reservoir]]s in [[Germany]].

The German word &quot;Talsperre&quot; (literally: valley barrier) may mean dam, but it is often used to include the associated reservoir as well. The reservoirs are often separately given names ending in &quot;-see&quot;, &quot;-teich&quot; or &quot;-speicher&quot; which are the German words for &quot;lake&quot;, &quot;pond&quot; and &quot;reservoir&quot;, but in this case all may also be translated as &quot;reservoir&quot;. The more specific word for the actual dam is &quot;Staumauer&quot; and for the lake is &quot;Stausee&quot;.

<text>Havelland () is a district or county in Brandenburg, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Ostprignitz-Ruppin and Oberhavel, the city-state of Berlin, the district of Potsdam-Mittelmark, the city of Brandenburg and the state of Saxony-Anhalt (districts of Jerichower Land and Stendal).

==History==
The district was established in 1993 by merging the former districts of Nauen and Rathenow.

== Demography ==


==Geography==
Geographically the Havelland refers to the land either side of the Havel river and the area surrounded by the large &quot;U&quot; bend in its course between the city of Berlin and its confluence with the Elbe river. The district mainly consists of the areas north of the Havel river.

==Coat of arms==

The red eagle is the heraldic animal of Brandenburg. The head of the eagle is part of the coat of arms of Rathenow. The swan is often used as a symbol for the Havelland region.

<doc id="166886" wikidata="Q1147130" url="?curid=166886" title="Cyberdog">
<text>Cyberdog was an OpenDoc-based Internet suite of applications, developed by Apple Computer for the Mac OS line of operating systems. It was introduced as a beta in February 1996 and abandoned in March 1997. The last version, Cyberdog 2.0, was released on April 28, 1997. It worked with later versions of System 7 as well as the Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 operating systems.

Cyberdog derived its name from a cartoon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; captioned &quot;On the Internet, nobody knows you&#x27;re a dog.&quot;

==History==

===Cyberdog 1===
* Apple released the first beta version of Cyberdog on February 16, 1996.
* Apple released Cyberdog 1.0 on May 13, 1996.
* Apple released Cyberdog 1.2 on December 4, 1996.

===Cyberdog 2===
Apple released a first alpha version on December 21, 1996, with new features such as frames, cookies and animated GIF support.

Apple also released Cyberdog 2.0 with Mac OS 8.0, allowing Mac Runtime for Java to be utilized and also had minor bugs with OpenDoc fixed.

== Overview ==
Cyberdog included email and news readers, a web browser and address book management components, as well as drag and drop FTP. OpenDoc allowed these components to be reused and embedded in other documents by the user. For instance, a &quot;live&quot; Cyberdog web page could be embedded in a presentation program, one of the common demonstrations of OpenDoc.

A serious problem with the OpenDoc project that Cyberdog depended on, was that it was part of a very acrimonious competition between OpenDoc consortium members and Microsoft. The members of the OpenDoc alliance were all trying to obtain traction in a market rapidly being dominated by Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer. At the same time, Microsoft used the synergy between the OS and applications divisions of the company to make it effectively mandatory that developers adopt the competing Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technology. OpenDoc was forced to create an interoperability layer in order to allow developers to use it, and this added a great technical burden to the project.

An offspring of Cyberdog called Subwoofer had been developed in parallel and was aimed at providing software developers with a simple library for integrating web communication protocols into applications. The project was completed after the cancellation of Cyberdog and released at the MacHack 1997 conference by Sari Harrison and Frédéric Artru. Subwoofer evolved into the URL Access library shipped with Mac OS 8.6.

== Cancellation ==

OpenDoc had several hundred developers signed up, but the timing was poor. Apple Computer was rapidly losing money at the time. Before long, OpenDoc was scrapped, with Steve Jobs noting that they &quot;put a bullet through (CyberDog&#x27;s) head&quot;, and most of the team was laid off in March 1997. Other sources noted that Microsoft hired away three ClarisWorks developers who were responsible for OpenDoc integration into ClarisWorks.

AppleShare IP Manager from versions 5.0 to 6.2 relied on OpenDoc, but AppleShare IP 6.3, the first Mac OS 9 compatible version (released in 1999), eliminated the reliance on OpenDoc. Apple officially relinquished the last trademark on the name OpenDoc on June 11, 2005.

OpenDoc had a large memory footprint for the time, and since the OS/2 (Warp 4) versions of OpenDoc were behind schedule, Cyberdog only ran on Macintosh. Moreover, saved documents were not viewable from applications which did not support OpenDoc&#x27;s Bento format. After Apple terminated Cyberdog along with the rest of OpenDoc, Cyberdog&#x27;s web browser component grew outdated as web standards evolved.

Cyberdog was once positioned as a replacement for the earlier, discontinued, Apple Open Collaboration Environment.

<doc id="166890" wikidata="Q584537" url="?curid=166890" title="Langevin equation">
<text>In physics, a Langevin equation (named after Paul Langevin) is a stochastic differential equation describing how a system evolves when subjected to a combination of deterministic and fluctuating (&quot;random&quot;) forces. The dependent variables in a Langevin equation typically are collective (macroscopic) variables changing only slowly in comparison to the other (microscopic) variables of the system. The fast (microscopic) variables are responsible for the stochastic nature of the Langevin equation. One application is to Brownian motion, which models the fluctuating motion of a small particle in a fluid. 

== Brownian motion as a prototype ==
The original Langevin equation describes Brownian motion, the apparently random movement of a particle in a fluid due to collisions with the molecules of the fluid,
formula_1

Here, formula_2 is the velocity of the particle, formula_3 is its damping coefficient, and formula_4 is its mass. The force acting on the particle is written as a sum of a viscous force proportional to the particle&#x27;s velocity (Stokes&#x27; law), and a &quot;noise term&quot; formula_5 representing the effect of the collisions with the molecules of the fluid. The force formula_5 has a Gaussian probability distribution with correlation function
formula_7
where formula_8 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_9 is the temperature and formula_10 is the i-th component of the vector formula_5. The formula_12-function form of the time correlation means that the force at a time formula_13 is uncorrelated with the force at any other time. This is an approximation: the actual random force has a nonzero correlation time corresponding to the collision time of the molecules. However, the Langevin equation is used to describe the motion of a &quot;macroscopic&quot; particle at a much longer time scale, and in this limit the formula_12-correlation and the Langevin equation becomes virtually exact.

Another common feature of the Langevin equation is the occurrence of the damping coefficient formula_3 in the correlation function of the random force, which in an equilibrium system is an expression of the Einstein relation.

== Mathematical aspects ==
A strictly formula_12-correlated fluctuating force formula_5 is not a function in the usual mathematical sense and even the derivative formula_18 is not defined in this limit. This problem disappears when the Langevin equation is written in integral form 
formula_19 

Therefore, the differential form is only an abbreviation for its time integral. The general mathematical term for equations of this type is &quot;stochastic differential equation&quot;.

Another mathematical ambiguity occurs for Langevin equations with multiplicative noise, which refers to noise terms that are multiplied by a non-constant function of the dependent variables, e.g., formula_20. If a multiplicative noise is intrinsic to the system, its definition is ambiguous, as it is equally valid to interpret it according to Stratonovich- or Ito- scheme (see Itô calculus). Nevertheless, physical observables are independent of the interpretation, provided the latter is applied consistently when manipulating the equation. This is necessary because the symbolic rules of calculus differ depending on the interpretation scheme. If the noise is external to the system, the appropriate interpretation is the Stratonovich one.

== Generic Langevin equation ==
There is a formal derivation of a generic Langevin equation from classical mechanics. This generic equation plays a central role in the theory of critical dynamics, and other areas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The equation for Brownian motion above is a special case.

An essential step in the derivation is the division of the degrees of freedom into the categories &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;fast&quot;. For example, local thermodynamic equilibrium in a liquid is reached within a few collision times, but it takes much longer for densities of conserved quantities like mass and energy to relax to equilibrium. Thus, densities of conserved quantities, and in particular their long wavelength components, are slow variable candidates. This division can be expressed formally with the Zwanzig projection operator. Nevertheless, the derivation is not completely rigorous from a mathematical physics perspective because it relies on assumptions that lack rigorous proof, and instead are justified only as plausible approximations of physical systems.

Let formula_21 denote the slow variables. The generic Langevin equation then reads
formula_22

The fluctuating force formula_10 obeys a Gaussian probability distribution with correlation function
formula_24

This implies the Onsager reciprocity relation formula_25 for the damping coefficients formula_3. The dependence formula_27 of formula_3 on formula_29 is negligible in most cases. The symbol formula_30 denotes the Hamiltonian of the system, where formula_31 is the equilibrium probability distribution of the variables formula_29. Finally, formula_33 is the projection of the Poisson bracket of the slow variables formula_34 and formula_35 onto the space of slow variables.

In the Brownian motion case one would have formula_36, formula_37 or formula_38 and formula_39. The equation of motion formula_40 for formula_41 is exact: there is no fluctuating force formula_42 and no damping coefficient formula_43.

== Examples ==

=== Thermal noise in an electrical resistor ===

There is a close analogy between the paradigmatic Brownian particle discussed above and Johnson noise, the electric voltage generated by thermal fluctuations in a resistor. The diagram at the right shows an electric circuit consisting of a resistance &quot;R&quot; and a capacitance &quot;C&quot;. The slow variable is the voltage &quot;U&quot; between the ends of the resistor. The Hamiltonian reads formula_44, and the Langevin equation becomes
formula_45

This equation may be used to determine the correlation function
formula_46
which becomes white noise (Johnson noise) when the capacitance becomes negligibly small.

=== Critical dynamics ===
The dynamics of the order parameter formula_47 of a second order phase transition slows down near the critical point and can be described with a Langevin equation. The simplest case is the universality class &quot;model A&quot; with a non-conserved scalar order parameter, realized for instance in axial ferromagnets,
formula_48
Other universality classes (the nomenclature is &quot;model A&quot;..., &quot;model J&quot;) contain a diffusing order parameter, order parameters with several components, other critical variables and/or contributions from Poisson brackets.


=== Harmonic oscillator in a fluid ===

formula_49

A particle in a fluid is described by a Langevin equation with a potential energy function, a damping force, and thermal fluctuations given by the fluctuation dissipation theorem. If the potential is quadratic then the constant energy curves are ellipses, as shown in the figure. If there is dissipation but no thermal noise, a particle continually loses energy to the environment, and its time-dependent phase portrait (velocity vs position) corresponds to an inward spiral toward 0 velocity. By contrast, thermal fluctuations continually add energy to the particle and prevent it from reaching exactly 0 velocity. Rather, the initial ensemble of stochastic oscillators approaches a steady state in which the velocity and position are distributed according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. In the plot below (figure 2), the long time velocity distribution (blue) and position distributions (orange) in a harmonic potential (formula_50) is plotted with the Boltzmann probabilities for velocity (green) and position (red). In particular, the late time behavior depicts thermal equilibrium. 

=== Trajectories of free Brownian particles ===
Consider a free particle of mass formula_4 with equation of motion described by
formula_52
where formula_53 is the particle velocity, formula_54 is the particle mobility, and formula_55 is a rapidly fluctuating force whose time-average vanishes over a characteristic timescale formula_56 of particle collisions, i.e. formula_57. The general solution to the equation of motion is
formula_58
where formula_59 is the correlation time of the noise term. It can also be shown that the autocorrelation function of the particle velocity formula_2 is given by
formula_61
where we have used the property that the variables formula_62 and formula_63 become uncorrelated for time separations formula_64. Besides, the value of formula_65 is set to be equal to formula_66 such that it obeys the equipartition theorem. If the system is initially at thermal equilibrium already with formula_67, then formula_68 for all formula_13, meaning that the system remains at equilibrium at all times.

The velocity formula_70 of the Brownian particle can be integrated to yield its trajectory formula_71. If it is initially located at the origin with probability 1, then the result is
formula_72

Hence, the average displacement formula_73 asymptotes to formula_74 as the system relaxes. The mean squared displacement can be determined similarly:
formula_75

This expression implies that formula_76, indicating that the motion of Brownian particles at timescales much shorter than the relaxation time formula_77 of the system is (approximately) time-reversal invariant. On the other hand, formula_78, which indicates an irreversible, dissipative process.

=== Recovering Boltzmann statistics ===
If the external potential is conservative and the noise term derives from a reservoir in thermal equilibrium, then the long-time solution to the Langevin equation must reduce to the Boltzmann distribution, which is the probability distribution function for particles in thermal equilibrium. In the special case of overdamped dynamics, the inertia of the particle is negligible in comparison to the damping force, and the trajectory formula_79 is described by the overdamped Langevin equation
formula_80
where formula_3 is the damping constant. The term formula_82 is white noise, characterized by formula_83 (formally, the Wiener process). One way to solve this equation is to introduce a test function formula_84 and calculate its average. The average of formula_85 should be time-independent for finite formula_79, leading to
formula_87

Itô&#x27;s lemma for the Itô drift-diffusion process formula_88 says that the differential of a twice-differentiable function is given by 
formula_89

Applying this to the calculation of formula_90 gives 
formula_91

This average can be written using the probability density function formula_92;
formula_93
where the second term was integrated by parts (hence the negative sign). Since this is true for arbitrary functions formula_84, it follows that
formula_95
thus recovering the Boltzmann distribution
formula_96

== Equivalent techniques ==
In some situations, one is primarily interested in the noise-averaged behavior of the Langevin equation, as opposed to the solution for particular realizations of the noise. This section describes techniques for obtaining this averaged behavior that are distinct from—but also equivalent to—the stochastic calculus inherent in the Langevin equation.

=== Fokker–Planck equation ===
A Fokker–Planck equation is a deterministic equation for the time dependent probability density formula_97 of stochastic variables formula_29. The Fokker–Planck equation corresponding to the generic Langevin equation described in this article is the following:
formula_99
The equilibrium distribution formula_100 is a stationary solution.

==== Klein–Kramers equation ====

The Fokker–Planck equation for an underdamped Brownian particle is called the Klein–Kramers equation. If the Langevin equations are written as
formula_101
where formula_102 is the momentum, then the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation is
formula_103
Here formula_104 and formula_105 are the gradient operator with respect to and , and formula_106 is the Laplacian with respect to .

In formula_107-dimensional free space, corresponding to formula_108 on formula_109, this equation can be solved using Fourier transforms. If the particle is initialized at formula_110 with position formula_111 and momentum formula_112, corresponding to initial condition formula_113, then the solution is
formula_114
where
formula_115
In three spatial dimensions, the mean squared displacement is
formula_116

=== Path integral ===
A path integral equivalent to a Langevin equation can be obtained from the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation or by transforming the Gaussian probability distribution formula_117 of the fluctuating force formula_118 to a probability distribution of the slow variables, schematically formula_119.
The functional determinant and associated mathematical subtleties drop out if the Langevin equation is discretized in the natural (causal) way, where formula_120 depends on formula_121 but not on formula_122. It turns out to be convenient to introduce auxiliary &quot;response variables&quot; formula_123. The path integral equivalent to the generic Langevin equation then reads
formula_124
where formula_125 is a normalization factor and
formula_126
The path integral formulation allows for the use of tools from quantum field theory, such as perturbation and renormalization group methods. This formulation is typically referred to as either the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism or the Janssen-De Dominicis formalism after its developers. The mathematical formalism for this representation can be developed on abstract Wiener space.

<doc id="166891" wikidata="Q1275730" url="?curid=166891" title="Equivalent rectangular bandwidth">
<text>The equivalent rectangular bandwidth or ERB is a measure used in psychoacoustics, which gives an approximation to the bandwidths of the filters in human hearing, using the unrealistic but convenient simplification of modeling the filters as rectangular band-pass filters, or band-stop filters, like in tailor-made notched music training (TMNMT).

== Approximations ==
For moderate sound levels and young listeners, suggest that the bandwidth of human auditory filters can be approximated by the polynomial equation:

where is the center frequency of the filter, in kHz, and is the bandwidth of the filter in Hz. The approximation is based on the results of a number of published simultaneous masking experiments and is valid from 0.1–.

Seven years later, published another, simpler approximation:

where is in Hz and is also in Hz. The approximation is applicable at moderate sound levels and for values of between 100 and .

== ERB-rate scale==
The ERB-rate scale, or ERB-number scale, can be defined as a function ERBS(&quot;f&quot;) which returns the number of equivalent rectangular bandwidths below the given frequency &quot;f&quot;. The units of the ERB-number scale are known ERBs, or as Cams, following a suggestion by Hartmann. The scale can be constructed by solving the following differential system of equations:

:formula_1

The solution for ERBS(&quot;f&quot;) is the integral of the reciprocal of ERB(&quot;f&quot;) with the constant of integration set in such a way that ERBS(0) = 0.

Using the second order polynomial approximation () for ERB(&quot;f&quot;) yields:

:formula_2 

where &quot;f&quot; is in kHz. The VOICEBOX speech processing toolbox for MATLAB implements the conversion and its inverse as:

:formula_3 
:formula_4 

where &quot;f&quot; is in Hz.

Using the linear approximation () for ERB(&quot;f&quot;) yields:

:formula_5 

where &quot;f&quot; is in Hz.

<doc id="166892" wikidata="Q5093793" url="?curid=166892" title="Chesterfield Canal">
<text>The Chesterfield Canal is a narrow canal in the East Midlands of England and it is known locally as &#x27;Cuckoo Dyke&#x27;. It was one of the last of the canals designed by James Brindley, who died while it was being constructed. It was opened in 1777 and ran for from the River Trent at West Stockwith, Nottinghamshire to Chesterfield, Derbyshire, passing through the Norwood Tunnel at Kiveton Park, at the time one of the longest tunnels on the British canal system. The canal was built to export coal, limestone, and lead from Derbyshire, iron from Chesterfield, and corn, deals, timber, groceries and general merchandise into Derbyshire. The stone for the Palace of Westminster was quarried in North Anston, Rotherham, and transported via the canal.

It was reasonably profitable, paying dividends from 1789, and with the coming of the railways, some of the proprietors formed a railway company. It became part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway company, and although there were intermittent plans to convert parts of it to a railway, it continued to thrive as a canal. In 1907, subsidence from local coal mines caused the collapse of the Norwood Tunnel, and the canal was effectively split in two. Subsequently, the main use of the Chesterfield end was the supply of water to the iron industry, while commercial carrying continued on the Worksop to West Stockwith section until the late 1950s.

It was formally closed in 1961, but campaigners fought for it to be retained, and the Worksop to Stockwith section was designated as a &quot;cruiseway&quot; under the Transport Act 1968, meaning that it would be retained for leisure use. The rest was designated as a remainder waterway, and parts were sold off, with housing being built over the route through Killamarsh. The Chesterfield Canal Society was formed in 1978 to spearhead restoration, becoming the Chesterfield Canal Trust in 1997. They initially sought to extend the navigable section beyond Worksop, but when progress was slow, moved to working on the Chesterfield end. Over of canal, including five original locks and a brand new lock at Staveley Basin were navigable by 2017. The eastern end was restored from Worksop to the mouth of the Norwood Tunnel at Kiveton Park near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1995 and 2003, funded by Derelict Land Grants, English Partnerships and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Less than of the original route remain to be restored to link the two navigable sections, but this will require some new lengths of
canal to be built, to bypass the housing development at Killamarsh, and to replace most of the Norwood Tunnel, which cannot be restored. The eastern section is managed by the Canal and River Trust, while the western section is managed by Derbyshire County Council. It includes Tapton Lock Visitor Centre, located to the north of Tapton Park, and the Hollingwood Hub, which provides offices for the Trust, together with meeting rooms and a cafe. It is located by Hollingwood Lock, and consists of a large new extension on the back of the refurbished lock house.

==History==
Lead had been mined in Derbyshire on a commercial scale since at least 1300, but the industry was hampered by poor transport links. The pigs of lead were carried by pack horses to Bawtry, where there were wharves on the River Idle. Small boats carried them to the River Trent, where the cargo was transferred to larger vessels for onward distribution. There was no proper system of road maintenance, and so the use of carts and wagons for the over-land journey was not possible. The River Idle was also unreliable, being affected by floods and droughts, but there were no alternatives, and the industry flourished despite the difficulties. The Derwent Navigation was authorised in 1719, running from Derby to the River Trent, but it was less reliable than the Idle, and so did not seriously affect trade through Bawtry. The London Lead Company, one of the main traders, together with others involved in lead and coal mining, looked for possible solutions, and were joined in this by several prominent landowners.

The main impetus for a canal came from the owners of mineral rights. The London Lead Company met with the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Newcastle, and others, but proposals were actively supported by the towns of Chesterfield, Worksop and Retford. Retford had obtained an act of Parliament, the Idle Navigation Act of 1719 to improve the River Idle from Bawtry to the town, but very little work was done to implement the scheme. In addition to being a market town, Retford also manufactured bricks and tiles, had reserves of gravel, and produced an agricultural surplus. In 1769, a steering group produced a pamphlet extolling the advantages of a proposed canal, which was available to everyone, but was primarily addressed to the Duke of Newcastle, Lord George Augustus Cavendish, and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Derbyshire, Godfrey Bagnall Clarke.

The route of the canal was surveyed by James Brindley and John Varley, who estimated the cost at £94,908 17s. Brindley presented his proposals to a meeting in Worksop on 24 August 1769. Bawtry interests asked John Grundy to carry out a second survey. He proposed a rather shorter course, from Stockwith in a straight line to Bawtry and then by Scrooby, Blyth and Carlton, to join Brindley&#x27;s line at Shireoaks. Grundy&#x27;s line was shorter, and the cost estimated at £71,479 6s d. Although Grundy&#x27;s line was considerably cheaper, it achieved this by missing Worksop and Retford, and the investors had already decided in favour of Brindley&#x27;s route.
An application was made to Parliament and the act of Parliament, the (11 Geo. 3. c. 75) was given royal assent on 28 March 1771, entitled &quot;An Act for making a navigable Cut or Canal from Chesterfield, in the county of Derby, through or near Worksop and Retford, to join the River Trent, at or near Stockwith, in the county of Nottingham.&quot;

The promoters consisted of one hundred and seventy-four persons, amongst whom were the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Newcastle, Lord Scarsdale, the Dean of York, and Sir Cecil Wray. They were incorporated by the name of &quot;The Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Chesterfield to the River Trent&quot;, and empowered to raise among themselves the sum of £100,000, in one thousand shares of £100 each, to fund the construction.

Immediately on the passing of the act, construction began under the direction of Brindley. Upon his death in September 1772, John Varley moved from Clerk of Works to Resident Engineer with Hugh Henshall, Brindley&#x27;s brother-in-law, appointed in a consultative capacity. He agreed to make inspections every three months. Henshall became Chief Engineer in 1773 and John Varley continued to work on the project. By August 1773, the section between Shireoaks and Worksop was nearly complete, and the company created a works to build boats at Shireoaks. The boats were used to carry spoil from the construction, and also to deliver coal. The canal was effectively open from Shireoaks to below Worksop by 6 April 1774, and to Retford by 3 August. The price of coal to the residents of Retford dropped from 15s 6d (77.5p) to 10s 6d (52.5p) overnight. Hayton was reached on 22 February 1775, and the Norwood Tunnel opened on 9 May 1775. The canal was to be built as a narrow canal, but in 1775, nine shareholders offered to fund the extra cost of making it a broad canal from Retford to Stockwith. Retford Corporation joined them, and each contributed £500, although the additional cost exceeded the £6,000 subscribed. The canal was opened throughout on 4 June 1777, with the lock into the River Trent at West Stockwith completed in the autumn, but the only record of wide-beamed boats using it at Retford is prior to 1799.

===Operation===
As built, the canal was almost long, being from the Trent to Worksop with a rise of . From Worksop to the eastern portal of Norwood Tunnel it was with a further rise. From there to Chesterfield it was a further with a fall of followed by a rise of . There were 65 locks in all, with two tunnels: a short tunnel near Gringley Beacon, and the major long Norwood Tunnel. At the time of construction, Norwood Tunnel was the second longest canal tunnel in Britain, exceeded only by another of Brindley&#x27;s tunnels, that at Harecastle on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The canal was a typical Brindley contour canal, following the contours to avoid costly cuttings and embankments, which resulted in a less than direct route in places.

In late 1775, the company had decided to build a branch, which left the canal between Renishaw and Staveley, and ran generally southwards for about to the turnpike road at Norbriggs. This may have been to help with transport to Chesterfield, until the main line was completed, but in 1777, the company leased Norbriggs Colliery. Henshall supervised its operation, and transport of coal to the branch canal was improved by the provision of a &quot;Newcastle Rail Road&quot; in 1778, which used wooden rails. The company pulled out of running the mine in 1797, when they advertised it to be let. Water supply was initially by a reservoir at Pebley, which was later supplemented by reservoirs at Harthill, Woodall and Killamarsh. Near Worksop, a private branch was built to serve the Lady Lee quarry, which ran for about , while at Netherthorpe, a branch connected to the East Inkersall tramroad, which served pits near the Adelphi Canal. A gasworks was later built at the junction, and while the 1877 Ordnance Survey map shows a short stub of the branch, connecting to the Seymour and Speedwell Branch railway, by 1898 a railway siding had replaced it, leaving just a basin at the junction to serve the gasworks. Another private branch was built in 1840, which crossed the Norbriggs road at Netherthorpe to serve the Speedwell Colliery. It was built by the Barrows, who also owned Staveley ironworks, but by 1860 had been replaced by a railway.

By 1789, the company had spent a total of £152,400, raised through shares and by mortgages. Income for the year was £8,320, and after interest payments had been met, that left a net profit of £2,780, enabling them to make their first dividend payment of one per cent. 74,312 tons of traffic were carried that year, of which 42,380 tons were coal, with the rest consisting of lead, iron, stone, corn, lime, timber and sundries. Dividends had risen to five per cent by 1795, were eight per cent the following year, and were six or seven per cent until at least 1836. There were several suggestions for links to the River Don Navigation or the Sheffield Canal, the first in 1792 as part of the scheme to build a canal to Sheffield, and subsequently in 1824, as part of the Grand Commercial Canal, and in 1852, when a Sheffield and Chesterfield Junction Canal was proposed, but none of them moved past the planning stage.

===Railway age===

In the 1840s, Railway Mania was gripping the country, with many speculative schemes being proposed. Rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed, a number of the proprietors formed the Manchester &amp; Lincoln Union Railway company in October 1845. The intention was to build a line from Liverpool to Grimsby, and to convert part of the canal into a railway. Locally, this included a line from Staveley to Gainsborough, via Worksop, with a branch to Lincoln and another from Worksop to Beighton. The previous year, the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway had been proposed, to build a line from Sheffield to Gainsborough, and was supported by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne &amp; Manchester Railway. The new scheme was in direct competition to the earlier one, but the two sets of proprietors met and agreed to amalgamate. Now arguing from a position of strength, the Manchester &amp; Lincoln Union rescinded their plans for most of their lines, and obtained the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccclviii) on 7 August 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the Midland Railway at Staveley to the canal at Worksop. The new company amalgamated with the Chesterfield Canal, to become the rather unwieldy Manchester and Lincoln Union Railway and Chesterfield and Gainsborough Canal, with powers to further amalgamate with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway. However, by the time they announced this, the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway had already become part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and so they amalgamated with that company instead. The act of Parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved, the entire canal was to be retained, its water supplies maintained, and tolls were to be fixed at a just level.

Under the new regime, the canal was put back into good order in 1848, after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected. The benefits were immediate, with traffic increasing as a result. Over 200,000 tons were carried in 1848, the highest recorded total. The railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal, and to maintain water levels, the reservoirs at Chesterfield were enlarged in 1856. Traffic levels were holding up in 1858, despite fierce competition from the London and North Western Railway. However, the owners considered options for converting the canal from Kiverton Park to Chesterfield into a railway in 1872, 1873 and 1884, but on each occasion, the plans were shelved. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was expanding, and an act of Parliament, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. ciii) was obtained which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting Chesterfield, Staveley and Beighton to be constructed. The new route was straighter than the old, and reduced the length of the canal by around . The Beighton to Staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 December 1891, and reached Chesterfield on 4 June 1892. The railway&#x27;s carrying business on this and other canals ceased shortly afterwards. The original route of the canal at Hague Lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and Renishaw Central station, but further north, the section around Chapel Wheel Forge and Dam is still clearly visible, and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds. Close to Bluebank Lock, the railway, known as the Great Central Railway Chesterfield Loop, turned to the east and passed to the south of Staveley Iron Works to reach Staveley Town station. Prior to construction of this section, the canal looped to the north around the iron works, passing through Cinderhill Lock before turning south-eastwards. The canal was re-routed along the southern edge of the works, and the railway crossed over at Staveley Works station, almost on top of a new lock which was known as Staveley Works Lock or Hollingwood Lock.

Parts of the canal above Worksop were affected by subsidence from local coal mines. By 1905, traffic had dropped to 45,177 tons, of which around 15,000 tons were coal and 11,000 were bricks. Some 40 boats were still working on the canal, although a short section between Staveley and Chesterfield had become unnavigable. The canal was making a loss, with receipts of £1,837 and expenditure of £3,883 in 1905. The largest drain on resources was the Norwood Tunnel, where £21,000 had been spent since 1871, in an attempt to repair damage and raise the roof. However, on 18 October 1907 there was a further substantial collapse, and the tunnel was closed. Effectively, the canal above Worksop became redundant. Responsibility for the canal passed to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, who carried out regular maintenance, and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting West Stockwith basin to the River Trent between 1923 and 1925. Various attempts to reduce the growth of weed, which had first appeared on the canal in 1852, were made, with variable success, and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the Second World War. The last serious commercial traffic on the canal was the carriage of bricks from Walkeringham to West Stockwith, which ended in 1955, although there was a small trade in warp, a fine silt dredged from the Trent at the mouth of the River Idle, and used by the cutlery trade in Sheffield for polishing metal, which lasted into the early 1960s. Parts of the isolated section from the tunnel to Chesterfield were infilled and redeveloped.

==Restoration==

Following the post-war Labour Government nationalisation of the railways and the canals, the Chesterfield Canal became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission. They were determined to close any canals that were not used to carry freight, and did not see any future in leisure use. By 1961, the canal had been formally closed, all requests to use it for leisure purposes were refused, and there were proposals for official abandonment of its entire length. Much of it was filled with rubbish and stagnant water, but despite this, Cliff Clarke, a businessman from South Yorkshire, mounted a campaign to save it. The British Transport Commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962, although the lock gates from Worksop to Kiveton were removed, and the lock walls bulldozed, on the grounds of public safety. Clarke formed the Retford and Worksop (Chesterfield Canal) Boat Club soon afterwards, and it became a limited company in 1966, to cope with the growing membership. Unofficial work parties were organised, to clear locks and cut back vegetation and weed; they were unofficial because the British Transport Commission would not allow volunteers to work on their property. Such activity became slightly more collaborative when the canal became the responsibility of the British Waterways Board. Government policy changed following the publication of a White Paper entitled &quot;British Waterways: Recreation and Amenity&quot; in September 1967, and the canal was classified as a &quot;cruiseway&quot; between the Trent and Morse Lock, Worksop under the Transport Act 1968, meaning that it would be maintained to a navigable standard for leisure use. The rest of the canal was classified as &quot;remainder&quot;.

By 1968, restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the Chesterfield Canal was mentioned in the May edition of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, produced for members of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) by the forerunners of the Waterway Recovery Group. The Chesterfield Canal Society was formed in September 1976, determined to restore the canal beyond Worksop, and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at Worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal, in conjunction with the Worksop and Retford Boat Club. Bassetlaw District Council provided financial backing, and the event was held over four days, coinciding with the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. Some 150 boats and over 21,000 people attended, with catering services, theatrical performances and exhibitions held on the Bracebridge showground. The Duke of Devonshire opened the festivities, and the Chesterfield Canal Society was formally launched, with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal, rather than just from boaters.

Progress beyond Worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995, when a Derelict Land Grant was obtained by Nottinghamshire County Council, and with additional funding from British Coal, a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between Worksop and the aqueduct over the River Ryton which forms the county boundary. Rotherham Borough Council were hoping to obtain similar grants for the section between the aqueduct and the Norwood Tunnel, but the funding came from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the regeneration agency English Partnerships. The complete project cost £19 million, which included an extra £971,000 received from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to allow detailed archaeological investigation of the Thorpe and Turnerwood lock flights to be undertaken. On 18 November 2002, the first boats in over 70 years ascended the Turnerwood flight. Thirty locks had been restored, from Morse Lock (49) near Worksop to Thorpe Top Treble Lock (20) near Thorpe Salvin. Three bridges had been rebuilt with navigable headroom, one over Tylden Road, the main access road into Rhodesia, an adjacent one that provided access to nearby cottages, and one which carried Shireoaks Common over the canal near to Shireoaks railway station. Just before Ryton Aqueduct, a new shallow lock named Boundary Lock (41a) had been required, due to widespread subsidence affecting the ground levels, and at Shireoaks, the former colliery loading basin had been turned into a marina.

===Western section===

Restoration had focused initially on the route east from Norwood Tunnel to Worksop, which presented relatively few physical obstacles to being restored to navigation. However, in practice progress had been slow, and attention turned to the section west of Norwood Tunnel, where much more damage had been done to the canal bed, with it being filled in and built over in many places. This included the construction of housing at Killamarsh in the 1970s, which went ahead despite protests. However, parts of the channel had survived remarkably well in places, as it had been used to supply water to the iron industry, and maintained by a team with a boat until the 1950s. The last few miles of the canal, from Chesterfield to Staveley, were in reasonable condition, although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access, while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass, which had first been proposed in 1927. Regular work parties began the process of restoration in 1988, organised by the Chesterfield Canal Society, and supplemented by volunteers from the Waterway Recovery Group periodically. Tapton lock was the first to be reopened, in 1990. Derbyshire County Council acquired the section of canal between Chesterfield and Staveley and secured derelict land grants to enable dredging and towpath maintenance to take place. A campaign to ensure that once all the coal had been extracted from the opencast mine, the canal would be reinstated was successful. Two lowered bridges had been rebuilt by June 2001, and Cow Lane Bridge followed in May 2002. Four more locks were restored, with the section from Chesterfield being reopened to navigation in 2002.

In a separate development, a private owner of a length of the canal near Boiley Farm, Killamarsh, obtained a Derelict Land Grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992. Although used as fishing ponds, the work resulted in a navigable profile being re-established, and a water supply was obtained from a small unnamed brook, which feeds into the southern end of the ponds. An earth bund at the site of the former Gallas footbridge divides the channel into two ponds, and carries a public footpath. In 1997, the Chesterfield Canal Trust was formed, as a limited company with charitable aims, and took over the assets of the Canal Society in 1998.

A breach in the canal in March 2007, caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the Tinkersick Brook under the canal, forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above Tapton Lock for about six weeks. Near the site of the former Renishaw Iron Foundry, which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing, a length of canal was re-excavated in 2007–08. The work included the new Renishaw Foundry footbridge (18a), which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal, and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the Smithy Brook. The development of the site ceased in 2010, when there were issues with ownership of the land. Since then, there have been issues with vandalism, and the lack of a natural water supply has been a continuing problem.

Over the winter of 2010–11, the Canal Trust obtained its first permanent base, when the lock house at Hollingwood Lock was renovated and a large extension added to the rear. The building, which is known as the Hollingwood Hub, was funded by a grant from Community Assets, part of the government&#x27;s Office for Civil Society, and provides offices for the Trust, a meeting room and a coffee shop. The ecology of the area was improved by the planting of 450 trees, provided by the Woodland Trust, in November 2011.

The next big advance was the opening of some of canal beyond Mill Green Bridge, and the construction of a new mooring basin at Staveley, which was completed in early 2012. Funding for the basin was provided by Derbyshire County Council with a grant from the East Midlands Development Agency, and the work which included the reclamation of the surrounding land, won an award from the Institute of Civil Engineers, given jointly to Derbyshire and the contractors NT Killingley. The work was aided by a road-building scheme for a new Staveley Bypass, which enabled two bridges to be raised and a third to be built, all with sufficient clearance for navigation.

===North from Staveley===

Progress beyond Staveley Basin was hampered by a railway bridge. The first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east, and was erected in the 1850s, when the canal arm to Speedwell Colliery was filled in, to be converted to a railway. The Staveley Ironworks railway system was sold to the Midland Railway in the 1870s, who built a replacement line and bridge, to ease the sharpness of the curve. This area has suffered from subsidence, so when the canal was formally abandoned, the twin-track iron bow girder bridge was removed and the canal was filled in. A combination of the subsidence, and the use of a deep ballast base to enable tracks to be carried straight over any new bridge has reduced the available headroom by . The solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound, with a new Staveley Town Lock (5a) immediately to the north of Staveley Basin to lower the level of the canal, and Railway Lock (5b) constructed just beyond the railway bridge. A syphon will maintain the water supply to the canal beyond the dropped pound. Staveley Town Lock was completed just in time for the Inland Waterways Association National Trailboat Festival, which was held at Staveley over the bank holiday weekend in late May 2016.

The first boat passed through the lock on 26 May, and it was officially opened on 28 May. However, once the festival was over, a clay bund had been reinstated above the lock by 16 June, and the pound below it drained, in order to allow work to continue on the weir and spillway which carries excess water back to the River Rother. Although the track on the mineral line has been removed, its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot, for the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway project. On 1 October 2017, the Trust received permission from Network Rail to investigate the bridge remains, and the infill was removed over the next few days.

===Chesterfield Waterside===

The southern end of the canal in Chesterfield is being redeveloped as part of a £300 million project called Chesterfield Waterside. This will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently derelict land. The project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site, navigation being restored to a length of the river, and a new basin at the southern edge of the site. Funding for the canal work was provided by a grant of £500,000 from the East Midlands Development Agency. The basin was completed and was opened in October 2009, although it remains isolated from the River Rother, to which it will be connected by a lock, while a back-pumping facility will supply it with water. Outline planning permission for the whole site was granted on 15 March 2010. In April 2012, the project was awarded a £2.4 million grant by the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership Board. The funding was for the connecting lock and the provision of sewers and access roads, to facilitate the subsequent development of the site.

===Closing the gap===
With the canal open from West Stockwith to the eastern portal of Norwood Tunnel, and from Chesterfield to Staveley, there were less than left to be restored by 2017. Whereas most of the work so far had involved restoration of the existing channel, this section includes some significant engineering challenges, with completely new construction needed to bypass the housing estate in Killamarsh, built over the original line in the 1970s, and the replacement of Norwood Tunnel with an alternative route. The Chesterfield Canal Partnership, an association of local and regional authorities, including the Chesterfield Canal Trust and other interested parties, have produced detailed plans for all of the work required to reinstate the missing section.

In 2004, the engineers Jacobs-Babtie examined six possible routes for the canal through Killamarsh. Of these, two were reasonably feasible, and were named Central Line East and Central Line West. At the time, the eastern route was felt to be the best option, and consultation with residents resulted in that route being included in the North East Derbyshire Local Plan. However, subsequent detailed design suggests that this may no longer be the best route. Redevelopment of the Tarran Bungalows site to the west of the village provided opportunities to reassess the western route, and it has gained support, as it would be more attractive for boaters, allowing them to access the village more readily. This route would also be considerably cheaper to construct that the eastern route. Both routes drop down into Nethermoor Lake, part of the Rother Valley Country Park and will ascend from the far side to regain the original course.

It will not be possible to reopen the Norwood Tunnel, as several sections have collapsed, the National Coal Board filled in some sections to stabilise the land above it, and when the M1 motorway was built, the tunnel below it was injection grouted, to ensure there would not be a subsequent collapse. The engineers Arup considered options for this section in 2007, proposing a route running largely on the surface, and crossing the site of the Kiveton Park Colliery, which closed in 1994. It involved an extra six locks at the top of the Norwood flight of 13 locks, passing under the motorway by using a farm underpass, and then descending through another six new locks, to enter the final of the tunnel. In 2012 the UK Government&#x27;s announcement of the preferred route for the HS2 rail line extension to Leeds indicated that the line would conflict with the planned restoration of the Canal in several places. The Chesterfield Canal Trust campaigned to have the needs of the Canal taken into account during the consultation process. The July 2017 announcement on the phase 2b route to be developed removed blight from the canal route. This revised route for the HS2 railway resulted in other options being considered for the tunnel replacement route. One is for a short tunnel at the western end, starting at the existing western portal, but heading in a different direction. The tunnel would be some long, passing under the route of HS2 and the M1 motorway, allowing HS2 to be constructed without interfering with navigation. The scheme would save the need to construct six locks, and engineers were assessing the cost of such a scheme in late 2017.
In 2020, the Trust submitted a planning application covering reinstatement of the remaining section that lies within the borough of Chesterfield. HS2 opposed the application, on the basis that the two projects were incompatible, but in February 2021, an agreement was reached between the Trust and HS2 to allow both to be constructed. Planning permission was then granted for the reinstatement from Staveley to Renishaw, including Brindley&#x27;s Puddle Bank which carries the canal across the valley of the River Doe Lea. The canal was breached after closure to prevent flooding by the river, which passed under the canal in a culvert, and the new crossing will feature a aqueduct. At Renishaw, of canal were restored in 2010 but have since become derelict again, due to a failure to reach agreement with the Environment Agency over water supplies. That issue should be resolved as part of the development. Meanwhile, Staveley Town Basin has been renamed Staveley Waterside, as plans for a new village with a hotel and marina have been announced by Derbyshire County Council.

In 2023, the canal trust received a grant of £5.3 million from the Staveley Town Deal, part of the £25.2 million awarded to Staveley in 2021 from the government&#x27;s Towns Fund. The grant was expected to cover restoration of the canal from Staveley to the River Doe Lea crossing at the end of Staveley puddle bank. Some 160,000 cubic metres of clay were also donated by a local developer called Suon, with royalties for its extraction waived by the Chatsworth Estate. The clay will be used to rebuild the puddle bank, parts of which were removed in 1972 when it was bulldozed. Delays and escalating costs mean that the Staveley Town Deal award will no longer cover the full restoration of the puddle bank, but on 25 October 2024, a new bridge carrying the Trans Pennine Trail over the route of the canal was installed. This will allow the canal to be restored beneath it, as far as Bellhouse Lane, where the entrance basin to the former Lowgates Arm will provide winding space.

==Features==
What are often called &quot;traditional&quot; working narrowboats were the product of the main canal system – but the craft that plied the 46 miles between Chesterfield, Retford, and the River Trent were very different. Isolated on the fringes of the inland waterways network there were no outside canal influences to change the design of craft that were adequate for the job they had to do. The cabins were below-decks, and the boatmen always had a home ashore. Short journeys, usually with a crew of two, did not generate colourful decorations of roses-and-castles, nor did engines oust the towing horse, not even as late as the 1950s. None of the original &quot;cuckoo&quot; boats have survived, although the last one was extensively measured and recorded in 1976, prior to it being broken up. This has enabled the Canal Trust to create a new boat, named the &quot;Dawn Rose&quot;, which was constructed at Shireoaks Marina using traditional methods. Wood was bought in 2007, and construction started in 2011, with the boat being completed and launched in April 2015.

Norwood Tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the Chesterfield Canal with its Western Portal in Norwood, Derbyshire and its Eastern Portal in Kiveton, South Yorkshire. Although a small section of it at the eastern end may be reused as part of the restoration, most of it will remain abandoned, as it has suffered from subsidence, and parts of it have been filled in.

Drakeholes Tunnel is a second, shorter tunnel 154 yards long also without a towpath built for the Chesterfield Canal at Drakeholes, Nottinghamshire a location between the Norwood Tunnel and the River Trent. In order to allow it to be navigated by wide-beam boats, it was built wide and high. Most of it was cut through solid sandstone, and so remained unlined until 1983, when some of the rock was found to be eroding.

Hollingwood Common Tunnel is a disused navigable coalmine adit which terminated at the Chesterfield Canal near Staveley. This tunnel was long, and its water level was maintained lower than that of the canal. This level was maintained by drainage through a culvert running beneath the canal, and required the transhipment of coal at the terminus. The boats used were loaded underground within the coalmine the tunnel served; these boats were long and wide.

Proposals are at early stages for a link north from Killamarsh to the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation along the River Rother, to be called the Rother Link. This would provide a way to reach the Chesterfield Canal without negotiating the tidal River Trent, and would create a new cruising ring, taking in the Rother Link, River Don Navigation, Stainforth and Keadby Canal, River Trent, and Chesterfield Canal.

The towpath of the canal has become a long-distance footpath and cycle route, stretching for from Chesterfield to West Stockwith, and is signposted as the &quot;Cuckoo Way&quot; after the name given to the boats which worked on the canal. Parts of the towpath beside the western section of the route are also part of the Trans Pennine Trail cycle route.

The Chesterfield Canal hit international headlines in 1978. While dredging the bottom of the canal to remove rubbish a maintenance team pulled up a large chain which had a wooden plug attached to it. Later that day, it was noticed that a whirlpool had formed and it became evident that the section of the canal between Whitsunday Pie Lock and Retford Town Lock was losing water. Investigation revealed that the plug was an original engineering feature of the canal, having been installed to allow sections to be drained for future maintenance purposes. The water drained (as designed) harmlessly into the nearby river Idle. The Retford event became a national and international story at the time, and was even recorded in Lloyd&#x27;s List. However, these plugs were a common feature of English canals built at that time and other instances of sudden drainage (both purposeful and accidental) have since been recorded, including emptying of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen Canal.

<text>In Norway, the district court (, literally &quot;thing court&quot;) is the first court instance, and handles both criminal and civil cases. The chief judge of a district court is the chief district judge ().

The ruling of the district court may be appealed to the next level of court, the court of appeal, and the court of appeal&#x27;s ruling may in turn be appealed to the supreme court, but only in select cases of precedential relevance admitted by the supreme court. Thus the vast majority of court cases are decided on by the district court or the court of appeal.

The term &quot;tingrett&quot; for the district courts was introduced in 2002, replacing the previous terms city court (&quot;byrett&quot;) and district court (&quot;herredsrett&quot;). Historically the district courts outside the cities were known as &quot;sorenskriveri&quot; (office of a &quot;sorenskriver&quot;), and consisted of a single (chief) district judge and often one or two assistant judges. The district usually included multiple parishes/municipalities, and the district judge was typically the highest state official within his jurisdiction, with an almost all-encompassing area of jurisdiction and an important role in the regional state administration.

==Criminal cases==
Since August 1995, all criminal cases which go to court are tried at the district court first. Prior to this, the most serious cases were tried in the Court of appeal (&quot;lagmannsrett&quot;). Regular trials are usually held before a panel of three judges, one professional and two lay judges. In particularly difficult cases the bench may consist of five judges (two professional and three lay judges). Verdicts and sentences are determined by a majority vote, with the lay judges&#x27; votes counting the same as the professional judge. If there is a full confession, and the defendant agrees to it, the trial may be held before a single professional judge who hears the case and determines sentencing.

==Civil cases==
The district court is the second tier in most civil cases, the first tier being the conciliation board (&quot;forliksråd&quot;). Certain cases cannot be held at the conciliation board, including family law, patent and trademark issues, cases against the authorities, and cases where an independent complaints committee has issued an opinion. In addition, larger cases where both sides are representad by attorneys, and other cases where extrajudicial mediation have taken place, may bypass the conciliation board and go straight to the district court. The district court also hears appeals from the conciliation board.

Civil cases are normally held before a single professional judge, but either side can demand two lay judges be seated as well. In some cases the law demands that there be two lay judges with competence in the subject matter.

In 2021, there are 23 district courts in Norway.

<doc id="166896" wikidata="Q891766" url="?curid=166896" title="Fokker–Planck equation">
<text>In statistical mechanics and information theory, the Fokker–Planck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle under the influence of drag forces and random forces, as in Brownian motion. The equation can be generalized to other observables as well. The Fokker–Planck equation has multiple applications in information theory, graph theory, data science, finance, economics etc.

It is named after Adriaan Fokker and Max Planck, who described it in 1914 and 1917. It is also known as the Kolmogorov forward equation, after Andrey Kolmogorov, who independently discovered it in 1931. When applied to particle position distributions, it is better known as the Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), and in this context it is equivalent to the convection–diffusion equation. When applied to particle position and momentum distributions, it is known as the Klein–Kramers equation. The case with zero diffusion is the continuity equation. The Fokker–Planck equation is obtained from the master equation through Kramers–Moyal expansion.

The first consistent microscopic derivation of the Fokker–Planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Nikolay Krylov.

==One dimension==
In one spatial dimension &quot;x&quot;, for an Itô process driven by the standard Wiener process formula_1 and described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE)
formula_2
with drift formula_3 and diffusion coefficient formula_4, the Fokker–Planck equation for the probability density formula_5 of the random variable formula_6 is 
In the following, use formula_7.

Define the infinitesimal generator formula_8 (the following can be found in Ref.):
formula_9

The &quot;transition probability&quot; formula_10, the probability of going from formula_11 to formula_12, is introduced here; the expectation can be written as
formula_13
Now we replace in the definition of formula_8, multiply by formula_10 and integrate over formula_16. The limit is taken on
formula_17
Note now that
formula_18
which is the Chapman–Kolmogorov theorem. Changing the dummy variable formula_19 to formula_20, one gets
formula_21
which is a time derivative. Finally we arrive to
formula_22
From here, the Kolmogorov backward equation can be deduced. If we instead use the adjoint operator of formula_8, formula_24, defined such that
formula_25
then we arrive to the Kolmogorov forward equation, or Fokker–Planck equation, which, simplifying the notation formula_26, in its differential form reads
formula_27

Remains the issue of defining explicitly formula_8. This can be done taking the expectation from the integral form of the Itô&#x27;s lemma:
formula_29

The part that depends on formula_30 vanished because of the martingale property.

Then, for a particle subject to an Itô equation, using
formula_31
it can be easily calculated, using integration by parts, that
formula_32
which bring us to the Fokker–Planck equation:
formula_33

While the Fokker–Planck equation is used with problems where the initial distribution is known, if the problem is to know the distribution at previous times, the Feynman–Kac formula can be used, which is a consequence of the Kolmogorov backward equation.

The stochastic process defined above in the Itô sense can be rewritten within the Stratonovich convention as a Stratonovich SDE:
formula_34
It includes an added noise-induced drift term due to diffusion gradient effects if the noise is state-dependent. This convention is more often used in physical applications. Indeed, it is well known that any solution to the Stratonovich SDE is a solution to the Itô SDE.

The zero-drift equation with constant diffusion can be considered as a model of classical Brownian motion:
formula_35

This model has discrete spectrum of solutions if the condition of fixed boundaries is added for formula_36:
formula_37

It has been shown that in this case an analytical spectrum of solutions allows deriving a local uncertainty relation for the coordinate-velocity phase volume:
formula_38
Here formula_39 is a minimal value of a corresponding diffusion spectrum formula_40, while formula_41 and formula_42 represent the uncertainty of coordinate–velocity definition.

==Higher dimensions==
More generally, if

formula_43

where formula_44 and formula_45 are -dimensional vectors, formula_46 is an formula_47 matrix and formula_48 is an &quot;M&quot;-dimensional standard Wiener process, the probability density formula_49 for formula_44 satisfies the Fokker–Planck equationwith drift vector formula_51 and diffusion tensor formula_52, i.e.formula_53

If instead of an Itô SDE, a Stratonovich SDE is considered,

formula_54

the Fokker–Planck equation will read:

formula_55

== Generalization ==
In general, the Fokker–Planck equations are a special case to the general Kolmogorov forward equation

formula_56

where the linear operator formula_57 is the Hermitian adjoint to the infinitesimal generator for the Markov process.

==Examples==

===Wiener process===

A standard scalar Wiener process is generated by the stochastic differential equation

formula_58

Here the drift term is zero and the diffusion coefficient is 1/2. Thus the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation is

formula_59

which is the simplest form of a diffusion equation. If the initial condition is formula_60, the solution is

formula_61

=== Boltzmann distribution at the thermodynamic equilibrium ===

The overdamped Langevin equationformula_62gives formula_63. The Boltzmann distribution formula_64 is an equilibrium distribution, and assuming formula_65 grows sufficiently rapidly (that is, the potential well is deep enough to confine the particle), the Boltzmann distribution is the unique equilibrium.

===Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process===

The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a process defined as

formula_66

with formula_67. Physically, this equation can be motivated as follows: a particle of mass formula_68 with velocity formula_69 moving in a medium, e.g., a fluid, will experience a friction force which resists motion whose magnitude can be approximated as being proportional to particle&#x27;s velocity formula_70 with formula_71. Other particles in the medium will randomly kick the particle as they collide with it and this effect can be approximated by a white noise term; formula_72. Newton&#x27;s second law is written as

formula_73

Taking formula_74 for simplicity and changing the notation as formula_75 leads to the familiar form formula_76.

The corresponding Fokker–Planck equation is
formula_77

The stationary solution (formula_78) is
formula_79

===Plasma physics===

In plasma physics, the distribution function for a particle species formula_80, formula_81, takes the place of the probability density function. The corresponding Boltzmann equation is given by

formula_82

where the third term includes the particle acceleration due to the Lorentz force and the Fokker–Planck term at the right-hand side represents the effects of particle collisions. The quantities formula_83 and formula_84 are the average change in velocity a particle of type formula_80 experiences due to collisions with all other particle species in unit time. Expressions for these quantities are given elsewhere. If collisions are ignored, the Boltzmann equation reduces to the Vlasov equation.

== Smoluchowski diffusion equation ==
Consider an overdamped Brownian particle under external force formula_86:formula_87where the formula_88 term is negligible (the meaning of &quot;overdamped&quot;). Thus, it is just formula_89. The Fokker–Planck equation for this particle is the Smoluchowski diffusion equation:
formula_90Where formula_91 is the diffusion constant and formula_92. The importance of this equation is it allows for both the inclusion of the effect of temperature on the system of particles and a spatially dependent diffusion constant.
Starting with the Langevin Equation of a Brownian particle in external field formula_86, where formula_94 is the friction term, formula_95 is a fluctuating force on the particle, and formula_96 is the amplitude of the fluctuation.

formula_87

At equilibrium the frictional force is much greater than the inertial force, formula_98. Therefore, the Langevin equation becomes,

formula_99

Which generates the following Fokker–Planck equation,

formula_100

Rearranging the Fokker–Planck equation,

formula_101

Where formula_102. Note, the diffusion coefficient may not necessarily be spatially independent if formula_96 or formula_94 are spatially dependent.

Next, the total number of particles in any particular volume is given by,

formula_105

Therefore, the flux of particles can be determined by taking the time derivative of the number of particles in a given volume, plugging in the Fokker–Planck equation, and then applying Gauss&#x27;s Theorem.

formula_106

formula_107

In equilibrium, it is assumed that the flux goes to zero. Therefore, Boltzmann statistics can be applied for the probability of a particles location at equilibrium, where formula_108 is a conservative force and the probability of a particle being in a state formula_109 is given as formula_110.

formula_111

formula_112

This relation is a realization of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Now applying formula_113 to formula_114 and using the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem,

formula_115

Rearranging,

formula_116

Therefore, the Fokker–Planck equation becomes the Smoluchowski equation,
formula_117
for an arbitrary force formula_86.

==Computational considerations==
Brownian motion follows the Langevin equation, which can be solved for many different stochastic forcings with results being averaged (canonical ensemble in molecular dynamics). However, instead of this computationally intensive approach, one can use the Fokker–Planck equation and consider the probability formula_119 of the particle having a velocity in the interval formula_120 when it starts its motion with formula_121 at time 0.

=== 1-D linear potential example===
Brownian dynamics in one dimension is simple.

==== Theory ====
Starting with a linear potential of the form formula_122 the corresponding Smoluchowski equation becomes,

formula_123

Where the diffusion constant, formula_91, is constant over space and time. The boundary conditions are such that the probability vanishes at formula_125 with an initial condition of the ensemble of particles starting in the same place, formula_126.

Defining formula_127 and formula_128 and applying the coordinate transformation,

formula_129

With formula_130 the Smoluchowki equation becomes,
formula_131

Which is the free diffusion equation with solution,
formula_132

And after transforming back to the original coordinates,
formula_133

==== Simulation ====
The simulation on the right was completed using a Brownian dynamics simulation. Starting with a Langevin equation for the system,
formula_134
where formula_94 is the friction term, formula_95 is a fluctuating force on the particle, and formula_96 is the amplitude of the fluctuation. At equilibrium the frictional force is much greater than the inertial force, formula_138. Therefore, the Langevin equation becomes,
formula_139

For the Brownian dynamic simulation the fluctuation force formula_140 is assumed to be Gaussian with the amplitude being dependent of the temperature of the system formula_141. Rewriting the Langevin equation,

formula_142
where formula_143 is the Einstein relation. The integration of this equation was done using the Euler–Maruyama method to numerically approximate the path of this Brownian particle.

==Solution==
Being a partial differential equation, the Fokker–Planck equation can be solved analytically only in special cases. A formal analogy of the Fokker–Planck equation with the Schrödinger equation allows the use of advanced operator techniques known from quantum mechanics for its solution in a number of cases. Furthermore, in the case of overdamped dynamics when the Fokker–Planck equation contains second partial derivatives with respect to all spatial variables, the equation can be written in the form of a master equation that can easily be solved numerically.
In many applications, one is only interested in the steady-state probability distribution formula_144, which can be found from formula_145.
The computation of mean first passage times and splitting probabilities can be reduced to the solution of an ordinary differential equation which is intimately related to the Fokker–Planck equation.

==Particular cases with known solution and inversion==
In mathematical finance for volatility smile modeling of options via local volatility, one has the problem of deriving a diffusion coefficient formula_146 consistent with a probability density obtained from market option quotes. The problem is therefore an inversion of the Fokker–Planck equation: Given the density f(x,t) of the option underlying &quot;X&quot; deduced from the option market, one aims at finding the local volatility formula_146 consistent with &quot;f&quot;. This is an inverse problem that has been solved in general by Dupire (1994, 1997) with a non-parametric solution. Brigo and Mercurio (2002, 2003) propose a solution in parametric form via a particular local volatility formula_146 consistent with a solution of the Fokker–Planck equation given by a mixture model. More information is available also in Fengler (2008), Gatheral (2008), and Musiela and Rutkowski (2008).

==Fokker–Planck equation and path integral==

Every Fokker–Planck equation is equivalent to a path integral. The path integral formulation is an excellent starting point for the application of field theory methods. This is used, for instance, in critical dynamics.

A derivation of the path integral is possible in a similar way as in quantum mechanics. The derivation for a Fokker–Planck equation with one variable formula_20 is as follows. Start by inserting a delta function and then integrating by parts:

formula_150

The formula_20-derivatives here only act on the formula_152-function, not on formula_153. Integrate over a time interval formula_154,

formula_155

Insert the Fourier integral

formula_156

for the formula_152-function,

formula_158

This equation expresses formula_159 as functional of formula_153. Iterating formula_161 times and performing the limit formula_162 gives a path integral with action

formula_163

The variables formula_164 conjugate to formula_20 are called &quot;response variables&quot;.

Although formally equivalent, different problems may be solved more easily in the Fokker–Planck equation or the path integral formulation. The equilibrium distribution for instance may be obtained more directly from the Fokker–Planck equation.

<doc id="166898" wikidata="Q1862434" url="?curid=166898" title="Knot invariant">
<text>In the mathematical field of knot theory, a knot invariant is a quantity (in a broad sense) defined for each knot which is the same for equivalent knots. The equivalence is often given by ambient isotopy but can be given by homeomorphism. Some invariants are indeed numbers (algebraic), but invariants can range from the simple, such as a yes/no answer, to those as complex as a homology theory (for example, &quot;a &quot;knot invariant&quot; is a rule that assigns to any knot a quantity such that if and are equivalent then .&quot;). Research on invariants is not only motivated by the basic problem of distinguishing one knot from another but also to understand fundamental properties of knots and their relations to other branches of mathematics. Knot invariants are thus used in knot classification, both in &quot;enumeration&quot; and &quot;duplication removal&quot;.

From the modern perspective, it is natural to define a knot invariant from a knot diagram. Of course, it must be unchanged (that is to say, invariant) under the Reidemeister moves (&quot;triangular moves&quot;). Tricolorability (and &quot;n&quot;-colorability) is a particularly simple and common example. Other examples are knot polynomials, such as the Jones polynomial, which are currently among the most useful invariants for distinguishing knots from one another, though currently it is not known whether there exists a knot polynomial which distinguishes all knots from each other. However, there are invariants which distinguish the unknot from all other knots, such as Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology.

Other invariants can be defined by considering some integer-valued function of knot diagrams and taking its minimum value over all possible diagrams of a given knot. This category includes the crossing number, which is the minimum number of crossings for any diagram of the knot, and the bridge number, which is the minimum number of bridges for any diagram of the knot.

Historically, many of the early knot invariants are not defined by first selecting a diagram but defined intrinsically, which can make computing some of these invariants a challenge. For example, knot genus is particularly tricky to compute, but can be effective (for instance, in distinguishing mutants).

The complement of a knot itself (as a topological space) is known to be a &quot;complete invariant&quot; of the knot by the Gordon–Luecke theorem in the sense that it distinguishes the given knot from all other knots up to ambient isotopy and mirror image. Some invariants associated with the knot complement include the knot group which is just the fundamental group of the complement. The knot quandle is also a complete invariant in this sense but it is difficult to determine if two quandles are isomorphic. The peripheral subgroup can also work as a complete invariant.

By Mostow–Prasad rigidity, the hyperbolic structure on the complement of a hyperbolic link is unique, which means the hyperbolic volume is an invariant for these knots and links. Volume, and other hyperbolic invariants, have proven very effective, utilized in some of the extensive efforts at knot tabulation.

In recent years, there has been much interest in homological invariants of knots which categorify well-known invariants. Heegaard Floer homology is a homology theory whose Euler characteristic is the Alexander polynomial of the knot. It has been proven effective in deducing new results about the classical invariants. Along a different line of study, there is a combinatorially defined cohomology theory of knots called Khovanov homology whose Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. This has recently been shown to be useful in obtaining bounds on slice genus whose earlier proofs required gauge theory. Mikhail Khovanov and Lev Rozansky have since defined several other related cohomology theories whose Euler characteristics recover other classical invariants. Catharina Stroppel gave a representation theoretic interpretation of Khovanov homology by categorifying quantum group invariants.

There is also growing interest from both knot theorists and scientists in understanding &quot;physical&quot; or geometric properties of knots and relating it to topological invariants and knot type. An old result in this direction is the Fáry–Milnor theorem states that if the total curvature of a knot in formula_1 satisfies

:formula_2

where is the curvature at , then is an unknot. Therefore, for knotted curves,

:formula_3

An example of a &quot;physical&quot; invariant is ropelength, which is the length of unit-diameter rope needed to realize a particular knot type.

<doc id="166899" wikidata="Q380550" url="?curid=166899" title="Eugene McCarthy">
<text>Eugene Joseph McCarthy (March 29, 1916December 10, 2005) was an American politician, writer, and academic from Minnesota. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the United States Senate from 1959 to 1971. McCarthy sought the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1968 election, challenging incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson on an anti-Vietnam War platform. McCarthy unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president four more times.

Born in Watkins, Minnesota, McCarthy became an economics professor after earning a graduate degree from the University of Minnesota. He served as a code breaker for the United States Department of War during World War II. McCarthy became a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (the state affiliate of the Democratic Party) and in 1948 was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served until being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1958. McCarthy was a prominent supporter of Adlai Stevenson II for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960, and was himself a candidate for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1964. He co-sponsored the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, though he later expressed regret about its impact and became a member of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

As the 1960s progressed, McCarthy emerged as a prominent opponent of Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War. After Robert F. Kennedy declined the request of a group of antiwar Democrats to challenge Johnson in the 1968 Democratic primaries, McCarthy entered the race on an antiwar platform. Though he was initially given little chance of winning, the Tet Offensive galvanized opposition to the war, and McCarthy finished in a strong second place in the New Hampshire primary. After that, Kennedy entered the race, and Johnson announced that he would not seek reelection. McCarthy and Kennedy each won several primary contests.

The race was upended in June 1968 when Kennedy was assassinated. McCarthy won a plurality of both the popular vote and the delegate count in the Democratic primaries, but the rules at the time did not bind delegates to their primary results. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, his delegates became uncommitted, with most ultimately backing Vice PresidentHubert Humphrey, who had not actively campaigned in the primaries. He had entered the primaries in April 1968 and was the preferred candidate of President Lyndon B. Johnson. This gave Humphrey the majority needed to secure the Democratic nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

McCarthy did not seek reelection in the 1970 Senate election. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 but fared poorly in the primaries. He ran in several more races after that but was never elected to another office. He ran as an Independent in the 1976 presidential election and won 0.9% of the popular vote. He was a plaintiff in the landmark campaign finance case &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; and supported Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.

==Early life==
McCarthy was born in Watkins, Minnesota. He was the son of a deeply religious Catholic woman of German ancestry, Anna Baden McCarthy, and a strong-willed man of Irish descent, Michael John McCarthy Jr., a postmaster and cattle buyer.

McCarthy grew up in Watkins with his parents and three siblings. He attended St. Anthony&#x27;s Catholic School in Watkins, and spent hours reading his aunt&#x27;s &quot;Harvard Classics&quot;. He was influenced by the monks at nearby St. John&#x27;s Abbey and University in Collegeville, Minnesota, and attended school there, at Saint John&#x27;s Preparatory School, from which he graduated in 1932. He also went to college at Saint John&#x27;s University, graduating in 1935. McCarthy earned his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Minnesota in 1939. He taught in public schools in Minnesota and North Dakota from 1935 to 1940, when he became a professor of economics and education at St. John&#x27;s, working there from 1940 to 1943.

While at St. John&#x27;s, he coached the hockey team for one season.

In 1943, considering the contemplative life of a monk, he became a Benedictine novice at Saint John&#x27;s Abbey. After nine months as a monk he left the monastery, causing a fellow novice to say, &quot;It was like losing a 20-game winner&quot;. He enlisted in the Army, serving as a code breaker for the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department in Washington, D.C. in 1944. He was then an instructor in sociology and economics at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, from 1946 to 1949.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
McCarthy became a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. In 1948 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives with labor and Catholic support, representing Minnesota&#x27;s 4th congressional district until 1959. He became the leader of young liberals, predominately from the Midwest, called &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s Marauders&quot;.

In 1952 he engaged Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy (no relation) in a nationally televised debate in which he parodied the Senator&#x27;s arguments to &quot;prove&quot; that General Douglas MacArthur had been a communist pawn. In 1958 he was elected to the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senate==

He served as a member of (among other committees) the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. McCarthy became known to a larger audience in 1960 when he supported twice-defeated presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson for the Democratic nomination. He pleaded during his speech nominating Stevenson, &quot;Do not reject this man who made us all proud to be called Democrats!&quot; He joked about his own merits as a candidate, &quot;I&#x27;m twice as liberal as Hubert Humphrey, twice as intelligent as Stuart Symington, and twice as Catholic as Jack Kennedy.&quot; He was considered as a possible running mate for Lyndon Johnson in 1964, only to see fellow Minnesota Senator Humphrey chosen for that position.

McCarthy voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Medicare program. He did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1968 or on the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Along with Ted Kennedy, McCarthy was one of the original co-sponsors of the Immigration Act of 1965. He later regretted this, noting that &quot;unrecognized by virtually all of the bill&#x27;s supporters were provisions which would eventually lead to unprecedented growth in numbers and the transfer of policy control from the elected representatives of the American people to individuals wishing to bring relatives to this country&quot;. He became a member of the Federation for American Immigration Reform&#x27;s board of advisors.

McCarthy met with Marxist-Leninist revolutionary Che Guevara in New York City in 1964 to discuss repairing relations between the US and Cuba. They met in journalist Lisa Howard&#x27;s apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan. The 2008 film &quot;&quot; depicts this event.

==1968 presidential campaign==

===McCarthy challenges Johnson===
In 1968, Allard K. Lowenstein and his anti-Vietnam War Dump Johnson movement recruited McCarthy to run against incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson. Reportedly, Lowenstein first attempted to recruit Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who declined to run, then Senator George McGovern, who also declined (Kennedy eventually decided to run after the primary on March 16, 1968, and McGovern also later briefly entered the race). McCarthy entered and almost defeated Johnson in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, with the intention of influencing the federal government—then controlled by Democrats—to curtail its involvement in the Vietnam War. A number of antiwar college students and other activists from around the country traveled to New Hampshire to support McCarthy&#x27;s campaign. Some antiwar students who had the long-haired, counterculture appearance of hippies chose to cut their long hair and shave off their beards in order to campaign for McCarthy door-to-door, a phenomenon that led to the informal slogan &quot;Get clean for Gene&quot;.

McCarthy&#x27;s decision to run arose partly as an outcome of Oregon Senator Wayne Morse&#x27;s opposition to the war. Morse was one of two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of August 1964. He gave speeches denouncing the war before it had entered most Americans&#x27; awareness. Thereafter, several politically active Oregon Democrats asked Kennedy to run as an antiwar candidate. McCarthy also encouraged Kennedy to run. After Kennedy refused, the group asked McCarthy to run, and he responded favorably. After Kennedy entered the race and Johnson withdrew, however, McCarthy shifted his focus toward Kennedy.

McCarthy declared his candidacy on November 30, 1967, saying, &quot;I am concerned that the Administration seems to have set no limit to the price it is willing to pay for a military victory.&quot; Political experts and the news media dismissed his candidacy, and he was given little chance of making any impact against Johnson in the primaries. But public perception of him changed following the Tet Offensive (January 30 – February 23, 1968), the aftermath of which saw many Democrats grow disillusioned with the war, and quite a few interested in an alternative to Johnson. McCarthy said, &quot;My decision to challenge the President&#x27;s position and the administration&#x27;s position has been strengthened by recent announcements out of the administration. The evident intention to escalate and to intensify the war in Vietnam, and on the other hand, the absence of any positive indication or suggestion for a compromise or for a negotiated political settlement.&quot;

On December 3, 1967, McCarthy addressed the Conference of Concerned Democrats in Chicago, accusing the Johnson administration of ignoring and bungling opportunities for bringing the war to a conclusion. Eight days later it was reported that he had suggested abandoning some areas of South Vietnam to the Viet Cong. On February 17, 1968, it was reported that McCarthy&#x27;s campaign had raised only a quarter of the funds it had hoped to raise nationally.

As his volunteers (led by youth coordinator Sam Brown) went door to door in New Hampshire, and as the media began paying more serious attention to the senator, McCarthy began to rise in the polls. When he received 42% of the vote to Johnson&#x27;s 49% in the March 12 New Hampshire primary (and 20 of New Hampshire&#x27;s 24 delegates to the Democratic convention), it became clear that there was deep division among Democrats about the war. By this time, Johnson had become inextricably defined by Vietnam, and this demonstration of divided support within his party meant his reelection (only four years after winning the highest percentage of the popular vote in modern history) seemed unlikely. The folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary released a record &quot;Eugene McCarthy For President (If You Love Your Country)&quot;, endorsing McCarthy, who they said had stood alone against Johnson over &quot;more timid men&quot; now echoing him.

=== Kennedy enters the race ===
On March 16, Robert F. Kennedy announced that he would run; many Democrats saw Kennedy as a stronger candidate than McCarthy. On March 31, Johnson surprised the world by announcing that he would not seek reelection. After that, McCarthy won in Wisconsin, where the Kennedy campaign was still getting organized. McCarthy also won in Oregon against a well-organized Kennedy effort; it was considered his first official victory over Kennedy.

McCarthy styled himself as a clean politician, but criticized his opponents. Known for his wit, when asked if Michigan Governor George Romney&#x27;s comment that Romney had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; about the Vietnam War had ended Romney&#x27;s presidential hopes, McCarthy remarked, &quot;Well... no, not really. Anyway, I think in that case a light rinse would have been sufficient.&quot; He mocked Kennedy and his supporters. A major gaffe occurred in Oregon, when McCarthy called Kennedy supporters &quot;less intelligent&quot; than his own and belittled Indiana (which had by then gone for Kennedy) for lacking a poet of the stature of Robert Lowell—a friend of McCarthy&#x27;s who often traveled with him. In May, Kennedy attacked McCarthy&#x27;s civil rights record.

Some of those who joined McCarthy&#x27;s effort early on were Kennedy loyalists. Now that Kennedy was in the race, many of them jumped ship, urging McCarthy to drop out and support Kennedy. McCarthy resented that Kennedy had let him do the &quot;dirty work&quot; of challenging Johnson and entered the race only when it became apparent that Johnson was vulnerable. As a result, while he initially entered the campaign with few illusions of winning, McCarthy now devoted himself to beating Kennedy (and Humphrey, who entered the race after Johnson withdrew) and gaining the nomination.

Humphrey, long a champion of labor unions and of civil rights, entered the race with the support of the party &quot;establishment&quot;, including most members of Congress, mayors, governors and labor union leaders. He entered too late to compete in any primaries, but had the support of Johnson and many Democratic insiders.

Kennedy, like his brother John in 1960, planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries. McCarthy and Kennedy squared off in California, knowing that the result there would be decisive. They both campaigned vigorously up and down the state, with many polls showing them neck-and-neck, and a few predicting a McCarthy victory.

A televised debate between them began to tilt undecided voters away from McCarthy. He made two statements many found ill-considered: that he would accept a government including Communists in South Vietnam, and that only the relocation of inner-city blacks would solve the urban problem. Kennedy pounced, portraying the former idea as soft on communism and the latter as a scheme to bus tens of thousands of ghetto residents into white, conservative Orange County. Kennedy won the California primary on June 4, but was shot after his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, and died soon afterwards. In response, McCarthy refrained from political action for several days. One aide recalled McCarthy sneering about his fallen rival, saying that Kennedy was &quot;demagoguing to the last&quot;. Another heard McCarthy say that Kennedy had &quot;brought it on himself&quot;—implying that he had provoked Sirhan Sirhan, the Palestinian gunman convicted of killing him, by promising military support to the state of Israel.

Despite strong showings in several primaries—he won more votes than any other Democratic candidate—McCarthy garnered only 23% of the delegates at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, largely due to the control of state-party organizations over the delegate-selection process. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, many Kennedy delegates, remembering his bitter war of words with McCarthy, chose to support George McGovern rather than McCarthy. Moreover, although Humphrey was not clearly an antiwar candidate, some antiwar Democrats hoped that as president he might succeed where Johnson had failed and extricate the United States from Vietnam. On June 23, 1968, Hubert Humphrey defeated McCarthy, securing significant delegates in their shared home state of Minnesota. Before election day, McCarthy confirmed that he would personally vote for Humphrey, but said that he would go no further than that, stopping short of endorsing him. Although McCarthy did not win the Democratic nomination, the antiwar &quot;New Party&quot;, which ran several candidates for president that year, listed him as its nominee on the ballot in Arizona, where he received 2,751 votes, and in Vermont, gaining 579 votes. He also appeared on the Oregon ballot as the New Party choice. He received 20,721 votes as a write-in candidate in California.

Despite McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Vietnam War stance, North Vietnam&#x27;s Communist government had a cynical attitude toward him, largely because the lack of money in his campaign made it highly skeptical of what he could achieve, describing McCarthy as &quot;a second-rate politician with little experience or money&quot; in its analysis of the presidential election published in their Army Newspaper dated August 10, 1968.

==Politics after the Senate==

=== 1972 presidential campaign ===

McCarthy returned to politics as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, but he fared poorly in New Hampshire and Wisconsin and soon dropped out.

Illinois was the only primary in which McCarthy actively participated. He got 38% of the vote to the then leading contender Edmund Muskie&#x27;s 59%, but the media ignored McCarthy&#x27;s Illinois campaign.

=== 1976 presidential campaign ===

After his 1972 campaign, McCarthy left the Democratic Party, and ran as an Independent candidate for president in 1976. During that campaign, he took a libertarian stance on civil liberties, promised to create full employment by shortening the work week, came out in favor of nuclear disarmament, attacked the Internal Revenue Service, and said whom he would nominate to various Cabinet posts if elected. Mainly, however, he battled ballot access laws he deemed too restrictive and encouraged voters to reject the two-party system.

His numerous legal battles during the election, along with a strong grassroots effort in friendly states, allowed him to appear on the ballot in 30 states and eased ballot access for later third-party candidates. His party affiliation was variously listed on ballots as &quot;Independent,&quot; &quot;McCarthy &#x27;76,&quot; &quot;Non-Partisan,&quot; &quot;Nom. Petition,&quot; &quot;Nomination,&quot; &quot;Not Designated,&quot; and &quot;Court Order&quot;. Although he was not on the California and Wyoming ballots, he was recognized as a write-in candidate in those states. In many states, he did not run with a vice-presidential nominee, but he came to have a total of 15 running mates in states where he was required to have one. At least eight of his running mates were women.

Nationally, McCarthy received 740,460 votes, 0.91% of the total, finishing third in the election. His best showing came in Oregon, where he received 40,207 votes, 3.90% of the vote.

===Further activism===

McCarthy opposed Watergate-era campaign finance laws, becoming a plaintiff in the landmark case &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain provisions of federal campaign finance laws were unconstitutional. McCarthy, the New York Civil Liberties Union, philanthropist Stewart Mott, the Conservative Party of New York State, the Mississippi Republican Party, and the Libertarian Party were the plaintiffs in &quot;Buckley&quot;, becoming key players in killing campaign spending limits and public financing of political campaigns.

In 1980, dismayed by what he saw as the abject failure of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency (he later said that &quot;he was the worst president we ever had&quot;), he appeared in a campaign ad for Libertarian candidate Ed Clark and wrote the introduction to Clark&#x27;s campaign book. He eventually endorsed Ronald Reagan for president.

===Final campaigns===
In 1982, McCarthy ran for his old Senate seat but lost the Democratic primary to businessman Mark Dayton, 69% to 24%.

In the 1988 election, McCarthy appeared on the ballot as the presidential candidate of a handful of left-wing state parties, specifically the Consumer parties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and the Minnesota Progressive Party in Minnesota. In his campaign, he supported trade protectionism, Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative and the abolition of the two-party system. He received 30,905 votes.

In 1992, returning to the Democratic Party, he entered the New Hampshire presidential primary and campaigned for the Democratic nomination, but was excluded from the first televised debate. Along with other candidates who had been excluded from the 1992 Democratic debates (including two-time New Alliance Party presidential candidate Lenora Fulani, former Irvine, California mayor Larry Agran, &quot;Billy Jack&quot; actor Tom Laughlin, and others), McCarthy staged protests and took unsuccessful legal action in an attempt to be included in the debates. Unlike the other excluded candidates, McCarthy was a longstanding national figure and had mounted credible campaigns for president in previous elections. He won 108,679 votes in the 1992 primaries. In his campaign for the Democratic nomination, McCarthy proposed the use of import fees to help Japan and Western Europe pay for military security and raise taxes on the wealthy in order to eliminate the national debt.

==Publishing==
After leaving the Senate in 1971, McCarthy became a senior editor at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publishing and a syndicated newspaper columnist. In the 1960s he began writing poetry, and his increased political prominence led to increased interest in his work. &quot;If any of you are secret poets, the best way to break into print is to run for the presidency&quot;, he wrote in 1968. He published a collection of poetry in 1997, &quot;Cool Reflections: Poetry For The Who, What, When, Where and Especially Why of It All&quot; ().

==Personal life==
McCarthy and his wife, Abigail Quigley McCarthy, had five children.

In 1969, McCarthy separated from his wife after 24 years of marriage, but they never divorced. The children stayed with their mother after the separation. According to McCarthy biographer Dominic Sandbrook, McCarthy had a romantic relationship with CBS News correspondent Marya McLaughlin that lasted until McLaughlin&#x27;s death in 1998.

McCarthy&#x27;s niece Mary Beth was married to folk singer Peter Yarrow.

==Death and legacy==
McCarthy died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease at age 89 on December 10, 2005, in a retirement home in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., where he had lived for the previous few years. Former President Bill Clinton gave his eulogy.

Following his death the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University renamed their Public Policy Center the Eugene J. McCarthy Center for Public Policy. The Democratic party memorialized his death during the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on August 28, 2008. The memorial included pictures of several prominent Democrats who had died during the four-year period since the 2004 Convention displayed on a large screen. During McCarthy&#x27;s tribute, the screen displaying his photograph mistakenly left off his first name but included his middle name, calling him &quot;Senator Joseph McCarthy&quot;; Joseph McCarthy was a notable Republican Senator from Wisconsin famous for his anti-Communist campaigning and sparring with journalist Edward R. Murrow.

In 2009, his alma mater, St. John&#x27;s University, honored McCarthy by establishing the Eugene McCarthy Distinguished Public Service Award.

McCarthy&#x27;s files as U.S. congressman (Democratic Farmer-Labor) from Minnesota&#x27;s 4th district (1949–1959) and as U.S. senator from Minnesota (1959–1971) are available at the Minnesota History Center for research. They include executive files, general files, legislative files, personal files, political and campaign (including senatorial, vice presidential, and presidential) files, public relations files, sound and visual materials (with photographs), and speeches.

<text>Teltow-Fläming () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the southwestern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the east clockwise) Dahme-Spreewald, Elbe-Elster, the districts Wittenberg in Saxony-Anhalt, the district Potsdam-Mittelmark, and the &quot;Bundesland&quot; Berlin.
==Geography==
The district is named after the two main regions. The Teltow is an agricultural belt south of Berlin. The Fläming is a wooded hill chain in the south; the portion located in this district is called the Lower Fläming, while the Higher Fläming is situated in Potsdam-Mittelmark.

==History==
The district was formed in December 1993 by merging the previous districts Luckenwalde, Jüterbog and Zossen, but also including small parts from other former districts such as Luckau.

== Demography ==


==Miscellaneous==
In the time from 1997 to 2001, the district had the biggest increase in the gross economic product of all districts of Germany with a rate of +56.1%. &quot;Flaeming-Skate&quot; is a long route specially for inline skating, the only such route in Germany. Curiously, the town of Teltow is not a part of the district Teltow-Fläming, just as the town of Dahme is not a part of the district of Dahme-Spreewald.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms show the eagle of Brandenburg to the left, as the margraves of Brandenburg began to rule the northern and northwestern part of the district in the 13th century. To the right is a staff of an abbot. It symbolizes the clerical state of Magdeburg, to which the southern and middle part of the district belonged. The black-and-white checkered bottom derives from the coat of arms of the family of Torgow, who owned the area around Zossen until 1478.

After the creation of the new district a public contest was held to create a coat of arms for the district. Out of ten proposals the parliament of the district selected the one made by the designer Horst Nehls from Merow. The coat of arms were officially granted by ministry of interior of Brandenburg on November 21, 1996.

<doc id="166911" wikidata="Q202937" url="?curid=166911" title="Stevie Ray Vaughan">
<text>Stephen Ray Vaughan (also known as SRV; October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the blues rock trio Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is considered one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan.

Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his brother Jimmie. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978. The band established itself in the Austin music scene and soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. They performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1982, where David Bowie saw Vaughan play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig in December where he played blues guitar on the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). John Hammond heard a demo album that Vaughan and Double Trouble had recorded and interested major label Epic Records in signing them to a record deal in March 1983. Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.

Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction for most of his life. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora &quot;Lenny&quot; Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album &quot;In Step&quot; reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan&#x27;s most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number-one hit, &quot;Crossfire&quot;. He became one of the world&#x27;s most popular blues performers, and he headlined Madison Square Garden in 1989 and the Beale Street Music Festival in 1990.

On August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were killed in a helicopter crash in East Troy, Wisconsin, after performing with Double Trouble at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error. Vaughan&#x27;s music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has twice ranked him among the top twenty guitar players of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, and Reese Wynans.

== Family and early life ==
Vaughan&#x27;s grandfather, Thomas Lee Vaughan, married Laura Belle LaRue and moved to Rockwall County, Texas, where they lived by sharecropping.

Stevie&#x27;s father, Jimmie Lee Vaughan, was born on September 6, 1921. Jimmie Vaughan, also known as Jim or Big Jim, dropped out of school at age sixteen and enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After his discharge from the military, he married Martha Jean (&quot;née&quot; Cook; 1928–2009) on January 13, 1950. They had a son, Jimmie, in 1951. Stevie was born at Methodist Hospital on October 3, 1954, in Dallas. Big Jim secured a job as an asbestos worker. The family moved frequently and lived in other states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy, Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. His father struggled with alcohol abuse and often terrorized his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years, Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of his father&#x27;s violence. His father died on August 27, 1986, exactly four years before Vaughan himself.

=== First instruments ===
In the early 1960s, Vaughan&#x27;s admiration for his brother Jimmie resulted in his trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone. In 1961, for his seventh birthday, Vaughan received his first guitar, a toy guitar from Sears with a Western motif. Learning by ear he diligently committed himself, following along to songs by the Nightcaps, particularly &quot;Wine, Wine, Wine&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird&quot;. He listened to blues artists such as Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters, and rock guitarists including Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as jazz guitarists including Kenny Burrell. In 1963, he acquired his first electric guitar, a Gibson ES-125T, as a hand-me-down from Jimmie.

Soon after he acquired the electric guitar, Vaughan joined his first band, the Chantones, in 1965. Their first show was at a talent contest held in Dallas&#x27; Hill Theatre, but after realizing that they could not perform a Jimmy Reed song in its entirety, Vaughan left the band and joined the Brooklyn Underground, playing professionally at local bars and clubs. He received Jimmie&#x27;s Fender Broadcaster, which he later traded for an Epiphone Riviera. When Jimmie left home at age sixteen, Vaughan&#x27;s apparent obsession with the guitar caused a lack of support from his parents. Miserable at home, he took a job at a local hamburger stand, where he washed dishes and dumped trash for seventy cents an hour. After falling into a barrel of grease, he grew tired of the job and quit to devote his life to a music career.

== Music career ==

=== Early years ===
In May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Jeff&#x27;s Boogie&quot; and played the song at the band audition. Mike Steinbach, the group&#x27;s drummer, commented: &quot;The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on &#x27;Jeff&#x27;s Boogie,&#x27; really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.&quot; Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group&#x27;s repertoire; he was told that he wouldn&#x27;t earn a living playing blues music and he and the band parted ways. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as &quot;incredible even then&quot;, Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack.

In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan&#x27;s guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group&#x27;s original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation&#x27;s break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song &quot;Thunderbird&quot;. Phares later described the performance: &quot;they tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.&quot;

Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan&#x27;s late-night shows contributed to his neglect of his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His pursuit of a musical career was disapproved of by many of the school&#x27;s administrators but he was also encouraged by many people, including his art teacher, to strive for a career in art. In his second year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but left when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and recalled having received daily notes from the principal about his grooming.

=== First recordings ===
In September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor Stephen Tobolowsky. They recorded two songs, &quot;Red, White and Blue&quot; and &quot;I Heard a Voice Last Night&quot;, for a compilation album, &quot;A New Hi&quot;, that featured various teenage bands from Dallas. In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to Austin, Texas, which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Club, a local blues venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as Sugarloaf, Wishbone Ash, and Zephyr, but could not maintain a consistent lineup. In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months.

In March 1973, Vaughan joined Marc Benno&#x27;s band, the Nightcrawlers, having met Benno at a jam session years before. The band featured vocalist Doyle Bramhall, who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old. The next month, the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood for A&amp;M Records. While the album was rejected by A&amp;M, it included Vaughan&#x27;s first songwriting efforts, &quot;Dirty Pool&quot; and &quot;Crawlin&#x27;&quot;. Soon afterward, he and the Nightcrawlers traveled back to Austin without Benno. In mid-1973, they signed a contract with Bill Ham, manager for ZZ Top, and played various gigs across the Southern United States, although many of them were unsuccessful. Ham left the band stranded in Mississippi without any way to make it back home and demanded reimbursement from Vaughan for equipment expenses; Ham was never reimbursed.

In 1975, Vaughan joined a six-piece band called Paul Ray and the Cobras which included guitarist Denny Freeman and saxophonist Joe Sublett. For the next two-and-a-half years, he earned a living performing weekly at a popular venue in town, the Soap Creek Saloon, and ultimately the newly opened Antone&#x27;s, widely known as Austin&#x27;s &quot;home of the blues&quot;. In late 1976, Vaughan recorded a single with them, &quot;Other Days&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Texas Clover&quot; as the B-side. With Vaughan playing guitar on both tracks, the single was released on February 7, 1977. In March, readers of the &quot;Austin Sun&quot; voted them as Band of the Year. In addition to playing with the Cobras, Vaughan jammed with many of his influences at Antone&#x27;s, including Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, and Albert King.

Vaughan toured with the Cobras during much of 1977, but near the end of September, when they decided to strive for a mainstream musical direction, he left the band and formed Triple Threat Revue, which included singer Lou Ann Barton, bassist W. C. Clark, and drummer Fredde &quot;Pharaoh&quot; Walden. In January 1978, they recorded four songs in Austin, including Vaughan&#x27;s composition &quot;I&#x27;m Cryin&#x27;&quot;. The thirty-minute audio recording marks the only known studio recording of the band.

=== Double Trouble ===
In mid-May 1978, Clark left to form his own group and Vaughan renamed the band Double Trouble, taken from the title of an Otis Rush song. Following the recruitment of bassist Jackie Newhouse, Walden quit in July, and was briefly replaced by Jack Moore, who had moved to Texas from Boston; he performed with the band for about two months. Vaughan then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he met Chris Layton through Sublett, who was his roommate. Layton, who had recently parted ways with Greezy Wheels, was taught by Vaughan to play a shuffle rhythm. When Vaughan offered Layton the position, he agreed. In early July, Vaughan befriended Lenora Bailey, known as &quot;Lenny&quot;, who became his girlfriend, and ultimately his wife. The marriage was to last for six and a half years.

In early October 1978, Vaughan and Double Trouble earned a frequent residency performing at one of Austin&#x27;s most popular nightspots, the Rome Inn. During a performance, Edi Johnson, an accountant at Manor Downs, noticed Vaughan. She remembered: &quot;I&#x27;m not an authority on music—it&#x27;s whatever turned me on—but this did.&quot; She recommended him to Manor Downs owner Frances Carr and general manager Chesley Millikin, who was interested in managing artists and saw Vaughan&#x27;s musical potential. After Barton quit Double Trouble in mid-November 1979, Millikin signed Vaughan to a management contract. Vaughan also hired Robert &quot;Cutter&quot; Brandenburg as road manager, whom he had met in 1969. Addressing him as &quot;Stevie Ray&quot;, Brandenburg convinced Vaughan to use his middle name on stage.

In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon attended a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller&#x27;s in Houston. Shannon, who was playing with Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: &quot;I went down there that night, and I&#x27;ll never forget this: it was like, when I walked in the door and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation. &#x27;That&#x27;s where I want to be; that&#x27;s where I belong, right there.&#x27; During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn&#x27;t try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player [Jackie Newhouse]—I didn&#x27;t know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great.&quot; Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.

==== Drug charge and trial ====
On December 5, 1979, while Vaughan was in a dressing room before a performance in Houston, an off-duty police officer arrested him after witnessing him using cocaine near an open window. He was formally charged with cocaine possession and subsequently released on $1,000 bail. Double Trouble was the opening act for Muddy Waters, who said about Vaughan&#x27;s drug abuse: &quot;Stevie could perhaps be the greatest guitar player that ever lived, but he won&#x27;t live to get 40 years old if he doesn&#x27;t leave that white powder alone.&quot; The following year, he was required to return on January 16 and February 29 for court appearances.

During the final court date on April 17, 1980, Vaughan was sentenced with two years&#x27; probation and was prohibited from leaving Texas. Along with a stipulation of entering treatment for drug abuse, he was required to &quot;avoid persons or places of known disreputable or harmful character&quot;; he refused to comply with both of these orders. After a lawyer was hired, his probation officer had the sentence revised to allow him to work outside the state. The incident later caused him to refuse maid service while staying in hotels during concert tours.

==== Montreux Jazz Festival ====
Although popular in Texas at the time, Double Trouble failed to gain national attention. The group&#x27;s visibility improved when record producer Jerry Wexler recommended them to Claude Nobs, organizer of the Montreux Jazz Festival. He insisted the festival&#x27;s blues night would be great with Vaughan, whom he called &quot;a jewel, one of those rarities who comes along once in a lifetime&quot;, and Nobs agreed to book Double Trouble on July 17, 1982.

Vaughan opened with a medley arrangement of Freddie King&#x27;s song &quot;Hide Away&quot; and his own fast instrumental composition, &quot;Rude Mood&quot;. Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of Larry Davis&#x27; &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, Hound Dog Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Give Me Back My Wig&quot;, and Albert Collins&#x27; &quot;Collins Shuffle&quot;, as well as three original compositions: &quot;Pride and Joy&quot;, &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Pool&quot;. The set ended with boos from the audience. &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s James McBride wrote:

According to road manager Don Opperman: &quot;the way I remember it, the &#x27;ooos&#x27; and the &#x27;boos&#x27; were mixed together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [had] just handed me his guitar and walked off stage, and I&#x27;m like, &#x27;are you coming back?&#x27; There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn&#x27;t see the guys, but I could. He went back to the dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, and that was the end of the show.&quot; According to Vaughan: &quot;it wasn&#x27;t the whole crowd [that booed]. It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow, it sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I&#x27;m used to playin&#x27; on 10!&quot; The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.

On the following night, Double Trouble was booked in the lounge of the Montreux Casino, with Jackson Browne in attendance. Browne jammed with Double Trouble until the early morning hours and offered them free use of his personal recording studio in downtown Los Angeles. In late November the band accepted his offer and recorded ten songs in two days. While they were in the studio, Vaughan received a telephone call from David Bowie, who had met him after the Montreux performance, and he invited him to participate in a recording session for his next studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. In January 1983, Vaughan recorded guitar on six of the album&#x27;s eight songs, including the title track and &quot;China Girl&quot;. The album was released on April 14, 1983, and sold over three times as many copies as Bowie&#x27;s previous album.

==== National success ====
In mid-March 1983, Gregg Geller, vice president of A&amp;R at Epic Records, signed Double Trouble to the label at the recommendation of record producer John Hammond. Soon afterward, Epic financed a music video for &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;, which was filmed at the Cherry Tavern in New York City. Vaughan recalled: &quot;we changed the name of the place in the video. Four years ago I got married in a club where we used to play all the time called the Rome Inn. When they closed it down, the owner gave me the sign, so in the video we put that up behind me on the stage.&quot;

With the success of &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, Bowie requested Vaughan as the featured instrumentalist for the upcoming Serious Moonlight Tour, realizing that he was an essential aspect of the album&#x27;s groundbreaking success. In late April, Vaughan began rehearsals for the tour in Las Colinas, Texas. When contract renegotiations for his performance fee failed, Vaughan abandoned the tour days before its opening date, and he was replaced by Earl Slick. Vaughan commented: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t gear everything on something I didn&#x27;t really care a whole lot about. It was kind of risky, but I really didn&#x27;t need all the headaches.&quot; Although contributing factors were widely disputed, Vaughan soon gained major publicity for quitting the tour.

On May 9, the band performed at The Bottom Line in New York City, where they opened for Bryan Adams, with Hammond, Mick Jagger, John McEnroe, Rick Nielsen, Billy Gibbons, and Johnny Winter in attendance. Brandenburg described the performance as &quot;ungodly&quot;: &quot;I think Stevie played every lick as loud and as hard and with as much intensity as I&#x27;ve ever heard him.&quot; The performance earned Vaughan a positive review published in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, asserting that Double Trouble outperformed Adams. &quot;Fortunately, Bryan Adams, the Canadian rocker who is opening arena dates for Journey, doesn&#x27;t headline too often&quot;, wrote Martin Porter, who claimed that after the band&#x27;s performance, the stage had been &quot;rendered to cinders by the most explosively original showmanship to grace the New York stage in some time.&quot;

==== &quot;Texas Flood&quot; ====

After acquiring the recordings from Browne&#x27;s studio, Double Trouble began assembling the material for a full-length LP. The album, &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, opens with the track &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;, which was written for Lenny on their &quot;love-struck day&quot;. He composed &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Cryin for one of his former girlfriends, Lindi Bethel. Although both are musically similar, their lyrics are two different perspectives of the relationship. Along with covers of Howlin&#x27; Wolf, the Isley Brothers, and Buddy Guy, the album included Vaughan&#x27;s cover of Larry Davis&#x27; &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, a song that he became strongly associated with. &quot;Lenny&quot; served as a tribute to his wife, which he composed at the end of their bed.

&quot;Texas Flood&quot; featured cover art by illustrator Brad Holland, who is known for his artwork for &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Originally envisioned with Vaughan sitting on a horse depicting a promotable resemblance, Holland painted an image of him leaning against a wall with a guitar, using a photograph as a reference. Released on June 13, 1983, &quot;Texas Flood&quot; peaked at number 38 and ultimately sold half a million copies. While &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Kurt Loder asserted that Vaughan did not possess a distinctive voice, according to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the release was a &quot;monumental impact&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;a guitar boogie lovers delight&quot;. Agent Alex Hodges commented: &quot;No one knew how big that record would be, because guitar players weren&#x27;t necessarily in vogue, except for some that were so established they were undeniable ... he was one of the few artists that was recouped on every record in a short period of time.&quot;

On June 16, Vaughan gave a performance at Tango nightclub in Dallas, which celebrated the album&#x27;s release. Assorted VIPs attended the performance, including Ted Nugent, Sammy Hagar, and members of The Kinks and Uriah Heep. Jack Chase, vice president of marketing for Epic, recalled: &quot;the coming-out party at Tango was very important; it was absolutely huge. All the radio station personalities, DJs, program directors, all the retail record store owners and the important managers, press, all the executives from New York came down—about seven hundred people. We attacked in Dallas first with Q102-FM and [DJ] Redbeard. We had the Tango party—it was hot. It was &quot;the&quot; ticket.&quot; &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reviewed the performance, starting with the rhetorical question; &quot;what if Stevie Ray Vaughan had an album release party and everybody came? It happened Thursday night at Tango. ... The adrenaline must have been gushing through the musicians&#x27; veins as they performed with rare finesse and skill.&quot;

Following a brief tour in Europe, Hodges arranged an engagement for Double Trouble as The Moody Blues&#x27; opening act during a two-month tour of North America. Hodges stated that many people disliked the idea of Double Trouble opening for The Moody Blues, but asserted that a common thread that both bands shared was &quot;album-oriented rock&quot;. Tommy Shannon described the tour as &quot;glorious&quot;: &quot;Our record hadn&#x27;t become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people. We just went out and played, and it fit like a glove. The sound rang through those big coliseums like a monster. People were going crazy, and they had no idea who we were!&quot; After appearing on the television series &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, the band played a sold-out concert at New York City&#x27;s Beacon Theatre. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that their ninety-minute set at the Beacon &quot;left no doubt that this young Texas musician is indeed the &#x27;guitar hero of the present era.

==== &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot; ====

In January 1984, Double Trouble began recording their second studio album, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: &quot;he was kind of like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, &#x27;let&#x27;s redo this, let&#x27;s do that more.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person.&quot; As the sessions began, Vaughan&#x27;s cover of Bob Geddins&#x27; &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: &quot;... we did probably the quietest version we ever did up &#x27;til that point. We ended it and [Hammond] said; &#x27;that&#x27;s the best that song will ever sound,&#x27; and we went; &#x27;we haven&#x27;t even got sounds, have we?&#x27; He goes, &#x27;that doesn&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s the best you&#x27;ll ever do that song.&#x27; We tried it again five, six, seven times – I can&#x27;t even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time.&quot;

During recording sessions, Vaughan began experimenting with other combinations of musicians, including Fran Christina and Stan Harrison, who played drums and saxophone respectively on the jazz instrumental, &quot;Stang&#x27;s Swang&quot;. Jimmie Vaughan played rhythm guitar on his cover of Guitar Slim&#x27;s &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot; and the title track, in the latter of which Vaughan carries a worldly message in his lyrics. According to musicologist Andy Aledort, Vaughan&#x27;s guitar playing throughout the song is marked by steady rhythmic strumming patterns and improvised lead lines, with a distinctive R&amp;B and soul single-note riff, doubled in octaves by guitar and bass.

&quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot; was released on May 15, 1984, and two weeks later it had rapidly outpaced the sales of &quot;Texas Flood&quot;. It peaked at number 31 and spent 38 weeks on the charts. The album includes Vaughan&#x27;s cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s song, &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;, which provoked inevitable comparisons to Hendrix. According to AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot; &quot;confirmed that the acclaimed debut was no fluke, while matching, if not bettering, the sales of its predecessor, thereby cementing Vaughan&#x27;s status as a giant of modern blues.&quot; According to authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford, the album &quot;was a major turning point in Stevie Ray Vaughan&#x27;s development&quot; and Vaughan&#x27;s singing improved.

==== Carnegie Hall ====
On October 4, 1984, Vaughan headlined a performance at Carnegie Hall that included many guest musicians. For the second half of the concert, he added Jimmie as rhythm guitarist, drummer George Rains, keyboardist Dr. John, Roomful of Blues horn section, and featured vocalist Angela Strehli. The ensemble rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and despite the solid dynamics of Double Trouble for the first half of the performance, according to Patoski and Crawford, the big band concept never entirely took form. Before arriving at the engagement, the venue sold out, which made Vaughan overexcited and nervous; he did not calm down until halfway through the third song. The benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation&#x27;s work in leukemia and cancer research was an important draw for the event. As his scheduled time slot drew closer, he indicated that he preferred traveling to the venue by limousine to avoid being swarmed by fans on the street; the band took the stage around 8:00 pm. The audience of 2,200 people, which included Vaughan&#x27;s wife, family and friends, transformed the venue into what Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a whistling, stomping roadhouse&quot;.

Introduced by Hammond as &quot;one of the greatest guitar players of all time&quot;, Vaughan opened with &quot;Scuttle Buttin&#x27;&quot;, wearing a custom-made mariachi suit he described as a &quot;Mexican tuxedo&quot;. Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Testify&quot;, The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;, &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;, Elmore James&#x27; &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;, and W. C. Clark&#x27;s &quot;Cold Shot&quot;, along with four original compositions including &quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;, &quot;Honey Bee&quot;, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;, and &quot;Rude Mood&quot;. During the second half of the performance, Vaughan performed covers by Larry Davis, Buddy Guy, Guitar Slim, Albert King, Jackie Wilson, and Albert Collins. The set ended with Vaughan performing solo renditions of &quot;Lenny&quot; and &quot;Rude Mood&quot;.

The &quot;Dallas Times-Herald&quot; wrote that the performance was &quot;full of stomping feet and swaying bodies, kids in blue jeans hanging off the balconies, dancing bodies that clogged the aisles&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that, despite the venue&#x27;s &quot;muddy&quot; acoustics, the band&#x27;s performance was &quot;filled with verve&quot;, and Vaughan&#x27;s playing was &quot;handsomely displayed&quot;. Jimmie Vaughan later commented: &quot;I was worried the crowd might be a little stiff. Turned out they&#x27;re just like any other beer joint.&quot; Vaughan commented: &quot;We won&#x27;t be limited to just the trio, although that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ll stop doing the trio. I&#x27;m planning on doing that too. I ain&#x27;t gonna stay in one place. If I do, I&#x27;m stupid.&quot; The performance was recorded, and in 1997 Epic Records released &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;, which was ultimately certified gold.

After the concert, Vaughan attended a private party at a downtown club in New York, which was sponsored by MTV, where he was greeted by an hour&#x27;s worth of supporters. On the following day, Double Trouble made an appearance at a record store in Greenwich Village, where they signed autographs for fans. 

In late October 1984, the band toured Australia and New Zealand, which included one of their first appearances on Australian television—on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;—where they performed &quot;Texas Flood&quot;, and an interview on &quot;Sounds&quot;. On November 5 and 9, they played sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House. After returning to the U.S., Double Trouble went on a brief tour in California. Soon afterward, Vaughan and Lenny went to the island of Saint Croix, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where they had spent some time vacationing in December. The next month, Double Trouble flew to Japan, where they appeared for five performances, including at Kōsei Nenkin Kaikan in Osaka.

==== &quot;Soul to Soul&quot; ====

In March 1985, recording for Double Trouble&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Soul to Soul&quot;, began at the Dallas Sound Lab. As the sessions progressed, Vaughan became increasingly frustrated with his own lack of inspiration. He was also allowed a relaxed pace of recording the album, which contributed to a lack of focus due to excesses in alcohol and other drugs. Roadie Byron Barr later recalled: &quot;the routine was to go to the studio, do dope, and play ping-pong.&quot; Vaughan, who found it increasingly difficult to be able to play rhythm guitar parts and sing at the same time, wanted to add another dimension to the band, so he hired keyboardist Reese Wynans to record on the album; he joined the band soon thereafter.

During the album&#x27;s production, Vaughan appeared at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the U.S. national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;; his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage, Vaughan acquired an autograph from former player for the New York Yankees, Mickey Mantle. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the &quot;Houston Press&quot;: &quot;As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid enough to know that he wanted Mickey Mantle&#x27;s autograph. Mantle obliged. &#x27;I never signed a guitar before.&#x27; Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure he&#x27;d be dead before he hit 30.&quot; Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison: &quot;I heard they even wrote about it in one of the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. I hate that stuff. His version was great.&quot;

Released on September 30, 1985, &quot;Soul to Soul&quot; peaked at number 34 and remained on the Billboard 200 through mid-1986, eventually certified gold. Critic Jimmy Guterman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;there&#x27;s some life left in their blues rock pastiche; it&#x27;s also possible that they&#x27;ve run out of gas.&quot; According to Patoski and Crawford, sales of the album &quot;did not match &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot;, suggesting Stevie Ray and Double Trouble were plateauing&quot;. Vaughan commented: &quot;as far as what&#x27;s on there song-wise, I like the album a lot. It meant a lot to us what we went through to get this record. There were a lot of odds and we still stayed strong. We grew a lot with the people in the band and immediate friends around us; we learned a lot and grew a lot closer. That has a lot to do with why it&#x27;s called [&quot;Soul to Soul&quot;].&quot;

==== &quot;Live Alive&quot; ====

After touring for nine and a half months, Epic requested a fourth album from Double Trouble as part of their contractual obligation. In July 1986, Vaughan decided that they would record the LP, &quot;Live Alive&quot;, during three live appearances in Austin and Dallas. On July 17 and 18, the band performed sold-out concerts at the Austin Opera House, and July 19 at the Dallas Starfest. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by Vaughan. Shannon was backstage before the Austin concert and predicted to new manager Alex Hodges that both Vaughan and he were &quot;headed for a brick wall&quot;. Guitarist Denny Freeman attended the Austin performances; he called the shows a &quot;musical mess, because they would go into these chaotic jams with no control. I didn&#x27;t know what exactly was going on, but I was concerned.&quot; Both Layton and Shannon remarked that their work schedule and drugs were causing the band to lose focus. According to Wynans: &quot;Things were getting illogical and crazy.&quot;

The &quot;Live Alive&quot; album was released on November 17, 1986, and was the only official live Double Trouble LP made commercially available during Vaughan&#x27;s lifetime, though it never appeared on the Billboard 200 chart. Though many critics claimed that most of the album was overdubbed, engineer Gary Olazabal, who mixed the album, asserted that most of the material was recorded poorly. Vaughan later admitted that it was not one of his better efforts; he recalled: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t in very good shape when we recorded &quot;Live Alive&quot;. At the time, I didn&#x27;t realize how bad a shape I was in. There were more fix-it jobs done on the album than I would have liked. Some of the work sounds like [it was] the work of half-dead people. There were some great notes that came out, but I just wasn&#x27;t in control; nobody was.&quot;

==== Drugs and alcohol ====
In 1960 when Vaughan was six years old, he began stealing his father&#x27;s drinks. Drawn in by its effects, he started making his own drinks and this resulted in alcohol dependence. He explained: &quot;that&#x27;s when I first started stealing daddy&#x27;s drinks. Or when my parents were gone, I&#x27;d find the bottle and make myself one. I thought it was cool ... thought the kids down the street would think it was cool. That&#x27;s where it began, and I had been depending on it ever since.&quot; According to the authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford: &quot;In the ensuing twenty-five years, he had worked his way through the &quot;Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference&quot; before finding his poisons of preference—alcohol and cocaine.&quot;

While Vaughan asserted that he first experienced the effects of cocaine when a doctor prescribed him a liquid solution containing it as a nasal spray, according to Patoski and Crawford, the earliest that Vaughan is known to have used it is in 1975, while performing with the Cobras. Before that, Vaughan had briefly used other drugs such as cannabis, methamphetamine, and Quaaludes, the brand name for methaqualone. After 1975, he regularly drank whiskey and used cocaine, particularly mixing the two substances together. According to Hopkins, by the time of Double Trouble&#x27;s European tour in September 1986, &quot;his lifestyle of substance abuse had reached a peak, probably better characterized as the bottom of a deep chasm.&quot;

At the height of Vaughan&#x27;s substance abuse, he drank of whiskey and used of cocaine each day. Personal assistant Tim Duckworth explained: &quot;I would make sure he would eat breakfast instead of waking up drinking every morning, which was probably the worst thing he was doing.&quot; According to Vaughan: &quot;it got to the point where if I&#x27;d try to say &quot;hi&quot; to somebody, I would just fall apart crying. It was like solid doom.&quot;

In September 1986, Double Trouble traveled to Denmark for a one-month tour of Europe. During the late night hours of September 28, Vaughan became ill after a performance in Ludwigshafen, Germany, suffering from near-death dehydration, for which he received medical treatment. The incident resulted in his checking into The London Clinic under the care of Dr. Victor Bloom, who warned him that he was a month away from death. After staying in London for more than a week, he returned to the United States and entered Peachford Hospital in Atlanta, where he spent four weeks in rehabilitation, and then checked into rehab in Austin.

==== &quot;Live Alive&quot; tour ====

In November 1986, following his departure from rehab, Vaughan moved back into his mother&#x27;s Glenfield Avenue house in Dallas, which is where he had spent much of his childhood. During this time, Double Trouble began rehearsals for the &quot;Live Alive&quot; tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety, he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled: &quot;Stevie was real worried about playing after he&#x27;d gotten sober...he didn&#x27;t know if he had anything left to offer. Once we got back out on the road, he was very inspired and motivated.&quot; The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University, which was Vaughan&#x27;s first performance with Double Trouble after rehab. On December 31, 1986, they played a concert at Atlanta&#x27;s Fox Theatre, which featured encore performances with Lonnie Mack.

As the tour progressed, Vaughan was longing to work on material for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for divorce from Lenny, which restricted him from any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song &quot;Crossfire&quot; with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: &quot;we wrote the music, and they had to write the lyrics. We had just gotten together; Stevie was unable to be there at that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote.&quot; On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughan&#x27;s last concert appearance in Europe.

==== &quot;In Step&quot; ====

After Vaughan&#x27;s divorce from Lenora &quot;Lenny&quot; Darlene Bailey became final, recording for Double Trouble&#x27;s fourth and final studio album, &quot;In Step&quot;, began at Kiva Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, working with producer Jim Gaines and co-songwriter Doyle Bramhall. Initially, he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety, but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled: &quot;&quot;In Step&quot; was, for him, a big growing experience. In my opinion, it&#x27;s our best studio album, and I think he felt that way, too.&quot; Bramhall, who had also entered rehab, wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption. According to Vaughan, the album was titled &quot;In Step&quot; because &quot;I&#x27;m finally in step with life, in step with myself, in step with my music.&quot; The album&#x27;s liner notes include the quote; &quot;&#x27;thank God the elevator&#x27;s broken,&quot; a reference to the twelve-step program proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).

After the &quot;In Step&quot; recording sessions moved to Los Angeles, Vaughan added horn players Joe Sublett and Darrell Leonard, who played saxophone and trumpet respectively on both &quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Love Me Darlin″&quot;. Shortly before the album&#x27;s production was complete, Vaughan and Double Trouble appeared at a presidential inaugural party in Washington, D.C. for George H. W. Bush. &quot;In Step&quot; was released on June 13, 1989, and eight months later, it was certified gold. The album was Vaughan&#x27;s most commercially successful release and his first one to win a Grammy Award. It peaked at number 33 on the Billboard 200, spending 47 weeks on the chart. &quot;In Step&quot; included the song, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, which was written by Double Trouble, Bill Carter, and Ruth Ellsworth; it became his only number one hit. The album also included one of his first recordings to feature the use of a Fuzz Face on Vaughan&#x27;s cover of the Howlin&#x27; Wolf song, &quot;Love Me Darlin.

In July 1989, Neil Perry, a writer for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, wrote: &quot;the album closes with the brow-soothing swoon of &#x27;Riviera Paradise,&#x27; a slow, lengthy guitar and piano workout that proves just why Vaughan is to the guitar what Nureyev is to ballet.&quot; According to music journalist Robert Christgau, Vaughan was &quot;writing blues for AA...he escapes the blues undamaged for the first time in his career.&quot; In October 1989, the &quot;Boca Raton News&quot; described Vaughan&#x27;s guitar solos as &quot;determined, clear-headed and downright stinging&quot; and his lyrics as &quot;tension-filled allegories&quot;.

== Death ==

On Monday, August 27, 1990, at 12:50 a.m. (CDT), Vaughan and members of Eric Clapton&#x27;s touring entourage played an all-star encore jam session at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Alpine Valley Resort in East Troy, Wisconsin. They then left for Midway International Airport in Chicago in a Bell 206B helicopter, the most common way for acts to enter and exit the venue, as there is only one road in and out, heavily used by fans. The helicopter crashed into a nearby ski hill shortly after takeoff. Vaughan and the four others on board—pilot Jeff Brown, agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and tour manager Colin Smythe—died. The helicopter was owned by Chicago-based company Omniflight Helicopters. The Elkhorn coroner&#x27;s inquest found that all five men died instantaneously.

The investigation determined the aircraft departed in foggy conditions with visibility reportedly under , according to a local forecast. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated: &quot;As the third helicopter was departing, it remained at a lower altitude than the others, and the pilot turned southeasterly toward rising terrain. Subsequently, the helicopter crashed on hilly terrain about three-fifths of a mile from the takeoff point.&quot; Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records showed that Brown was qualified to fly by instruments in a fixed-wing aircraft, but not in a helicopter. Toxicology tests performed on the victims revealed no traces of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Vaughan&#x27;s funeral service was held on August 31, 1990, at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas, Texas. His wooden casket quickly became adorned with bouquets of flowers. An estimated 3,000 mourners joined a procession led by a white hearse. Among those at the public ceremony were Jeff Healey, Charlie Sexton, ZZ Top, Colin James, Stevie Wonder, Bonnie Raitt and Buddy Guy. Vaughan&#x27;s grave marker reads: &quot;Thank you ... for all the love you passed our way.&quot;

== Musical style ==

Vaughan&#x27;s music was rooted in blues, rock, and jazz. He was influenced by Johnny Winter, Jimi Hendrix, Albert King, Lonnie Mack, B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert Collins, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, Buddy Guy, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Otis Rush, Guitar Slim, Chuck Berry, and Muddy Waters. According to nightclub owner Clifford Antone, who opened Antone&#x27;s in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antone&#x27;s in July 1977 and it almost &quot;scared him to death&quot;, saying &quot;it was the best I&#x27;ve ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie&quot;. While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix was Vaughan&#x27;s greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared: &quot;I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitarist—he played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact I&#x27;m not sure if he even played the guitar—he played music.&quot; He was also influenced by such jazz guitarists as Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, and George Benson.

In 1987, Vaughan listed Lonnie Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Vaughan observed that Mack was &quot;ahead of his time&quot; and said, &quot;I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie&quot;. On another occasion, Vaughan said that he had learned tremolo picking and vibrato from Mack and that Mack had taught him to &quot;play guitar from the heart.&quot; Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978:

Vaughan&#x27;s relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of &quot;Boot Hill,&quot; Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, &quot;Raisin&#x27; Cain&quot;, Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. &quot;We even played together over at Tommy Shannon&#x27;s house one time.&quot; Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a blues festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that &quot;Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him&quot;. Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that &quot;mine&#x27;s a little bit rawer, I think.&quot;

== Equipment ==
=== Guitars ===
Vaughan owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. His guitar of choice, and the instrument that he became most associated with, was the Fender Stratocaster, his favorite being a 1963 body with a 1962 neck and pickups dated from 1959; hence Vaughan usually referring to it as a &quot;1959 Strat&quot;. He explained why he favored this guitar in a 1983 interview: &quot;I like the strength of its sound. Any guitar I play has got to be pretty versatile. It&#x27;s got a big, strong tone and it&#x27;ll take anything I do to it.&quot; Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his &quot;first wife&quot;, or &quot;Number One&quot;. Another favorite guitar was a slightly later Strat he named &#x27;Lenny&#x27; after his wife, Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar, a 1965 Stratocaster that had been refinished in red, with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking $300 for it, which was way more than Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar, so she got six of their friends to chip in $50 each, and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night, after bringing &quot;Lenny&quot; (the guitar, and wife) home with him, he wrote the song, &quot;Lenny&quot;. He had started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings, although he did play other guitars, including custom guitars.


One of the custom guitars—nicknamed &quot;Main&quot;—was built by James Hamilton of Hamiltone Guitars in Buffalo, New York. It was a gift from Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. Gibbons had commissioned Hamilton to build the guitar in 1979. There were some delays, including having to re-do the mother of pearl inlay of Vaughan&#x27;s name on the fretboard when he changed his stage name from Stevie Vaughan to Stevie Ray Vaughan. The guitar was presented to him by Jim Hamilton on April 29, 1984. Hamilton recalls that Stevie Ray Vaughan was so happy with the guitar that he played it that night at Springfest on the University of Buffalo campus. It remained one of the main guitars he used on stage and in studio. Vaughan made some alterations to the guitar, including replacing the bronze color Gibson knobs with white Fender knobs, as he preferred the ribbing on the Fender knobs. The pickups had to be changed after the guitar was used in the &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Stand the Weather&quot; video, in which Stevie and &quot;Main&quot; were drenched with water, and the pickups were ruined. Vaughan&#x27;s preferred guitar has been summarized as his,
Number One Strat, which Stevie claimed to be a &#x27;59, since that was the date stamped on the back of the pickups… this was incorrect, however, as guitar tech Rene Martinez (who oversaw SRV&#x27;s guitars since 1980) found the stamp of 1963 on the body and 1962 on the original neck (the neck was replaced in 1989 after it could no longer be refretted properly; Rene used the neck from another SRV favorite, &quot;Red&quot;, as it was also a 1962 model). The pickups are also relatively low output, not the hot overwound myth that gained legs during the 80s… all 3 pickups are rumored to be under 6k ohms output impedance, which would be typical of a 1959 set (the neck pickups tended to be hottest, but not by much). Although the Fender SRV signature model uses Texas Special pickups, which Stevie was heavily involved in the making of, they do not accurately represent the sound of his original Number One.

Vaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. With these heavy string sizes, it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail because of his quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie&#x27;s guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top), which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr&#x27;s father. As for his usage of plectrums, Vaughan preferred Fender medium gauge guitar picks, using one of the rounder shoulders of the pick rather than the pointed tip to pluck and strum the strings.

Vaughan was also photographed playing a Rickenbacker Capri, a National Duolian, Epiphone Riviera, Gibson Flying V, as well as several other models. Vaughan used a Gibson Johnny Smith to record &quot;Stang&#x27;s Swang&quot;, and a Guild 12-string acoustic for his performance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; in January 1990. On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughan&#x27;s Stratocasters, the aforementioned &quot;Lenny&quot; strat, was sold at an auction to benefit Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Centre in Antigua; the instrument was bought by Guitar Center for $623,500.

=== Amplifiers and effects ===
Vaughan was a catalyst in the revival of vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two black-face Fender Super Reverbs, which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs, including black-face Fender Vibroverbs, and brands including Dumble and Marshall, which he used for his clean sound.

While an Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Vox wah-wah pedal were his mainstay effects, Vaughan experimented with a range of effects. He used a Fender Vibratone, designed as a Leslie speaker for electric guitars which provided a warbling chorus effect; it can be heard on the track &quot;Cold Shot&quot;. He used a vintage Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face that can be heard on &quot;In Step&quot;, as well as an Octavia. The Guitar Geek website provides a detailed illustration of Vaughan&#x27;s 1985 equipment set up based on interviews with his guitar tech and effects builder, Cesar Diaz.

== Legacy ==
Vaughan throughout his career revived blues rock and paved the way for many other artists. Vaughan&#x27;s work continues to influence numerous blues, rock, and alternative artists, including John Mayer, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Mike McCready, Albert Cummings, Los Lonely Boys and Chris Duarte among others. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Vaughan as &quot;the leading light in American blues&quot; who developed &quot;a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist, regardless of genre&quot;. In 1983, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called Vaughan the &quot;guitar hero of the present era&quot;.

In the months that followed his death, Vaughan sold over 5.5 million albums in the United States. On September 25, 1990, Epic released &quot;Family Style&quot;, an LP the Vaughan brothers cut at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The label released several promotional singles and videos for the collaborative effort. In November 1990, CMV Enterprises released &quot;Pride and Joy&quot;, a collection of eight Double Trouble music videos. Sony signed a deal with the Vaughan estate to obtain control of his back catalog, as well as permission to release albums with previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. On October 29, 1991, &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot; was released as Vaughan&#x27;s first posthumous album with Double Trouble, and featured studio recordings from 1984 to 1985. Other compilations, live albums, and films have also been released since his death.

On October 3, 1991, Texas governor Ann Richards proclaimed &quot;Stevie Ray Vaughan Commemoration Day&quot;, during which a memorial concert was held at the Texas Theatre. In 1993, a memorial statue of Vaughan was unveiled on Auditorium Shores and is the first public monument of a musician in Austin. In September 1994, a Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Run for Recovery was held in Dallas; the event was a benefit for the Ethel Daniels Foundation, established to help those in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction who cannot afford treatment. In 1999, the Musicians&#x27; Assistance Program (later renamed MusiCares MAP Fund) created the &quot;Stevie Ray Vaughan Award&quot; to honor the memory of Vaughan and to recognize musicians for their devotion to helping other addicts struggling with the recovery process. The recipients include Eric Clapton, David Crosby, Steven Tyler, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Pete Townshend, Chris Cornell, Jerry Cantrell, and Mike McCready among others. In 1993, Martha Vaughan established the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Scholarship Fund, awarded to students at W.E. Greiner Middle School in Oakcliff who intend to attend college and pursue the arts as a profession.

=== Awards and honors ===

Vaughan won five W. C. Handy Awards and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000. In 1985, he was named an honorary admiral in the Texas Navy. Vaughan had a single number-one hit on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for the song &quot;Crossfire&quot;. His album sales in the U.S. stand at over 15 million units. &quot;Family Style&quot;, released shortly after his death, won the 1991 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album and became his best-selling, non-Double Trouble studio album with over a million shipments in the U.S. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him seventh among the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Players of All Time&quot;, with a 2023 update placing him 20th. He also became eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, but did not appear on a nominations roster until 2014. He was inducted in the RRHOF alongside Double Trouble in 2015. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked him as Number One in its list of the greatest blues guitarists.

In 1994 the city of Austin, Texas, erected the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial on the hiking trail beside Lady Bird Lake.

<text>An antidote is a substance that can counteract a form of poisoning. The term ultimately derives from the Greek term φάρμακον ἀντίδοτον &quot;(pharmakon antidoton)&quot;, &quot;(medicine) given as a remedy&quot;. An older term in English which is now rare is atterlothe, derived from &quot;atter&quot; (&quot;poison&quot; or &quot;venom&quot;). Antidotes for anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as reversal agents.

The antidotes for some particular toxins are manufactured by injecting the toxin into an animal in small doses and extracting the resulting antibodies from the host animals&#x27; blood. This results in an antivenom that can be used to counteract venom produced by certain species of snakes, spiders, and other venomous animals. Some animal venoms, especially those produced by arthropods (such as certain spiders, scorpions, and bees) are only potentially lethal when they provoke allergic reactions and induce anaphylactic shock; as such, there is no &quot;antidote&quot; for these venoms; however anaphylactic shock can be treated (e.g. with epinephrine).

Some other toxins have no known antidote. For example, the poison batrachotoxin – a highly poisonous steroidal alkaloid derived from various poison dart frogs, certain beetles, and birds – has no antidote, and as a result, is often fatal if it enters the human body in sufficient quantities.

==Mechanical approaches==
Ingested poisons are frequently treated by the oral administration of activated charcoal, which adsorbs the poison and flushes it from the digestive tract, thereby removing a large part of the toxin. 
Poisons which are injected into the body (such as those from bites or stings from venomous animals) are usually treated by the use of a constriction band which limits the flow of lymph and/or blood to the area, thus slowing the circulation of the poison around the body. This should not be confused with the use of a tourniquet which cuts off blood flow completely – often leading to the loss of the limb.

== Techniques to identify antidotes ==
In early 2019, a group of researchers in Australia published the finding of a new box jellyfish venom antidote using CRISPR. The technology had been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and identify the peripheral membrane protein ATP2B1, a calcium transporting ATPase, as one host factor required for box jellyfish venom cytotoxicity.

<text>James Joseph Croce (; January 10, 1943 – September 20, 1973) was an American folk and rock singer-songwriter. Between 1966 and 1973, he released five studio albums and numerous singles. During this period, Croce took a series of odd jobs to pay bills while he continued to write, record and perform concerts. After Croce formed a partnership with the songwriter and guitarist Maury Muehleisen in the early 1970s, his fortunes turned. Croce&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1972, when his third album, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot;, produced three charting singles, including &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot;, which reached No. 1 after Croce died. The follow-up album &quot;Life and Times&quot; included the song &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&quot;, Croce&#x27;s only No. 1 hit during his lifetime.

On September 20, 1973, at the height of his popularity and the day before the lead single to his fifth album, &quot;I Got a Name&quot;, was released, Croce, Muehleisen, and four others died in a plane crash. His music continued to chart throughout the 1970s following his death. Croce&#x27;s widow and early songwriting partner, Ingrid, continued to write and record after his death. Their son, A. J. Croce, became a singer-songwriter in the 1990s.

==Early life and education==
Croce was born on January 10, 1943 (although some sources say 1942), in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to James Albert Croce and Flora Mary (Babusci) Croce, Italian Americans whose parents had emigrated from Trasacco and Balsorano in Abruzzo and Palermo in Sicily.

Croce grew up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, seven miles west of Philadelphia, and attended Upper Darby High School, where he graduated in 1960. He then attended Malvern Preparatory School for a year prior to enrolling at Villanova University, where he majored in psychology and minored in German. He was a member of the campus singing groups the Villanova Singers and the Villanova Spires. When the Spires performed off campus or made recordings, they were known as The Coventry Lads. Croce was also a student disc jockey at WKVU, which has since become WXVU. In 1965, he graduated from Villanova with a Bachelor of Science in Social Studies degree.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Croce did not take music seriously until he studied at Villanova, where he became a leader of the Villanova Singers, formed bands, and performed at fraternity parties, coffeehouses, and universities around Philadelphia. He played &quot;anything that the people wanted to hear: blues, rock, a cappella, railroad music ... anything.&quot; Croce&#x27;s band was chosen for a foreign exchange tour of Africa, the Middle East and Yugoslavia. He later said, &quot;We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn&#x27;t speak English over there but if you mean what you&#x27;re singing, people understand.&quot; On November 29, 1963, Croce met his future wife, Ingrid Jacobson, at the Philadelphia Convention Hall during a hootenanny, where he was judging a contest.

Croce released his first album, &quot;Facets&quot;, in 1966, with 500 copies pressed. The album had been financed with a $500 ($ in dollars) wedding gift from Croce&#x27;s parents, who set a condition that the money must be spent to make an album. They hoped that Croce would abandon music after the album failed and use his college education to pursue a more traditional profession. However, the album proved to be a success, with every copy sold.

=== 1960s ===
Croce married Jacobson in 1966 and converted from Catholicism to Judaism, as his wife was Jewish. They were married in a traditional Jewish ceremony. Croce enlisted in the Army National Guard in New Jersey that same year to avoid being drafted and deployed to Vietnam, and served on active duty for four months, leaving for duty one week after his honeymoon. Croce, who tended to resist authority, endured basic training twice. He said that he would be prepared if &quot;there&#x27;s ever a war where we have to defend ourselves with mops.&quot;

From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Croce and his wife performed as a duo. Initially, their performances included songs by artists such as Ian &amp; Sylvia, Gordon Lightfoot, Joan Baez, and Arlo Guthrie, but they eventually began writing their own music. During this time, Croce secured his first long-term gig, at a suburban bar and steakhouse in Lima, Pennsylvania called the Riddle Paddock. Croce&#x27;s set list covered several genres, including blues, country, rock and roll, and folk.

In 1968, the Croces were encouraged by the record producer Tommy West, a fellow Villanova alumnus, to move to New York City. The couple spent time in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx and recorded their first album with Capitol Records. According to Ingrid, over the next two years, they drove more than , playing small clubs and concerts on the college concert circuit to promote their album &quot;Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce&quot;.

Becoming disillusioned by the music business and New York, they sold all but one guitar to pay the rent and returned to the Pennsylvania countryside, settling in an old farm in Lyndell, where he played for $25 a night ($ in dollars). To earn additional money, Croce took odd jobs such as driving trucks, construction work, and teaching guitar while continuing to write songs, often about the characters whom he would meet at local bars and truck stops and his experiences at work. These songs included &quot;Big Wheel&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; at the Car Wash Blues.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
The Croces eventually returned to Philadelphia and Croce decided to be &quot;serious&quot; about becoming a productive member of society. He said: &quot;I&#x27;d worked construction crews, and I&#x27;d been a welder while I was in college. But I&#x27;d rather do other things than get burned.&quot; His determination led to a job at Philadelphia R&amp;B AM radio station WHAT, where Croce translated commercials into &quot;soul&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;d sell airtime to Bronco&#x27;s Poolroom and then write the spot: &#x27;You wanna be cool, and you wanna shoot pool ... &quot;dig it&quot;.

In 1970, Croce met classically trained pianist-guitarist and singer-songwriter Maury Muehleisen through producer Joe Salviuolo, a friend of Croce&#x27;s since college. Salviuolo had met Muehleisen when he was teaching at Glassboro State College in New Jersey and brought Croce and Muehleisen together at the production office of Tommy West and Terry Cashman in New York City. Initially, Croce backed Muehleisen on guitar, but gradually their roles reversed, with Muehleisen adding a lead guitar to Croce&#x27;s music.

When his wife became pregnant, Croce became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could secure a record deal. After their son, Adrian James (A.J.), was born in September 1971, Ingrid stayed at home while Croce toured to promote his music.

In 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with ABC Records, releasing two albums, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; and &quot;Life and Times&quot;. The singles &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot;, &quot;Operator (That&#x27;s Not the Way It Feels)&quot;, and &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; all received airplay. That same year, the Croce family moved to San Diego. Croce began appearing on television, including on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on August 12, his national debut, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on August 14, and &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; on September 20 and 21.

Croce began touring the United States with Muehleisen, performing in large coffeehouses, on college campuses, and at folk festivals. However, his financial situation remained precarious. The record company had fronted him the money to record, and much of his earnings went to repay the advance. In February 1973, Croce and Muehleisen traveled to Europe, performing in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Zurich, and Dublin and receiving encouraging reviews. Croce made television appearances on &quot;The Midnight Special,&quot; which he cohosted on June 15, and &quot;The Helen Reddy Show&quot; on July 19. His biggest single, &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&quot;, reached No. 1 on the American charts in July.

From July 16 through August 4, Croce and Muehleisen returned to London and performed on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test,&quot; on which they sang &quot;Lover&#x27;s Cross&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; at the Car Wash Blues&quot; from their upcoming album &quot;I Got a Name.&quot; Croce finished recording the album just a week before his death. While on tour, Croce grew increasingly homesick and decided to take a break from music and settle with Ingrid and A.J. when his &quot;Life and Times&quot; tour ended. In a letter to Ingrid that arrived after his death, Croce told her that he had decided to quit music and wanted to write short stories and movie scripts as a career and withdraw from public life.

== Death ==
On the night of Thursday, September 20, 1973, during Croce&#x27;s Life and Times tour, which had been scheduled for 45 dates, and the day before his ABC single &quot;I Got a Name&quot; was released, Croce and five others were killed when their chartered Beechcraft E18S crashed shortly after takeoff from the Natchitoches Regional Airport in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Croce was 30 years old. Others killed in the crash were the pilot, Robert N. Elliott; Croce&#x27;s bandmate Maury Muehleisen; the manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortese; the road manager Dennis Rast; and George Stevens, a comedian. An hour before the crash, Croce had completed a concert at Northwestern State University&#x27;s Prather Coliseum in Natchitoches. He was flying to Sherman, Texas, for a concert at Austin College.

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) identified the probable cause as the pilot&#x27;s failure to see obstructions because of physical impairment and fog that had reduced his vision. The 57-year-old pilot suffered from severe coronary artery disease and had run three miles to the airport from a motel. He had an ATP certificate, 14,290 hours&#x27; total flight time, and 2,190 hours in the Beech 18 type airplane.

Croce was buried at Haym Salomon Memorial Park in Frazer, Pennsylvania.

== Legacy ==
The album &quot;I Got a Name&quot; was released on December 1, 1973. The posthumous release included three hits: &quot;Workin&#x27; at the Car Wash Blues&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Have to Say I Love You in a Song&quot; and the title song, which had been used as the theme to the film &quot;The Last American Hero&quot;, released two months prior to his death. &quot;I&#x27;ll Have to Say I Love You in a Song&quot; reached No. 9 on the singles chart.

While ABC had not originally released the song &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; as a single, Croce&#x27;s untimely death lent its lyrics, dealing with mortality and the wish to have more time, an additional resonance. The song subsequently received a large amount of airplay as an album track, and demand for a single release built. When it was eventually issued as one, it became Croce&#x27;s second and final No. 1 hit. After the single had finished its two-week run at the top in early January 1974, the album &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; became No. 1 for five weeks. After seven weeks of its release, &quot;I Got a Name&quot; reached No. 2 behind &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot;.

A greatest hits album titled &quot;Photographs &amp; Memories&quot; was released in 1974. Later posthumous releases have included &quot;Home Recordings: Americana&quot;, &quot;The Faces I&#x27;ve Been&quot;, &quot;Jim Croce: Classic Hits&quot;, &quot;Down the Highway&quot;, &quot;Have You Heard: Jim Croce Live&quot; and DVD and CD releases of his television performances. In 1990, Croce was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Queen&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; included the song &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;; its title and lyrics reference Croce&#x27;s &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&quot;.

In 2012, Ingrid Croce published a memoir about Croce entitled &quot;I Got a Name: The Jim Croce Story&quot;.

In 1985, Ingrid Croce opened Croce&#x27;s Restaurant &amp; Jazz Bar, a project she had jokingly discussed with Croce, in the historic Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego. She owned and managed it until its closure on December 31, 2013. In December 2013, Ingrid Croce opened another restaurant, Croce&#x27;s Park West, on 5th Avenue in the Bankers Hill neighborhood near Balboa Park. She closed it in January 2016.

In 2022, a Pennsylvania Historical Marker honoring Croce was installed outside his farmhouse in Lyndell.

<text>The fancy rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus domestica&quot;) is the domesticated form of &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;, the brown rat, and the most common species of rat kept as a pet. The name &quot;fancy rat&quot; derives from the use of the adjective &quot;&quot; for a hobby, also seen in &quot;animal fancy&quot;, a hobby involving the appreciation, promotion, or breeding of pet or domestic animals. The offspring of wild-caught specimens, having become docile after having been bred for many generations, fall under the &quot;fancy&quot; type.

Fancy rats were originally targets for blood sport in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Later bred as pets, they now come in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns, and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups around the world. They are sold in pet stores and by breeders. Fancy rats are generally quite affordable, even compared to other small pets; this is one of their biggest draws. Additionally, they are quite independent, affectionate, loyal and easily trained. They are considered more intelligent than other domesticated rodents. Healthy fancy rats typically live 2 to 3 years, but are capable of living a year or so longer.

Fancy rats are used widely in medical research, as their physiology is similar to human physiology. When used in this field, they are referred to as &quot;laboratory rats (lab rats)&quot;.

Domesticated rats are physiologically and psychologically different from their wild relatives, and typically pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, although exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like the bacteria &quot;Streptobacillus moniliformis&quot; into the home. Fancy rats have different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus are unlikely to succumb to the same illnesses as wild rats.

== History ==
The origin of the modern fancy rat begins with the rat-catchers of the 18th and 19th centuries who trapped rats throughout Europe. These rat-catchers would then either kill the rats, or, more likely, sell the rats to be used in blood sport. Rat-baiting was a popular sport until the beginning of the 20th century. It involved filling a pit with several rats and then placing bets on how long it would take a terrier to kill them all. It is believed that both rat-catchers and sportsmen began to keep certain, odd-colored rats during the height of the sport, eventually breeding them and then selling them as pets. The two men thought to have formed the basis of rat fancy are Jack Black, self-proclaimed rat-catcher to Queen Victoria, and Jimmy Shaw, manager of one of the largest sporting public houses in London. These two men are responsible for beginning many of the color varieties present today. Black, specifically, was known for taming the &quot;prettier&quot; rats of unusual color, decorating them with ribbons, and selling them as pets.

Rat fancy as a formal, organized hobby began when a woman named Mary Douglas asked for permission to bring her pet rats to an exhibition of the National Mouse Club at the Aylesbury Town Show in England on October 24, 1901. Her black-and-white hooded rat won &quot;Best in Show&quot; and ignited interest in the area. After Douglas&#x27; death in 1921, rat fancy soon began to fall back out of fashion. The original hobby formally lasted from 1912 to 1929 or 1931, as part of the National Mouse and Rat Club, at which point &quot;Rat&quot; was dropped from the name, returning it to the original National Mouse Club. The hobby was revived in 1976 with the formation of the English National Fancy Rat Society (NFRS). Pet rats are now commonly available in stores and from breeders (although there is a debate among rat enthusiasts as to the ethical treatment and quality of life provided by larger pet stores) and there exist several rat fancier groups worldwide.

== Differences from wild rats ==
While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild counterparts to justify a distinct species (like the dog versus grey wolf), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild &quot;R. norvegicus&quot; are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.

Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer than those in the wild. They are more comfortable around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and for a longer period of time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other: while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare domesticated silver fox).

The body structure of domesticated rats differs from that of a wild rat as well. The body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail. Domesticated rats have generally smaller and sharper facial features as well.

Domesticated rats have a longer lifespan than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild &quot;R. norvegicus&quot;, which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also each face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers such as cockroaches and fleas.

== Varieties ==
As in other pet species, a variety of colors, coat types, and other features that do not appear in the wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Fancy rats in themselves are a subspecies and as such do not have distinctive breeds. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.

=== Coloring ===
While some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include agouti, cinnamon, and fawn. Black-based colors include black, beige, blue, and chocolate.

Eye color is considered a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or &quot;vice versa&quot;. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two differently colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. &quot;Ruby&quot; refers to eyes which at a glance appear black, but on closer observation are a deep, dark red.

Color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties, like lilac and fawn, while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between (and even within) different countries or clubs.
=== Markings ===
Further dividing the varieties of fancy rats are the many different markings. Fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically in reference to the patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a &quot;self&quot; (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat&#x27;s markings).

Markings have a strict standard, with detailed terminology, for showing in fancy rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; many of those found in pet shops will have &quot;mismarkings&quot; from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation.

Commonly recognized standards include:
* Berkshire – colored top, white belly
* Hooded – color runs in a &quot;saddle&quot;, a single, unbroken line from the full head down to the spine and possibly partly down the tail
* Capped – color on the full head only
* Blazed – colored head (capped) or body (Irish, Berkshire or self) with a triangular wedge of white fur over the face.
* Variegated – any form of mismatched oddities in the fur. Can be anything from a broken or spotted hood to a misshaped blaze.
* Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is standardized by the NFRS as an equilateral triangle of white with a side that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid-length. In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside.

Other marking varieties include spotted or Dalmatian (named for the spotted Dalmatian dog), Essex, masked, Himalayan (typically a gradient of color along the body, darkest at the base of the tail and nose as in Siamese cats), and Down Under or Downunder (an Australian variety that has a solid color stripe on the belly or a color marking there that corresponds to the markings on the top). 

=== Ear and Body type ===

Two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx rat and Dumbo rat. The Dumbo rat, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, versus the smaller and less prominent ears seen on a standard eared rat. Dumbo ears are caused by a recessive mutation, and was named for its resemblance to the fictional character Dumbo the Flying Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation. Breeding Manx rats does raise some ethical and health concerns however, as rats use their tails for both balance and thermoregulation.
Another body type variation that has risen to prominence more recently in the hobby is the Dwarf rat. Dwarfism arose as a mutation among Sprague-Dawley rats kept for research in the 1970s. Adult dwarfs are considerably smaller than their standard counterparts, with males between 100 and 130g as opposed to 300g or more. This strain of dwarfism is caused by reduced production of growth hormone, and this has other effects in addition to changed overall body size. Important for pet-keeping, it reduces the incidence of pituitary and mammary tumours and nephropathy (kidney disease), with the result that Dwarf rats live 20–40% longer in males and 10–20% longer in females than their standard counterparts. However, they may also show some cognitive impairment. 

=== Coat types ===
There is a relatively small variety of coats compared to the number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females&#x27; coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.

==== Hairless rats ====


Hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss. One type of hairless rat is bred from curly-coated rexes. These range from having areas of very short fur to being completely bald. Since rex is a dominant trait, there only needs to be one rex parent to produce curly rex-coated offspring. However, when two rex parents are bred, two copies of the trait may be present in the offspring. This causes varying levels of hairlessness, and has earned the colloquial name &quot;double rex&quot;. The other type of hairless rat is sometimes referred to as a &quot;true hairless&quot;. This is caused by a different gene, and is distinguishable from a hairless double rex by the absence of whiskers. Unlike a double rex, this type of hairless rat is incapable of growing hairs on any part of the body. One additional subset of semi-hairless rats, patchwork rex, constantly lose their hair and regrow it in different &quot;patches&quot; several times throughout their life. Hairless rats may be prone to more health problems than their standard- or rex-coated counterparts, including a reduced tolerance for cold, kidney and liver failure, more prone to skin injury, skin conditions, and shortened life span.

=== Ethics of selective breeding ===
There is controversy among rat fanciers in regard to selective breeding. On one hand, breeding rats to &quot;conform&quot; to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of what the fancy was founded on. On the other hand, the process results in many rats who do not &quot;conform&quot;, and are then either given away, sold as food, or killed—the latter referred to as culling.

There are concerns as to whether breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats&#x27; balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can be at risk for life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region, like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.
=== Availability ===
Because &quot;R. norvegicus&quot; and related species are seen as pests, their intentional import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and Dumbo rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.

== Health ==
Human-raised &quot;R. norvegicus&quot; are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet.

Rats that live their entire lives indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing bacteria such as &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.

Porphyrin is a browny-red substance that fancy rats can develop around the eyes and nose. It may appear like dried blood, but is a mucus-like substance that is released at times of stress or if the rat has a respiratory infection. It can also be caused by temporary irritation in the eye, such as the rat accidentally scratching its eye while grooming.

Mites also pose a health risk. Mites are microscopic bloodsucking parasites that can irritate the skin of fancy rats, and if they have a preexisting health condition, it can cause them to die from their bodies&#x27; inability to handle two problems at once.

While living indoors decreases the risk of contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, lack of proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat&#x27;s health to make them more prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer&#x27;s disease, protozoic infections (e.g. &quot;Giardia muris&quot;), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with pneumonia. A human-associated fungus, &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; (also found in almost all domesticated animals), is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat&#x27;s immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs, the infection can develop into pneumonia.

Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, &quot;Mycoplasma pulmonis&quot;), are prevalent simply because their highly contagious natures work in tandem with the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.

Pet rats can also develop pituitary tumors if fed high-calorie diets, and ringtail if placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside on the top of the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis.

There is some evidence that spayed female rats (&quot;does&quot;) are less likely to develop mammary and pituitary tumors than intact females. Research into prevention of common diseases and health issues in rats is ongoing. Dietary changes are among the main suggestions for improved health and longevity in fancy rats, including feeding rat-friendly superfoods in moderation to reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and stroke.

=== Risks to owners ===
Keeping rats as pets can come with the stigma that rats supposedly transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. Usually, rats bred as pets are tested and treated for diseases and parasites. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact &quot;R. norvegicus&quot; is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat&#x27;s initial exposure to salmonella, along with many other zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner&#x27;s home, or from the pet&#x27;s contaminated food, water, or bedding.

Another risk to rat owners is rat-bite fever. This is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores that breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders with neglectful rat husbandry. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by swelling of the bite or scratch site, fever, vomiting, and body aches. It is contracted by the bite or scratch of an infected rat. As an early breeder of fancy rats, 19th-century rat catcher Jack Black recounted that he nearly died several times after bites.

In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control reported an outbreak of Seoul virus spread by pet rats.

== Fiction ==

Samantha Martin, a professional animal trainer for films, commercials, and music videos, has claimed that rats are one of the easiest animals to train due to their adaptability, intelligence, and focus.

In the direct-to-video sequels to the 1987 film &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot;, &quot;The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue&quot; and &quot;The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars&quot;, Ratso is the pet rat of Rob McGroarty.

The novella &quot;Ratman&#x27;s Notebooks&quot; by Stephen Gilbert was the basis for the films &quot;Willard&quot; (1971) and &quot;Ben&quot; (1972), and a 2003 remake of the first film. Here, the protagonist befriends the rats found in his home and builds up a close relationship, only to have it end tragically. While these movies generally emphasize the popular perception of malevolence—they kill people and cats and ransack grocery stores—other wild rats who become pets are portrayed in more neutral to positive ways; the television show, &quot;House&quot;, briefly featured &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, the pet rat of the titular character.

In certain versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, the master and adoptive father of the turtles is Splinter, who was once the pet rat of ninja Hamato Yoshi and learned his martial arts skills by imitating his owner.

In the 1996 point-and-click adventure game &quot;&quot;, the protagonist Curtis Craig owns a pet rat named Blob, which is seen various times in the game and is even involved in one of the many puzzles that the player must decipher.

Pet rats are unofficially allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Harry Potter series, but are not generally seen as desirable pets. Ronald Weasley has a pet rat, Scabbers, who was later revealed to be an illegal animagus named Peter Pettigrew in reality.

Christopher Boone, the autistic protagonist of &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; has a pet rat named Toby.

Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman), the main character in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, is a fancy rat kept as a pet by a family in Kensington, London.

<doc id="166921" wikidata="Q1827237" url="?curid=166921" title="Lionel Curtis">
<text>Lionel George Curtis CH (1872–1955) was a British internationalist and author. He was the inspiration for the foundation of Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) as well as the US Council On Foreign Relations at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He was a leading member of Round Table movement. His writings and influence caused the evolution of the former British nations into the Commonwealth.

==Early life==
Curtis was born in 1872 at The Outwoods, Derby, his mother&#x27;s family home, and later moved to Coddington, Herefordshire, the youngest of the four children of George James Curtis, Anglican rector of the parish, and his wife Frances Carr, daughter of the Rev. John Edmund Carr. He was educated at Haileybury College and then at New College, Oxford, where he read law. He fought in the Second Boer War with the City Imperial Volunteers.

==Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten==

Curtis served as secretary to Lord Milner (a position that had also been held by adventure-novelist John Buchan), during which time he dedicated himself to working for a united self-governing South Africa. He with a group of bright young men there, who would later make their mark in international roles, were called Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. Following Milner&#x27;s death in 1925, Curtis became the second leader of Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten until his own death in 1955.

==The Round Table==

Curtis was an original founding member with Lord Milner of the Round Table Movement.

Curtis was also a founder (1910) the international quarterly The Round Table.

==Oxford University== 

He was appointed (1912) Beit lecturer in colonial history at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of All Souls College.

==Chatham House and The Council on Foreign Relations==

In 1919 Curtis made a proposal to the British and American delegates attending the Paris Peace Conference at a meeting on 30 May 1919 at the Hotel Majestic. Curtis addressed the meeting and strongly believed that the conference had illustrated the pressing need for the formation of an informed international research body for expert analysis of foreign affairs that could have advised on the matters the delegates had had before them and had been required to decide upon. Curtis&#x27;s proposal to the meeting was that an Anglo-American &quot;Institute of International Affairs&quot; should be founded with offices in Britain and the US and this was warmly accepted by the British and United States delegates. 

However in the end it actually resulted in the formation of two sister organisations with the foundation of a British Institute, later the Royal Institute of International Affairs regularly now known as Chatham House, on 5 July 1920 in London and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York one year later on July 29, 1921. 

In a revealing letter written 1932, Whitney Shepardson, a US delegate at the Peace Conference, a participant at the meeting at the Hotel Majestic and a founding member of the US Council on Foreign Relations wrote to Ivison Macadam at Chatham House about Curtis,&quot; &quot; He&#x27;s like the Hound of Heaven. Or Jacob wrestling the angel. There was some talk at Council [on Foreign Relations] Directors&#x27; meeting today about Chatham House and its resources. Craveth said that Chatham House had been lucky in having one or two &#x27;angels&#x27; to give it money. I said, &#x27;Yes, but what&#x27;s more important they had a Jacob in the shape of Lionel Curtis to wrestle with these angels saying &quot;I will not let thee go until thou bless me!&quot;&quot;&#x27; 
Curtis remained a driving force within Chatham House and in international movements and conferences around the world until very late in his life but preferred to give credit to others.

==The Commonwealth==

Curtis was largely the creator of the idea of Commonwealth as former British territories would transition into self governing nations (originally the British Commonwealth and now expanded as the Commonwealth of Nations)

==Other initiatives==
Curtis had earlier advocated British Empire Federalism and, late in life, a world state.

His experience led him to conceptualise his early version of a Federal World Government.

His ideas concerning dyarchy were important in the development of the Government of India Act 1919.

He was involved in 1921-1922 the creation of The Irish Free State Treaty.

== Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize and made Companion of Honour==
In 1947, Curtis was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; in 1949, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, on the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Chatham House.

==Works==
Curtis&#x27; most important works were:
* &quot;The Problem of the Commonwealth&quot; (London: Macmillan, 1915);
* &quot;The Commonwealth of Nations&quot; (1916);
* &quot;Dyarchy&quot; (1920); and,
* &quot;Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God&quot; (1938), arguing that the United States must rejoin the British commonwealth and that the Commonwealth must evolve into a world government.

<doc id="166929" wikidata="Q5125709" url="?curid=166929" title="Indo-European ablaut">
<text>In linguistics, the Indo-European ablaut ( , from German ) is a system of apophony (regular vowel variations) in the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE).

An example of ablaut in English is the strong verb &quot;sing, sang, sung&quot; and its related noun &quot;song&quot;, a paradigm inherited directly from the Proto-Indo-European stage of the language. Traces of ablaut are found in all modern Indo-European languages, though its prevalence varies greatly.

== History of the concept ==
The phenomenon of Indo-European ablaut was first recorded by Sanskrit grammarians in the later Vedic period (roughly 8th century BCE), and was codified by Pāṇini in his &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; (4th century BCE), where the terms &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; were used to describe the phenomena now known respectively as the &quot;full grade&quot; and &quot;lengthened grade&quot;.

In the context of European languages, the phenomenon was first described in the early 18th century by the Dutch linguist Lambert ten Kate, in his book &quot;Gemeenschap tussen de Gottische spraeke en de Nederduytsche&quot; (&quot;Common aspects of the Gothic and Dutch languages&quot;, 1710). 

The term &quot;&quot; is borrowed from German, and derives from the noun &quot;&quot; &quot;sound&quot;, and the prefix &quot;&quot;, which indicates movement downwards or away, or deviation from a norm; thus the literal meaning is &quot;sound reduction&quot;. It was coined in this sense in 1819 by the German linguist Jacob Grimm in his &quot;Deutsche Grammatik&quot;, though the word had been used before him. In particular, the 17th-century grammarian Schottelius had used the word negatively to suggest that German verbs lacked the sophistication of the classics, but there is no hint of this disdain in Grimm or in modern scholarly usage.
In English, the term became established through the 1845 translation of Bopp&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;.

==Ablaut and vowel gradation==

Vowel gradation is any vowel difference between two related words (such as &quot;photograph&quot; [ˈfoʊtəgrɑːf] and &quot;photography&quot; [fəˈtɒgrəfi]) or two forms of the same word (such as &quot;man&quot; and &quot;men&quot;). The difference does not need to be indicated in the spelling. There are many kinds of vowel gradation in English and other languages, which are discussed generally in the article apophony. Some involve a variation in vowel length (quantitative gradation: &quot;photograph&quot; / &quot;photography&quot; shows reduction of the first vowel to a schwa), others in vowel coloring (qualitative gradation: &quot;man&quot; / &quot;men&quot;) and others the complete disappearance of a vowel (reduction to zero: &quot;could not&quot; → &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;).

For the study of European languages, one of the most important instances of vowel gradation is the Indo-European ablaut, remnants of which can be seen in the English verbs &quot;ride&quot;, &quot;rode&quot;, &quot;ridden&quot;, or &quot;fly, &quot;flew, &quot;flown&quot;. For simply learning English grammar, it is enough to note that these verbs are irregular, but understanding why they have unusual forms that seem irregular (and indeed why they are actually perfectly regular within their own terms) requires an understanding of the grammar of the reconstructed proto-language.

Ablaut is the oldest and most extensive single source of vowel gradation in the Indo-European languages and must be distinguished clearly from other forms of gradation, which developed later, such as Germanic umlaut (&quot;man&quot; / &quot;men&quot;, &quot;goose&quot; / &quot;geese&quot;, &quot;long&quot; / &quot;length&quot;) or the results of modern English word-stress patterns (&quot;man&quot; / &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;photograph&quot; / &quot;photography&quot;). Confusingly, in some contexts, the terms &#x27;ablaut&#x27;, &#x27;vowel gradation&#x27;, &#x27;apophony&#x27; and &#x27;vowel alternation&#x27; are used synonymously, especially in comparisons, but historical linguists prefer to keep &#x27;ablaut&#x27; for the specific Indo-European phenomenon, which is the meaning intended by the linguists who first coined the word.

==Ablaut grades==
In Proto-Indo-European, the basic, inherent vowel of most syllables was a short &quot;e&quot;. &quot;Ablaut&quot; is the name of the process whereby this short &quot;e&quot; changed, becoming short &quot;o&quot;, long &quot;ē&quot;, long &quot;ō&quot; or sometimes disappearing entirely to leave no vowel at all.

Thus, ablaut results in the alternation of the following sounds:

If a syllable had a short &quot;e&quot;, it is said to be in the &quot;e-grade&quot; or &quot;full grade&quot;. When it had no vowel, it is said to be in the &quot;zero grade&quot;. Syllables with long vowels are said to be in &quot;lengthened grade&quot;. (When the &quot;e&quot;-grade or the &quot;o&quot;-grade is referred to, the short vowel forms are meant.)

A classic example of the five grades of ablaut in a single root is provided by the different case forms of two closely related Greek words. In the following table, an acute accent (´) marks the syllable carrying the word stress; a macron (¯) marks long vowels and the syllable in bold is the one illustrating the different vowel gradations.

In this unusually neat example, the following can be seen:
*A switch to the zero-grade when the word stress moves to the following syllable.
*A switch to the o-grade when the word stress moves to the preceding syllable.
*A lengthening of the vowel when the syllable is in word-final position before a sonorant.

As with most reconstructions, however, scholars differ about the details of this example.

One way to think of this system is to suppose that Proto-Indo-European originally had only one vowel, short &quot;e&quot;, and over time, it changed according to phonetic context, so the language started to develop a more complex vowel system. Thus, it has often been speculated that an original e-grade underwent two changes in some phonetic environments: under certain circumstances, it changed to &quot;o&quot; (the o-grade) and in others, it disappeared entirely (the zero-grade).

However, that is not certain: the phonetic conditions that controlled ablaut have never been determined, and the position of the word stress may not have been a key factor at all. There are many counterexamples to the proposed rules: &quot;*deywós&quot; and its nominative plural &quot;*deywóes&quot; show pretonic and posttonic e-grade, respectively, and &quot;*wĺ̥kʷos&quot; has an accented zero grade.

===Lengthened grades===
Many examples of lengthened grades, including those listed above, are not directly conditioned by ablaut. Instead, they are a result of sound changes like Szemerényi&#x27;s law and Stang&#x27;s law, which caused compensatory lengthening of originally short vowels. In the examples above, Szemerényi&#x27;s law affected the older sequences *ph2-tér-s and *n̥-péh2-tor-s, changing them to *ph2-tḗr and *n̥-péh2-tōr. Thus, these forms were originally in the regular, unlengthened e-grade and o-grade. Such lengthened vowels were, however, later grammaticalised and spread to other words in which the change did not occur.

Nevertheless, there are examples of true lengthened grades, in which short &quot;e&quot; alternates with long &quot;ē&quot;. Examples are the verbs with &quot;Narten&quot; inflection, and nouns like &quot;*mḗh₁-n̥s&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, genitive &quot;*méh₁-n̥s-os&quot;. Alternations of this type were rare, however, and the &quot;e&quot; ~ &quot;o&quot; ~ &quot;∅&quot; alternation was the most common by far. The long &quot;ō&quot; grade was rarer still and may not have actually been a part of the ablaut system at all.

===Zero grade===
The zero grade of &quot;ablaut&quot; may appear difficult for speakers of English. In the case of *ph2trés, which may already have been pronounced something like , it is not difficult to imagine it as a contraction of an older *ph2terés, pronounced perhaps , as this combination of consonants and vowels would be possible in English as well. In other cases, however, the absence of a vowel strikes the speaker of a modern western European language as unpronounceable.

To understand, one must be aware that there were a number of sounds that were consonants in principle but could operate in ways analogous to vowels: the four syllabic sonorants, the three laryngeals and the two semi-vowels:

*The syllabic sonorants are &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, which could be consonants much as they are in English, but they could also be held on as continuants and carry a full syllable stress and then are transcribed with a small circle beneath them. There are many modern languages who show these sounds in syllable nuclei, including Indo-European ones (e.g. Czech). 
*The laryngeals could be pronounced as consonants, in which case they were probably variations on the &quot;h&quot; sound and so normally transcribed as h1, h2 and h3. However, they could also carry a syllable stress, in which case they were more like vowels. Thus, some linguists prefer to transcribe them ə1, ə2 and ə3. The vocalic pronunciation may have originally involved the consonantal sounds with a very slight schwa before and/or after the consonant.
*In pre-vocalic positions, the phonemes &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; were semi-vowels, probably pronounced like English &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, but they could also become pure vowels when the following ablaut vowel reduced to zero.

When &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; came in postvocalic positions, the result was a diphthong. Ablaut is nevertheless regular and looks like this:

Thus, any of these could replace the ablaut vowel when it was reduced to the zero-grade: the pattern CVrC (for example, &quot;*bʰergʰ-&quot;) could become CrC (&quot;*bʰr̥gʰ-&quot;).

However, not every PIE syllable was capable of forming a zero grade; some consonant structures inhibited it in particular cases, or completely. Thus, for example, although the preterite plural of a Germanic strong verb (see below) is derived from the zero grade, classes 4 and 5 have instead vowels representing the lengthened e-grade, as the stems of these verbs could not have sustained a zero grade in this position.

Zero grade is said to be from pre-Proto-Indo-European syncope in unaccented syllables, but in some cases the lack of accent does not cause zero grade: &quot;*deywó-&quot;, nominative plural &quot;*-es&quot; &quot;god&quot;. There does not seem to be a rule governing the unaccented syllables that take zero grade and the ones that take stronger grades.

===a-grade===
It is still a matter of debate whether PIE had an original a-vowel at all. In later PIE, the disappearance of the laryngeal h2 could leave an a-colouring and this may explain all occurrences of &quot;a&quot; in later PIE. However, some argue controversially that the e-grade could sometimes be replaced by an a-grade without the influence of a laryngeal, which might help to explain the vowels in class 6 Germanic verbs, for example.

==Subsequent development==
Although PIE had only this one, basically regular, ablaut sequence, the development in the daughter languages is frequently far more complicated, and few reflect the original system as neatly as Greek. Various factors, such as vowel harmony, assimilation with nasals, or the effect of the presence of laryngeals in the Indo-European (IE) roots as well as their subsequent loss in most daughter languages, mean that a language may have several different vowels representing a single vowel in the parent language.

In particular, the zero grade was often subject to modification from changes in the pronunciation of syllabic sonorants. For example, in Germanic, syllabic sonorants acquired an epenthetic &quot;-u-&quot;, thus converting the original zero grade to a new &quot;u-grade&quot; in many words. Thus, while ablaut survives in some form in all Indo-European languages, it became progressively less systematic over time.

Ablaut explains vowel differences between related words of the same language. For example:
* English &quot;strike&quot; and &quot;stroke&quot; both come from the same IE root &quot;*streyg-&quot;. The former comes from the e-grade, the latter from the o-grade.
* German &quot;Berg&quot; (mountain, hill) and &quot;Burg&quot; (castle) both come from the root &quot;*bʰergʰ-&quot;, which presumably meant &quot;high&quot;. The former comes from the e-grade, the latter from the zero-grade. (Zero-grade followed by &quot;r&quot; becomes &quot;ur&quot; in Germanic.)
Ablaut also explains vowel differences between cognates in different languages.
*English &quot;tooth&quot; comes from Germanic &quot;*tanþ-s&quot; (e.g. Old English &quot;tōþ&quot;, Old High German &quot;zand&quot;), genitive &quot;*tund-iz&quot; (Gothic &quot;tunþus&quot;, but also &quot;thornbush&quot;, literally &quot;horse-tooth&quot;). This form is related to Latin &quot;dens, dentis&quot; and Greek &quot;, &quot;, with the same meaning, and is reflected in the English words &quot;dentist&quot; and &quot;orthodontic&quot;. One reconstructed IE form is &quot;*dónts&quot;, genitive &quot;*dn̥tés&quot;. The consonant differences can be explained by regular sound shifts in primitive Germanic but not the vowel differences: by the regular laws of sound changes, Germanic &quot;a&quot; can originate from PIE &quot;o&quot;, but &quot;un&quot; usually goes back to a syllabic &quot;n̥&quot;.

:The explanation is that the Germanic and Greek nominative forms developed from the o-grade, the Latin word and the Germanic genitive from the zero-grade (in which syllabic &quot;n̥&quot; developed into &quot;en&quot; much in the same way as it became &quot;un&quot; in Germanic). Going a step further back, some scholars reconstruct &quot;*h1dónts&quot;, from the zero grade of the root &quot;*h1ed-&quot; &#x27;to eat&#x27; and the participle &quot;-ont-&quot; and explain it as &#x27;the eating one&#x27;.
*English &quot;foot&quot; comes from the lengthened o-grade of &quot;*ped-&quot;. Greek &quot;, &quot; and Latin &quot;pes, pedis&quot; (compare English &quot;octopus&quot; and &quot;pedestrian&quot;), come from the (short) o-grade and the e-grade respectively.

For the English-speaking non-specialist, a good reference work for quick information on IE roots, including the difference of &quot;ablaut&quot; grade behind related lexemes, is Watkins (2000). (Note that in discussions of lexis, Indo-European roots are normally cited in the e-grade, without any inflections.)

==Grammatical function==
In PIE, there were already ablaut differences within the paradigms of verbs and nouns. These were not the main markers of grammatical form, since the inflection system served this purpose, but they must have been significant secondary markers.

An example of ablaut in the paradigm of the noun in PIE can be found in &quot;*pértus&quot;, from which the English words &quot;ford&quot; and (via Latin) &quot;port&quot; are derived (both via the zero-grade stem &quot;*pr̥t-&quot;).

An example in a verb is *bʰeydʰ- &quot;to wait&quot; (cf. &quot;bide&quot;).

In the daughter languages, these came to be important markers of grammatical distinctions. The vowel change in the Germanic strong verb, for example, is the direct descendant of that seen in the Indo-European verb paradigm. Examples in modern English are the following:

It was in this context of Germanic verbs that &quot;ablaut&quot; was first described, and this is still what most people primarily associate with the phenomenon. A fuller description of &quot;ablaut&quot; operating in English, German and Dutch verbs and of the historical factors governing these can be found at the article Germanic strong verb.

The same phenomenon is displayed in the verb tables of Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit. Examples of &quot;ablaut&quot; as a grammatical marker in Latin are the vowel changes in the perfect stem of verbs.

Ablaut can often explain apparently random irregularities. For example, the verb &quot;to be&quot; in Latin has the forms &quot;est&quot; (he is) and &quot;sunt&quot; (they are). The equivalent forms in German are very similar: &quot;ist&quot; and &quot;sind&quot;. The same forms were present in Proto-Slavic: &quot;*estь&quot; and &quot;*sǫtь&quot;, and developed into e.g. Polish &quot;jest&quot; and &quot;są&quot;.

The difference between singular and plural in these languages is easily explained: the PIE root is &quot;*h1es-&quot;. In the singular, the stem is stressed, so it remains in the e-grade, and it takes the inflection &quot;-ti&quot;. In the plural, however, the inflection &quot;-énti&quot; was stressed, causing the stem to reduce to the zero grade: &quot;*h1es-énti&quot; → &quot;*h1s-énti&quot;. See main article: Indo-European copula.

Some of the morphological functions of the various grades are as follows:

e-grade:
* Present tense of thematic verbs; root stress.
* Present singular of athematic verbs; root stress.
* Accusative and vocative singular, nominative, accusative and vocative dual, nominative plural of nouns.

o-grade:
* Verbal nouns
# stem-stressed masculine action nouns (Greek &quot;gónos&quot; &quot;offspring&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;jánas&quot; &quot;creature, person&quot;; Greek &quot;trókhos&quot; &quot;circular course&quot; &lt; &quot;*act of running&quot;);
# ending-stressed feminine, originally collective, action nouns (Greek &quot;gonḗ&quot; &quot;offspring&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;janā́&quot; &quot;birth&quot;);
# ending-stressed masculine agent nouns (Greek &quot;trokhós&quot; &quot;wheel&quot; &lt; &quot;*runner&quot;).
* Nominative, vocative and accusative singular of certain nouns (acrostatic root nouns such as &quot;dṓm&quot;, plural &quot;dómes&quot; &quot;house&quot;; proterokinetic neuter nouns such as &quot;*wódr̥&quot; &quot;water&quot; or &quot;dóru&quot; &quot;tree&quot;).
* Present tense of causative verbs; stem (not root) stress.
* Perfect singular tense.

zero-grade:
* Present dual and plural tense of athematic verbs; ending stress.
* Perfect dual and plural tense; ending stress.
* Past participles; ending stress.
* Some verbs in the aorist (the Greek thematic &quot;second aorist&quot;).
* Oblique singular/dual/plural, accusative plural of nouns.

lengthened grade:
* Nominative singular of many nouns.
* Present singular of certain athematic verbs (so-called &quot;Narten-stem verbs&quot;).
* Some verbs in the aorist.
* Some derived verbal nouns (so-called &quot;proto-vrddhi&quot;).

Many examples of lengthened-grade roots in the daughter languages are actually caused by the effect of laryngeals and of Szemerényi&#x27;s law and Stang&#x27;s law, which operated within Indo-European times.

<text>A river delta is a landform, triangular, created by the deposition of the sediments that are carried by the waters of a river, where the river merges with a body of slow-moving water or with a body of stagnant water. The creation of a river delta occurs at the river mouth, where the river merges into an ocean, a sea, or an estuary, into a lake, a reservoir, or (more rarely) into another river that cannot carry away the sediment supplied by the feeding river. Etymologically, the term &quot;river delta&quot; derives from the triangular shape (Δ) of the uppercase Greek letter delta. In hydrology, the dimensions of a river delta are determined by the balance between the watershed processes that supply sediment and the watershed processes that redistribute, sequester, and export the supplied sediment into the receiving basin.

River deltas are important in human civilization, as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers. They can provide coastline defence and can impact drinking water supply. They are also ecologically important, with different species&#x27; assemblages depending on their landscape position. On geologic timescales, they are also important carbon sinks.

==Etymology==
A river delta is so named because the shape of the Nile Delta approximates the triangular uppercase Greek letter delta. The triangular shape of the Nile Delta was known to audiences of classical Athenian drama; the tragedy &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; by Aeschylus refers to it as the &quot;triangular Nilotic land&quot;, though not as a &quot;delta&quot;. Herodotus&#x27;s description of Egypt in his &quot;Histories&quot; mentions the Delta fourteen times, as &quot;the Delta, as it is called by the Ionians&quot;, including describing the outflow of silt into the sea and the convexly curved seaward side of the triangle. Despite making comparisons to other river systems deltas, Herodotus did not describe them as &quot;deltas&quot;. The Greek historian Polybius likened the land between the Rhône and Isère rivers to the Nile Delta, referring to both as islands, but did not apply the word delta. According to the Greek geographer Strabo, the Cynic philosopher Onesicritus of Astypalaea, who accompanied Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests in India, reported that Patalene (the delta of the Indus River) was &quot;a delta&quot; (). The Roman author Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Indica&quot; states that &quot;the delta of the land of the Indians is made by the Indus river no less than is the case with that of Egypt&quot;.

As a generic term for the landform at the mouth of the river, the word delta is first attested in the English-speaking world in the late 18th century, in the work of Edward Gibbon.

== Formation ==
River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or a reservoir. When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium, which builds up to form the river delta. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird&#x27;s-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).

As the gradient of the river channel decreases, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This destabilizes the river channel. If the river breaches its natural levees (such as during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a steeper, more stable gradient. Typically, when the river switches channels in this manner, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. Repeated channel-switching events build up a mature delta with a distributary network.

Another way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of mouth bars (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the Wax Lake Delta.

In both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops closer to an ideal fan because more rapid changes in channel position result in a more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird&#x27;s feet, are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. Alluvial fan deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.

Most large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the Mississippi, Nile, Amazon, Ganges, Indus, Yangtze, and Yellow River discharging along passive continental margins. This phenomenon is due mainly to three factors: topography, basin area, and basin elevation. Topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas. Topography along active margins tends to be steeper and less widespread, which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf.

There are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins. Along active margins, orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes, brecciated rocks, and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source. When sediment does not travel far from the source, sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated, therefore making delta formation more difficult. Tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion, delta lobe switching, and auto cyclicity. Active margin river deltas tend to be much smaller and less abundant but may transport similar amounts of sediment. However, the sediment is never piled up in thick sequences due to the sediment traveling and depositing in deep subduction trenches.

At the mouth of a river, the change in flow conditions can cause the river to drop any sediment it is carrying. This sediment deposition can generate a variety of landforms, such as deltas, sand bars, spits, and tie channels. Landforms at the river mouth drastically alter the geomorphology and ecosystem.

== Types ==

Deltas are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, wave, and tidal processes, depending on the strength of each. The other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river.

=== Fluvial-dominated deltas ===
Fluvial-dominated deltas are found in areas of low tidal range and low wave energy. Where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water, the delta is characterized by &quot;homopycnal flow&quot;, in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load. Where the river water has a higher density than basin water, typically from a heavy load of sediment, the delta is characterized by &quot;hyperpycnal flow&quot; in which the river water hugs the basin bottom as a density current that deposits its sediments as turbidites. When the river water is less dense than the basin water, as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline, the delta is characterized by &quot;hypopycnal flow&quot; in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan. This allows fine sediments to be carried a considerable distance before settling out of suspension. Beds in a hypocynal delta dip at a very shallow angle, around 1 degree.

Fluvial-dominated deltas are further distinguished by the relative importance of the inertia of rapidly flowing water, the importance of turbulent bed friction beyond the river mouth, and buoyancy. Outflow dominated by inertia tends to form Gilbert-type deltas. Outflow dominated by turbulent friction is prone to channel bifurcation, while buoyancy-dominated outflow produces long distributaries with narrow subaqueous natural levees and few channel bifurcations.

The modern Mississippi River delta is a good example of a fluvial-dominated delta whose outflow is buoyancy-dominated. Channel abandonment has been frequent, with seven distinct channels active over the last 5000 years. Other fluvial-dominated deltas include the Mackenzie delta and the Alta delta.

==== Gilbert deltas ====
A Gilbert delta (named after Grove Karl Gilbert) is a type of fluvial-dominated delta formed from coarse sediments, as opposed to gently sloping muddy deltas such as that of the Mississippi. For example, a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta.
 It is commonly a result of homopycnal flow. Such deltas are characterized by a tripartite structure of topset, foreset, and bottomset beds. River water entering the lake rapidly deposits its coarser sediments on the submerged face of the delta, forming steeping dipping foreset beds. The finer sediments are deposited on the lake bottom beyond this steep slope as more gently dipping bottomset beds. Behind the delta front, braided channels deposit the gently dipping beds of the topset on the delta plain.

While some authors describe both lacustrine and marine locations of Gilbert deltas, others note that their formation is more characteristic of the freshwater lakes, where it is easier for the river water to mix with the lakewater faster (as opposed to the case of a river falling into the sea or a salt lake, where less dense fresh water brought by the river stays on top longer). Gilbert himself first described this type of delta on Lake Bonneville in 1885. Elsewhere, similar structures occur, for example, at the mouths of several creeks that flow into Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and form prominent peninsulas at Naramata, Summerland, and Peachland.

=== Wave-dominated deltas ===
In wave-dominated deltas, wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coastline. The relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin. With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta, causing the delta to retreat. For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels.

=== Tide-dominated deltas ===
Erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas, such as the Ganges Delta, which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sandbars and ridges. This tends to produce a &quot;dendritic&quot; structure. Tidal deltas behave differently from river-dominated and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries. Once a wave-dominated or river-dominated distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there is a lot of water around – such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a more or less constant rate until they fizzle out.

=== Tidal freshwater deltas ===
A tidal freshwater delta is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary, in the region known as the &quot;subestuary&quot;. Drowned coastal river valleys that were inundated by rising sea levels during the late Pleistocene and subsequent Holocene tend to have dendritic estuaries with many feeder tributaries. Each tributary mimics this salinity gradient from its brackish junction with the mainstem estuary up to the fresh stream feeding the head of tidal propagation. As a result, the tributaries are considered to be &quot;subestuaries&quot;. The origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting. The combination of processes that create a tidal freshwater delta result in a distinct morphology and unique environmental characteristics. Many tidal freshwater deltas that exist today are directly caused by the onset of or changes in historical land use, especially deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanization. These ideas are well illustrated by the many tidal freshwater deltas prograding into Chesapeake Bay along the east coastline of the United States. Research has demonstrated that the accumulating sediments in this estuary derive from post-European settlement deforestation, agriculture, and urban development.

=== Estuaries ===
Other rivers, particularly those on coasts with significant tidal range, do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an estuary. Notable examples include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Tagus estuary.

=== Inland deltas ===
In rare cases, the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an inverted river delta. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an &quot;inland delta&quot;, and often occurs on former lake beds. The term was first coined by Alexander von Humboldt for the middle reaches of the Orinoco River, which he visited in 1800. Other prominent examples include the Inner Niger Delta, Peace–Athabasca Delta, the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, and the Sistan delta of Iran. The Danube has one in the valley on the Slovak–Hungarian border between Bratislava and Iža.

In some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. The Okavango Delta in Botswana is one example. See endorheic basin.

=== Mega deltas ===
The generic term &quot;mega delta&quot; can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the Yangtze, Pearl, Red, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Indus.

== Sedimentary structure ==

The formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three-part structure may be seen on small scale by crossbedding.
*The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by sediment gravity flow, creating a turbidite. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes.
*The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes). The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the bed load that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Underwater, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the angle of repose of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.
*The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain. As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta&#x27;s top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.

== Existential threats to deltas ==
Human activities in both deltas and the river basins upstream of deltas can radically alter delta environments. Upstream land use change such as anti-erosion agricultural practices and hydrological engineering such as dam construction in the basins feeding deltas have reduced river sediment delivery to many deltas in recent decades. This change means that there is less sediment available to maintain delta landforms, and compensate for erosion and sea level rise, causing some deltas to start losing land. Declines in river sediment delivery are projected to continue in the coming decades.

The extensive anthropogenic activities in deltas also interfere with geomorphological and ecological delta processes. People living on deltas often construct flood defences which prevent sedimentation from floods on deltas, and therefore means that sediment deposition can not compensate for subsidence and erosion. In addition to interference with delta aggradation, pumping of groundwater, oil, and gas, and constructing infrastructure all accelerate subsidence, increasing relative sea level rise. Anthropogenic activities can also destabilise river channels through sand mining, and cause saltwater intrusion. There are small-scale efforts to correct these issues, improve delta environments and increase environmental sustainability through sedimentation enhancing strategies.

While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the Nile Delta and Colorado River Delta are some of the most extreme examples of the devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water.

Historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times when there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there was significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.

== Deltas in the economy ==
Ancient deltas benefit the economy due to their well-sorted sand and gravel. Sand and gravel are often quarried from these old deltas and used in concrete for highways, buildings, sidewalks, and landscaping. More than 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are produced in the United States alone. Not all sand and gravel quarries are former deltas, but for ones that are, much of the sorting is already done by the power of water.
Urban areas and human habitation tend to be located in lowlands near water access for transportation and sanitation. This makes deltas a common location for civilizations to flourish due to access to flat land for farming, freshwater for sanitation and irrigation, and sea access for trade. Deltas often host extensive industrial and commercial activities, and agricultural land is frequently in conflict. Some of the world&#x27;s largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, European Low Countries and the Greater Tokyo Area.

== Examples ==
The Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, which spans most of Bangladesh and West Bengal and empties into the Bay of Bengal, is the world&#x27;s largest delta.

The Selenga River delta in the Russian republic of Buryatia is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water, in its case Lake Baikal.

== Deltas on Mars ==
Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had large amounts of water. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below are pictures of a few.

<doc id="166935" wikidata="Q347125" url="?curid=166935" title="John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland">
<text>John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland (1504 – 22 August 1553) was an English general, admiral, and politician, who led the government of the young King Edward VI from 1550 until 1553, and unsuccessfully tried to install Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King&#x27;s death. The son of Edmund Dudley, a minister of Henry VII executed by Henry VIII, John Dudley became the ward of Sir Edward Guildford at the age of seven. Dudley grew up in Guildford&#x27;s household together with his future wife, Guildford&#x27;s daughter Jane, with whom he was to have 13 children. Dudley served as Vice-Admiral and Lord High Admiral from 1537 until 1547, during which time he set novel standards of navy organisation and was an innovative commander at sea. He also developed a strong interest in overseas exploration. Dudley took part in the 1544 campaigns in Scotland and France and was one of Henry VIII&#x27;s intimates in the last years of the reign. He was also a leader of the religious reform party at court.

In 1547, Dudley was created Earl of Warwick and, with the Duke of Somerset, England&#x27;s Lord Protector, distinguished himself in the renewed Scottish war at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. During the country-wide uprisings of 1549 Dudley put down Kett&#x27;s Rebellion in Norfolk. Convinced of the Protector&#x27;s incompetence, he and other privy councillors forced Somerset out of office in October 1549. Having averted a conservative reaction in religion and a plot to destroy him alongside Somerset, Dudley emerged in early 1550 as &quot;de facto&quot; regent for the 12-year-old Edward VI. He reconciled himself with Somerset, who nevertheless soon began to intrigue against him and his policies. Somerset was executed on largely fabricated charges, three months after Dudley had been raised to the Dukedom of Northumberland in October 1551.

As Lord President of the Council, Dudley headed a distinctly conciliar government and sought to introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing lord-lieutenants who were in close contact with the central authority. Dudley&#x27;s religious policy was — in accordance with Edward&#x27;s religion — decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.

The 15-year-old King fell ill in early 1553 and excluded his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, whom he regarded as illegitimate, from the succession, designating non-existent, hypothetical male heirs. As his death approached, Edward changed his will so that his Protestant cousin Lady Jane Grey, Northumberland&#x27;s daughter-in-law, could inherit the Crown. 

To what extent the Duke influenced this scheme is uncertain. The traditional view is that it was Northumberland&#x27;s plot to maintain his power by placing his family on the throne. Many historians see the project as genuinely Edward&#x27;s, enforced by Dudley after the King&#x27;s death. The Duke did not prepare well for this occasion. Having marched to East Anglia to capture Mary, he surrendered on hearing that the Privy Council had changed sides and proclaimed Mary as queen.

Convicted of high treason, Northumberland returned to Catholicism and abjured the Protestant faith before his execution on 22 August 1553. Having secured the contempt of both religious camps, popularly hated, and a natural scapegoat, he became the &quot;wicked Duke&quot; — in contrast to his predecessor Somerset, the &quot;good Duke&quot;. Only since the 1970s has he also been seen as a Tudor Crown servant: self-serving, inherently loyal to the incumbent monarch, and an able statesman in difficult times.

==Career under Henry VIII==

John Dudley was the eldest of three sons of Edmund Dudley, a councillor of Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle. His father was attainted and executed for high treason in 1510, having been arrested immediately after Henry VIII&#x27;s accession because the new king needed scapegoats for his predecessor&#x27;s unpopular financial policies. 

In 1512, the seven-year-old John became the ward of Sir Edward Guildford and was taken into his household. At the same time Edmund Dudley&#x27;s attainder was lifted and John Dudley was restored &quot;in name and blood&quot;. The King was hoping for the good services &quot;which the said John Dudley is likely to do&quot;. 

At about age 15 John Dudley probably went with his guardian to the Pale of Calais to serve there for the next years. He took part in Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s diplomatic voyages of 1521 and 1527, and was knighted by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, during his first major military experience, the 1523 invasion of France. In 1524 Dudley became a Knight of the Body, and from 1534 he was responsible for the King&#x27;s body armour as Master of the Tower Armoury. 

Being &quot;the most skilful of his generation, both on foot and on horseback&quot;, he excelled in wrestling, archery, and the tournaments of the royal court, as a French report stated as late as 1546.

In 1525, Dudley married Guildford&#x27;s daughter Jane, who was four years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. 

Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. His only son having predeceased him, Guildford&#x27;s nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s patronage, won the case. 

In 1532, he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over £7,000 on the security of the baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.

Dudley was present at Henry VIII&#x27;s meeting with Francis I of France at Calais in 1532. Another member of the entourage was Anne Boleyn, who was soon to be queen. Dudley took part in the christenings of the King&#x27;s children, Elizabeth and Edward and, in connection with the announcement of the Prince&#x27;s birth to the Emperor, travelled to Spain via France in October 1537. He sat in the Reformation parliament for Kent, in place of his deceased father-in-law, in 1534–1536, and led one of the contingents sent against the Pilgrimage of Grace in late 1536. 

In January 1537, Dudley was made Vice-Admiral and began to apply himself to naval matters. He was Master of the Horse to Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard, and in 1542 returned to the House of Commons as MP for Staffordshire but was soon promoted to the House of Lords following 12 March 1542, when he became Viscount Lisle after the death of his stepfather Arthur Plantagenet, Henry VIII&#x27;s uncle, and &quot;by the right of his mother&quot;. Being now a peer, Dudley became Lord High Admiral and a Knight of the Garter in 1543; he was also admitted to the Privy Council. 

In the aftermath of the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542, he served as Warden of the Scottish Marches, and in the 1544 campaign the English force under Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, was supported by a fleet which Dudley commanded. Dudley joined the land force that destroyed Edinburgh, after he had blown the main gate apart with a culverin. In late 1544 he was appointed Governor of Boulogne, the siege of which had cost the life of his eldest son, Henry. His tasks were to rebuild the fortifications to King Henry&#x27;s design and to fend off French attacks by sea and land.

As Lord Admiral, Dudley was responsible for creating the Council for Marine Causes, which for the first time co-ordinated the various tasks of maintaining the navy functioning and thus made English naval administration the most efficient in Europe. At sea, Dudley&#x27;s fighting orders were at the forefront of tactical thinking: Squadrons of ships, ordered by size and firepower, were to manoeuvre in formation, using co-ordinated gunfire. These were all new developments in the English navy. 

In 1545, he directed the fleet&#x27;s operations before, during, and after the Battle of the Solent and entertained King Henry on the flagship &quot;Henri Grace a Dieu&quot;. A tragic loss was the sinking of the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; with 500 men aboard. In 1546 John Dudley went to France for peace negotiations. When he suspected the Admiral of France, Claude d&#x27;Annebault, of manoeuvres which might have led to a renewal of hostilities, he suddenly put to sea in a show of English strength, before returning to the negotiating table. He then travelled to Fontainebleau, where the English delegates were entertained by the Dauphin Henri and King Francis. In the Peace of Camp, the French king acknowledged Henry VIII&#x27;s title as &quot;Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland&quot;, a success for both England and her Lord Admiral.

John Dudley, popularly fêted and highly regarded by King Henry as a general, became a royal intimate who played cards with the ailing monarch. Next to Edward Seymour, Prince Edward&#x27;s maternal uncle, Dudley was one of the leaders of the Reformed party at court, and both their wives were among the friends of Anne Askew, the Protestant martyr destroyed by Bishop Stephen Gardiner in July 1546. Dudley and the Queen&#x27;s brother, William Parr, 1st Earl of Essex, tried to convince Anne Askew to conform to the Catholic doctrines of the Henrician Church, yet she replied &quot;it was great shame for them to counsel contrary to their knowledge&quot;. In September Dudley struck Gardiner in the face during a full meeting of the council. This was a grave offence, and he was lucky to escape with a month&#x27;s leave from court in disgrace. In the last weeks of the reign Seymour and Dudley played their parts in Henry&#x27;s strike against the conservative House of Howard, thus clearing the path for a Protestant minority rule. They were seen as the likely leaders of the impending regency—&quot;there are no other nobles of a fit age and ability for the task&quot;, Eustache Chapuys, the former Imperial ambassador, commented from his retirement.

==From Earl of Warwick to Duke of Northumberland==

The 16 executors of Henry VIII&#x27;s will also embodied the Regency Council that had been appointed to rule collectively during Edward VI&#x27;s minority. The new Council agreed on making Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford Lord Protector with full powers, which in effect were those of a prince. At the same time the Council awarded themselves a round of promotions based on Henry VIII&#x27;s wishes; the Earl of Hertford became the Duke of Somerset and John Dudley was created Earl of Warwick. The new Earl had to pass on his post of Lord Admiral to Somerset&#x27;s brother, Thomas Seymour, but advanced to Lord Great Chamberlain. Perceived as the most important man next the Protector, he was on friendly terms with Somerset, who soon reopened the war with Scotland. Dudley accompanied him as second-in-command with a taste for personal combat. On one occasion he fought his way out of an ambush and, spear in hand, chased his Scottish counterpart for some , nearly running him through. In the Battle of Pinkie Dudley led the vanguard, being &quot;one of the key architects of the English victory&quot;.

The Protector&#x27;s agrarian policy and proclamations were inspired by a group of intellectuals sometimes called &quot;the commonwealth men&quot;. These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful. As one of England&#x27;s major landowners, Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset. By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England. The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich, so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once. This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel-held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged. Two days later Kett, who had his main camp outside the city, confronted the royal army, resulting in a slaughter of over 2,000 peasants. In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts-martial which executed many rebels, perhaps up to 300. For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment, so Dudley warned them: &quot;Is there no place for pardon? ... What shall we then do? Shall we hold the plough ourselves, play the carters and labour the ground with our own hands?&quot;

The Lord Protector, in his proclamations, appealed to the common people. To his colleagues, whom he hardly consulted, he displayed a distinctly autocratic and &quot;increasingly contemptuous&quot; face. By autumn 1549 the same councillors who had made him Protector were convinced that he had failed to exercise proper authority and was unwilling to listen to good counsel. Dudley still had the troops from the Norfolk campaign at his disposal, and in October 1549 he joined the Earl of Southampton and the Earl of Arundel, prominent religious conservatives, to lead a coup of councillors to oust the Protector from office. They withdrew from court to London, meeting in Dudley&#x27;s residence. Starting with the Protector, each side issued proclamations accusing the other of treason and declared to act in defence of the King&#x27;s safety. Somerset tried in vain to raise a popular force and entrenched himself with the King at the fortress Windsor Castle. Military force near King Edward&#x27;s presence was unthinkable and, apparently, Dudley and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer brokered an unofficial deal with Somerset, who surrendered. To keep appearances, the 12-year-old King personally commanded his uncle&#x27;s arrest. For a moment there was hope of a conservative restoration in some quarters. However, Dudley and Cranmer secured the Reformed agenda by persuading Edward to appoint additional Reformed-minded members to the Council and Privy Chamber. In December 1549 Southampton tried to regain predominance by charging Dudley with treason, alongside Somerset, for having been an original ally of the Protector. The scheme misfired when Dudley invited the council to his house and baffled the plotters by exclaiming, with his hand at his sword and &quot;a warlike visage&quot;: &quot;my lord, you seek his [Somerset&#x27;s] blood and he that seeketh his blood would have mine also&quot;.

Dudley consolidated his power through institutional manoeuvres and by January 1550 was in effect the new regent. On 2 February 1550 he became Lord President of the Council, with the capacity to debar councillors from the body and appoint new ones. He excluded Southampton and other conservatives, but arranged Somerset&#x27;s release and his return to the Privy Council and Privy Chamber. In June 1550 Dudley&#x27;s heir John married Somerset&#x27;s daughter Anne as a mark of reconciliation. Yet Somerset soon attracted political sympathizers and hoped to re-establish his power by removing Dudley from the scene, &quot;contemplating&quot;, as he later admitted, the Lord President&#x27;s arrest and execution. Relying on his popularity with the masses, he campaigned against and tried to obstruct Dudley&#x27;s policies. His behaviour increasingly threatened the cohesion vital within a minority regime. In that respect Warwick would take no chances, and he now also aspired to a dukedom. He needed to advertise his power and impress his followers; like his predecessor, he had to represent the King&#x27;s honour. His elevation as Duke of Northumberland came on 11 October 1551 with the Duke of Somerset participating in the ceremony. Five days later Somerset was arrested, while rumours about supposed plots of his circulated. He was accused of having planned a &quot;banquet massacre&quot;, in which the council were to be assaulted and Dudley killed. Somerset was acquitted of treason, but convicted of felony for raising a contingent of armed men without a licence. He was executed on 22 January 1552. While technically lawful, these events contributed much to Northumberland&#x27;s growing unpopularity. Dudley himself, according to a French eyewitness, confessed before his own end that &quot;nothing had pressed so injuriously upon his conscience as the fraudulent scheme against the Duke of Somerset&quot;.

==Ruling England==
Instead of taking the title of Lord Protector, John Dudley set out to rule as &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, the working atmosphere being more conciliar and less autocratic than under Somerset. The new Lord President of the Council reshuffled some high offices, becoming Grand Master of the Household himself and giving Somerset&#x27;s former office of Lord Treasurer to William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester. The office of Grand Master entailed supervising the Royal Household, which gave Dudley the means to control the Privy Chamber and thus the King&#x27;s surroundings. This was done via his &quot;special friends&quot; (as he called them), Sir John Gates and Lord Thomas Darcy. Dudley also placed his son-in-law Sir Henry Sidney and his brother Sir Andrew Dudley near the King. William Cecil was still in the Duke of Somerset&#x27;s service when he gradually shifted his loyalty to John Dudley, who made him Secretary of State and thought him &quot;a most faithful servant and by that term most witty [wise] councillor ... as was scarce like in this realm&quot;. In this position Cecil was Dudley&#x27;s trusted right hand, who primed the Privy Council according to the Lord President&#x27;s wishes. At the same time Cecil had intimate contact with the King because Edward worked closely with the secretaries of state.

Dudley organised Edward&#x27;s political education so that he should take an interest in affairs and at least appear to influence decisions. He wanted the King to grow into his authority as smoothly as possible. Disruptive conflicts when Edward took over government could thus be minimised, while Dudley&#x27;s chances to continue as principal minister would be good. From the age of about 14 Edward&#x27;s signature on documents no longer needed the council&#x27;s countersignatures, and the King was regularly debriefed in meetings with a Council of his own choosing—the principal administrators and the Duke of Northumberland were among the chosen. Dudley had a warm if respectful relationship with the teenager, who &quot;loved and feared&quot; him according to Jean Scheyfve, the Imperial ambassador. At a dinner Edward discussed with the envoy at length until Northumberland discreetly indicated to the King that he had said enough. Yet the Duke did not necessarily have his way in all things. In 1552–1553 the King&#x27;s hand can be discerned behind decisions (and omissions) that directly contravened Dudley&#x27;s wishes. At court, complex networks of influence were at work and Edward listened to more than one voice. Regarding the question to what extent Edward played a role in his own government, Stephen Alford writes: 

===Social and economic policy===
Dudley set out to restore administrative efficiency and maintain public order to prevent renewed rebellion as seen in 1549. Equipped with a new law &quot;for the punishment of unlawful assemblies&quot;, he built a united front of landholders and Privy Council, the government intervening locally at any sign of unrest. He returned to the ancient practice of granting licences to retain liveried followers and installed lord-lieutenants that represented the central government and were to keep ready small bands of cavalry. These measures proved effective and the country was calm for the rest of the reign. In fact, in the summer of 1552—a year before the succession crisis—the cavalry bands were disbanded to save money.

John Dudley also strove to alleviate the social situation. The 1547 &quot;Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds&quot;, which had enacted that any unemployed man found loitering was to be branded and given to the &quot;presentor&quot; as a slave, was abolished as too harsh in 1550. In 1552, Northumberland pushed a novel Poor Law through parliament which provided for weekly parish-based collections for the &quot;relief of the poor&quot;. Parishes were to register their needy inhabitants as well as the amounts people agreed to give for them, while unwilling contributors were to be &quot;induced&quot; by the parson and, if need be, by the bishop. The years 1549–1551 saw poor harvests and, accordingly, soaring food prices. Dudley tried to intervene against the malpractices of middlemen by official searches for hidden corn and by fixing maximum prices for grain, meat, and other victuals. However, the set prices were so unrealistic that farmers stopped to sell their produce at the open market and the regulations had to be rescinded. The regime&#x27;s agrarian policy, while giving landlords much freedom to enclose common land, also distinguished between different forms of enclosure. Landlords guilty of illegal enclosures were increasingly prosecuted.

The financial legacy of the Protectorate consisted, apart from crippling Crown debts, of an unprecedentedly debased coinage. On the second day as Lord President of the Council, Dudley began a process to tackle the problems of the mint. He set up a committee that looked into the peculation by the officers of the mint and other institutions. In 1551, the government at the same time tried to yield profit and restore confidence in the coin by issuing yet further debased coinage and &quot;crying it down&quot; immediately afterwards. The result was panic and confusion and, to get hold of the situation, a coin of 92.3% silver content (against 25% silver content in the last debasement) was issued within months. The bad coin prevailed over the good, however, because people had lost confidence. Northumberland admitted defeat and recruited the financial expert Thomas Gresham. After the first good harvest in four years, by late 1552 the currency was stable, prices for foodstuffs had dropped, and a basis for economic recovery had been laid. A process to centralise the administration of Crown revenue was underway and foreign debt had been eliminated.

===Religious policy===
The use of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; became law in 1549. King Edward&#x27;s half-sister, Mary Tudor, &quot;de facto&quot; had licence to continue hearing mass in private. So soon as he was in power, Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend. Mary, who in her turn did not tolerate the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in any of her residences, was not prepared to make any concessions. She planned to flee the country but then could not make up her mind in the last minute. Mary denied Edward&#x27;s personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles. After a meeting with King and Council, in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law, she sent the Imperial ambassador Scheyfve to threaten war on England. The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who had stepped out of his commission, but at the same time would not risk all-important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands, so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary&#x27;s household officers were arrested. On his next visit to the council, Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40—Dudley was alluding to Mary&#x27;s refusal to accept Edward&#x27;s demands on grounds of his young age. In the end a silent compromise came into effect: Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner, while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown.

Appealing to the King&#x27;s religious tastes, John Dudley became the chief backer of evangelical Protestants among the clergy, promoting several to bishoprics—for example John Hooper and John Ponet. The English Reformation went on apace, despite its widespread unpopularity. The 1552 revised edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation, and the Forty-two Articles, issued in June 1553, proclaimed justification by faith and denied the existence of purgatory. Despite these being cherished projects of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, he was displeased with the way the government handled their issue. By 1552 the relationship between the primate and the Duke was icy. To prevent the Church from becoming independent of the state, Dudley was against Cranmer&#x27;s reform of canon law. He recruited the Scot John Knox so that he should, in Northumberland&#x27;s words, &quot;be a whetstone to quicken and sharp the Bishop of Canterbury, whereof he hath need&quot;. Knox refused to collaborate, but joined fellow reformers in a concerted preaching campaign against covetous men in high places. Cranmer&#x27;s canon law was finally wrecked by Northumberland&#x27;s furious intervention during the spring parliament of 1553. On a personal level, though, the Duke was happy to help produce a schoolchildren&#x27;s catechism in Latin and English. In June 1553 he backed the Privy Council&#x27;s invitation of Philip Melanchthon to become Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge University. But for the King&#x27;s death, Melanchthon would have come to England—his high travel costs had already been granted by Edward&#x27;s government.

At the heart of Northumberland&#x27;s problems with the episcopate lay the issue of the Church&#x27;s wealth, from the confiscation of which the government and its officials had profited ever since the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The most radical preachers thought that bishops, if needed at all, should be &quot;unlorded&quot;. This attitude was attractive to Dudley, as it conveniently allowed him to fill up the Exchequer or distribute rewards with Church property. When new bishops were appointed—typically to the sees of deprived conservative incumbents—they often had to surrender substantial land holdings to the Crown and were left with a much reduced income. The dire situation of the Crown finances made the Council resort to a further wave of Church expropriation in 1552–1553, targeting chantry lands and Church plate. At the time and since, the break-up and reorganisation of the Prince-Bishopric of Durham has been interpreted as Dudley&#x27;s attempt to create himself a county palatine of his own. However, as it turned out, Durham&#x27;s entire revenue was allotted to the two successor bishoprics and the nearby border garrison of Norham Castle. Dudley received the stewardship of the new &quot;King&#x27;s County Palatine&quot; in the North (worth £50 p.a.), but there was no further gain for him. Overall, Northumberland&#x27;s provisions for reorganised dioceses reveal a concern in him that &quot;the preaching of the gospel&quot; should not lack funds. Still, the confiscation of Church property as well as the lay government&#x27;s direction of Church affairs made the Duke disliked among clerics, whether Reformed or conservative. His relations with them were never worse than when the crisis of Edward&#x27;s final illness approached.

===Peace policy===
The war policy 1547–1549 had entailed an extraordinary expenditure of about £350,000 p.a. against a regular Crown income of £150,000 p.a. It was impossible to continue in this way, and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne. The high costs of the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £180,000 were a most welcome cash income. The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550. There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time, and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English-held territory. A year later it was agreed that King Edward was to have a French bride, the six-year-old Elisabeth of Valois. The threat of war with Scotland was also neutralised, England giving up some isolated garrisons in exchange. In the peace treaty with Scotland of June 1551, a joint commission, one of the first of its kind in history, was installed to agree upon the exact boundary between the two countries. This matter was concluded in August 1552 by French arbitration. Despite the cessation of hostilities, English defences were kept on a high level: nearly £200,000 p.a. were spent on the navy and the garrisons at Calais and on the Scottish border. In his capacity as Warden-General of the Scottish Marches, Northumberland arranged for the building of a new Italianate fortress at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

The war between France and the Emperor broke out once again in September 1551. In due course Northumberland rejected requests for English help from both sides, which in the case of the Empire consisted of a demand for full-scale war based on an Anglo-Imperial treaty of 1542. The Duke pursued a policy of neutrality, a balancing act that made peace between the two great powers attractive. In late 1552, he undertook to bring about a European peace by English mediation. These moves were taken seriously by the rival resident ambassadors, but were ended in June 1553 by the belligerents, the continuance of war being more advantageous to them.

===Overseas interest===
John Dudley recovered the post of Lord Admiral immediately after the Protector&#x27;s fall in October 1549, Thomas Seymour having been executed by his brother in March 1549. Dudley passed on the office to Edward, Lord Clinton, in May 1550, yet never lost his keen interest in maritime affairs. Henry VIII had revolutionised the English navy, mainly in military terms. Dudley encouraged English voyages to far-off coasts, ignoring Spanish threats. He even contemplated a raid on Peru with Sebastian Cabot in 1551. Expeditions to Morocco and the Guinea coast in 1551 and 1552 were actually realised. A planned voyage to China via the Northeast Passage under Hugh Willoughby sailed in May 1553. King Edward watched their departure from his window. Northumberland was at the centre of a &quot;maritime revolution&quot;, a policy in which, increasingly, the English Crown sponsored long-distance trade directly.

==1553==

===Changing the succession===

The 15-year-old King fell seriously ill in February 1553. His sister Mary was invited to visit him, the Council doing &quot;duty and obeisance to her as if she had been Queen of England&quot;. The King recovered somewhat, and in April Northumberland restored Mary&#x27;s full title and arms as Princess of England, which she had lost in the 1530s. He also kept her informed about Edward&#x27;s condition. About this time a set of drawn-out marriage negotiations came to conclusion. On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley, Northumberland&#x27;s second youngest son, married Lady Jane Grey, the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and, through her mother Frances Brandon, a grandniece of Henry VIII. Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, and another Katherine, Guildford&#x27;s younger sister, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. Within a month the first of these marriages turned out to be highly significant. Although marked by magnificent festivities, at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.

At some point during his illness Edward wrote a draft document headed &quot;My devise for the Succession&quot;. Due to his ardent Protestantism Edward did not want his Catholic sister Mary to succeed, but he was also preoccupied with male succession and with legitimacy, which in Mary&#x27;s and Elizabeth&#x27;s case was questionable as a result of Henry VIII&#x27;s legislation. In the first version of his &quot;devise&quot;, written before he knew he was mortally ill, Edward bypassed his half-sisters and provided for the succession of male heirs only. Around the end of May or early June Edward&#x27;s condition worsened dramatically and he corrected his draft such that Lady Jane Grey herself, not just her putative sons, could inherit the Crown. To what extent Edward&#x27;s document—especially this last change—was influenced by Northumberland, his confidant John Gates, or still other members of the Privy Chamber like Edward&#x27;s tutor John Cheke or Secretary William Petre, is unclear.

Edward fully endorsed it. He personally supervised the copying of his will and twice summoned lawyers to his bedside to give them orders. On the second occasion, 15 June, Northumberland kept a watchful eye over the proceedings. Days before, the Duke had intimidated the judges who were raising legal objections to the &quot;devise&quot;. The next step was an engagement to perform the King&#x27;s will after his death, signed in his presence by Northumberland and 23 others. Finally, the King&#x27;s official &quot;declaration&quot;, issued as letters patent, was signed by 102 notables, among them the whole Privy Council, peers, bishops, judges, and London aldermen. Edward also announced to have it passed in parliament in September, and the necessary writs were prepared.

It was now common knowledge that Edward was dying. The Imperial ambassador, Scheyfye, had been convinced for years that Dudley was engaged in some &quot;mighty plot&quot; to settle the Crown on his own head. As late as 12 June, though, he still knew nothing specific, despite having inside information about Edward&#x27;s sickness. France, which found the prospect of the Emperor&#x27;s cousin on the English throne disagreeable, gave indications of support to Northumberland. Since the Duke did not rule out an armed intervention from Charles V, he came back on the French offer after the King&#x27;s death, sending a secret and non-committal mission to King Henry II. After Jane&#x27;s accession in July the ambassadors of both powers were convinced she would prevail, although they were in no doubt that the common people backed Mary. Antoine de Noailles wrote of Guildford Dudley as &quot;the new King&quot;, while the Emperor instructed his envoys to arrange themselves with the Duke and to discourage Mary from undertaking anything dangerous.

Whether altering the succession was Edward&#x27;s own idea or not, he was determinedly at work to exclude his half-sisters in favour of what he perceived as his jeopardised legacy. The original provisions of the &quot;devise&quot; have been described as bizarre and obsessive and as typical of a teenager, while incompatible with the mind and needs of a pragmatical politician. Mary&#x27;s accession could cost Northumberland his head, but not necessarily so. He tried hard to please her during 1553, and may have shared the general assumption that she would succeed to the Crown as late as early June. Faced with Edward&#x27;s express royal will and perseverance, John Dudley submitted to his master&#x27;s wishes—either seeing his chance to retain his power beyond the boy&#x27;s lifetime or out of loyalty.

===Downfall===
Edward VI died on 6 July 1553. The next morning Northumberland sent his son Robert into Hertfordshire with 300 men to secure the person of Mary Tudor. Aware of her half-brother&#x27;s condition, the Princess had only days before moved to East Anglia, where she was the greatest landowner. She began to assemble an armed following and sent a letter to the council, demanding to be recognised as queen. It arrived on 10 July, the day Jane Grey was proclaimed as queen. The Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s oration, held before Jane the previous day, did not move her to accept the Crown—her parents&#x27; assistance was required for that. Dudley had not prepared for resolute action on Mary&#x27;s part and needed a week to build up a larger force. He was in a dilemma over who should lead the troops. He was the most experienced general in the kingdom, but he did not want to leave the government in the hands of his colleagues, in some of whom he had little confidence. Queen Jane decided the issue by demanding that her father, the Duke of Suffolk, should remain with her and the council. On 14 July Northumberland headed for Cambridge with 1,500 troops and some artillery, having reminded his colleagues of the gravity of the cause, &quot;what chance of variance soever might grow amongst you in my absence&quot;.

Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary&#x27;s military camp was gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a hopeless campaign. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July a letter from the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Mary Queen and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the council&#x27;s orders all the time and that he did not now wish &quot;to combat the Council&#x27;s decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same.&quot; Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and &quot;so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief.&quot; The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke&#x27;s feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.

Northumberland rode through the City of London to the Tower on 25 July, with his guards struggling to protect him against the hostile populace. A pamphlet appearing shortly after his arrest illustrated the general hatred of him: &quot;the great devil Dudley ruleth, Duke I should have said&quot;. He was now commonly thought to have poisoned King Edward while Mary &quot;would have been as glad of her brother&#x27;s life, as the ragged bear is glad of his death&quot;. Dumbfounded by the turn of events, the French ambassador Noailles wrote: &quot;I have witnessed the most sudden change believable in men, and I believe that God alone worked it.&quot; David Loades, biographer of both Queen Mary and John Dudley, concludes that the lack of fighting clouds the fact that this outcome was a close-run affair, and warns
===Trial and execution===
Northumberland was tried on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall. The panels of the jury and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues. Dudley hinted that he had acted on the authority of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked &quot;whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges&quot;. After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen&#x27;s mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to &quot;confess to a learned divine&quot; and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward&#x27;s reign in the Tower and was now Mary&#x27;s Lord Chancellor. The Duke&#x27;s execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that &quot;the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us now is that we have erred from the faith these sixteen years.&quot; A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley&#x27;s words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt &quot;that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke&quot;, as he wrote in a desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: &quot;O my good lord remember how sweet life is, and how bitter ye contrary.&quot; On the scaffold, before 10,000 people, Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained:

==Assessments==

===Historical reputation===
A black legend about the Duke of Northumberland was already in the making when he was still in power, the more after his fall. From the last days of Henry VIII he was to have planned, years in advance, the destruction of both King Edward&#x27;s Seymour uncles—Lord Thomas and the Protector—as well as Edward himself. He also served as an indispensable scapegoat: It was the most practical thing for Queen Mary to believe that Dudley had been acting all alone and it was in nobody&#x27;s interest to doubt it. Further questions were unwelcome, as Charles V&#x27;s ambassadors found out: &quot;it was thought best not to inquire too closely into what had happened, so as to make no discoveries that might prejudice those [who tried the duke]&quot;. By renouncing the Protestantism he had so conspicuously stood for, Northumberland lost every respect and became ineligible for rehabilitation in a world dominated by thinking along sectarian lines. Protestant writers like John Foxe and John Ponet concentrated on the pious King Edward&#x27;s achievements and reinvented Somerset as the &quot;good Duke&quot;—it followed that there had also to be a &quot;wicked Duke&quot;. This interpretation was enhanced by the High and Late Victorian historians, James Anthony Froude and A. F. Pollard, who saw Somerset as a champion of political liberty whose desire &quot;to do good&quot; was thwarted by, in Pollard&#x27;s phrase, &quot;the subtlest intriguer in English History&quot;.

As late as 1968/1970, W. K. Jordan embraced this good duke/bad duke dichotomy in a two-volume study of Edward VI&#x27;s reign. However, he saw the King on the verge of assuming full authority at the beginning of 1553 (with Dudley contemplating retirement) and ascribed the succession alteration to Edward&#x27;s resolution, Northumberland playing the part of the loyal and tragic enforcer instead of the original instigator. Many historians have since seen the &quot;devise&quot; as Edward&#x27;s very own project. Others, while remarking upon the plan&#x27;s sloppy implementation, have seen Northumberland as behind the scheme, yet in concord with Edward&#x27;s convictions; the Duke acting out of despair for his own survival, or to rescue political and religious reform and save England from Habsburg domination.

Since the 1970s, critical reassessments of the Duke of Somerset&#x27;s policies and government style led to acknowledgment that Northumberland revitalised and reformed the Privy Council as a central part of the administration, and that he &quot;took the necessary but unpopular steps to hold the minority regime together&quot;. Stability and reconstruction have been made out as the mark of most of his policies; the scale of his motivation ranging from &quot;determined ambition&quot; with G. R. Elton in 1977 to &quot;idealism of a sort&quot; with Diarmaid MacCulloch in 1999. Dale Hoak concluded in 1980: &quot;given the circumstances which he inherited in 1549, the duke of Northumberland appears to have been one of the most remarkably able governors of any European state during the sixteenth century.&quot;

===Personality===
John Dudley&#x27;s recantation of his Protestant faith before his execution delighted Queen Mary and enraged Lady Jane. The general opinion, especially among Protestants, was that he tried to seek a pardon by this move. Historians have often believed that he had no faith whatsoever, being a mere cynic. Further explanations—both contemporary and modern—have been that Northumberland sought to rescue his family from the axe, that, in the face of catastrophe, he found a spiritual home in the church of his childhood, or that he saw the hand of God in Mary&#x27;s success. Although he endorsed the Reformation from at least the mid-1530s, Dudley may not have understood theological subtleties, being a &quot;simple man in such matters&quot;. The Duke was stung by an outspoken letter he received from John Knox, whom he had invited to preach before the King and in vain had offered a bishopric. William Cecil was informed: 

Northumberland was not an old-style peer, despite his aristocratic ancestry and existence as a great lord. He acquired, sold, and exchanged lands, but never strove to build himself a territorial power base or a large armed force of retainers (which proved fatal in the end). His maximum income of £4,300 p.a. from land and a £2,000 p.a. from annuities and fees, was appropriate to his rank and figured well below the annuity of £5,333 p.a. the Duke of Somerset had granted himself, thus reaching an income of over £10,000 p.a. while in office. John Dudley was a typical Tudor Crown servant, self-interested but absolutely loyal to the incumbent sovereign: The monarch&#x27;s every wish was law. This uncritical stance may have played a decisive role in Northumberland&#x27;s decision to implement Edward&#x27;s succession device, as it did in his attitude towards Mary when she had become queen. The fear his services could be inadequate or go unacknowledged by the monarch was constant in Dudley, who also was very sensitive on what he called &quot;estimation&quot;, meaning status. Edmund Dudley was unforgotten: &quot;my poor father&#x27;s fate who, after his master was gone, suffered death for doing his master&#x27;s commandments&quot;, the Duke wrote to Cecil nine months before his own end.

John Dudley was an imposing figure with a strong temperament who could also charm people with his courtesy and a graceful presence. He was a family man, an understanding father and husband who was passionately loved by his wife. Frequent phases of illness, partly due to a stomach ailment, occasioned long absences from court but did not reduce his high output of paperwork, and may have had an element of hypochondria in them. The English diplomat Richard Morrison wrote of his onetime superior: &quot;This Earl had such a head that he seldom went about anything but he had three or four purposes beforehand.&quot; A French eyewitness of 1553 described him as &quot;an intelligent man who could explain his ideas and who displayed an impressive dignity. Others, who did not know him, would have considered him worthy of a kingdom.&quot;

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;Hymn to the Flag&#x27;) is the national anthem of Albania, adopted in 1912. Its music is derived from the Romanian patriotic song &quot;Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire&quot;, composed by Ciprian Porumbescu. The lyrics, was written by Albanian poet Asdreni. The anthem was originally titled &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;The Pledge on the Flag&quot;).

==History==
On 21 April 1912, &quot;&quot; was first published as a poem in (), an Albanian newspaper in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was later printed in a volume of poems by Drenova titled (&quot;Dreams and Tears&quot;) which was published in Bucharest. According to Lasgush Poradeci&#x27;s memoirs, the anthem, created by the adaptation of the text to the music, was not originally intended to be a national anthem, but it was so well liked by the people that it was proclaimed as the national anthem in 1912, and it was with its music that the Albanian flag was raised during the Albanian Proclamation of Independence in Vlore.

===Music===
A Hungarian composer, György Ligeti, opined that the music composed by Porumbescu is rooted in Germanic and Austrian musical traditions, though this is not a definitive groundbreaking explanation of its influence and later creation. It is a view based on Porumbescu&#x27;s musical education, since he had studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. The view has been shared by Albanian musicologist, Ramadan Sokoli.

==Lyrics==
The second half of each verse is considered refrain and is repeated. Usually only the first stanza of the anthem is performed, such as during sporting events.


===In other alphabets===
Albanian has historically been written in a number of different alphabets, and alternate alphabets are used to write different Albanian dialects.

<text>Newi is an acronym for NEw World Infrastructure, a software architecture for software componentry, mostly known as Newi Business Objects which coined the term &quot;business object&quot;. Newi was developed by Oliver Sims at the software engineering company Integrated Object Systems, England. It was one of the first implemented architectures for software components.

== Overview ==
Newi was what today is called a component container. The concepts behind the Newi middleware can be found in Oliver Sims&#x27; book &quot;Business Objects&quot;, McGraw-Hill 1994. In spite of the title, the book was about software components.

Newi components were language-neutral. That is, a Newi component could be written in one of a variety of languages that was supported by Newi. At its height, Newi supported software components written in Cobol, Ada, C, C++, Rexx, and Java. Platforms supported included Windows 3.1, Win95, WinNT, three varieties of Unix - and a prototype supporting components written in RPG was running on the AS400.

Newi components were intended to be &quot;objects in the large&quot;. There was a form of sub/supertyping which was implemented by the infrastructure through an intelligent delegation mechanism. For example, a component written in C could be &quot;subtyped&quot; by a component written in Cobol. Component names (or types?) were separated from the code implementation module. Messages (both sync and async) were passed using a proprietary form of &quot;tagged data&quot; (a similar concept to today&#x27;s XML). There was also a notification service. The various system services (including the GUI framework and communications subsystems) were implemented as Newi components. Throughout, there was a rigorous focus on making the programming of application components as simple as possible, with Newi providing many transparencies.

From the start, Newi was targeted at both front-end GUI systems and back-end server systems. The front-end version had a GUI run-time framework implemented as components. The component concept fitted very well with the object-based UI provided. Hence a designer/programmer used the same technical code structure to implement both front-end and back-end business function.

== History==
The initial concept behind Newi originated in 1989 when Oliver Sims, then working for IBM, saw the need for an infrastructure whereby a given real-world business concept (process or entity) could be implemented as a software module that could be plugged into a running system. Applications would be created by composing an appropriate set of modules. IBM UK funded development of the concept through collaboration with Softwright, a UK bespoke software company.

After several successful prototypes, and an early AS400 production version, a joint venture called Integrated Object Systems (IOS) was created in 1993 to exploit the concept. The first version of Newi was announced and shipped in 1994.

In early 1996, IOS was bought by SSA (System Software Associates, Inc), who saw great potential in Newi. The software was significantly further developed within SSA, in particular in its back-end capability, as well as having its underlying communications function moved to a COTS Corba product that provided the communications &quot;wet string&quot; while maintaining the Newi programming model and loosely coupled component interaction. Tools were also significantly expanded. SSA also announced an early and proprietary form of web services, based on the re-developed Newi, called &quot;Semantic Message Gateways&quot;, or SMG.

In 1998, for reasons other than their technology base, SSA had to downsize dramatically; Newi development was halted then abandoned, and the development team (around forty people in UK and US) was dispersed.

<doc id="166942" wikidata="Q2586606" url="?curid=166942" title="Bones (instrument)">
<text>The bones, also known as rhythm bones, are a folk instrument that, in their original form, consists of a pair of animal bones, but may also be played on pieces of wood or similar material. Sections of large rib bones and lower leg bones are the most commonly used bones, although wooden sticks shaped like true bones are now more often used. Metal spoons may be used instead, as is common in the United States, known as &quot;playing the spoons&quot;. The technique probably arrived in the U.S. via Irish and other European immigrants, and has a history stretching back to ancient China, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.
They have contributed to many music genres, including 19th century minstrel shows, traditional Irish and Scottish music, the blues, bluegrass, zydeco, French-Canadian music, and music from Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The clacking of the loose rib bones produces a much sharper sound than the zydeco washboard or frottoir, which mimics rattling a bone up and down a fixed ribcage.


==Description==
Rhythm bones are typically about in length, but can be much longer, and they are often curved, roughly resembling miniature barrel staves. Bones can also be flat, for example by the cutting of a yardstick. They are played by holding them between one&#x27;s fingers, convex surfaces facing one another, and moving one&#x27;s wrist in such a way that they knock against each other. One method involves placing the bones to either side of the middle finger such that approximately two-thirds of their length extends along the palm while the remainder protrudes above the fingers on the backside of the hand. The hand is held in a loose fist with the bones and the curled fingers roughly parallel to the palm, with the bone closest to the ring finger gently held against the palm by the tip of the ring finger placed on its edge, while the other bone is left free to move in the &quot;hinge&quot; formed by the index and middle fingers as they gently hold it. It is also possible to play the &quot;hinge&quot; on the lower (ring finger) bone while locking the top (index finger) bone against the palm.

==Technique==
A player may use a pair of bones in each hand, or just a single pair in one hand.

A critical element to playing the bones is not trying to force them to make contact with one another through finger manipulation but allowing their momentum to do the work. By moving the hand back and forth across the chest, with just enough force on the bones to keep them from falling out of the hand, a patient learner can produce a triple click. This &quot;click-it-y&quot; sound is the essential ingredient to playing the bones. A double-click can be produced by the same movement of the hand with the addition of a bit of pressure to the bones to suppress the third click. Once these elemental triple and double figures have been mastered, they can be combined to create complex combinations of rhythmic sounds. The effect is further enhanced by the use of two pairs of bones, one in each hand. A skilled practitioner can produce a wide variety of percussive sounds reminiscent of those made by a tap dancer.

The Irish tradition is unique to the island. While North American players are typically two-handed, the Irish tradition finds the vast majority of bones players using only one hand, a distinction in method that has a strong impact on musical articulation.

The comparison of the function of banjo rolls with that of bones within an ensemble suggests that stereotypically a subdivided accompaniment pattern is played on the bones.

The song &quot;This Old Man&quot; describes bone playing, particularly sheep bone playing (hence paddywhack).

<text>Erwin S. Strauss is an American author, science fiction fan, noted member of the MITSFS, and filk musician, born in Washington, D.C. He frequently is known by the nickname &quot;Filthy Pierre&quot;. He was injured descending a stairway at SMOFcon 41in December 2023, and in January 2024 announced his retirement.

==Science fiction and writing==
Strauss has been chairman of a number of science fiction conventions, such as Boskone 3 in 1966 and RailCon in 1975; and a member of the committee for at least one Worldcon, Noreascon 3, in 1989. He was an early (1964) vice president of the MIT Science Fiction Society. In addition, he was the author of the monthly &quot;SF Convention Calendar&quot; in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine until the March 2024 issue, and his flyer racks (&quot;Filthy boards&quot;) were seen at conventions all over the East Coast. He is the author and/or editor of a number of books, articles, and fanzines. He is a frequent Guest of Honor at SF conventions, including Arisia, Boskone, and Albacon. Strauss is the creator of the Voodoo board message board system once used at conventions such as Worldcons, WisCon, and Arisia.

==Libertarian publishing==
Strauss is most well known in libertarian circles for his longstanding publication of &quot;The Connection&quot;, an amateur press association (APA). The APA was started under the name &quot;The Libertarian Connection&quot; by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw (using pseudonyms) in 1968. Strauss wrote for it as &quot;Filthy Pierre&quot; almost from the beginning, and in 1979 he took over as publisher. Although Strauss dropped the word &quot;libertarian&quot; from the title (to indicate that it was open to all participants), the strong libertarian perspective of the contributors remained. Strauss continued to publish it until 2023.

<text>Cartilage is a resilient and smooth type of connective tissue. Semi-transparent and non-porous, it is usually covered by a tough and fibrous membrane called perichondrium. In tetrapods, it covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints as articular cartilage, and is a structural component of many body parts including the rib cage, the neck and the bronchial tubes, and the intervertebral discs. In other taxa, such as chondrichthyans and cyclostomes, it constitutes a much greater proportion of the skeleton. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen fibers and, sometimes, elastin. It usually grows quicker than bone.

Because of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the cricoid cartilage and carina.

Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of collagenous extracellular matrix, abundant ground substance that is rich in proteoglycan and elastin fibers. Cartilage is classified into three types elastic cartilage, hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage which differ in their relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan.

As cartilage does not contain blood vessels or nerves, it is insensitive. However, some fibrocartilage such as the meniscus of the knee has partial blood supply. Nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion. The compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage generates fluid flow, which assists the diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes. Compared to other connective tissues, cartilage has a very slow turnover of its extracellular matrix and is documented to repair at only a very slow rate relative to other tissues.

== Structure ==
=== Development ===
In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules (aggrecan and collagen type II) that form the extracellular matrix. In all vertebrates, cartilage is the main skeletal tissue in early ontogenetic stages; in osteichthyans, many cartilaginous elements subsequently ossify through endochondral and perichondral ossification.

Following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis, cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state. The division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly, and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself. It has been identified that non-coding RNAs (e.g. miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) as the most important epigenetic modulators can affect the chondrogenesis. This also justifies the non-coding RNAs&#x27; contribution in various cartilage-dependent pathological conditions such as arthritis, and so on.

=== Articular cartilage ===
The articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM consists mainly of proteoglycan and collagens. The main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan, which, as its name suggests, forms large aggregates with hyaluronan and with itself. These aggregates are negatively charged and hold water in the tissue. The collagen, mostly collagen type II, constrains the proteoglycans. The ECM responds to tensile and compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage. Cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition, but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body. The ECM of articular cartilage is classified into three regions: the pericellular matrix, the territorial matrix, and the interterritorial matrix. 

== Function ==
=== Mechanical properties ===
The mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro, micro, and nano-scales. These mechanical properties include the response of cartilage in frictional, compressive, shear and tensile loading. Cartilage is resilient and displays viscoelastic properties.

Since cartilage has interstitial fluid that is free-moving, it makes the material difficult to test. One of the tests commonly used to overcome this obstacle is a confined compression test, which can be used in either a &#x27;creep&#x27; or &#x27;relaxation&#x27; mode. In creep mode, the tissue displacement is measured as a function of time under a constant load, and in relaxation mode, the force is measured as a function of time under constant displacement. In creep mode, the tissue displacement is measured as a function of time under a constant load. During this mode, the deformation of the tissue has two main regions. In the first region, the displacement is rapid due to the initial flow of fluid out of the cartilage, and in the second region, the displacement slows down to an eventual constant equilibrium value. Under the commonly used loading conditions, the equilibrium displacement can take hours to reach.

In both the creep mode and the relaxation mode of a confined compression test, a disc of cartilage is placed in an impervious, fluid-filled container and covered with a porous plate that restricts the flow of interstitial fluid to the vertical direction. This test can be used to measure the aggregate modulus of cartilage, which is typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.9 MPa for articular cartilage, and the Young’s Modulus, which is typically 0.45 to 0.80 MPa. The aggregate modulus is “a measure of the stiffness of the tissue at equilibrium when all fluid flow has ceased”, and Young’s modulus is a measure of how much a material strains (changes length) under a given stress.

The confined compression test can also be used to measure permeability, which is defined as the resistance to fluid flow through a material. Higher permeability allows for fluid to flow out of a material’s matrix more rapidly, while lower permeability leads to an initial rapid fluid flow and a slow decrease to equilibrium. Typically, the permeability of articular cartilage is in the range of 10^-15 to 10^-16 m^4/Ns. However, permeability is sensitive to loading conditions and testing location. For example, permeability varies throughout articular cartilage and tends to be highest near the joint surface and lowest near the bone (or “deep zone”). Permeability also decreases under increased loading of the tissue.

Indentation testing is an additional type of test commonly used to characterize cartilage. Indentation testing involves using an indentor (usually &lt;0.8 mm) to measure the displacement of the tissue under constant load. Similar to confined compression testing, it may take hours to reach equilibrium displacement. This method of testing can be used to measure the aggregate modulus, Poisson&#x27;s ratio, and permeability of the tissue. Initially, there was a misconception that due to its predominantly water-based composition, cartilage had a Poisson&#x27;s ratio of 0.5 and should be modeled as an incompressible material. However, subsequent research has disproven this belief. The Poisson’s ratio of articular cartilage has been measured to be around 0.4 or lower in humans and ranges from 0.46–0.5 in bovine subjects. 

The mechanical properties of articular cartilage are largely anisotropic, test-dependent, and can be age-dependent. These properties also depend on collagen-proteoglycan interactions and therefore can increase/decrease depending on the total content of water, collagen, glycoproteins, etc. For example, increased glucosaminoglycan content leads to an increase in compressive stiffness, and increased water content leads to a lower aggregate modulus.

=== Tendon-bone interface ===
In addition to its role in load-bearing joints, cartilage serves a crucial function as a gradient material between softer tissues and bone. Mechanical gradients are crucial for your body’s function, and for complex artificial structures including joint implants. Interfaces with mismatched material properties lead to areas of high stress concentration which, over the millions of loading cycles experienced by human joins over a lifetime, would eventually lead to failure. For example, the elastic modulus of human bone is roughly 20 GPa while the softer regions of cartilage can be about 0.5 to 0.9 MPa. When there is a smooth gradient of materials properties, however, stresses are distributed evenly across the interface, which puts less wear on each individual part. 

The body solves this problem with stiffer, higher modulus layers near bone, with high concentrations of mineral deposits such as hydroxyapatite. Collagen fibers (which provide mechanical stiffness in cartilage) in this region are anchored directly to bones, reducing the possible deformation. Moving closer to soft tissue into the region known as the tidemark, the density of chondrocytes increases and collagen fibers are rearranged to optimize for stress dissipation and low friction. The outermost layer near the articular surface is known as the superficial zone, which primarily serves as a lubrication region. Here cartilage is characterized by a dense extracellular matrix and is rich in proteoglycans (which dispel and reabsorb water to soften impacts) and thin collagen oriented parallel to the joint surface which have excellent shear resistant properties. 

Osteoarthritis and natural aging both have negative effects on cartilage as a whole as well as the proper function of the materials gradient within. The earliest changes are often in the superficial zone, the softest and most lubricating part of the tissue. Degradation of this layer can put additional stresses on deeper layers which are not designed to support the same deformations. Another common effect of aging is increased crosslinking of collagen fibers. This leads to stiffer cartilage as a whole, which again can lead to early failure as stiffer tissue is more susceptible to fatigue based failure. Aging in calcified regions also generally leads to a larger number of mineral deposits, which has a similarly undesired stiffening effect. Osteoarthritis has more extreme effects and can entirely wear down cartilage, causing direct bone-to-bone contact.

=== Frictional properties ===
Lubricin, a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid, plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage.

=== Repair ===
Cartilage has limited repair capabilities: Because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae, they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Therefore, cartilage damage is difficult to heal. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Over the last years, surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of cartilage repair procedures that help to postpone the need for joint replacement. A tear of the meniscus of the knee cartilage can often be surgically trimmed to reduce problems. Complete healing of cartilage after injury or repair procedures is hindered by cartilage-specific inflammation caused by the involvement of M1/M2 macrophages, mast cells, and their intercellular interactions.

Biological engineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage, using a cellular &quot;scaffolding&quot; material and cultured cells to grow artificial cartilage. Extensive researches have been conducted on freeze-thawed PVA hydrogels as a base material for such a purpose. These gels have exhibited great promises in terms of biocompatibility, wear resistance, shock absorption, friction coefficient, flexibility, and lubrication, and thus are considered superior to polyethylene-based cartilages. A two-year implantation of the PVA hydrogels as artificial meniscus in rabbits showed that the gels remain intact without degradation, fracture, or loss of properties.

== Clinical significance ==
=== Disease ===

Several diseases can affect cartilage. Chondrodystrophies are a group of diseases, characterized by the disturbance of growth and subsequent ossification of cartilage. Some common diseases that affect the cartilage are listed below.
* Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint, however, one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage. The cartilage covering bones (articular cartilage—a subset of hyaline cartilage) is thinned, eventually completely wearing away, resulting in a &quot;bone against bone&quot; within the joint, leading to reduced motion, and pain. Osteoarthritis affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of &quot;wear and tear&quot; rather than a true disease. It is treated by arthroplasty, the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint often made of a stainless steel alloy (cobalt chromoly) and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. Chondroitin sulfate or glucosamine sulfate supplements, have been claimed to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, but there is little good evidence to support this claim. In osteoarthritis, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines cause aberrant changes in differentiated chondrocytes function which leads to an excess of chondrocyte catabolic activity, mediated by factors including matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases.
* Traumatic rupture or detachment: The cartilage in the knee is frequently damaged but can be partially repaired through knee cartilage replacement therapy. Often when athletes talk of damaged &quot;cartilage&quot; in their knee, they are referring to a damaged meniscus (a fibrocartilage structure) and not the articular cartilage.
* Achondroplasia: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism.
* Costochondritis: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest pain.
* Spinal disc herniation: Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia often compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain.
* Relapsing polychondritis: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death occurs by asphyxiation as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses.

Tumors made up of cartilage tissue, either benign or malignant, can occur. They usually appear in bone, rarely in pre-existing cartilage. The benign tumors are called chondroma, the malignant ones chondrosarcoma. Tumors arising from other tissues may also produce a cartilage-like matrix, the best-known being pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands.

The matrix of cartilage acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of lymphocytes or diffusion of immunoglobulins. This property allows for the transplantation of cartilage from one individual to another without fear of tissue rejection.

=== Imaging ===
Cartilage does not absorb X-rays under normal &quot;in vivo&quot; conditions, but a dye can be injected into the synovial membrane that will cause the to be absorbed by the dye. The resulting void on the radiographic film between the bone and meniscus represents the cartilage. For in vitro scans, the outer soft tissue is most likely removed, so the cartilage and air boundary are enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to the refraction of the .

== Other animals ==
=== Cartilaginous fish ===
Cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes) or sharks, rays and chimaeras have a skeleton composed entirely of cartilage.

=== Invertebrate cartilage ===
Cartilage tissue can also be found among some arthropods such as horseshoe crabs, some mollusks such as marine snails and cephalopods, and some annelids like sabellid polychaetes.

====Arthropods====
The most studied cartilage in arthropods is the branchial cartilage of &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;. It is a vesicular cell-rich cartilage due to the large, spherical and vacuolated chondrocytes with no homologies in other arthropods. Other type of cartilage found in &quot;L. polyphemus&quot; is the endosternite cartilage, a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component, much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage, with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies. There are homologous tissues to the endosternite cartilage in other arthropods. The embryos of &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot; express ColA and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite, which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage. The endosternite cartilage forms close to Hh-expressing ventral nerve cords and expresses ColA and SoxE, a Sox9 analog. This is also seen in gill cartilage tissue.

====Mollusks====
In cephalopods, the models used for the studies of cartilage are &quot;Octopus vulgaris&quot; and &quot;Sepia officinalis&quot;. The cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage. The growth is thought to take place throughout the movement of cells from the periphery to the center. The chondrocytes present different morphologies related to their position in the tissue.
The embryos of &quot;S. officinalis&quot; express ColAa, ColAb, and hyaluronan in the cranial cartilages and other regions of chondrogenesis. This implies that the cartilage is fibrillar-collagen-based. The &quot;S. officinalis&quot; embryo expresses hh, whose presence causes ColAa and ColAb expression and is also able to maintain proliferating cells undiferentiated. It has been observed that this species presents the expression SoxD and SoxE, analogs of the vertebrate Sox5/6 and Sox9, in the developing cartilage. The cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage.

In gastropods, the interest lies in the odontophore, a cartilaginous structure that supports the radula. The most studied species regarding this particular tissue is &quot;Busycotypus canaliculatus&quot;. The odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage, consisting of vacuolated cells containing myoglobin, surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen. The odontophore contains muscle cells along with the chondrocytes in the case of &quot;Lymnaea&quot; and other mollusks that graze vegetation.

====Sabellid polychaetes====
The sabellid polychaetes, or feather duster worms, have cartilage tissue with cellular and matrix specialization supporting their tentacles. They present two distinct extracellular matrix regions. These regions are an acellular fibrous region with a high collagen content, called cartilage-like matrix, and collagen lacking a highly cellularized core, called osteoid-like matrix. The cartilage-like matrix surrounds the osteoid-like matrix. The amount of the acellular fibrous region is variable. The model organisms used in the study of cartilage in sabellid polychaetes are &quot;Potamilla&quot; species and &quot;Myxicola infundibulum&quot;.

== Plants and fungi ==
Vascular plants, particularly seeds, and the stems of some mushrooms, are sometimes called &quot;cartilaginous&quot;, although they contain no cartilage.

<doc id="166950" wikidata="Q380794" url="?curid=166950" title="Aleksandër Stavre Drenova">
<text>Aleksandër Stavre Drenova (; 11 April 187211 December 1947), commonly known by the pen name Asdreni, was an Albanian poet, rilindas, translator, writer and the author of the poem which later became the national anthem of Albania. He is regarded as one of the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century and composed most of his Albanian Renaissance-inspired known works during that period. 
Born in the village of Drenovë, Asdreni completed his academic studies at the University of Bucharest in Romania where he enthusiastically committed himself to the Independence of Albania from the Ottoman Empire. He maintained close liaison with fellow Gjergj Fishta and Lasgush Poradeci and was notably inspired by the patriots Girolamo de Rada and Naim Frashëri.
&quot;Rreze dielli&quot;, a collection of 99 poems, was his first prominent work which he dedicated to the national hero of Albania Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. Devoted to Edith Durham a friend of Albania, his second collection of again 99 poems, &quot;Ëndrra e lotë&quot;, displayed a wider range of themes and motifs as well as his more astonishing maturity.

On the 30th of June 2021 the new 10000 Lekë banknote was issued by the Bank of Albania with the main portrait being that of Asdreni.

== Biography ==

=== Life and career ===

Asdreni was born as Aleksandër Stavre Drenova on 11 April 1872 into an Albanian peasant family of Eastern Orthodox faith in the village of Drenovë close to the city of Korçë in what was then part of the Ottoman Empire and is now Albania. In his native village he properly received his early formal education at a Greek primary school and had just started secondary school in Korçë subsequently his father, Stavri Thimiu, died leaving him fatherless. 

The surrounding region Korçë had been a prime source of Albanian migration which was additionally strengthened by an earthquake in 1879. He consequently migrated to Bucharest in 1885 and rejoined his more elderly brothers where he also commenced his short-living studies at the Faculty of Political Science of the University of Bucharest. 

In the new country, Asdreni came into liaison with other Albanian intellectuals and writers with whom he started to strengthen the Albanian diaspora in Romania for the struggle of national liberation. Prior to that, he was strongly inspired by Girolamo de Rada and Naim Frashëri as well as by the Albanian Renaissance in which the Albanians came to acknowledge themselves as a nation deserving the right to govern themselves.

Asdreni died in 1947 in Bucharest. He was initially buried there, at the Sfânta Vineri Cemetery (where Nikolla Naço is also buried), but his remains were brought to Albania and buried in Drenovë in 1974.

== Literature ==

=== Writings and publication === 

The literary career of Asdreni blossomed simultaneously with the beginning of the 20th century. In his first work, a collection of 99 poems known as the &quot;Rreze dielli&quot; dedicated to the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg who led a successful resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe, he followed the literary traditions of Naim Frashëri and raised his love for the motherland encouraging his compatriots to enter the struggle for liberation from the Ottoman Empire.

&quot;Ëndrra e lotë&quot;, his second work also composed of 99 poems dedicated to Edith Durham who travelled extensively across Albania, is characterised by a wealth of poetic values. He instantly expressed his democratic values, his interests in societal problems at the time as well as his critical discourses on foreign domination. It was an important step from Romanticism towards Realism which was characterised by the historical time frame and reference, and writing about events and situations that happened in real life. 
His poem &quot;Kënga e bashkimit&quot; (The Song of Unity), published in the volume Ëndrra [dh]e lotë (&quot;Dreams and tears&quot;, 1912), is a clear adaptation of the Romanian song &quot;Hora Unirii&quot; by Vasile Alecsandri.

<text>The Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party ( &#x27; ), also transliterated asBa&#x27;th (), was a political party founded in Syria by Michel Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar, and associates of Zaki al-Arsuzi. The party espoused Ba&#x27;athism, which is an ideology mixing Arab nationalist, pan-Arab, Arab socialist, and anti-imperialist interests. Ba&#x27;athism calls for the unification of the Arab world into a single state. Its motto, &quot;Unity, Freedom, Socialism&quot;, refers to Arab unity and freedom from non-Arab control and interference.

The party was founded by the merger of the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement, led by ʿAflaq and al-Bitar, and the Arab Ba&#x27;ath, led by al-ʾArsūzī, on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party. The party quickly established branches in other Arab countries, although it would only hold power in Iraq and Syria. In 1952, the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party merged with the Arab Socialist Movement, led by Akram al-Hawrani, to form the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party. The newly formed party was a relative success, and it became the second-largest party in the Syrian parliament in the 1954 election. This, coupled with the increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party, led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria, in 1958. The UAR would prove unsuccessful, and was dissolved following the 1961 Syrian coup d&#x27;état.

Following the break-up of the UAR, the Ba&#x27;ath Party was reconstituted. However, during the UAR period, military activists had established the Military Committee that took control of the Ba&#x27;ath Party away from civilian hands. In the meantime, in Iraq, the local Ba&#x27;ath Party branch had taken power by orchestrating and leading the Ramadan Revolution, only to lose power a couple of months later. The Military Committee, with Aflaq&#x27;s consent, took power in Syria in the 1963 Syrian coup d&#x27;état.

A power struggle quickly developed between the civilian faction led by ʿAflaq, al-Bitar, and Munīf ar-Razzāz and the Military Committee led by Salah Jadid and Hafez al-Assad. As relations between the two factions deteriorated, the Military Committee initiated the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, which ousted the National Command led by al-Razzāz, ʿAflaq, and their supporters. The 1966 coup split the Ba&#x27;ath Party between the Iraqi-dominated Ba&#x27;ath Party and the Syrian-dominated Ba&#x27;ath Party. There are currently no longer any Ba’athist countries after the fall of the Ba’ath regime in Syria on December 8, 2024.
==History==

The party was founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party by Michel Aflaq (an Antiochian Orthodox Christian), Salah al-Din al-Bitar (a Sunni Muslim), and the followers of Zaki al-Arsuzi (an Alawite who later became an atheist) in Damascus, Syria, leading to the establishment of the Syrian Regional Branch. Other regional branches were established throughout the Arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s, in, among others, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Throughout its existence, the National Command (the body responsible for all-Arab affairs) gave most attention to Syrian affairs. The 2nd National Congress was convened in June 1954 and elected a seven-man National Command; Aflaq, Bitar, and Akram al-Hawrani were elected and represented the Syrian Regional Branch, while Abdullah Rimawi and Abdallah Na&#x27;was were elected to represent the Jordanian Branch. The 1954 congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the Arab Socialist Movement and the Ba&#x27;ath Party, which took place in 1952.

The Syrian Regional Branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the Syrian Regional Branch won 22 seats in parliament, becoming the second largest party in the country. 90 percent of Ba&#x27;ath Party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament. The failure of the traditional parties, represented by the People&#x27;s Party and the National Party, strengthened the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s public credibility. Through this position, the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet; Bitar was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Khalil Kallas became Minister of Economics. Its new, strengthened position was used successfully to garner support for Syria&#x27;s merger with Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, which led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1958.

On 24 June 1959, Fuad al-Rikabi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, accused the National Command of betraying Arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the UAR. In light of these criticisms, the Ba&#x27;ath convened the 3rd National Congress, held 27 August–1 September 1959, attended by delegates from Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, South Arabia, the Gulf, &quot;Arab South&quot;, &quot;Arab Maghreb&quot;, Palestine, and Party student organisations in Arab and other universities. The congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch, which had been decided by Aflaq and Bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958, and for expelling Rimawi, the Regional Secretary of the Jordanian Regional Branch. Rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party, the Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba&#x27;ath Party, which established a rival National Command to compete with the original. The National Command responded to the problems in Iraq by appointing a Temporary Regional Command on 2 February 1960, which appointed Talib El-Shibib as Regional Secretary, and on 15 June 1961 the National Command expelled Rikabi from the party.

In Iraq, the Iraqi Regional Branch had supported Abd al-Karim Qasim&#x27;s seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the Iraqi Monarchy. The Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists supported Qasim on the grounds that they believed he would enter Iraq into the UAR, enlarging the Arab nationalist republic. However, this was proven to be a ruse, and after taking power, Qasim launched an Iraq first policy. In retaliation, the Ba&#x27;ath Party tried to assassinate Qasim in February 1959, but the operation, involving a young Saddam Hussein, failed. Qasim was overthrown in the Ramadan Revolution led by young Ba&#x27;athist officer Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr; long suspected to be supported by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), however pertinent contemporary documents relating to the CIA&#x27;s operations in Iraq have remained classified by the U.S. government, although the Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists are documented to have maintained supportive relationships with U.S. officials before, during, and after the coup. The Iraqi Regional Branch, when it took power, was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in November 1963.

The 4th National Congress, held in August 1960, criticized the leadership of Aflaq and Bitar, called for the reestablishment of the Syrian Regional Branch and deemphasized the party&#x27;s commitment to Arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party. A year later, during the UAR&#x27;s nadir in Syria, the Syrian General Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi launched a coup on 28 September 1961, which led to the reestablishment of the Syrian Arab Republic.

===Rule in Syria, infighting, the 1966 coup and split: 1963–1966===
The challenges of building a Ba&#x27;athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party. The Iraqi Regional Branch was increasingly dominated by self-described Marxist Ali Salih al-Sa&#x27;di. Al-Sa&#x27;di was supported in his ideological reorientation by Hammud al-Shufi, the Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch; Yasin al-Hafiz, one of the party&#x27;s few ideological theorists; and by certain members of the secret Military Committee. The Marxist wing gained new ground at the 6th National Congress (held in October 1963), in which the Iraqi and Syrian regional branches called for the establishment of &quot;socialist planning&quot;, &quot;collective farms run by peasants&quot;, &quot;workers&#x27; democratic control of the means of production&quot;, and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of Soviet-style socialism. Aflaq, angry at this transformation of his party, retained a nominal leadership role, but the National Command as a whole came under the control of the radicals.

In 1963, the Ba&#x27;ath Party seized power in Syria, and from then on the Ba&#x27;ath functioned as the only officially recognized Syrian political party, but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of varying governments and new constitutions. On 23 February 1966, a coup d&#x27;état led by Salah Jadid, the informal head of the Military Committee, overthrew Aflaq and Bitar&#x27;s cabinet. The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid&#x27;s &quot;regionalist&quot; (qutri) camp, which promoted ambitions for a Greater Syria, and the more traditionally pan-Arab faction then in power, the &quot;nationalist&quot; (qawmi) faction. Jadid&#x27;s supporters were considered to have been more left-wing then Aflaq and his peers. Several of Jadid&#x27;s opponents managed to make their escape, and they fled to Beirut, Lebanon. Jadid moved the party in a more radical direction. Although he and his supporters had not signed onto the victorious far-left line at the 6th Party Congress, they had now moved to adopt its positions. The moderate faction, formerly led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, were purged from the party.

While it took some years, the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing National Commands, one Syrian-dominated and another Iraqi-dominated. However, both in Iraq and Syria, the Regional Command became the real centre of party power, and the membership of the National Command became a largely honorary position, often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership. One consequence of the split was that Zaki al-Arsuzi took Aflaq&#x27;s place as the official father of Ba&#x27;athist thought in the pro-Syrian Ba&#x27;ath movement, while the pro-Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath movement still considered Aflaq the &quot;de jure&quot; father of Ba&#x27;athist thought.

==Organization==
The organizational structure of the Ba&#x27;ath Party was created at the 2nd National Congress (1954) by amending the party&#x27;s Internal Regulations (), which had been previously approved at the party&#x27;s 1st National Congress (1947). The organizational structure ran from top to bottom, and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation, i.e., all contacts had to pass through a higher command level.

===National organization===

The National Command was the ruling organ of the party between sessions of the National Congress and was headed by a Secretary-General. Between National Congresses, the National Command was held accountable by the National Consultative Council (Arabic: &quot;al-majlis al-istishari al-qawmi&quot;). The National Consultative Council was a forum made up of representatives from the party&#x27;s regional branches. However, the number of National Consultative Council members was decided by the size of the regional branch. The National Congress elected the National Command, National Tribunal, the party&#x27;s discipline body, and the Secretary-General, the party leader. The congress delegates determined the party&#x27;s policies and procedures.

Before 1954, the party was ruled by the Executive Committee, but this organ, along with others, too, was replaced at the 2nd National Congress in 1954. In Ba&#x27;athist jargon, &quot;Nation&quot; means the Arab Nation, because of that, the National Command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the Ba&#x27;ath movement throughout the Arab world. The National Command had several bureaus, similar to those of the Regional Command. National Command sessions were held monthly. Of these, the National Liaisons Office was responsible for maintaining contact with the party&#x27;s Regional Branches.

===Regional organization===
A &quot;region&quot; (&quot;quṭr&quot;), in Ba&#x27;athist parlance, is an Arab state, e.g., Syria, Iraq, or Lebanon. Use of the term &quot;region&quot; reflected the Party&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge these countries as separate nation-states. The Regional Congress, which combined all the provincial branches, was the region&#x27;s highest authority and elected a Regional Command, the party leadership in a specific region; the Regional Tribunal, the body responsible for discipline inspection; and a Regional Secretary, the regional party leader. The Regional Congress was made of delegates from the provincial branches; other members attended, but as observers. The Regional Congress was responsible for evaluating the party&#x27;s performance since the last Regional Congress, while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period, which would last until the next Regional Congress was held. How long this period lasted was decided by the Regional Command. The Regional Command, similar to the Branch Command, operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions.

Below the Regional Commands were &quot;branches&quot;. The branch came above the sub-branch; it comprised at least two to five sub-branches and operated at the provincial level. The branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a Command and a Secretary (leader). The Command operated through bureaus, such as the Workers Bureau and the Bureau of the Secretariat. The &quot;sub-branch&quot; level constituted three to five sections &quot;and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical Congress.&quot; Some sub-branches were independent of central authority and elected their own Command and secretaries, while other sub-branches were incorporated into the branches. In the latter case, the sub-branch secretary would be appointed by the superior branch.

A &quot;section&quot;, which comprised two to five divisions, functioned at the level of a large city quarter, a town, or a rural district. It elected its own command, composed of five members, but the sub-branch appointed the command&#x27;s secretary. Beneath the section were &quot;divisions&quot;. A division comprised two to seven &quot;circles&quot;, controlled by a division commander. The lowest level was the circle. It was composed of three to seven members, constituting the basic organizational unit. Such Ba&#x27;athist groups occurred throughout the bureaucracy and the military. They functioned as the Party&#x27;s watchdogs and were an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration.

The Military Organization was made up of branches similar to those in the Ba&#x27;ath&#x27;s civilian sector. However, unlike the civilian sector, the Military Organization was controlled by a separate Military Bureau and held periodical Military Congresses. The Military Organization and the Civilian Organization converged at the Regional Congress.

===Membership===
There existed three types of membership categories in the Ba&#x27;ath Party: Active member (Arabic: &quot;udw ämil&quot;), Apprentice Member (Arabic: &quot;udw mutadarrib&quot;) and Supporter (Arabic: &quot;firqa&quot;). An Active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit, was given the right to vote in party elections, and could run for party office. In the Syrian Regional Branch, a member had to spend 18 months as a Supporter to be promoted to Apprentice status, and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to Active member status.

==Ideology and policy==
===Foundational Ba&#x27;ath: 1947–1960===
====Arab Nation====

For more than 2 decades, Michel Aflaq&#x27;s essay compilation titled &quot;Fi Sabil al-Ba&#x27;ath&quot; (translation: &quot;The Road to Renaissance&quot;) was the primary ideological book of the Ba&#x27;ath party. The work was published by Aflaq in 1940. From its very beginning, the party was a manifestation of Arab nationalist thought, with the party describing itself as &quot;The Party of Arab Unity&quot;. The pan-Arab tendencies of the party&#x27;s predecessor, the Arab Ba&#x27;ath Movement, were strengthened in 1945–1947 by recruiting members from Zaki al-Arsuzi&#x27;s Arab Ba&#x27;ath. The first article of the party&#x27;s constitution stated that: &quot;...the Arabs form one nation. This nation has the natural right to live in a single state. [As such,] the Arab fatherland constitutes an indivisible political and economic unit. No Arab can live apart from the others.&quot;

To express his heartfelt belief in Arab nationalism, Aflaq coined the term &quot;one Arab nation with an eternal message&quot; (). Party ideology, and Ba&#x27;athism in general, was not based on concepts such as the purity of the Arab race or ethnic chauvinism, but on idealistic concepts borrowed from the enlightenment era. According to author Tabitha Petran, the basic tenet of the party&#x27;s ideology was:

...that the Arab nation is a permanent entity in history. The Arab nation is considered, philosophically speaking, not as a social and economic formation, but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms, one of its highest contributions taking the form of Islam. It was not Islam that modeled the peoples of Arabia, the Fertile Crescent, and North Africa, equipping them with Islamic values, especially the Arabic language and the Arabic culture, but the Arab nation which created Islam. This conception of the Arab nation implicitly advantages the Arab contribution to history. On the other hand, Arab decadence can be overcome through a purifying and spiritual action, not religious but moral.

====Peasant and workers====

The early Ba&#x27;ath gave little attention to the problems facing the peasants and workers. As the historian Hanna Batatu notes, &quot;Aflaq was basically urban in outlook. The peasants never constituted an object of his special concern. In his writing there is scarcely an expression of concentrated interest in the country&#x27;s husbandsmen.&quot; While peasants and the issues they faced are mentioned in some of Aflaq&#x27;s work, there was scarcely any depth given to them. Aflaq never expressed explicit enmity towards traditional landowners. Issues such as these would only gain prominence when Akram al-Hawrani became a leading party figure and when the &quot;transitional Ba&#x27;athists&quot; took power. Of the four members in the 1st Executive Committee, Wahib al-Ghanim was the only one who paid much attention to the problems of peasants and workers, as the other members (Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar and Jalil al-Sayyide) had a middle class upbringing and upheld middle-class values. 

The early party organization never cultivated a deep following in rural areas. In fact, at the party&#x27;s founding congress, only one peasant and one worker were present among the 217 delegates. Most of the delegates were either school teacher or students attending universities. When Akram al-Hawrani&#x27;s Arab Socialist Party (ASP) merged with the Ba&#x27;ath Party, the majority of ASP members of peasant origin did not join the Ba&#x27;ath Party, instead becoming personal followers of Hawrani. However, the majority of Ba&#x27;ath members were of rural upbringing. The &quot;Transitional Ba&#x27;ath&quot;, which grew out of the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch (1958) and the Military Committee, was more rural in outlook, policy and ideology.

====&quot;Unity, Freedom, Socialism&quot;====

The slogan &quot;Unity, Freedom, Socialism&quot; is the key tenet in Ba&#x27;athist thought. Unity stood for the creation of an independent, strong Arab Nation. Liberty did not mean liberal democracy, but rather freedom from colonial oppression and freedom of speech and thought. Aflaq believed that the Ba&#x27;ath Party, at least in theory, would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people, however he did support intra-party democracy. The last tenet, &#x27;socialism&#x27;, did not mean socialism as defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. According to Ba&#x27;athist thought, socialism had originated under the rule of the Prophet Muhammad. The original interpretation of Arab socialism did not answer questions regarding economic equality or how much state control was necessary, but instead focused on freeing the Arab Nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general.

===Transitional Ba&#x27;ath: 1960–1964===
====Regionalists versus nationalists====
After the failure of the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria, the Ba&#x27;ath Party was divided into two main factions, the Regionalists () and the Nationalists (pan-Arab) (). When the union with Egypt collapsed, the Ba&#x27;ath Party was put in a difficult position, as the party still sought Arab unity but did not oppose the UAR&#x27;s dissolution and did not want to seek another union with Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s rule. However, being the unionist party that it was, the party&#x27;s leaders could not state their position on this issue. The end result was that the pro-Arab nationalists within the Ba&#x27;ath Party became committed Nasserists, while the more moderate Arab nationalists founded the pro-Nasserite Socialist Unionists party. A third group, led by people disenchanted with both Nasser and the union period, remained in the Ba&#x27;ath Party but stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-Arabism. On 21 February 1962, the National Command issued a new policy regarding the pan-Arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the UAR, but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the UAR as a decentralized federal union with Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. Many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy, with many members being both disenchanted with pan-Arabism and Aflaq&#x27;s continued party rule.

When the Syrian Regional Branch was reestablished, the majority of its members in the provinces were of communal origins – Druze, Alawi, or Ismaili. The provincial party members had not been told of the Syrian Regional Branch&#x27;s dissolution, which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the National Command. While it is true that in 1962 the Regionalists supported the slogan adopted at the 5th National Congress, &quot;the renewal of the union with Egypt while taking note of past mistakes&quot;, they treated such a slogan as a propaganda slogan rather than a feasible goal.

====The &quot;Arab road to socialism&quot;====
The disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-Arab project, led to the radicalization of the party&#x27;s interpretation of socialism. Yasin al-Hafiz, a former member of the Syrian Communist Party, was an early frontrunner for the party&#x27;s radicalization. While he didn&#x27;t oppose the pan-Arab project, he wanted to turn the concept of Arab socialism into a scientific and revolutionary socialist ideology which adapted Marxism to local conditions. Jamal al-Atassi, who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life, called for the renunciation of Arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a &quot;virtually Marxist concept of socialism&quot; by claiming that class struggle was the moving force in society.

Hammud al-Shufi became the leader of the party&#x27;s Marxist faction during his short stint as Syrian Regional Secretary, literally the head of the Syrian Regional Organization. Shufi was able, due to his position as head of the Organization Bureau of the Regional Command, to recruit several Marxist or Marxist-leaning members to the top of the Syrian Regional party hierarchy. Radical socialists led by Ali Salih al-Sadi took control of the Iraqi Regional Branch in 1963, which led to the official radicalization of the party&#x27;s ideology.

The delegates at the 6th National Congress elected an Ideology Committee that was responsible for writing a charter about the party&#x27;s ideology. The end result was the document &quot;Points of Departure&quot;. The document, which was approved by the 6th National Congress, relegated Arab unity to a secondary role and gave socialism prominence. Marxist concepts were used interchangeably alongside Ba&#x27;athist ones; however, the document was reluctant in explicitly admitting that certain ideas were of Marxist origins. The 6th National Congress borrowed key Marxist-Leninist tenets such as &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot; and emphasized the need of a socialist vanguard in-order to:

&quot;play the role of mediator and leader (even if it is in power) that acts to direct the journey of the masses towards the socialist future in a scientific way and in a democratic style&quot;.

While the &quot;Points of Departure&quot; didn&#x27;t create a break with the party&#x27;s traditional ideology, it criticized the party&#x27;s old guard for giving Arab unity primacy over socialism and their failure to turn Ba&#x27;athism into a comprehensive theory. While the documents says Arab unity is progressive, the reason for it being important changed. The document stated: &quot;Arab unity is an indispensable basis for the construction of a socialist economy.&quot; Aflaq also believed that Arab unity was only an intermediate goal, but it stood at the centre of classical Ba&#x27;athism. In the &quot;Points of Departure&quot;, despite not firmly stating it, the goal of creating a socialist society seemed to be both an immediate goal and the main goal of the party.

The concept of Arab socialism, accused of being narrow-minded and nationalistic, was replaced with the &quot;Arab road to socialism&quot; concept. The &quot;Points of Departure&quot; criticized the classical Ba&#x27;athist view regarding private ownership. Classical Ba&#x27;athists supported private ownership as a way to recruit into the party many petty bourgeois elements. The document called for nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy, the slow incorporation of the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist economy and the elimination of the national bourgeoisie and its allied classes. To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting state capitalism, the socialist economy would be controlled by a vanguard party together with popular participation from the toiler masses. Major policies in the &quot;Arab road to socialism&quot; included:

The nationalization of the major branches of the economy with the participation of the toiling masses in the management of the economy, and for the creation of collective farms to effect the revolution necessary for the peasants...the Congress stipulated that the changes be directed by a &quot;revolutionary vanguard&quot;, the final aim being to establish a &quot;popular democracy&quot; that was to guarantee freedom to the classes which constitute the true people and ensure the country&#x27;s rapid development. This regime was to center on the party, leading the popular organizations and councils and operating according to the principle of &quot;democratic centralism&quot;

==== Stance on religion ====
Militant secularism was emphasized in the &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; manifesto published by the Ba&#x27;ath party in 1960; which declared that the party&#x27;s &quot;educational policy&quot; was to build a &quot;new generation of Arabs that believe in the unity of the nation and the eternity of its mission&quot;. The manifesto also stated that this envisaged Ba&#x27;athist generation would be &quot;committed to scientific thought freed from the shackles of superstition and backward customs&quot; and replace religion with Arab nationalism as their belief system.

===Neo-Ba&#x27;ath: 1964–1966===
Neo-Ba&#x27;athism refers to the dramatic changes that manifested in Ba&#x27;athist ideology from 1960 to 1964, and the Military Committee&#x27;s takeover of the Syrian Regional Branch and the National Command in the period 1964 to 1966. The 6th National Congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left, which opposed both the traditional leaders in the National Command and the pragmatists in the Military Committee. When the anti-military left called for popular democracy, no involvement of the military in national politics and popular struggle, the Military Committee became concerned. In 1965, Ba&#x27;athist President Amin al-Hafiz imposed the socialist policies adopted in the 6th National Congress; fully nationalizing Syrian industry and vast segments of the private sector, and establishing a centralized command economy.

By 1965 the anti-military leftists began to &quot;spread rumors about the rightist character of the military junta [Military Committee] within the party and their subversive efforts to engulf it. There was not a single officer in the party who was not accused of conspiracy and reactionary tendencies.&quot; In collaboration with the National Command, the Military Committee succeeded in expelling the anti-military left from the party at the 7th National Congress. The Military Committee, which now controlled the Syrian Regional Branch, took control of the Ba&#x27;ath Party in the coup of 1966. The military committee accused the Old Guard of diluting socialist ideology and casting aside &quot;collective leadership&quot;. According to Middle East expert Avraham Ben-Tzur, &quot;the [neo-]Ba&#x27;th in its latest variant is a bureaucratic apparatus headed by the military, whose daily life and routine are shaped by the rigid military oppression on the home front, and [Soviet aid among others] military aid.&quot;

==Regional branches==
===Iraq===
Fuad al-Rikabi founded the Iraqi Regional Branch in 1951 or 1952. There are those who trace the branch&#x27;s founding to Abd ar Rahman ad Damin and Abd al Khaliq al Khudayri in 1947, after their return from the 1st National Congress, which was held in Syria. Another version is that the branch was established in 1948 by Rikabi and Sa&#x27;dun Hamadi, a Shia Muslim. However, Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi contend that the Regional Branch was established in the 1940s, but that it received official recognition as a Regional Branch of the Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1952 by the National Command. What is certain is that Rikabi was elected the Regional Branch&#x27;s first Regional Secretary in 1952.

The party initially consisted of a majority of Shia Muslims, as Rikabi recruited supporters mainly from his friends and family, but slowly became Sunni dominated. The Regional Branch, and other parties of pan-Arab inclination, had difficulties in recruiting Shia members. Most Shi&#x27;ites considered pan-Arab ideology as a Sunni project, since the majority of Arabs are Sunnis.

At the time of 14 July Revolution in 1958, which overthrew the Hashemite monarchy, the Regional Branch had 300 members. The Iraqi Regional Branch supported Abd al-Karim Qasim&#x27;s rule on the grounds that he would seek Iraq&#x27;s entry into the United Arab Republic. Of the 16-members of Qasim&#x27;s cabinet, 12 of them were Regional Branch members. After taking power, Qasim changed his position on the UAR, reverting to the old &quot;Iraq first policy&quot;. This turn displeased the Regional Branch and other Arab nationalists groups. Due to his policy reversal, the Regional Branch gathered a group, led by Saddam Hussein, which tried but failed to assassinate Qasim.

The Regional Branch seized power in the Ramadan Revolution. The coup was led by leading Regional Branch member Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. The plotters appointed Abdul Salam Arif, a Nasserite, to the Presidency while al-Bakr was appointed the country&#x27;s Prime Minister. However, real power was in the hands of Ali Salih al-Sadi, the branch&#x27;s Regional Secretary. After taking power, the Regional Branch through its militia, the National Guard, initiated what Iraqi expert Con Coughlin referred to as an &quot;orgy of violence&quot; against communist and left-wing elements. These repressive measures coupled with factionalism within the Regional Branch led to the November 1963 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état by President Arif and his Nasserite supporters. Iraq expert Malik Mufti believes Aflaq may have supported Arif&#x27;s coup because it weakened al-Sadi&#x27;s position within the party and strengthened his own. The coup forced the branch to go underground. Due to the coup, several leading Ba&#x27;athist were jailed, such as al-Bakr and Saddam. Despite this, the Regional Branch elected al-Bakr as Regional Secretary in 1964.

===Jordan===
Following the party&#x27;s establishment in Syria, Ba&#x27;athist ideas spread throughout the Arab world. In Jordan Ba&#x27;athist thought first spread to the East Bank in the late-1940s, most notably at universities. While the Regional Branch was not formed until 1951, several meetings took place at the universities where students and professors alike would discuss the Ba&#x27;athist thought. Despite the ideology being very popular, it took time before the actual Regional Branch was established. A group of teachers established the Regional Branch in the city by Al-Karak. At the very beginning, the clinic owned by Abd al-Rahman Shuqyar was used as the branch&#x27;s meeting place. Bahjat Abu Gharbiyah became the Regional Branch&#x27;s first member in the West Bank, and was thus resigned the responsibility of building the party&#x27;s organization in the area the branch secretary in the West Bank, and was thus responsible in that area. In the West Bank, the branch was most active in the cities of Jerusalem and Ramallah.

The 1st Regional Congress was held in 1951 in the home of Abdullah Rimawi. The congress mapped out the &quot;future course of the party&quot;. The next year, the 2nd Regional Congress was held, this time in Abdallah Na&#x27;was&#x27; home. It elected a Regional Command and appointed Rimawi as the branch&#x27;s Regional Secretary. Shugyar, Gharbiyah and Na&#x27;was agreed to serve in the Regional Branch&#x27;s Central Committee. Rimawi and Na&#x27;was, his deputy, would prove effective leaders. Shortly after the 2nd Regional Congress, the branch launched a successful recruitment campaign in Jordanian and Palestinian neighbourhoods and cities. On 28 August 1956 the branch was legalized by a High Court.

Both Rimawi and Na&#x27;was were elected to Parliament in the 1950 and 1951 elections as independents (the branch was not a legal party at the time). In the 1951 election, the branch managed to elect three members to parliament. Rimawi was able to retain his seat in parliament until the 1956 election. None of these elections can be considered democratic. Shuqyar, during the 1951 elections, was imprisoned by the authorities because his views were deemed to radical. Less than a month before the election day, the British Embassy in Amman had estimated that Shuqyar would gain an easy victory. However, because of the undemocratic nature of the election, Shuqyar was not elected. As voting patterns would prove, voters who voted for Ba&#x27;athist candidates lived in Irbid and Amman on the East Bank, and Jerusalem and Nablus on the West Bank.

Shuqyar during a government-imposed exile to Southern Jordan, used his spare time reading Marxist and Leninist literature. While he never became a communist, Shuqyar began to support communist concepts. On his return from exile he tried to persuade the Regional Branch to join in an electoral front with the Jordanian Communist Party. However, the Regional Branch leaders Rimawi, Na&#x27;was, Gharbiyah and Munif al-Razzaz opposed such an idea, and because of it, Shuqyar left the Ba&#x27;ath Party.

Rimawi and Na&#x27;was were elected to the National Command at the 2nd National Congress (held in 1952). At the 6th and 7th National Congress, the Regional Branch elected Razzaz to the National Command.

===Lebanon===
The Lebanese Regional Branch was formed in 1949–1950. During the existence of the UAR, the Regional Branch was split into two factions, those supporting Nasser and those opposing him. However, in April 1960, the UAR denied the Regional Branch organ &quot;As Sahafäh&quot; access into the UAR-ruled Syria.

The Regional Branch was strongest in the city of Tripoli. In the 1960 elections, Abd al-Majid al-Rafei was just a few votes short of being elected to parliament. However, a persistent problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the Regional Branch by the Lebanese Communist Party. In Tripoli the Communists supported the candidacy of Rashid Karami, to ensure themselves of a Regional Branch victory. On 17 July 1961 a group of rival Ba&#x27;athists led by Rimawi opened fire on several of the Regional Branch&#x27;s members.

During the UAR years, the same factional lines that developed in the Syrian Regional Branch came to the Lebanese Regional Branch. At the 4th National Congress (held in Lebanon), which was mainly attended by delegates representing Lebanon, several resolutions with a pronounced anti-Nasser tone were approved. At the same time, criticism of Aflaq and Bitar was severe, both their leadership records and their ideology were criticized. A resolution was approved, which stated that the party leaders (Aflaq and al-Bitar among others) had too hastily entered into a union with Egypt, had wrongly dissolved the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958, and had given pan-Arabism primacy when socialism was more important. The resolution also affirmed the need to use a more Marxist lens rather than a Ba&#x27;athist one to analyze the current situation, and the need for the party to strengthen their positions among the workers, peasants, artisans, and shopkeepers. Because of the position of the Lebanese Regional Branch, Aflaq at the 5th National Congress invited enough Iraqi Regional Branch delegates to neutralize the Lebanese delegates. However, at the same time, the Lebanese Regional Branch opposed Hawrani and his faction. At the 6th National Congress, the Lebanese Regional Branch elected Jubrän Majdalani and Khalid al-Ali to the National Command.

At the 7th National Congress, the National Command in collaboration with the Military Committee removed leftists, such as those found in the Lebanese Regional Branch, from leadership positions, and expelled them from the party in the most severe cases. The Lebanese Regional Branch managed to elect three members to the National Command at the 7th National Congress; Majdalani, al-Ali and Abd al-Majid Rafi.

===Libya===
The Regional Branch was founded in the 1950s by Amr Taher Deghayes. Ba&#x27;athism was a major political force in Libya following the establishment of the United Arab Republic. Many intellectuals were attracted to Ba&#x27;athist ideology during the later years of the Kingdom of Libya. However, with help from Nasserist propaganda, several Ba&#x27;athists changed affiliation and became Nasserists instead. The growth of these pan-Arab ideologies concerned the government, which led to the incarceration of several Nasserist and Ba&#x27;athist military officers in the early sixties. The Ba&#x27;athist were accused of working to overthrow &quot;the political, economic and social system&quot; of the Kingdom; the sentences ranged from everything to eight months to two years. By 1964, the Libyan Regional Branch had only managed to establish one-level below the Regional Command, the branch-level. Syrian specialist John Devlin estimated that the Libyan Regional Branch had been 50 and 150 members in 1964.

===Syria===

Syrian politics took a dramatic turn in 1954 when the military government of Adib Shishakli was overthrown and the democratic system restored. The Ba&#x27;ath, now a large and popular organisation, won 15 out of 142 parliamentary seats in the Syrian election that year, becoming the second-largest party in parliament. Aside from the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), the Ba&#x27;ath Party was the only party able to organise mass protests among workers. The party was supported by the intelligentsia due to their pro-Egyptian and anti-imperialist stance along with their advocation of social reform.

The Ba&#x27;ath faced considerable competition from ideological competitors, notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which supported the establishment of a Greater Syria. The Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s main adversary was the SCP, whose support for class struggle and internationalism was anathema to the Ba&#x27;ath. In addition to parliamentary-level competition, all these parties (as well as Islamists) competed in street-level activity and sought to recruit support among the military.

By the end of 1957, the SCP was able to weaken the Ba&#x27;ath Party to such an extent that the Ba&#x27;ath Party drafted a bill in December that called for a union with Egypt, a move that proved to be very popular. The Ba&#x27;ath leadership dissolved the party in 1958, gambling that the illegalisation of certain parties would hurt the SCP more than it would the Ba&#x27;ath.

A military coup in Damascus in 1961 brought the UAR to an end. Sixteen prominent politicians signed a statement supporting the coup, among them al-Hawrani and Salah al-Din al-Bitar (who later retracted his signature). Following the UAR&#x27;s dissolution, the Ba&#x27;ath Party was reestablished at the 1962 congress. The Military Committee did not show itself to the civilian wing of the party at this congress. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through Muhammad Umran, made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d&#x27;état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy.

Following the success of the Ramadan Revolution, led by the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against Nazim al-Kudsi&#x27;s presidency. The 8 March Revolution proved successful, and a Ba&#x27;athist government in Syria was established. The plotters first order was to establish the National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba&#x27;athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.

While the Ba&#x27;ath Party had attained power, there was significant infighting. The Military Committee, which was itself a tiny minority of the already small Ba&#x27;ath Party membership, ruled by force. The Ba&#x27;ath Party lacked a popular base, as it had only 2,500 members by mid-1963. Even if membership expanded, the authoritarian rule it had introduced would only increase.

The civilian wing was plagued by infighting between the radical socialist and moderate faction, while the military stood more unified. Whatever the case, the Syrian Regional Command slowly amassed its powers by weakening the National Command. This all came to a head in the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état.

The party officially indefinitely suspended all activities in Syria on 11 December 2024, following the Fall of the Assad regime.

===Others===
Following the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s founding, regional branches were established in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman . Not long after it established branches in North Yemen and South Yemen. In Tunisia, a Regional Branch was established in the 1950s, but was forced underground for much of its existence. The Saudi Regional Branches elected Ali Ghannäm to represent them at the 7th National Command. While its currently unknown which side the Saudi Ba&#x27;ath took after the 1966 split, it published a newspaper, &quot;Sawt al-Tal&#x27;iyya&quot;, from 1973 to 1980. It was an ardent critic of the Saudi royal family and American imperialism. The majority of its members were Shia Muslims. In late 1963, Ba&#x27;ath cells were being established in Sudan, and there were even rumours that a Ba&#x27;ath cell had been established in Egypt. A regional Ba&#x27;ath Party branch was established in Algeria in 1988 after the one-party system ended.
