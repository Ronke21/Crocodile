<doc id="169674" wikidata="Q5405491" url="?curid=169674" title="Eucalypt">
<text>Eucalypt is any woody plant with capsule fruiting bodies belonging to one of seven closely related genera (of the tribe Eucalypteae) found across Australia:
&quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Corymbia&quot;, &quot;Angophora&quot;, &quot;Stockwellia&quot;, &quot;Allosyncarpia&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptopsis&quot; and &quot;Arillastrum&quot;. In Australia, they are commonly known as gum trees or stringybarks.

== Taxonomy ==
For an example of changing historical perspectives, in 1991, largely genetic evidence indicated that some prominent &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species were actually more closely related to &quot;Angophora&quot; than to other eucalypts; they were accordingly split off into the new genus &quot;Corymbia&quot;.

Although separate, all of these genera and their species are allied and it remains the standard to refer to the members of all seven genera &quot;Angophora&quot;, &quot;Corymbia&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Stockwellia&quot;, &quot;Allosyncarpia&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptopsis&quot; and &quot;Arillastrum&quot; as &quot;eucalypts&quot; or as the eucalypt group.

The extant genera &quot;Stockwellia&quot;, &quot;Allosyncarpia&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptopsis&quot; and &quot;Arillastrum&quot; comprise six known species, restricted to monsoon forests and rainforests in north-eastern Australia, the Arnhem Land plateau, New Guinea, the Moluccas and New Caledonia. These genera are recognised as having evolved from ancient lineages of the family Myrtaceae. According to genetic, fossil and morphological evidence, it is hypothesised that they evolved into separate taxa before the evolution of the more widespread and well-known genera &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Angophora&quot;, and all of their many species.

&quot;Eucalyptus deglupta&quot; has naturally spread the furthest from the Australian geographic origin of the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, being the only species known growing naturally in the nearby northern hemisphere, from New Guinea to New Britain, Sulawesi, Seram Island to Mindanao, Philippines. &quot;Eucalyptus urophylla&quot; also grows naturally as far west as the Flores and Timor islands.

== Adaptations ==
Eucalypts from fire-prone habitats are attuned to withstand fire in several ways:
* Their seeds are often held in an insulated capsule, which opens only after a bushfire. Once cooled down, the land becomes a freshly fertilised seed bed.
* Oils in the leaves tend to make the fire more severe and therefore more damaging to less attuned species, giving an evolutionary advantage to the eucalypts.
Epicormic buds under the often thick bark of the trunk and branches are ready to sprout new stems and leaves after a fire.

These advantages work well in areas affected by long dry spells.

Over 700 eucalypt species dominate landscapes all over Australia, but diversity is reduced in rainforests and arid environments.

A fungal plant pathogen (from the family Sporocadaceae), &quot;Allelochaeta brevilata&quot; is found on species of eucalypts in Australia.

<doc id="169683" wikidata="Q834162" url="?curid=169683" title="Capital of the Netherlands">
<text>In the Netherlands, the Constitution refers to Amsterdam as the capital city. However, since 1588, the States General and the Executive Branch, along with the Supreme Court and the Council of State, have been situated in The Hague as the seat of government. Since the 1983 revision of the Constitution of the Netherlands, Article 32 mentions that &quot;the King shall be sworn in and inaugurated as soon as possible in the capital city, Amsterdam&quot;. It is the only reference in the document stating that Amsterdam is the capital. In contrast, The Hague is customarily called the (&quot;residence&quot;).

Only once during its history was Amsterdam both &quot;capital&quot; and seat of government. Between 1808 and 1810, during the Kingdom of Holland, King Louis Napoleon resided in Amsterdam and declared the city capital of his kingdom and seat of government. To accommodate the king, the grand seventeenth-century Town Hall of Amsterdam, a prime example of the republican values that were prevalent for so long in the Netherlands, was converted into a Royal Palace.

In 1810, the Netherlands was annexed by the French Empire and King Louis Napoleon was replaced by a French governor, who took up residence in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. From 1810 to 1813, Amsterdam kept its position of capital city somewhat, as Emperor Napoleon declared the city to be the third city of the Empire (after Paris and Rome) and an imperial residence. In December 1813, after the fall of Napoleon and the accession of Prince William VI of Orange as Sovereign of the Netherlands, The Hague was restored as the seat of government.

==Historical background==
Although the proper legal status of Amsterdam as capital of the Netherlands is of recent date, the city has been recognized as the capital since 1814. In that year Willem Frederik, Prince of Orange and Nassau, was proclaimed Sovereign Prince of the United Netherlands and invested as such on 30 March 1814 in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. This is partly because it is a &quot;Royal City&quot;, used not only for the inauguration of kings, but also for royal weddings (note though that royal burials take place in Delft), and also because of its dominant position in Dutch history. From the end of the 16th century, the city grew rapidly to become the largest and most powerful city in the Netherlands and the main centre of trade, commerce, finance and culture. 

The origins of the split between Amsterdam as capital city and The Hague as seat of government lay in the peculiar Dutch constitutional history. From the middle-ages to the sixteenth century, The Hague had been the seat of government of the County of Holland and residence of the Counts of Holland. Amsterdam in the meantime was growing to be a more important city. After the establishment of the Republic of the United Netherlands in 1572/1581, Dordrecht briefly became the seat of government of the United Provinces, residence of the States General, the Council of State and the Prince of Orange as Prince Stadtholder. In 1588, these central governmental institutions were moved to The Hague, which, from that point onwards, kept the position of seat of government for the whole republic. Amsterdam remained loyal to the Spanish/Burgundian empire until relatively late in the Eighty Years War, which allowed the city a lot of trade opportunities, but made it unsuitable for the seat of government of the emerging &#x27;rebel&#x27; state.

Before the institution of the Batavian Republic of 1795, the Netherlands was not a unitary state, but more of a confederation in which the independent provinces and the larger cities and towns were very much politically autonomous. During the seventeenth century, the Prince Stadtholder as official of the States of Holland clashed several times with the city government of Amsterdam about policy, up to the point that the city was beleaguered by the army. Up to 1795 there remained a strong animosity between the Orange faction and the republican faction in Dutch politics. The former supported the idea of hereditary political leadership vested in the princes of Orange as Stadtholders, and had its powerbase in The Hague and the rural areas. The latter supported civic independence and found its support mainly in the cities and towns of Holland, with Amsterdam as its progenitor and most outspoken representative.

When in 1814 the new kingdom was formed, the appointment of Amsterdam, still the most prominent city in the kingdom, as capital city was also very much a conciliatory gesture of the Orange faction towards the town, and a recognition of the strong civic and republican basis of the new kingdom.

==Brussels==
Brussels was briefly the capital of the Netherlands and the low countries in the 16th and 19th centuries. Brussels was the capital of the Seventeen Provinces (1549–1581). During the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1839), there were two government centers: The Hague and Brussels. The government sat in one of these cities every other year. As a result, ministers and officials had to own or rent homes in both cities.

Brussels was successively the capital of the Duchy of Brabant, the Seventeen Provinces, the Southern Netherlands, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Belgium, the Flemish and French Community and is currently the (de facto) capital of the European Union.

<text>Solomon Airlines is the flag carrier of Solomon Islands, based in Honiara.

== History ==
Solomon Airlines was established in 1962 as a charter airline by Laurie Crowley. Crowley had a charter operation in Papua New Guinea with occasional charter flights to the Solomons using a single Piper Aztec. As no commercial aircraft were based in Solomon Islands, Crowley decided to start an airline and called it Megapode Airlines.

Papua New Guinea-based Macair purchased Megapode in 1968, and changed the airline&#x27;s name to Solomon Islands Airways, with the acronym of SOLAIR, and changed the operation from a charter airline to a regular schedule. Under Macair, SOLAIR served the island of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, with two De Havilland Doves and two Beechcraft Barons.

In 1975, Macair (including its SOLAIR subsidiary) were bought by Dennis Buchanan, owner of Talair in Papua New Guinea, and in 1976, the airline received two Beechcraft Queen Air 80 airplanes. At the time, the Solomon Islands Government bought 49 percent of the airline&#x27;s shares and with rights to purchase the remaining 51 percent by the next five years.

For the next five years, growth was slow but steady. A brand new Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner was bought, and services were established to Vanuatu.

In 1984 the Government decided to purchase all of the airline&#x27;s remaining shares, and two De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and one Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante were leased from Talair. Soon after full Government take-over, the three leased planes were returned. In 1987, the sale of the airline and its assets Pacific Car Rental (a subsidiary of Avis) and the tour company Hunts of the Pacific, were completed.

The new ownership was met with skepticism and distrust by airline workers, and many trained personnel left the company, including some on the managerial level. The government was faced with the task of rebuilding the airline, and it started doing so by investing 2 million dollars to buy two DHC-6-300 Twin Otters. Soon, a new livery was introduced, and the name was changed to &quot;Solomon Airlines&quot; officially.

A joint venture with Qantas followed, and then Solomon Airlines entered the jet age by leasing a Boeing 737 from Air Pacific. Solomon Airlines and Air Pacific soon also made a joint venture, but when Air Pacific announced in 1989 it was planning to substitute its Boeing 737 with a Boeing 767 to upgrade international services, Solomon Airlines was forced to lease one from another company, and so it decided on leasing a 737 owned by International Lease Finance Corporation. Since then, the airline has operated with leased 737s alongside its own turbo-props.

In 1999, after ethnic violence broke out in the Solomons, the United Nations imposed sanctions which severely damaged the airline&#x27;s international operations, and at one point, the airline was forced to retain only is scheduled services to Brisbane. Since the end of the conflict, the airline has reestablished its international network.

In November 2006, Solomon Airlines obtained a Boeing B737-300 aircraft including pilots and cabin crew, leased by the Spanish AirClass Airways.

For the months of January and February 2009, Solomon Airlines leased a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 seating 40, from Vincent Aviation of Wellington, New Zealand while one of its Twin Otter aircraft was undergoing heavy maintenance at Honiara.

In August 2009, Solomon Airlines obtained an Airbus A320-200 aircraft including pilots, leased by Strategic Airlines. When the lease with Strategic Airlines expired Solomon Airlines acquired an Airbus A320-211 and obtained its own Air Operators Certificate.

On 7 June 2016 Solomon Airlines suspended all operations, including international and domestic flights and ground operations, stranding passengers at Honiara. The airline&#x27;s CEO, Ron Sum Sum, said that the grounding was caused by the government&#x27;s failure to pay millions of dollars in arrears. The airline resumed operations two days later.

On 12 May 2023, CEO Gus Kraus confirmed that the airline was looking to acquire a second A320-200 to expand services and cater to an expected increase in demand from the 2023 Pacific Games to be held in Honiara later in the year.

On 22 May 2024, Solomon Airlines began launching weekly direct flights between Auckland, New Zealand and Port Villa, Vanuatu to fill the gap caused by the bankruptcy of Vanuatuan national carrier, Air Vanuatu. New Zealand has several Vanuatuan RSE (Recognised Seasonal Employer) workers who were stranded because of Air Vanuatu&#x27;s liquidation.

==Destinations==
Solomon Airlines currently operates regular return services from Honiara to Brisbane-Australia, Nadi-Fiji (own aircraft &amp; codeshare), Port Vila, Vanuatu (own aircraft &amp; codeshare), Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (codeshare only), and Tarawa, Kiribati.

Solomon Airlines also operates an extensive domestic network around Solomon Islands.

=== Current destinations ===
== Livery ==
The airline&#x27;s original livery consisted of an overall white fuselage, with a cheatline extending up onto the vertical fin in colours mirroring those of the national flag. The vertical fin was mainly royal blue, with five white stars prominently displayed. The single word &quot;Solomons&quot; was carried above the window line forward, along with the national flag.

With the acquisition of the Airbus A320 in 2011 a decision was made to &quot;refresh&quot; the livery. The new livery consists of an all-white fuselage with the single word &quot;Solomons&quot; carried above the forward windows and &quot;Spirit of Solomons&quot; in grey below the forward window line. The tail and winglets have a stylised version of the national flag. The underside of the fuselage has a large white flysolomons.com on a blue background.

<doc id="169693" wikidata="Q16251727" url="?curid=169693" title="Eugenics Board of North Carolina">
<text>The Eugenics Board of North Carolina (EBNC) was a State Board of the U.S. state of North Carolina formed in July 1933 by the North Carolina State Legislature by the passage of House Bill 1013, entitled &quot;An Act to Amend Chapter 34 of the Public Laws of 1929 of North Carolina Relating to the Sterilization of Persons Mentally Defective&quot;. This Bill formally repealed a 1929 law, which had been ruled as unconstitutional by the North Carolina Supreme Court earlier in the year.

Over time, the Board shifted their focus to include sterilizations. Their original purpose was to oversee the practice of sterilization as it pertained to inmates or patients of public-funded institutions that were judged to be &#x27;mentally defective or feeble-minded&#x27; by authorities. The majority of these sterilizations were coerced. Academic sources have observed that this was not only an ableist and classist project but also a racist one, as Black people were disproportionately targeted. Of the 7,686 people who were sterilized in North Carolina after 1933, 5,000 were Black. American Civil Liberties Union attorney Brenda Feign Fasteau said of the situation, &quot;As far as I can determine, the statistics reveal that since 1964, approximately 65 percent of the women sterilized in North Carolina were Black and approximately 35 percent were White.&quot;

In contrast to other eugenics programs across the United States, the North Carolina Board enabled county departments of public welfare to petition for the sterilization of their clients. The Board remained in operation until 1977. During its existence thousands of individuals were sterilized. In 1977 the N.C. General Assembly repealed the laws authorizing its existence, though it would not be until 2003 that the involuntary sterilization laws that underpinned the Board&#x27;s operations were repealed.

Today the Board&#x27;s work is repudiated by people across the political, scientific and private spectrum. In 2013, North Carolina passed legislation to compensate those sterilized under the Board&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Structure==

The board was made up of five members:

* The Commissioner of Public Welfare of North Carolina.
* The Secretary of the State Board of Health of North Carolina.
* The Chief Medical Officer of &quot;An institute for the feebleminded or insane&quot; of the State of North Carolina not located in Raleigh.
* The Chief Medical Officer of the State Hospital at Raleigh.
* The Attorney General of the State of North Carolina.

==History of the Board==

===1919===

The State of North Carolina first enacted sterilization legislation in 1919. The 1919 law was the first foray for North Carolina into eugenics; this law, entitled &quot;An Act to Benefit the Moral, Mental, or Physical Conditions of Inmates of Penal and Charitable Institutions&quot; was quite brief, encompassing only four sections. Provision was made for creation of a Board of Consultation, made up of a member of the medical staff of any of the penal or charitable State institutions, and a representative of the State Board of Health, to oversee sterilization that was to be undertaken when &quot;in the judgement of the board hereby created, said operation would be for the improvement of the mental, moral or physical conditions of any inmate of any of the said institutions&quot;. The Board of Consultation would have reported to both the Governor and the Secretary of the State Board of Health. No sterilizations were performed under the provisions of this law, though its structure was to guide following legislation.

===1929===

In 1929, two years after the landmark US Supreme Court ruling of &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; in which sterilization was ruled permissible under the U.S. Constitution, North Carolina passed an updated law that formally laid down rules for the sterilization of citizens. This law, entitled &quot;An Act to Provide For the Sterilization of the Mentally Defective and Feeble-Minded Inmates of Charitable and Penal Institutions of the State of North Carolina&quot;, was similar to the law which preceded it, although this new Act contained several new provisions.

In contrast to the 1919 law, which had mandated sterilization for the &quot;improvement of the mental, moral or physical condition of any inmate&quot;, the new law added a new and far-reaching condition: &quot;Or for the public good.&quot; This condition, expanding beyond the individual to greater considerations of society, would be built on in the ensuing years.

The 1929 law also expanded the review process to four reviewers, namely: The Commissioner of Charities and Public Welfare of North Carolina, The Secretary of the State Board of Health of North Carolina, and the Chief Medical Officers of any two institutions for the &quot;feeble-minded or insane&quot; for the State of North Carolina.

Lastly, the new law also explicitly stated that sterilization, where performed under the Act&#x27;s guidelines, would be lawful and that any persons who requested, authorized or directed proceedings would not be held criminally or civilly liable for actions taken. Under the 1929 law, 49 recorded cases took place in which sterilization was performed.

===1933–1971===

In 1933, the North Carolina State Supreme Court heard &quot;Brewer v. Valk&quot;, an appeal from Forsyth County Superior Court, in which the Supreme Court upheld that the 1929 law violated both the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s 14th Amendment and Article 1, Section 17 of the 1868 North Carolina State Constitution. The Supreme Court noted that property rights required due process, specifically a mechanism by which notice of action could be given, and hearing rights established so that somebody subject to the sterilization law had the opportunity to appeal their case. Under both the U.S. Constitution and the N.C. State Constitution in place at the time, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1929 law was unconstitutional as no such provisions existed in the law as written.

The North Carolina General Assembly went on in the wake of &quot;Brewer v. Valk&quot; to enact House Bill 1013, removing the constitutional objections to the law, thereby forming the Eugenics Board and creating the framework which would remain in force for over thirty years. The Board was granted authority over all sterilization proceedings undertaken in the State, which had previously been devolved to various governing bodies or heads of penal and charitable institutions supported in whole or in part by the State.

A study from Gregory N. Price, William Darity Jr., and Rhonda V. Sharpe argues that from 1958 to 1968, sterilization in North Carolina was specifically targeted towards Black Americans, with the intended effect of racial eugenics. Sharpe, of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Science, Equity, and Race, argues that this is an example of the need to disaggregate data that might otherwise overlook the experiences of Black women.

===1971–1977===

In the 1970s the Eugenics Board was moved around from department to department, as sterilization operations declined in the state. In 1971, an act of the legislature transferred the EBNC to the then newly created Department of Human Resources (DHR), and the secretary of that department was given managerial and executive authority over the board.

Under a 1973 law, the Eugenics Board was transformed into the Eugenics Commission. Members of the commission were appointed by the governor, and included the director of the Division of Social and Rehabilitative Services of the DHR, the director of Health Services, the chief medical officer of a state institution for the feeble-minded or insane, the chief medical officer of the DHR in the area of mental health services, and the state attorney general.

In 1974 the legislature transferred to the judicial system the responsibility for any proceedings.

1976 brought a new challenge to the law with the case of In re Sterilization of Joseph Lee Moore in which an appeal was heard by the North Carolina Supreme Court. The petitioner&#x27;s case was that the court had not appointed counsel at State expense to advise him of his rights prior to sterilization being performed. While the court noted that there was discretion within the law to approve a fee for the service of an expert, it was not constitutionally required. The court went on to declare that the involuntary sterilization of citizens for the public good was a legitimate use of the police power of the state, further noting that &quot;The people of North Carolina have a right to prevent the procreation of children who will become a burden on the state.&quot; The ruling upholding the constitutionality was notable in both its relatively late date (many other States had ceased performing sterilization operations shortly after WWII) and its language justifying state intervention on the grounds of children being a potential burden to the public.

The Eugenics Commission was formally abolished by the legislature in 1977.

===2000-present===

In 2003, the N.C. General Assembly formally repealed the last involuntary sterilization law, replacing it with one that authorizes sterilization of individuals unable to give informed consent only in the case of medical necessity. The law explicitly ruled out sterilizations &quot;solely for the purpose of sterilization or for hygiene or convenience.&quot;

==Justification of Eugenics Policy==

===Legal===

At the time of the Board&#x27;s formation there was a body of thought that viewed the practice of eugenics as both necessary for the public good and for the private citizen. Following &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, the Supreme Court was often cited both domestically and internationally as a foundation for eugenics policies.

In &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote, in support of eugenics policy, that

Despite the Supreme Court rulings in support of eugenics as constitutionally permitted, even as late as 1950 some physicians in North Carolina were still concerned about the legality of sterilization. Efforts were made to reassure the medical community that the laws were both constitutionally sound and specifically exempting physicians from liability.

===Public good===

Framing eugenics as supporting the public good was fundamental to how the law was written. It was argued that both for the benefit of the private citizen, and for the costs to society of future possible childbirths, eugenics were a sound and moral way to proceed. This was stated in the Board&#x27;s manual of policies and procedures, in which the practice was justified:
* Sterilization has one effect only—it prevents parenthood.
* It is not a punishment; it is a protection; and therefore carries no stigma or humiliation.
* It in no way unsexes the party sterilized.
* Sterilization is approved by the families and friends of the sterilized.
* It is approved by medical staffs, probation officers, and social workers generally wherever they have come in contact with patients who have been sterilized.
* It permits patients, who would otherwise be confined to institutions during the fertile period of life, to return to their homes and friends.
* The records show that many moron girls paroled from institutions after sterilization have married and are happy and succeeding fairly well. They could never have managed and cared for children, to say nothing of the possible inheritance and fate of such children.
* Homes are kept together by sterilization of husband or wife in many mild cases of mental disease, thus removing the dread by the normal spouse of the procreation of a defective child and permitting normal marital companionship.
* There is no discovery Vitally affecting the life, happiness and well-being of the human race in the last quarter of a century about which intelligent people know less than they know about modern sterilization. The operation is simple; it removes no organ or tissue of the body. It has no effect on the patient except to prevent parenthood. Under conservative laws, sanely and equitably administered, these discoveries developed by the medical profession now offer to the mentally ill, feeble-minded, and epileptic the protection of sterilization.

In the press, opinion articles were published arguing for a greater use of eugenics, in which many of the reasons above were cited as justification. Even the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;, which would be a significant force in illuminating North Carolina&#x27;s past eugenics abuses in the modern era, was not immune. In 1948 the newspaper published an editorial entitled &quot;The Case for Sterilization - Quantity vs. Quality&quot; that went into great detail extolling the virtues of &#x27;breeding&#x27; for the general public good.

Proponents of eugenics did not restrict its use to the &#x27;feeble-minded&#x27;. In many cases, more ardent authors included the blind, deaf-mutes, and people with diseases like heart disease or cancer in the general category of those who should be sterilized. The argument was twofold; that parents likely to give birth to &#x27;defective&#x27; children should not allow it, and that healthy children borne to &#x27;defective&#x27; parents would be doomed to an &#x27;undesirable environment&#x27;.

Wallace Kuralt, Mecklenburg County&#x27;s welfare director from 1945 to 1972, was a leader in transitioning the work of state eugenics from looking only at medical conditions to considering poverty as a justification for state sterilization. Under Kuralt&#x27;s tenure, Mecklenburg county became far and away the largest source of sterilizations in the state. He supported this throughout his life in his writings and interviews, where he made plain his conviction that sterilization was a force for good in fighting poverty. In a 1964 interview with the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot;, Kuralt said:

Among public and private groups that published articles advocating for eugenics, the Human Betterment League was a significant advocate for the procedure within North Carolina. This organization, founded by Procter &amp; Gamble heir Clarence Gamble, provided experts, written material and monetary support to the eugenics movement. Many pamphlets and publications were created by the league advocating the group&#x27;s position which were then distributed throughout the state. One pamphlet entitled &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Expect ...&quot; laid out a series of rhetorical questions to argue the point that those considered &#x27;defective&#x27; were unable to be good parents.

==Legacy==

===Number of operations===
While it is not known exactly how many people were sterilized during the lifetime of the law, the Task Force established by Governor Beverly Perdue estimated the total at around 7,500. They provided a summary of the estimated number of operations broken down by time period. This does not include sterilizations that may have occurred at a local level by doctors and hospitals.

The report went on to provide a breakdown by county. There were no counties in North Carolina that performed no operations, though the spread was marked, going from as few as 4 in Tyrrell county, to 485 in Mecklenburg county.

Some research into the historical data in North Carolina has drawn links between race and sterilization rates. One study performed in 2010 by Gregory Price and William Darity Jr described the practice as &quot;racially biased and genocidal&quot;. In the study, the researchers showed that as the black population of a county increased, the number of sterilizations increased disproportionately; that black citizens were more likely, all things being equal, to being recommended for sterilization than whites.

Poverty and sterilization were also closely bound. Since social workers concerned themselves with those accepting welfare and other public assistance, there was a strong impetus to recommending sterilization to families as a means of controlling their economic situation. This was sometimes done under duress, when benefits were threatened as a condition of undergoing the surgery.

What made the picture more complicated was the fact that in some cases, individuals sought out sterilization. Since those in poverty had fewer choices for birth control, having a state-funded procedure to guarantee no further children was attractive to some mothers. Given the structure of the process however, women found themselves needing to be described as unfit mothers or welfare burdens in order to qualify for the program, rather than simply asserting reproductive control.

===Personal stories===

Many stories from those directly affected by the Board&#x27;s work have come to light over the past several years. During the hearings from the NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation many family members and individuals personally testified to the impact that the procedures had had on them.

====Elaine Riddick Jessie====
Elaine Riddick was born in Perquimans County, North Carolina. Born into a poor family, one of seven children, the family was split up by the County Welfare department after her parents were deemed to be unfit. Elaine and one sister were sent to live with her grandmother, while the remaining five were sent to an orphanage. It was shortly after this family upheaval, when Elaine was 13, that she was raped by a 20-year-old man with a history of assault and incarceration. Elaine subsequently became pregnant.

When the social worker, Marion Payne, assigned to the Riddick family found out that Elaine was pregnant, she pressured Elaine&#x27;s grandmother into signing a consent form for sterilization (Riddick&#x27;s grandmother, being illiterate, signed the form with a simple &#x27;X&#x27; symbol). On March 5, 1968, when Elaine was 14 years old, she was sterilized by Dr. William Wylie Bindeman Jr, under the authority of the board. The procedure took place hours after Elaine had given birth to a son. Riddick learned only years later the extent of the procedure, testifying to its effect over her life in a lawsuit brought against the state of North Carolina with the assistance of the ACLU in 1974. She cited failed relationships, physical pain and suffering, and psychological trauma. Riddick&#x27;s lawsuit did not end in success; a jury found against her, and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear her case. It would not be until the hearings of the NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation that her story was to be widely heard once more.

====Junius Wilson====

Junius Wilson was born in 1908 in North Carolina and grew up near Wilmington. In 1916 he was sent to the North Carolina School for the Colored Deaf and the Blind, a segregated state school in Raleigh that was the first southern school for black deaf children. Since this was a segregated school, students there were not given the resources of other schools. They were not taught American Sign Language and developed their own system of communication. This worked within the institution, but because it was their own, it did not travel, and so students and deaf from other schools were unable to understand them.

Wilson stayed there for six years, learning rudimentary sign language, until a minor infraction lead to his expulsion. While at home in Castle Hayne, Wilson came to the attention of the legal system when he was accused of the attempted rape of a relative. It is unclear whether the charge had merit—biographers speculated that his misunderstood behavior stemming from communication difficulties may have led to the situation—but what is not in doubt is that in 1925 Wilson was declared legally insane by a court and committed to the state Hospital for the Colored Insane in Goldsboro, North Carolina, which became Cherry Hospital in 1959. In 1932 he was surgically castrated under the provisions of the eugenics laws in place.

Wilson would remain committed to the state facility for decades. In 1990, he was given a new social worker, John Wasson. Wasson came to find out that not only was Wilson not mentally disabled, but that the hospital staff had known for years that he was not. To compound the situation, the legal charges against Wilson dating back to 1925 had been dismissed in 1970; for twenty years he had been committed to the hospital without legal justification. In interviews with hospital staff, Wasson found that it had been considered the most &#x27;benevolent&#x27; course of action, since Wilson was thoroughly institutionalized at that point, with many of the same difficulties in learning and communication that had been his burden since birth.

Wasson instigated the legal challenge to Wilson&#x27;s incarceration. In 1992 Wilson was formally declared a free man. Since he had no close relatives or family members able to care for him in his advanced age, a cottage was found for him on the grounds of Cherry Hospital. Wilson would live there until his death in 2001.

====Mary English====

Not all who testified before the committee were sterilized by the Eugenics Board directly. In many cases people who were sterilized were operated on by local clinics and doctors. It was argued that in many of these cases patients were not fully educated as to the nature of the procedure and were urged into it by doctors or social workers who were making judgements based upon their patients&#x27; economic situation. Young women of limited means who had multiple children were specifically targeted for sterilization by many case workers.

Mary English was one such case. In her personal testimony she explained that in 1972, she had been newly divorced with three children. She went to see a doctor at a Fayetteville OB/GYN clinic for some medical complaints. The doctor offered her entry into a program that would negate any need for future birth control. English signed the required paperwork, and was sterilized after the birth of her third child. It was years later, when she went back to the doctor to have the procedure reversed, that she found out it was permanent.

English went on to detail her struggles with depression and retold experiences of friends and neighbors who had gone through similar situations at the hands of their own doctors. As for the clinic at which English was sterilized, she claimed that it was still operating, though declined to name it, or the doctor responsible for her sterilization.

==Restitution==

The &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Against Their Will&quot; documentary, released in 2002, based in part on Joanna Schoen&#x27;s research of the North Carolina Eugenics program, is credited with spurring public interest and demands for action to repeal laws and explore the possibility of compensation for affected people. This five-part series gave extensive background to the work of the Eugenics Board, with detailed statistics, victim&#x27;s stories, and historical information on the broader Eugenics movement in the United States in the Post-WWII era.

Then-Governor Mike Easley offered an apology to victims of the policy in 2002. At the time, North Carolina was the third State in the nation to officially apologize for eugenics practices, following behind Virginia and Oregon though North Carolina was the first State to go beyond a formal apology to actively considering compensation in some form. Easley set up a committee to study the history of the Eugenics Board with instructions to provide recommendations on how to handle what it termed &#x27;program survivors&#x27;. The committee recommended five specific steps:

*Establishment of a Nonprofit foundation to help find and support survivors
*Institute an outreach program from state Department of Health and Human Services to assist in encouraging
*Create a panel to adjudicate any claims to ensure that applicants were indeed affected by the program
*Create a fund to provide healthcare for certified survivors
*Provide educational benefits through the North Carolina University and Community College system to survivors and survivors&#x27; caretakers

The recommendations lay dormant in the North Carolina Legislature until 2008, when a study committee was appointed. The House Committee gave its own recommendations which in large part mirrored Easley&#x27;s committee&#x27;s findings though it went further, in establishing a suggested dollar figure of $20,000 compensation per surviving victim. The House committee also recommended training, the creation of memorials, and documenting survivor experiences, and the creation of a database to store sterilization records for future research. While the House committee recommended setting funds aside for these purposes, the Legislature did not grant funding in 2008. The house committee was co-chaired by State Representative Larry Womble, who has been a public advocate in the state house for victim&#x27;s compensation. Womble announced he would be stepping down and not seek re-election after a serious car crash in late 2011.

In 2008, Beverley Perdue was elected Governor of North Carolina. As part of her platform she pledged to take up the sterilization situation. In 2010 Perdue issued an executive order that formed the North Carolina Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation (NCJSVF).

The Task Force was made up of the following:
*Dr. Laura Gerald MD MPH (Chair)
*Fetzer &#x27;Frank&#x27; Mills JD, retired Superior Court judge
*Phoebe Zerwick MS, lecturer at Wake Forest University
*Lenwood G. Davis PHD, Professor of History at Winston-Salem State University
*Demetrius Worley Berry JD, Attorney, Brotherton Ford Yeoman Berry &amp; Weaver, PLLC

The Foundation recommended that compensation be raised to $50,000 per victim, in a 3–2 vote. They also voted for funds for mental health services and historical displays and exhibits documenting the history of sterilization in the state. It is not yet clear how many victims will be satisfied by the amount; many have granted detailed interviews that documented their severe emotional trauma in the wake of the procedures, and have been outspoken in demanding higher sums.

On April 25, 2012, North Carolina&#x27;s Gov. Perdue announced that she will put $10.3 million in her budget proposal to allocate towards issues surrounding eugenics. The funds are intended to aid with $50,000 payments to verified North Carolina eugenics victims. The remainder of the monies will be used to support the continued efforts of the NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation as they provide outreach and clearinghouse services to help Eugenics victims. Governor Perdue stated,

Perdue&#x27;s budget proposal is in accordance with the recommendations of the January 2012 final report issued from the Eugenics Compensation Task Force. The board suggested that living victims and those who were not deceased when verified by the foundation receive a tax-free, lump sum payment of $50,000. The N.C. Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation reports that there is still an increase in the number of confirmed/verified eugenics victims. , 132 people in 51 counties had been matched to the North Carolina&#x27;s Eugenics program records.

In 2013, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed an appropriations bill to give compensation, up to $50,000 per person, to individuals sterilized under the authority of the Eugenics Board of North Carolina.

<doc id="169696" wikidata="Q211011" url="?curid=169696" title="Falconry">
<text>Falconry is the hunting of wild animals in their natural state and habitat by means of a trained bird of prey. Small animals are hunted; squirrels and rabbits often fall prey to these birds. Two traditional terms are used to describe a person involved in falconry: a &quot;falconer&quot; flies a falcon; an &quot;austringer&quot; (Old French origin) keeps Goshawks and uses accipiters for hunting. In modern falconry, the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;), and the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco perigrinus&quot;) are some of the more commonly used birds of prey. The practice of hunting with a conditioned falconry bird is also called &quot;hawking&quot; or &quot;gamehawking&quot;, although the words and hawker have become used so much to refer to petty traveling traders, that the terms &quot;falconer&quot; and &quot;falconry&quot; now apply to most use of trained birds of prey to catch game. However, many contemporary practitioners still use these words in their original meaning.

In early English falconry literature, the word &quot;falcon&quot; referred to a female peregrine falcon only, while the word &quot;hawk&quot; or &quot;hawke&quot; referred to a female hawk. A male hawk or falcon was referred to as a &quot;tiercel&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;tercel&quot;), as it was roughly one-third less than the female in size. This traditional Arabian sport grew throughout Europe. Falconry is also an icon of Arabian culture. The saker falcon used by Arabs for falconry is called by Arabs &quot;Hur&quot; i.e. Free-bird, and it has been used in falconry in the Arabian Peninsula since ancient times. Saker falcons are the national bird of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Yemen and have been integral to Arab heritage and culture for over 9,000 years. They are the national emblem of many Arab countries.

==Birds used in contemporary falconry==
Several raptors are used in falconry. They are typically classed as:
* &quot;Broadwings&quot;: &quot;Buteo and Parabuteo&quot; spp., and eagles (red-tailed hawks, Harris hawks, golden eagles)
* &quot;Shortwings&quot;: &quot;Accipiter&quot; (Cooper&#x27;s hawk, goshawks, sparrow hawks)
* &quot;Longwings&quot;: Falcons (peregrine falcons, kestrels, gyrfalcons, saker falcons)
Owls are also used, although they are far less common.

In determining whether a species can or should be used for falconry, the species&#x27; behavior in a captive environment, its responsiveness to training, and its typical prey and hunting habits are considered. To some degree, a species&#x27; reputation will determine whether it is used, although this factor is somewhat harder to objectively gauge.

===Species for beginners===
In North America, the capable red-tailed hawk is commonly flown by beginner falconers during their apprenticeship. Opinions differ on the usefulness of the kestrel for beginners due to its inherent fragility. In the UK, beginner falconers are often permitted to acquire a larger variety of birds, but Harris&#x27;s hawk and the red-tailed hawk remain the most commonly used for beginners and experienced falconers alike. Red-tailed hawks are held in high regard in the UK due to the ease of breeding them in captivity, their inherent hardiness, and their capability hunting the rabbits and hares commonly found throughout the countryside in the UK. Many falconers in the UK and North America switch to accipiters or large falcons following their introduction with easier birds. In the US, accipiters, several types of buteos, and large falcons are only allowed to be owned by falconers who hold a general license. The three kinds of falconry licenses in the United States, typically, are the apprentice class, general class, and master class.

===Soaring hawks and the common buzzard (&quot;Buteo&quot;)===
The genus &quot;Buteo&quot;, known as &quot;hawks&quot; in North America and not to be confused with vultures, has worldwide distribution, but is particularly well represented in North America. The red-tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, and rarely, the red-shouldered hawk are all examples of species from this genus that are used in falconry today. The red-tailed hawk is hardy and versatile, taking rabbits, hares, and squirrels; given the right conditions, it can catch the occasional duck or pheasant. The red-tailed hawk is also considered a good bird for beginners. The Eurasian or common buzzard is also used, although this species requires more perseverance if rabbits are to be hunted.

===Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;)===

&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot; is one of two representatives of the &quot;Parabuteo&quot; genus worldwide. The other is the white-rumped hawk (&quot;P. leucorrhous&quot;). Arguably the best rabbit or hare raptor available anywhere, Harris&#x27;s hawk is also adept at catching birds. Often captive-bred, Harris&#x27;s hawk is remarkably popular because of its temperament and ability. It is found in the wild living in groups or packs, and hunts cooperatively, with a social hierarchy similar to wolves. This highly social behavior is not observed in any other bird-of-prey species, and is very adaptable to falconry. This genus is native to the Americas from southern Texas and Arizona to South America. Harris&#x27;s hawk is often used in the modern technique of car hawking (or drive-by falconry), where the raptor is launched from the window of a moving car at suitable prey.

===True hawks (&quot;Accipiter&quot;)===
The genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; is also found worldwide. Hawk expert Mike McDermott once said, &quot;The attack of the accipiters is extremely swift, rapid, and violent in every way.&quot; They are well known in falconry use both in Europe and North America. The northern goshawk has been trained for falconry for hundreds of years, taking a variety of birds and mammals. Other popular &quot;Accipiter&quot; species used in falconry include Cooper&#x27;s hawk and the sharp-shinned hawk in North America and the European sparrowhawk in Europe and Eurasia.

===Harriers (&quot;Circus&quot;)===
New Zealand is likely to be one of the few countries to use a harrier species for falconry; there, falconers successfully hunt with the Australasian harrier (&quot;Circus approximans&quot;).

===Falcons (&quot;Falco&quot;)===
The genus &quot;Falco&quot; is found worldwide and has occupied a central niche in ancient and modern falconry. Most falcon species used in falconry are specialized predators, most adapted to capturing bird prey such as the peregrine falcon and merlin. A notable exception is the use of desert falcons such the saker falcon in ancient and modern falconry in Asia and Western Asia, where hares were and are commonly taken. In North America, the prairie falcon and the gyrfalcon can capture small mammal prey such as rabbits and hares (as well as the standard gamebirds and waterfowl) in falconry, but this is rarely practiced. Young falconry apprentices in the United States often begin practicing the art with American kestrels, the smallest of the falcons in North America; debate remains on this, as they are small, fragile birds, and can die easily if neglected. Small species, such as kestrels, merlins and hobbys are most often flown on small birds such as starlings or sparrows, but can also be used for recreational bug hawking – that is, hunting large flying insects such as dragonflies, grasshoppers, and moths.

===Owls (Strigidae)===

Owls (family Strigidae) are not closely related to hawks or falcons. Little is written in classic falconry that discusses the use of owls in falconry. However, at least two species have successfully been used, the Eurasian eagle-owl and the great horned owl. Successful training of owls is much different from the training of hawks and falcons, as they are hearing- rather than sight-oriented. (Owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted.) This often leads falconers to believe that they are less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises, and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as those of hawks and falcons.

===Booted eagles (&quot;Aquila&quot;)===
The &quot;Aquila&quot; (all have &quot;booted&quot; or feathered tarsi) genus has a nearly worldwide distribution. The more powerful types are used in falconry; for example golden eagles have reportedly been used to hunt wolves in Kazakhstan, and are now most widely used by the Altaic Kazakh eagle hunters in the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ölgii to hunt foxes, and other large prey, as they are in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. Most are primarily ground-oriented, but occasionally take birds. Eagles are not used as widely in falconry as other birds of prey, due to the lack of versatility in the larger species (they primarily hunt over large, open ground), the greater potential danger to other people if hunted in a widely populated area, and the difficulty of training and managing an eagle. A little over 300 active falconers are using eagles in Central Asia, with 250 in western Mongolia, 50 in Kazakhstan, and smaller numbers in Kyrgyzstan and western China.

===Sea eagles (&quot;Haliaëtus&quot;)===
Most species of genus &quot;Haliaëtus&quot; catch and eat fish, some almost exclusively, but in countries where they are not protected, some have been effectively used in hunting for ground quarry.

==Falconry around the world==
Falconry is currently practiced in many countries around the world. The falconer&#x27;s traditional choice of bird is the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon. In contemporary falconry in both North America and the UK, they remain popular, although Harris&#x27; hawks and red-tailed hawks are likely more widely used. The northern goshawk and the golden eagle are more commonly used in Eastern Europe than elsewhere. In the west Asia, the saker falcon is the most traditional species flown against the houbara bustard, sandgrouse, stone-curlew, other birds, and hares. Peregrines and other captive-bred imported falcons are also commonplace. Falconry remains an important part of the Arab heritage and culture. The UAE reportedly spends over US$27 million annually towards the protection and conservation of wild falcons, and has set up several state-of-the-art falcon hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the world. Two breeding farms are in the Emirates, as well as those in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Every year, falcon beauty contests and demonstrations take place at the ADIHEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi.


Eurasian sparrowhawks were formerly used to take a range of small birds, but have since fallen out of favor due to their fragility and the availability of various American species.

In North America and the UK, falcons usually fly only after birds. Large falcons are typically trained to fly in the &quot;waiting-on&quot; style, where the falcon climbs and circles above the falconer and/or dog and the quarry is flushed when the falcon is in the desired commanding position. Classical game hawking in the UK had a brace of peregrine falcons flown against the red grouse, or merlins in &quot;ringing&quot; flights after skylarks. Rooks and crows are classic game for the larger falcons, and the magpie, making up in cunning what it lacks in flying ability, is another common target. Short-wings can be flown in both open and wooded country against a variety of bird and small mammal prey. Most hunting with large falcons requires large, open tracts where the falcon is afforded opportunity to strike or seize its quarry before it reaches cover. Most of Europe practices similar styles of falconry, but with differing degrees of regulation.

Medieval falconers often rode horses, but this is now rare with the exception of contemporary Kazakh and Mongolian falconry. In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia, the golden eagle is traditionally flown (often from horseback), hunting game as large as foxes and wolves.

In Japan, the northern goshawk has been used for centuries. Japan continues to honor its strong historical links with falconry (&quot;takagari&quot;), while adopting some modern techniques and technologies.

In Australia, although falconry is not specifically illegal, it is illegal to keep any type of bird of prey in captivity without the appropriate permits. The only exemption is when the birds are kept for purposes of rehabilitation (for which a licence must still be held), and in such circumstances it may be possible for a competent falconer to teach a bird to hunt and kill wild quarry, as part of its regime of rehabilitation to good health and a fit state to be released into the wild.

In New Zealand, falconry was formally legalised for one species only, the swamp/Australasian harrier (&quot;Circus approximans&quot;) in 2011. This was only possible with over 25 years of effort from both Wingspan National Bird of Prey Center and the Raptor Association of New Zealand. Falconry can only be practiced by people who have been issued a falconry permit by the Department of Conservation. Tangent aspects, such as bird abatement and raptor rehabilitation, also employ falconry techniques to accomplish their goals.

===Falconry today===

Falcons can live into their midteens, with larger hawks living longer and eagles likely to see out middle-aged owners. Through the captive breeding of rescued birds, the last 30 years have had a great rebirth of the sport, with a host of innovations; falconry&#x27;s popularity, through lure flying displays at country houses and game fairs, has probably never been higher in the past 300 years. Ornithologist Tim Gallagher, editor of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology&#x27;s &quot;Living Bird&quot; magazine, documented his experiences with modern falconry in a 2008 book, &quot;Falcon Fever&quot;.

Making use of the natural relationship between raptors and their prey, falconry is now used pest birds and animals in urban areas, landfills, commercial buildings, hotels, and airports.

Falconry centres or bird-of-prey centres house these raptors. They are responsible for many aspects of bird-of-prey conservation (through keeping the birds for education and breeding). Many conduct regular flying demonstrations and educational talks, and are popular with visitors worldwide.

Such centres may also provide falconry courses, hawk walks, displays, and other experiences with these raptors.

==Clubs and organizations==

In the UK, the British Falconers&#x27; Club (BFC) is the oldest and largest of the falconry clubs. BFC was founded in 1927 by the surviving members of the Old Hawking Club, itself founded in 1864. Working closely with the Hawk Board, an advisory body representing the interests of UK bird of prey keepers, the BFC is in the forefront of raptor conservation, falconer education, and sustainable falconry. Established in 1927, the BFC now has a membership over 1,200 falconers. It began as a small and elite club, but it is now a sizeable democratic organisation that has members from all walks of life, flying hawks, falcons, and eagles at legal quarry throughout the British Isles.

The North American Falconers Association (NAFA), founded in 1961, is the premier in the US, Canada, and Mexico, and has members worldwide. NAFA is the primary club in the United States and has a membership from around the world. Most USA states have their own falconry clubs. Although these clubs are primarily social, they also serve to represent falconers within their states in regards to that state&#x27;s wildlife regulations.

The International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey, founded in 1968, currently represents 156 falconry clubs and conservation organisations from 87 countries worldwide, totalling over 75,000 members.

The Saudi Falcons Club preserves the historical heritage associated with the falconry culture, and spreads awareness and provides training to protect falcons and flourish falconry.

==Captive breeding and conservation==
The successful and now widespread captive breeding of birds of prey began as a response to dwindling wild populations due to persistent toxins such as PCBs and DDT, systematic persecution as undesirable predators, habitat loss, and the resulting limited availability of popular species for falconry, particularly the peregrine falcon. The first known raptors to breed in captivity belonged to a German falconer named Renz Waller. In 1942–43, he produced two young peregrines in Düsseldorf in Germany.
The first successful captive breeding of peregrine falcons in North America occurred in the early 1970s by the Peregrine Fund, professor and falconer Heinz Meng, and other private falconer/breeders such as David Jamieson and Les Boyd who bred the first peregrines by means of artificial insemination. In Great Britain, falconer Phillip Glasier of the Falconry Centre in Newent, Gloucestershire, was successful in obtaining young from more than 20 species of captive raptors. A cooperative effort began between various government agencies, non-government organizations, and falconers to supplement various wild raptor populations in peril. This effort was strongest in North America where significant private donations along with funding allocations through the Endangered Species Act of 1972 provided the means to continue the release of captive-bred peregrines, golden eagles, bald eagles, aplomado falcons and others. By the mid-1980s, falconers had become self-sufficient as regards sources of birds to train and fly, in addition to the immensely important conservation benefits conferred by captive breeding.

Between 1972 and 2001, nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the U.S. were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the U. S. Endangered Species Act was passed, and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons were removed from the United States&#x27; endangered species list on August 25, 1999. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2001, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.

Some controversy has existed over the origins of captive-breeding stock used by the Peregrine Fund in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies were included in the breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the extirpation of the eastern subspecies (&quot;Falco peregrinus anatum&quot;), its near extirpation in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native subspecies was justified to optimize the genetic diversity found within the species as a whole. Such strategies are common in endangered species reintroduction scenarios, where dramatic population declines result in a genetic bottleneck and the loss of genetic diversity.

Laws regulating the hunting, import and export of wild falcons vary across Asia, and effective enforcement of current national and international regulations is lacking in some regions. It is possible that the spread of captive-bred falcons in falcon markets in the Arabian Peninsula has mitigated this demand for wild falcons.

==Hybrid falcons==
The species within the genus &quot;Falco&quot; are closely related, and some pairings produce viable offspring. The heavy northern gyrfalcon and Asiatic saker are especially closely related, and whether the Altai falcon is a subspecies of the saker or descendants of naturally occurring hybrids is not known. Peregrine and prairie falcons have been observed breeding in the wild and have produced offspring. These pairings are thought to be rare, but extra-pair copulations between closely related species may occur more frequently and/or account for most natural occurring hybridization. Some male first-generation hybrids may have viable sperm, whereas very few first-generation female hybrids lay fertile eggs. Thus, naturally occurring hybridization is thought to be somewhat insignificant to gene flow in raptor species.

The first hybrid falcons produced in captivity occurred in western Ireland when veteran falconer Ronald Stevens and John Morris put a male saker and a female peregrine into the same moulting mews for the spring and early summer, and the two mated and produced offspring.

Captive-bred hybrid falcons have been available since the late 1970s, and enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in North America and the UK in the 1990s. Hybrids were initially &quot;created&quot; to combine the horizontal speed and size of the gyrfalcon with the good disposition and aerial ability of the peregrine. Hybrid falcons first gained large popularity throughout the Arabian Peninsula, feeding a demand for particularly large and aggressive female falcons capable and willing to take on the very large houbara bustard, the classic falconry quarry in the deserts of the West Asia. These falcons were also very popular with Arab falconers, as they tended to withstand a respiratory disease (aspergillosis from the mold genus &quot;Aspergillus&quot;) in stressful desert conditions better than other pure species from the Northern Hemisphere.

==Artificial selection and domestication==

Some believe that no species of raptor have been in captivity long enough to have undergone successful selective breeding for desired traits. Captive breeding of raptors over several generations tends to result, either deliberately, or inevitably as a result of captivity, in selection for certain traits, including:
* Ability to survive in captivity
* Ability to breed in captivity
* Suitability (in most cases) for interactions with humans for falconry: Birds that demonstrated an unwillingness to hunt with men were most often discarded, rather than being placed in breeding projects
* With gyrfalcons in areas away from their natural Arctic tundra habitat, better disease resistance
* With gyrfalcons, feather color

==Escaped falconry birds==

Falconers&#x27; birds are inevitably lost on occasion, though most are found again. The main reason birds can be found again is because, during free flights, birds usually wear radio transmitters or bells. The transmitters are in the middle of the tail, on the back, or attached to the bird&#x27;s legs.

Records of species becoming established in Britain after escaping or being released include:
* Escaped Harris hawks reportedly bred in the wild in Britain.
* The return of the goshawk as a breeding bird to Britain since 1945 is due in large part to falconers&#x27; escapes; the earlier British population was wiped out by gamekeepers and egg collectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* A pair of European eagle owls bred in the wild in Yorkshire for several years, feeding largely or entirely on rabbits. The pair are most likely captive escapees. If this will lead to a population becoming established is not yet known.

In 1986, a lost captive-bred female prairie falcon (which had been cross-fostered by an adult peregrine in captivity) mated with a wild male peregrine in Utah. The prairie falcon was trapped and the eggs removed, incubated, and hatched, and the hybrid offspring were given to falconers. The wild peregrine paired with another peregrine the next year.

Falconry in Hawaii is prohibited largely due to the fears of escaped non-native birds of prey becoming established on the island chain and aggravating an already rampant problem of invasive species impacts on native wildlife and plant communities.

==Regulations==

===In Great Britain===
In sharp contrast to the US, falconry in Great Britain is permitted without a special license, but a restriction exists of using only captive-bred birds. In the lengthy, record-breaking debates in Westminster during the passage of the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Bill, efforts were made by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and other lobby groups to have falconry outlawed, but these were successfully resisted. After a centuries-old but informal existence in Britain, the sport of falconry was finally given formal legal status in Great Britain by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which allowed it to continue, provided all captive raptors native to the UK were officially ringed and government-registered. DNA testing was also available to verify birds&#x27; origins. Since 1982, the British government&#x27;s licensing requirements have been overseen by the Chief Wildlife Act Inspector for Great Britain, who is assisted by a panel of unpaid assistant inspectors.

British falconers are entirely reliant upon captive-bred birds for their sport. The taking of raptors from the wild for falconry, although permitted by law under government licence, has not been allowed in recent decades.

Anyone is permitted to possess legally registered or captive-bred raptors, although falconers are anxious to point out this is not synonymous with falconry, which specifically entails the hunting of live quarry with a trained bird. A raptor kept merely as a pet or possession, although the law may allow it, is not considered to be a falconer&#x27;s bird. Birds may be used for breeding or kept after their hunting days are over, but falconers believe it is preferable that young, fit birds are flown at quarry.

===In the United States===
In the United States, falconry is legal in all states except Hawaii, and in the District of Columbia. A falconer must have a state permit to practice the sport. (Requirements for a federal permit were changed in 2008 and the program discontinued effective January 1, 2014.) Acquiring a falconry license in the United States requires an aspiring falconer to pass a written test, have equipment and facilities inspected, and serve a minimum of two years as an apprentice under a licensed falconer, during which time, the apprentice falconer may only possess one raptor. Three classes of the falconry license have a permit issued jointly by the falconer&#x27;s state of residence and the federal government. The aforementioned apprentice license matriculates to a general class license, which allows the falconer to up to three raptors at one time. (Some jurisdictions may further limit this.) After a minimum of five years at general level, falconers may apply for a master class license, which allows them to keep up to five wild raptors for falconry and an unlimited number of captive-produced raptors. (All must be used for falconry.) Certain highly experienced master falconers may also apply to possess golden eagles for falconry.

Within the United States, a state&#x27;s regulations are limited by federal law and treaties protecting raptors. Most states afford falconers an extended hunting season relative to seasons for archery and firearms, but species to be hunted, bag limits, and possession limits remain the same for both. No extended seasons for falconry exist for the hunting of migratory birds such as waterfowl and doves.

Federal regulation of falconry in North America is enforced under the statutes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), originally designed to address the rampant commercial market hunting of migratory waterfowl during the early 20th century. Birds of prey suffered extreme persecution from the early 20th century through the 1960s, where thousands of birds were shot at conspicuous migration sites, and many state wildlife agencies issued bounties for carcasses. Due to widespread persecution and further impacts to raptor populations from DDT and other toxins, the act was amended in 1972 to include birds of prey. (Eagles are also protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1959.) Under the MBTA, taking migratory birds, their eggs, feathers, or nests is illegal. Take is defined in the MBTA to &quot;include by any means or in any manner, any attempt at hunting, pursuing, wounding, killing, possessing, or transporting any migratory bird, nest, egg, or part thereof&quot;. Falconers are allowed to trap and otherwise possess certain birds of prey and their feathers with special permits issued by the Migratory Bird Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by state wildlife agencies (issuers of trapping permits).

The Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) restricts the import and export of most native birds species and are listed in the CITES Appendices I, II, and III.

The Wild Bird Conservation Act, legislation put into effect &quot;circa&quot; 1993, regulates importation of any CITES-listed birds into the United States.

Some controversy exists over the issue of falconer&#x27;s ownership of captive-bred birds of prey. Falconry permits are issued by states in a manner that entrusts falconers to &quot;take&quot; (trap) and possess permitted birds and use them only for permitted activities, but does not transfer legal ownership. No legal distinction is made between native wild-trapped vs. captive-bred birds of the same species. This legal position is designed to discourage the commercial exploitation of native wildlife.

==History==


Evidence suggests that the art of falconry may have begun in Mesopotamia, with the earliest accounts dating to around 2,000 BC. Also, some raptor representations are in the northern Altai, western Mongolia. The falcon was a of ancient Mongol tribes. Some disagreement exists about whether such early accounts document the practice of falconry (from the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and others) or are misinterpreted depictions of humans with birds of prey. During the Turkic Period of Central Asia (seventh century AD), concrete figures of falconers on horseback were described on the rocks in Kyrgyz. Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194–1250) is generally acknowledged as the most significant wellspring of traditional falconry knowledge. He is believed to have obtained firsthand knowledge of Arabic falconry during wars in the region (between June 1228 and June 1229). He obtained a copy of Moamyn&#x27;s manual on falconry and had it translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch. Frederick II himself made corrections to the translation in 1241, resulting in &quot;De Scientia Venandi per Aves&quot;. King Frederick II is most recognized for his falconry treatise, &quot;De arte venandi cum avibus&quot; (&quot;On The Art of Hunting with Birds&quot;). Written himself toward the end of his life, it is widely accepted as the first comprehensive book of falconry, but also notable in its contributions to ornithology and zoology. &quot;De arte venandi cum avibus&quot; incorporated a diversity of scholarly traditions from east to west, and is one of the earliest challenges to Aristotle&#x27;s explanations of nature.


Historically, falconry was a popular sport and status symbol among the nobles of medieval Europe, and Asia. Many historical illustrations left in Rashid al Din&#x27;s &quot;Compendium chronicles&quot; book described falconry of the middle centuries with Mongol images. Falconry was largely restricted to the noble classes due to the prerequisite commitment of time, money, and space. In art and other aspects of culture, such as literature, falconry remained a status symbol long after it was no longer popularly practiced. The historical significance of falconry within lower social classes may be underrepresented in the archaeological record, due to a lack of surviving evidence, especially from nonliterate nomadic and nonagrarian societies. Within nomadic societies such as the Bedouin, falconry was not practiced for recreation by noblemen. Instead, falcons were trapped and hunted on small game during the winter to supplement a very limited diet.

In the UK and parts of Europe, falconry probably reached its zenith in the 17th century, but soon faded, particularly in the late 18th and 19th centuries, as firearms became the tool of choice for hunting. (This likely took place throughout Europe and Asia in differing degrees.) Falconry in the UK had a resurgence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when a number of falconry books were published. This revival led to the introduction of falconry in North America in the early 20th century. Colonel R. Luff Meredith is recognized as the father of North American falconry.

Throughout the 20th century, modern veterinary practices and the advent of radio telemetry (transmitters attached to free-flying birds) increased the average lifespan of falconry birds, and allowed falconers to pursue quarry and styles of flight that had previously resulted in the loss of their hawk or falcon.

===Timeline===

* 722–705 BC – An Assyrian bas-relief found in the ruins at Khorsabad during the excavation of the palace of Sargon II (Sargon II) has been claimed to depict falconry. In fact, it depicts an archer shooting at raptors and an attendant capturing a raptor. A. H. Layard&#x27;s statement in his 1853 book &quot;Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon&quot; is &quot;A falconer bearing a hawk on his wrist appeared to be represented in a bas-relief which I saw on my last visit to those ruins.&quot;

* Fourth century BC – Aristotle wrote that in Thrace, the boys who want to hunt small birds, take hawks with them. When they call the hawks addressing them by name, the hawks swoop down on the birds. The small birds fly in terror into the bushes, where the boys catch them by knocking them down with sticks; in case the hawks themselves catch any of the birds, they throw them down to the hunters. When the hunting finishes, the hunters give a portion of all that is caught to the hawks. He also wrote that in the city of Cedripolis (Κεδρίπολις), men and hawks jointly hunt small birds. The men drive them away with sticks, while the hawks pursue closely, and the small birds in their flight fall into the clutches of the men. Because of this, they share their prey with the hawks.

===Falconry in Britain in early 12th century===
Medieval Normans distinguished falconry from the sport of &#x27;hawking&#x27;. Normans practiced falconry by horseback and &#x27;hawking&#x27; by foot. An immediate impact of the Norman Conquest of England was a penchant for falconry enjoyed by Norman nobility. So much so, in fact, that they outlawed commoners from hunting particular lands so that nobility could freely enjoy both sports. Both falconry and &#x27;hawking&#x27; were central to Norman cultural identity in medieval times. Normans transported their falcons on a frame called a cadge.

===The &quot;Book of St Albans&quot;===
The often-quoted &quot;Book of Saint Albans&quot; or &quot;Boke of St Albans&quot;, first printed in 1486, often attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, provides this hierarchy of hawks and the social ranks for which each bird was supposedly appropriate.
# Emperor: Eagle, vulture, and merlin
# King: gyrfalcon and the tercel of the gyrfalcon
# Prince: falcon gentle and the tercel gentle
# Duke: falcon of the loch
# Earl: Peregrine falcon
# Baron: bustard
# Knight: sacre and the sacret
# Esquire: lanere and the laneret
# Lady: marlyon
# Young man: hobby
# Yeoman: goshawk
# Poor man: tercel
# Priest: sparrowhawk
# Holy water clerk: musket
# Knave or servant: kestrel

This list, however, was mistaken in several respects.
* 1) Vultures are not used for falconry.
* 3) 4) 5) These are usually said to be different names for the peregrine falcon. But there is an opinion that renders 4) as &quot;rock falcon&quot; = a peregrine from remote rocky areas, which would be bigger and stronger than other peregrines. This could also refer to the Scottish peregrine.
* 6) The bustard is not a bird of prey, but a game species that was commonly hunted by falconers; this entry may have been a mistake for buzzard, or for &quot;busard&quot; which is French for &quot;harrier&quot;; but any of these would be a poor deal for barons; some treat this entry as &quot;bastard hawk&quot;, possibly meaning a hawk of unknown lineage, or a hawk that could not be identified.
* 7) Sakers were imported from abroad and very expensive, and ordinary knights and squires would be unlikely to have them.
* 8) Contemporary records have lanners as native to England.
* 10) 15) Hobbies and kestrels are historically considered to be of little use for serious falconry (the French name for the hobby is &quot;faucon hobereau&quot;, &quot;hobereau&quot; meaning &quot;local/country squire&quot;. That may be the source of the confusion), however King Edward I of England sent a falconer to catch hobbies for his use. Kestrels are coming into their own as worthy hunting birds, as modern falconers dedicate more time to their specific style of hunting. While not suitable for catching game for the falconer&#x27;s table, kestrels are certainly capable of catching enough quarry that they can be fed on surplus kills through the molt.
* 12) An opinion holds that since the previous entry is the goshawk, this entry (&quot;Ther is a Tercell. And that is for the powere [= poor] man.&quot;) means a male goshawk and that here &quot;poor man&quot; means not a labourer or beggar, but someone at the bottom of the scale of landowners.

The relevance of the &quot;Boke&quot; to practical falconry past or present is extremely tenuous, and veteran British falconer Phillip Glasier dismissed it as &quot;merely a formalised and rather fanciful listing of birds&quot;.
===Falconry in Britain in 1973===
A book about falconry published in 1973 says:
* Most falconry birds used in Britain were taken from the wild, either in Britain, or taken abroad and then imported.
* Captive breeding was initiated. The book mentions a captive-bred goshawk and a brood of captive-bred red-tailed hawks. It describes as a new and remarkable event captive breeding hybrid young in 1971 and 1972 from John Morris&#x27;s female saker and Ronald Stevens&#x27;s peregrine falcon.
* Peregrine falcons were suffering from the post–World War II severe decline caused by pesticides. Taking wild peregrines in Britain was only allowed to train them to keep birds off Royal Air Force airfields to prevent bird strikes.
* The book does not mention telemetry.
* Harris hawks were known to falconers but unusual. For example, the book lists a falconry meet on four days in August 1971 at White Hill and Leafield in Dumfriesshire in Scotland; the hawks flown were 11 goshawks and one Harris hawk. The book felt it necessary to say what a Harris hawk is.
* The usual species for a beginner was a kestrel.
* A few falconers used golden eagles.
* Falcons in falconry would have bells on their legs so the hunters could find them. If the bells fell off the falcon, the hunter would not be able to find his bird easily. The bird usually died if it could not find a way to remove the leather binding on its feet.

== Intangible cultural heritage ==
In 2010, UNESCO inscribed falconry on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity upon the nomination of eleven countries in which it is an important element of their culture: Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, South Korea, Mongolia, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. Austria and Hungary were added in 2012; Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Portugal were added in 2016; and Croatia, Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia were added in 2021. Nominated by a total of twenty-four countries, falconry is the largest multi-national element on the Representative List.

In their rationale for inscription on the list, the nominators highlighted that &quot;Originally a means of obtaining food, falconry has acquired other values over time and has been integrated into communities as a social and recreational practice and as a way of connecting with nature. Today, falconry is practised by people of all ages in many countries. As an important cultural symbol in many of those countries, it is transmitted from generation to generation through a variety of means, including through mentoring, within families or in training clubs&quot;.

==Literature and film==

* In historic literature of Mongols, &quot;The Secret History of Mongol&quot; is one of earliest books that described Bodonchar Munkhag, first leader of the Borjigan tribe as having first caught a falcon and fed it until spring. Through falconry, he not only survived, but also made it his tribal custom. His eighth-generation descendant Esukhei Baatar (hereo) was also in falconry, and he was the father of Genghis Khan. Through Genghis Khan&#x27;s Great Mongol empire, this custom was introduced to China, Korea, Japan, and Europe, as well as the Western Asia.
* In the Tale XXXIII of the &quot;Tales of Count Lucanor&quot; by the prince of Villena, &quot;Lo que sucedió a un halcón sacre del infante don Manuel con una garza y un águila&quot;, the tale tries to teach a moral based on a story about falconry lived by the father of the author.
* In the ninth novel of the fifth day of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;, a medieval collection of novellas, a falcon is central to the plot: Nobleman Federigo degli Alberighi has wasted his fortune courting his unrequited love until nothing is left but his brave falcon. When his lady comes to see him, he gives her the falcon to eat. Knowing his case, she changes her mind, marries him, and makes him rich.
* Famous explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton wrote an account of falconry in India, &quot;Falconry in the Valley of the Indus&quot;, first published in 1852 and now available in modern reprints.
* A 17th-century English physician-philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne, wrote a short essay on falconry.
* T.H. White was a falconer and wrote &quot;The Goshawk&quot; about his attempt to train a hawk in the traditional art of falconry. Falconry is also featured and discussed in &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;.
* In Virginia Henley&#x27;s historical romance books, &quot;The Falcon and the Flower&quot;, &quot;The Dragon and the Jewel&quot;, &quot;The Marriage Prize&quot;, &quot;The Border Hostage&quot;, and &quot;Infamous&quot;, numerous mentions to the art of falconry are made, as these books are set at dates ranging from the 1150s to the 16th century.
* The main character, Sam Gribley, in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot;, is a falconer. His trained falcon is named Frightful.
* William Bayer&#x27;s novel &quot;Peregrine&quot; set in the world of falconry, about a rogue peregrine falcon in New York City, won the 1982 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Mystery.
* Stana Katic, the Canadian actress who played Detective Kate Beckett on &quot;Castle&quot;, enjoys falconry in her spare time. She has said that &quot;It gives me self-respect.&quot;
* In the book and movie &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; about two Americans who sold secrets to the Soviets, one of the two main characters, Christopher Boyce, is a falconer.
* In &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, Richie keeps a falcon named Mordecai on the roof of his home in Brooklyn.
* In James Clavell&#x27;s &quot;Shōgun&quot;, Toranaga, one of the main characters, practices falconry throughout the book, often during or immediately before or after important plot events. His thoughts also reveal an analogy between his falconry and his use of other characters towards his ends.
* The 1985 film &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; involved a medieval warrior who carried a red-tailed hawk as a pet, but in truth, the hawk was actually his lover, who had been cursed by an evil bishop to keep the two apart.
* In &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, the main character, Roland, uses a hawk named David, to win a trial by combat to become a Gunslinger.
* &quot;The Falconer&quot; is a recurring sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, featuring Will Forte as a falconer who constantly finds himself in mortal peril and must rely on his loyal falcon, Donald, to rescue him.
* Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;″s main character, Santiago Nasar, and his father are falconers.
* Hodgesaargh is a falconer based in Lancre Castle in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; books. He is an expert and dedicated falconer who unluckily seems to only keep birds that enjoy attacking him.

<doc id="169709" wikidata="Q2447709" url="?curid=169709" title="Walter Dorwin Teague">
<text>Walter Dorwin Teague (December 18, 1883 – December 5, 1960) was an American industrial designer, architect, illustrator, graphic designer, writer, and entrepreneur. Often referred to as the &quot;Dean of Industrial Design&quot;, Teague pioneered in the establishment of industrial design as a profession in the US, along with Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss and Joseph Sinel.

Regarded as a classicist and a traditionalist despite a later shift to modern tastes, Teague is recognized as a critical figure in the spread of mid-century modernism in America. He is widely known for his exhibition designs during the 1939-40 New York World&#x27;s Fair, such as the Ford Building, and his iconic product and package designs, from Eastman Kodak&#x27;s Bantam Special to the steel-legged Steinway piano.

A self-described late starter whose professional acclaim began as he approached age 50, Teague sought to create heirlooms out of mass-produced manufactured objects, and frequently cited beauty as &quot;visible rightness&quot;. In 1926 Teague assembled an industrial design consultancy later known as Teague.

==Biography==
Teague was one of six children born to an established Decatur, Indiana family. In 1840, Teague&#x27;s grandfather had moved from North Carolina to Pendleton, Indiana, home to one of America&#x27;s largest Quaker communities. Teague&#x27;s father, of Irish forebears, became a circuit-riding Methodist minister (and later full-time tailor) who settled in Pendleton with his family. With little money, the Teague household was laden with books.

At age 16, while he was still in school in Pendleton, Teague worked as a handyman at the local paper, where he quickly became a jack-of-all-trades and eventually a reporter.

Teague married Cecelia Fehon in 1908. They had three children: Walter Dorwin Jr., Cecily Fehon and Rudolf Lewis. Teague and Fehon divorced in 1937.

His second wife was Ruth Mills with whom he co-authored the murder mystery &quot;You Can&#x27;t Ignore Murder&quot;.
===Career beginnings===
Books on architecture in his high school library influenced Teague&#x27;s desire to become an artist. At 19 years old, Teague left Indiana for New York City. He studied painting from 1903 to 1907 at the Art Students League of New York, where he met his first wife, Celia Fehon, a fellow artist. To earn money upon his arrival in New York, Teague checked hats at the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association in Manhattan, where he also began sign painting. His lettering work evolved into illustration projects for mail order catalogues, for which he drew apparel items such as neckties and shoes. Refusing involvement in the fashion industry, Teague focused his creative efforts on elaborate advertising illustrations, which caught the attention of Walter Whitehead, an advertising executive whom Teague had met at the YMCA.

Whitehead hired Teague at the Ben Hampton Advertising Agency. When Whitehead left Ben Hampton for the larger agency of Calkins &amp; Holden in 1908, Teague went with him. During Teague&#x27;s four years at Calkins &amp; Holden, he developed a distinct artistic style recognized by Earnest Elmo Calkins as a reconciliation of past art and present day production.

By 1911, Teague was an active freelancer in decorative design and typography. He also shared offices with Bruce Rogers and Frederic Goudy, and was a co-founder of Pynson Printers. Teague became known for his distinctive frames for advertising art, which blended Baroque and Renaissance influence with a simplicity ideal for high-volume printing presses.

In 1912, Teague left Calkins &amp; Holden to expand his freelance work from his own typographic studio. Through his graphic design contributions to magazines, Teague&#x27;s signature style earned widespread recognition in his field, particularly during the early 1920s when he designed frames for the famous Arrow Collar ads. &quot;Teague borders&quot; became a generic term for ad frames of a certain type, even those created by others.

By the mid-1920s, as the demand for border designs weakened, Teague had become lightly involved in commercial packaging. Intrigued by the International Paris Exposition and European stylistic movements, Teague left for Europe on June 30, 1926, to investigate European design. While abroad he familiarized himself with Bauhaus work during an exhibition in Italy, and became greatly inspired by the architectural creations and writings of Le Corbusier.

===Pioneering an occupation===
As the Great Depression loomed in America and mass-produced, machine-made objects intensified, large companies were desperate to find measures of survival. Stirred by European modernism, America&#x27;s design heritage, and a keen understanding of modern market dynamics, Teague promoted new ideas about the impact and significance of design in American culture, fueled, so, too, by the desire to transform machine-made objects into contextual heirlooms.

Shortly before Teague concluded his 18-year advertising career, he partook in several commissions in product design, for which a growing number of clients sought counseling. At age 43, Teague established a sole proprietorship devoted to product and package design. By 1927, Teague added &quot;Industrial Design&quot; to his letterhead upon landing his first big client, Eastman Kodak.

Richard Bach, a curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had recommended Teague to Adolph Stuber, a top manager of Rochester, New York-based Eastman Kodak, when the company was considering the assistance of an artist to design cameras. With no knowledge of cameras, Teague proposed working on-site in collaboration with Kodak engineers. Designing according to engineering necessities, insisted Teague, &quot;ultimately leads to greater beauty and heavier sales.&quot; In Teague&#x27;s &quot;Forbes&quot; article, &quot;Modern Design Needs Modern Merchandising,&quot; published February 1, 1928, he advises, &quot;The designer who gets results for the manufacturer plans with all departments of a business before he ever lays pencil to drawing board.&quot;
On January 1, 1928, Teague embarked on a design endeavor that culminated in an extensive relationship with Kodak—that would last until his death. He designed a number of well-known Kodak cameras, including an Art Deco gift camera (1928), the Baby Brownie (1934), the Bantam Special (1936) (considered a masterpiece of Art Deco styling and one of the most popular cameras ever produced,) and the Brownie Hawkeye (1950). By redesigning the camera case to match the camera, the two items presented a unity difficult to break during purchase; thus, the sales of carrying cases increased four times over in 1934.

Teague&#x27;s camera designs for Kodak expanded into the design of Kodak&#x27;s displays, retail spaces, and exhibits. By 1934, the company created an entire styling division, to which Teague&#x27;s role became advisory.

===Design expansion &amp; corporate identity===

Within two years of his first endeavor with Eastman Kodak, Teague&#x27;s scope of industrial design work and number of clients multiplied. While design culture sustained a rather elitist attainability through the 1930s, Teague pursued strategic relationships with large businesses selling products to the masses. In addition to gaining widespread attention for such designs as the Marmon V-16, the first automobile to be conceived by an industrial designer, designed by Teague and his son, Walter Dorwin Teague, Jr., and the Steinway Peace Piano, Teague&#x27;s work also included 32 design patterns for Steuben Glass, a division of Corning Glass Works, three radios produced by Sparton (the &#x27;Bluebird&#x27; and &#x27;Sled&#x27; table models and the &#x27;Nocturne&#x27; console), and the design of passenger cars and diners for the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad.

The concept of &quot;Corporate Identity&quot; emerged from the cross-disciplined work of commercial design and the human-designed environment, first shown through Teague&#x27;s retail-space design for Eastman Kodak. Elevating this concept into a first-of-its-kind corporate identity program for Texaco Company, Teague created an expansive brand image that included the design of full station layouts for Texaco service stations, pumps, signs, cans, and trucks. More than 20,000 of these art-deco style stations had been built worldwide by 1960.

===World&#x27;s Fairs and expositions===

In the 1930s and 1940s, corporate identity was prolifically popularized in America through elaborate fairs and expositions, which showcased industry sponsors&#x27; contributions to modern living. Teague—who, prior, had no formal training in architecture or engineering—succeeded in becoming licensed as an architect in New York State.

Teague commenced his deep involvement in exhibition design with his work on the Ford Building at Chicago&#x27;s Century of Progress 1933-34 fair, for which he prepared for three months, commuting between Detroit and New York. His architectural contributions also included the Texaco exhibition hall at the 1935 Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas, Texas, and the Ford pavilion for the 1935 California Pacific International Exposition in Balboa Park in San Diego.

Teague made a substantial impact on the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair as one of seven members of the Fair&#x27;s design board, and was also responsible for nine corporate displays. In addition to his design of the Ford and U.S. Steel pavilions, Teague introduced the new National Cash Register 100 Model, exemplifying &quot;art moderne&quot;, with a seven-story high cash register placed atop the NCR exhibition, also shown at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exhibition in San Francisco.

Teague&#x27;s additional exhibition work includes that for the 1957 Milan Triennial, 1961 Civil War Centennial Dome in Richmond, Virginia, the US Science Center for the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, as well as the &quot;House of the Future&quot; for the Festival of Gas at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

===Post-WWII: confirming a profession===
Teague, along with fellow industrial designer pioneers Raymond Loewy and Henry Dreyfuss, experienced monumental success following World War II. The post-war economic boom fueled the American consumer&#x27;s desire for more and better products, intensifying the demand for industrial design among American businesses.

In 1944, Teague successfully defended the assertion that industrial design was a profession, citing its contributions to the public good before the appeals court in New York State, setting a national precedent.

===Walter Dorwin Teague Associates===
As early as his first Kodak designs, Teague had accumulated a team of expert associates. By 1938, Teague&#x27;s office grew to 55 employees, including architects, engineers, 3D artists and industrial designers. Teague had also signed his first design retainer contract with Polaroid, culminating in the development of the Land Camera, the first camera able to develop its own prints, introduced in 1948. In 1945, when Teague&#x27;s growing studio of designers, architects and technicians was supplemented with an engineering division, Teague changed his company structure from a sole proprietorship to a partnership, allowing senior staff to be partners in Walter Dorwin Teague Associates. In 1946, Frank Del Giudice (who would later become the company&#x27;s president) represented WDTA in seeking commissions from The Boeing Company, not only commencing WDTA&#x27;s lasting relationship with Boeing, but the company&#x27;s substantial impact in aerospace.

By 1959, WDTA&#x27;s client list included Ac&#x27;cent, Polaroid, Schaefer Beer, Procter &amp; Gamble, UPS, Steinway, General Foods Corporation, Boeing, Con Edison, Du Pont, US Steel, NASA, and the US Navy. A 1959 Fortune survey reported that WDTA was then second in gross revenue among those industrial design firms also doing architecture and interior design (Raymond Loewy Associates was first).

Accredited with iconic designs such as the UPS truck, Pringles Potato Chips canister, Scope Mouthwash bottle, Reagan-era &quot;Air Force One&quot;, Polaroid Land Camera, and more.

Walter Dorwin Teague Associates is now known as Teague. The privately held Seattle-based company is most commonly recognized today for its work in consumer electronics, aviation, digital, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicle interaction design. Its clients include Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Panasonic, and Boeing, and projects such as the Xbox and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

===Society of Industrial Designers (SID)===
Teague, Loewy and Dreyfuss, as well as 15 East Coast designers, established the Society of Industrial Designers (SID) as &quot;tangible evidence of the arriving maturity of the field,&quot; according to Teague, who also said, &quot;Its purpose is to define and maintain standards of ethics and performance within the profession, and to guide and improve the still somewhat experimental education of future designers. For his accomplishments in establishing industrial design as a profession, Teague was named the first president of SID in February 1944.

In 1955, the SID changed its name to the American Society of Industrial Design (ASID), and by 1965 the organization had evolved into today&#x27;s Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA).

===Death===
Teague died in Flemington, New Jersey on December 5, 1960, less than a year after addressing the Royal Society of the Arts, and less than two weeks shy of his 77th birthday. Twice married, Teague was survived by his second wife Ruth, his two sons and his daughter (from his first marriage). His son, Walter Dorwin Teague Jr., who began working with his father in 1934, also devoted his career to industrial design until his own death in 2004.

===Posthumous recognition===
In 1963, the ASID honored Teague by offering the organization&#x27;s first scholarship program, The Walter Dorwin Teague Scholarship, eligible to select junior students majoring in industrial design. The first scholarship of $1000 was presented in May 1964.

In 2007, Teague posthumously won the Personal Recognition Award from IDSA.

In January 2011, Teague was one of twelve honored by the United States Postal Service as &quot;the nation&#x27;s most important and influential industrial designers,&quot; with a special edition of postal stamps. The Smithsonian&#x27;s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum was the setting for the dedication.

In August 2014, Teague was named to the Academy of Fellows by the IDSA. Such recommendations are for members in good standing who have earned the special respect and affection of the membership through distinguished service to the society and to the profession as a whole.&quot;

===Biographical Documentary Film===
In 2014 the feature documentary film &quot;Teague: Design &amp; Beauty&quot; by independent filmmaker, Jason A. Morris, premiered in Austin, Texas. The film documented Teague&#x27;s life, his rise to prominence, his turbulent relationship with a rebellious son, and the stories behind some of his greatest designs. The film was an official selection at the 2015 Newport Beach Film Festival, Trail Dance Film Festival, and San Diego Design Film Festival. It was also screened at design schools and museums across the United States.

==Publications==
Teague&#x27;s best-known book, &quot;Design This Day- The Technique of Order in the Machine Age&quot;, was first published in 1940, as the first book on the whole subject of industrial design, tracing the development of modern design and outlining necessary techniques to the solution of design problems. Described as a &quot;milestone&quot; in the industry, the book explores the evolution of civilization&#x27;s reliance on increased industrialization and explains the designer&#x27;s role. Teague (the company) reprinted the book in 2006. Teague also wrote &quot;Land of Plenty&quot;, &quot;A Summary of Possibilities&quot; (1947), and, with John Storck, &quot;Flour for Man&#x27;s Bread, a History of Milling&quot; (1952).

Teague&#x27;s writings were published in &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Art &amp; Industry&quot;, &quot;New Yorker&quot;, the &quot;Seventh International Management Congress&quot;, &quot;Interiors&quot;, &quot;Business Week&quot;, &quot;Art and Decoration&quot;, Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum of Art archived texts, among others.

Teague co-authored a murder mystery novel with his second wife Ruth Mills Teague. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Ignore Murder&quot; was published in 1942.

<text>Lake Tanganyika ( ; ) is an African Great Lake. It is the world&#x27;s second-largest freshwater lake by volume and the second deepest, in both cases after Lake Baikal in Siberia. It is the world&#x27;s longest freshwater lake. The lake is shared among four countries—Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the DRC), Burundi, and Zambia—with Tanzania (46%) and the DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. It drains via the Lukuga River into the Congo River system, which ultimately discharges at Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo into the Atlantic Ocean.

==Geography==
Lake Tanganyika is situated within the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift, and is confined by the mountainous walls of the valley. It is the largest rift lake in Africa and the second-largest lake by volume in the world. It is the deepest lake in Africa and holds the greatest volume of fresh water on the continent, accounting for 16% of the world&#x27;s available fresh water. It extends for in a general north–south direction and averages in width. The lake covers , with a shoreline of , a mean depth of and a maximum depth of (in the northern basin). It holds an estimated volume of water.

The catchment area of the lake is . Two main rivers flow into the lake, as well as numerous smaller rivers and streams (whose lengths are limited by the steep mountains around the lake). The one major outflow is the Lukuga River, which empties into the Congo River drainage. Precipitation and evaporation play a greater role than the rivers. At least 90% of the water influx is from rain falling on the lake&#x27;s surface and at least 90% of the water loss is from direct evaporation.

The major river flowing into the lake is the Ruzizi River, formed about 10,000 years ago, which enters the north of the lake from Lake Kivu. The Malagarasi River, which is Tanzania&#x27;s second largest river, enters the east side of Lake Tanganyika. The Malagarasi is older than Lake Tanganyika, and before the lake was formed, it probably was a headwater of the Lualaba River, the main Congo River headstream.

The lake has a complex history of changing flow patterns, due to its high altitude, great depth, slow rate of refill, and mountainous location in a turbulently volcanic area that has undergone climate changes. Apparently, it has rarely in the past had an outflow to the sea. It has been described as &quot;practically endorheic&quot; for this reason. The lake&#x27;s connection to the sea is dependent on a high water level allowing water to overflow out of the lake through the Lukuga River into the Congo. When not overflowing, the lake&#x27;s exit into the Lukuga River typically is blocked by sand bars and masses of weed, and instead this river depends on its own tributaries, especially the Niemba River, to maintain a flow.

The lake may also have at times had different inflows and outflows; inward flows from a higher Lake Rukwa, access to Lake Malawi and an exit route to the Nile have all been proposed to have existed at some point in the lake&#x27;s history.

Lake Tanganyika is an ancient lake, one of only twenty more than a million years old. Its three basins, which in periods with much lower water levels were separate lakes, are of different ages. The central began to form 9–12 million years ago (Mya), the northern 7–8 Mya and the southern 2–4 Mya.

==Water characteristics==

The lake&#x27;s water is alkaline with a pH around 9 at depths of . Below this, it is around 8.7, gradually decreasing to 8.3–8.5 in the deepest parts of Tanganyika. A similar pattern can be seen in the electric conductivity, ranging from about 670 μS/cm in the upper part to 690 μS/cm in the deepest.

Surface temperatures generally range from about in the southern part of the lake in early August to in the late rainy season in March—April. At depths greater than , the temperature is very stable at . The water has gradually warmed since the 19th century and this has accelerated with global warming since the 1950s.

The lake is stratified and seasonal mixing generally does not extend beyond depths of . The mixing mainly occurs as upwellings in the south and is wind-driven, but to a lesser extent, up- and downwellings also occur elsewhere in the lake. As a consequence of the stratification, the deep sections contain &quot;fossil water&quot;. This also means it has no oxygen (it is anoxic) in the deeper parts, essentially limiting fish and other aerobic organisms to the upper part. Some geographical variations are seen in this limit, but it is typically at depths around in the northern part of the lake and in the south. The oxygen-devoid deepest sections contain high levels of toxic hydrogen sulfide and are essentially lifeless, except for bacteria.

==Biology==
===Reptiles===
Lake Tanganyika and its associated wetlands are home to Nile crocodiles (including famous giant Gustave), Zambian hinged terrapins, serrated hinged terrapins, and pan hinged terrapins (last species not in the lake itself, but in adjacent lagoons). Storm&#x27;s water cobra, a threatened subspecies of banded water cobra that feeds mainly on fish, is only found in Lake Tanganyika, where it prefers rocky shores.

===Cichlid fishes===
Lake Tanganyika is home to at least 250 endemic species of cichlids, and undescribed species likely remain to be discovered. Almost all (roughly 98%) of the lake&#x27;s cichlid species are found solely there, and nowhere else, thus making it a precious biological resource for the study of speciation and evolution. The cichlids of the African Great Lakes, including Tanganyika, represent the most diverse extent of adaptive radiation in vertebrates. Some of the endemic species do occur slightly into the upper Lukuga River (Lake Tanganyika&#x27;s outflow), but any further distribution into the Congo River basin is stemmed purely by geography and chemistry—Tanganyika&#x27;s lake environment is far more stable and consistent than the rapids and fast-flowing sections of the Congo River. Additionally, Lake Tanganyika&#x27;s water is alkaline and of a higher pH (which the cichlids prefer), containing a higher calcium and mineral content than the Congo&#x27;s acidic, sediment-rich waters, which collect much organic detritus from the surrounding rainforests. In areas of the Congo away from rapids or whitewater, the accumulated sediment and organic matter creates sections of &quot;blackwater&quot;, with a high concentration of tannins from dissolving wood and leaves, creating an environment in which cichlids simply do not thrive. Likewise, many tropical riverine species would likely suffer if exposed to the crisp, alkaline lake water. 

Although Lake Tanganyika has fewer cichlid species than Lakes Malawi or Victoria—which both have experienced relatively recent explosive species radiations (resulting in many closely related species)—, its cichlids are the most morphologically and genetically diverse. This is linked to the maturity of Tanganyika, as it is far older than the other lakes. Tanganyika has the largest number of endemic cichlid genera of all African lakes. All Tanganyika cichlids are in the subfamily Pseudocrenilabrinae. Of the 10 tribes in this subfamily, half are largely or entirely restricted to the lake (Cyprichromini, Ectodini, Lamprologini, Limnochromini and Tropheini), while another three have species in the lake (Haplochromini, Tilapiini and Tylochromini). Others have proposed splitting the Tanganyika cichlids into as many as 12–16 tribes (Bathybatini, Benthochromini, Boulengerochromini, Cyphotilapiini, Eretmodini, Greenwoodochromini, Perissodini and Trematocarini, in addition to the aforementioned tribes).

Most Tanganyika cichlids live along the shoreline, down to a depth of , but some deep-water species regularly descend to . &quot;Trematocara&quot; species have, exceptionally, been found at more than , which is deeper than any other cichlid known. Some of the deepwater genera (e.g., &quot;Bathybates&quot;, &quot;Gnathochromis&quot;, &quot;Hemibates&quot; and &quot;Xenochromis&quot;) have been caught in places virtually devoid of oxygen, and how they are able to survive there is unclear. Tanganyika cichlids are generally benthic (found at or near the bottom) and/or coastally. No Tanganyika cichlids are truly pelagic &quot;and&quot; offshore, except for some of the piscivorous &quot;Bathybates&quot;. Two of these, &quot;B. fasciatus&quot; and &quot;B. leo&quot;, mainly feed on Tanganyika sardines. Tanganyika cichlids differ extensively in ecology, and include species that are herbivores, detritivores, planktivores, insectivores, molluscivores, scavengers, scale-eaters and piscivores. These dietary specializations, however, have been shown to be variable and subject to opportunistic changes. That is, many species of Tanganyikan cichlid with specialized diets showed opportunistic, episodic exploitation of &quot;Stolothrissa tanganicae&quot; and &quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot; when prey concentrations were unusually high. The fishes&#x27; breeding behavior falls into two main groups: the substrate- or sand-spawners (often in caves or rock crevices) and the mouthbrooders. Among the endemic species are two of the world&#x27;s smallest cichlids, &quot;Neolamprologus multifasciatus&quot; and &quot;N. similis&quot; (both shell dwellers), measuring up to , and one of the largest, the giant cichlid (&quot;Boulengerochromis microlepis&quot;) at up to .

Many cichlids from Lake Tanganyika, such as species from the genera &quot;Altolamprologus&quot;, &quot;Cyprichromis&quot;, &quot;Eretmodus&quot;, &quot;Julidochromis&quot;, &quot;Lamprologus&quot;, &quot;Neolamprologus&quot;, &quot;Tropheus&quot; and &quot;Xenotilapia&quot;, are popular aquarium fish due to their bright colors and patterns, and interesting behaviors. Recreating a Lake Tanganyika biotope to host those cichlids in a habitat similar to their natural environment is also popular in the aquarium hobby, with many species today being bred in captivity successfully.

===Other fish===

Lake Tanganyika is home to more than 80 species of non-cichlid fish and about 60% of these are endemic.

The open waters of the pelagic zone are dominated by four non-cichlid species: Two species of &quot;Tanganyika sardine&quot; (&quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot; and &quot;Stolothrissa tanganicae&quot;) form the largest biomass of fish in this zone, and they are important prey for the forktail lates (&quot;Lates microlepis&quot;) and sleek lates (&quot;L. stappersii&quot;). Two additional lates are found in the lake, the Tanganyika lates (&quot;L. angustifrons&quot;) and bigeye lates (&quot;L. mariae&quot;), but both these are primarily benthic hunters, although they also may move into open waters. The four lates, all endemic to Tanganyika, have been overfished and larger individuals are rare today.

Among the more unusual fish in the lake are the endemic, facultatively brood parasitic &quot;cuckoo catfish&quot;, including at least &quot;Synodontis grandiops&quot; and &quot;S. multipunctatus&quot;. A number of others are very similar (e.g., &quot;S. lucipinnis&quot; and &quot;S. petricola&quot;) and have often been confused; it is unclear if they have a similar behavior. The facultative brood parasites often lay their eggs synchronously with mouthbroding cichlids. The cichlid pick up the eggs in their mouth as if they were their own. Once the catfish eggs hatch the young eat the cichlid eggs. Six catfish genera are entirely restricted to the lake basin: &quot;Bathybagrus&quot;, &quot;Dinotopterus&quot;, &quot;Lophiobagrus&quot;, &quot;Phyllonemus&quot;, &quot;Pseudotanganikallabes&quot; and &quot;Tanganikallabes&quot;. Although not endemic on a genus level, six species of &quot;Chrysichthys&quot; catfish are only found in the Tanganyika basin where they live both in shallow and relatively deep waters; in the latter habitat they are the primary predators and scavengers. A unique evolutionary radiation in the lake is the 15 species of &quot;Mastacembelus&quot; spiny eels, all but one endemic to its basin. Although other African Great Lakes have &quot;Synodontis&quot; catfish, endemic catfish genera and &quot;Mastacembelus&quot; spiny eels, the relatively high diversity is unique to Tanganyika, which likely is related to its old age.

Among the non-endemic fish, some are widespread African species but several are only shared with the Malagarasi and Congo River basins, such as the Congo bichir (&quot;Polypterus congicus&quot;), goliath tigerfish (&quot;Hydrocynus goliath&quot;), &quot;Citharinus citharus&quot;, six-banded distichodus (&quot;Distichodus sexfasciatus&quot;) and mbu puffer (&quot;Tetraodon mbu&quot;).

===Molluscs and crustaceans===

A total of 83 freshwater snail species (65 endemic) and 11 bivalve species (8 endemic) are known from the lake. Among the endemic bivalves are three monotypic genera: &quot;Grandidieria burtoni&quot;, &quot;Pseudospatha tanganyicensis&quot; and &quot;Brazzaea anceyi&quot;. Many of the snails are unusual for species living in freshwater in having noticeably thickened shells and/or distinct sculpture, features more commonly seen in marine snails. They are referred to as thalassoids, which can be translated to &quot;marine-like&quot;. All the Tanganyika thalassoids, which are part of Prosobranchia, are endemic to the lake. Initially they were believed to be related to similar marine snails, but they are now known to be unrelated. Their appearance is now believed to be the result of the highly diverse habitats in Lake Tanganyika and evolutionary pressure from snail-eating fish and, in particular, &quot;Platythelphusa&quot; crabs. A total of 17 freshwater snail genera are endemic to the lake, such as &quot;Hirthia&quot;, &quot;Lavigeria&quot;, &quot;Paramelania&quot;, &quot;Reymondia&quot;, &quot;Spekia&quot;, &quot;Stanleya&quot;, &quot;Tanganyicia&quot; and &quot;Tiphobia&quot;. There are about 30 species of non-thalassoid snails in the lake, but only five of these are endemic, including &quot;Ferrissia tanganyicensis&quot; and &quot;Neothauma tanganyicense&quot;. The latter is the largest Tanganyika snail and its shell is often used by small shell-dwelling cichlids.

Crustaceans are also highly diverse in Tanganyika with more than 200 species, of which more than half are endemic. They include 10 species of freshwater crabs (9 &quot;Platythelphusa&quot; and &quot;Potamonautes platynotus&quot;; all endemic), at least 11 species of small atyid shrimp (&quot;Atyella&quot;, &quot;Caridella&quot; and &quot;Limnocaridina&quot;), an endemic palaemonid shrimp (&quot;Macrobrachium moorei&quot;), about 100 ostracods, including many endemics, and several copepods. Among these, &quot;Limnocaridina iridinae&quot; lives inside the mantle cavity of the unionid mussel &quot;Pleiodon spekei&quot;, making it one of only two known commensal species of freshwater shrimp (the other is the sponge-living &quot;Caridina spongicola&quot; from Lake Towuti, Indonesia).

Among Rift Valley lakes, Lake Tanganyika far surpasses all others in terms of crustacean and freshwater snail richness (both in total number of species and number of endemics). For example, the only other Rift Valley lake with endemic freshwater crabs are Lake Kivu and Lake Victoria with two species each.

===Other invertebrates===
The diversity of other invertebrate groups in Lake Tanganyika is often not well-known, but there are at least 20 described species of leeches (12 endemics), 9 sponges (7 endemic), 6 bryozoa (2 endemic), 11 flatworms (7 endemic), 20 nematodes (7 endemic), 28 annelids (17 endemic) and the small hydrozoan jellyfish &quot;Limnocnida tanganyicae&quot;.

== Fishing ==
Lake Tanganyika supports a major fishery, which, depending on source, provides 25–40% or 60% of the animal protein in the diet of the people living in the region.

Lake Tanganyika fish can be found exported throughout East Africa. Major commercial fishing began in the mid-1950s and has, together with global warming, had a heavy impact on the fish populations, causing significant declines. In 2016, it was estimated that the total catch was up to 200,000 tonnes.

==History==

It is thought that early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; were making an impact on the region during the Stone Age. The time period of the Middle Stone Age to Late Stone Age is described as an age of advanced hunter-gatherers.

There are many methods in which the native people of the area were fishing. Most of them included using a lantern as a lure for fish that are attracted to light. There were three basic forms. One called Lusenga which is a wide net used by one person from a canoe. The second one is using a lift net. This was done by dropping a net deep below the boat using two parallel canoes and then simultaneously pulling it up. The third is called Chiromila which consisted of three canoes. One canoe was stationary with a lantern while another canoe holds one end of the net and the other circles the stationary one to meet up with the net.

The first known Westerners to find the lake were the British explorers Richard Burton and John Speke, in 1858. They located it while searching for the source of the Nile River. Speke continued and found the actual source, Lake Victoria. Later David Livingstone passed by the lake. He noted the name &quot;Liemba&quot; for its southern part, a word probably from the Fipa language. &quot;Tanganyika&quot; means &quot;stars&quot; in the Luvale language.

The lake was the scene of Battle for Lake Tanganyika during World War I. With the aid of the &quot;Graf Goetzen&quot;, the Germans had complete control of the lake in the early stages of the war. The ship was used both to ferry cargo and personnel across the lake, and as a base from which to launch surprise attacks on Allied troops. It therefore became essential for the Allied forces to gain control of the lake themselves. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson the British Royal Navy achieved the monumental task of bringing two armed motor boats HMS &quot;Mimi&quot; and HMS &quot;Toutou&quot; from England to the lake by rail, road and river to Albertville (since renamed Kalemie in 1971) on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika. The two boats waited until December 1915, and mounted a surprise attack on the Germans, with the capture of the gunboat &quot;Kingani&quot;. Another German vessel, the &quot;Hedwig&quot;, was sunk in February 1916, leaving the &quot;Götzen&quot; as the only German vessel remaining to control the lake. In order to avoid his prize ship falling into Allied hands, Zimmer scuttled the vessel on July 26, 1916. The vessel was later raised in 1924 and renamed MV &quot;Liemba&quot;.

<text>The year 1971 involved some significant events in television. Below is a list of notable TV-related events.

==Events==

*January 1 – The final cigarette advertisements are televised in the United States, with the final one occurring during that evening&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on NBC.
*January 3 – BBC Open University broadcasts begin in the UK.
*January 12 – CBS airs the first episode of &quot;All in the Family,&quot; with a disclaimer at the beginning of the program warning viewers about potentially offensive content. Within a year, it became television&#x27;s most popular program, and started a trend toward realism in situation comedies.
*January 27 – Valerie Barlow is electrocuted by a faulty hairdryer, and then perishes in a house fire on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.
*February 23 – &quot;The Selling of the Pentagon&quot; documentary airs on CBS.
*March 2 – On an &quot;All in the Family&quot; episode, Archie and Edith get brand new next-door neighbors—Michael and Gloria&#x27;s best friend, Lionel Jefferson (played by Mike Evans) and his parents. The episode marks Isabel Sanford&#x27;s first appearance as Louise Jefferson; George Jefferson would not be depicted on-screen until 1973 (by Sherman Hemsley).
*March 11 – ABC cancels &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; after sixteen years on the network. The show, however, returns to the airwaves in syndication in September, where it would run for another eleven years.
*March 16 - CBS releases its schedule for the fall 1971 season, adding new shows with urban/suburban appeal and cancelling what Pat Buttram would later call &quot;every show that had a tree in it,&quot; among them Buttram&#x27;s &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, and &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; Two other victims of CBS&#x27; &quot;rural purge,&quot; &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, would continue in first-run syndication that fall.
*April 3 – RTÉ launches Color television in Ireland with the Eurovision Song Contest 1971, held in Dublin.
*April 4 - PBS airs Peter Paul and Mary&#x27;s &quot;The Song is Love&quot; movie documentary, directed by the most unlikely of people, horror movie&#x27;s Tobe Hooper.
*June 7 – The UK children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; buries a time capsule in the grounds of BBC Television Centre; it would be unearthed on the first episode of the year 2000.
*August 1 - The much-acclaimed 6-hour BBC miniseries &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, starring Keith Michell as Henry, makes its U.S. premiere; CBS would air it over 6 consecutive Sundays through September 5.
*September 13 – U.S. network prime time programming shrinks as the original Prime Time Access Rule takes effect. NBC, unable to take advantage, immediately feels the pinch and fails to win any of the 1971–72 season&#x27;s first thirteen weeks.
*October 2 – &quot;Soul Train&quot; debuts in syndication. 
*October 21 – One-off drama &quot;Edna, the Inebriate Woman&quot;, starring Patricia Hayes, is shown by BBC One in its &quot;Play for Today&quot; slot.
*November – Top-rated &quot;As the World Turns&quot; loses the #1 slot in the daytime Nielsens for the first time since 1959.
*Michael Zaslow first appears as Roger Thorpe on &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;.

<text>The year 1972 involved some significant events in television.
Below is a list of notable television-related events.

==Events==
*January 3 – &quot;Show Boat&quot; is aired for the first time on network television in the United States, on NBC
*January 21 – The first convention of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans is held in New York City&#x27;s Statler-Hilton hotel
*Mid-February – John Lennon and Yoko Ono co-host an entire week on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in the U.S.
*February 19 – Sammy Davis Jr. makes a guest appearance on &quot;All in the Family&quot;
*March 18 – After losing a 15-year court battle over the legality of its business relationship with &quot;The Herald-Traveler&quot;, CBS&#x27; Boston, Massachusetts affiliate WHDH-TV Channel 5 signs off the air. At 3 a.m. on March 19, WCVB takes over the Channel 5 frequency, simultaneously switching affiliations to the ABC network following CBS&#x27; loss of interest in the channel during the long legal wrangle.
*March 27 - &quot;The Amateur&#x27;s Guide to Love&quot; begins on the air, making it CBS&#x27; first attempt to make a game show since 1968 when &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; went off the air. It fails after 3 months
*April 4 – After a three-year courtship, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) marries Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) on ITV soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in the U.K.
*May – &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; relocates its production from New York City to the NBC studios in Burbank, California. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; will remain there until relocating back to New York in February 2014
*July 21 – Victoria Wyndham makes her first appearance as vixen (and later, good girl) Rachel Davis on the U.S. soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;
*August 1 – Three years after it was first filmed, the Israel Broadcasting Authority finally agrees to screen &quot;Barricades&quot;, a controversial documentary film that offers a sympathetic portrayal of Palestinians expelled from their homes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War
*August 26 – Effective with this issue, &quot;TV Guide&quot; in the U.S. discontinues the practice of using a &quot;C&quot; to indicate color programs, and instead starts using a &quot;BW&quot; for monochrome, saving a lot of printer&#x27;s ink in the process. At thIS time about half of the TV households in the U.S. have color sets
*September 1 – A day for CBS&#x27; daytime lineup that marks the end of an era. CBS airs reruns of popular primetime shows, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;My Three Sons&quot; for the final time, as reruns dominating CBS&#x27; daytime lineup (a tradition since 1959). The following Monday, all three shows move to syndication
*September 4 – Another eventful day for CBS&#x27; daytime schedule. &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; premieres on CBS. It becomes the longest running game show on American television. &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; and &quot;Gambit&quot; also debut, bringing game shows back to CBS&#x27; schedule in a more successful attempt than &quot;The Amateur&#x27;s Guide to Love&quot;, which was cancelled on June 23, and replacing the morning reruns dominating CBS&#x27; daytime lineup (a staple since 1959).
*September 9 – &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; opens its 18th season on location in Hawaii
*October 27 – The 5000th episode of CBS children&#x27;s show &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; airs
*November 8 – Home Box Office (HBO) is launched, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania
*November 21 – In the second part of a two-part story which began the previous week, Beatrice Arthur&#x27;s character, Maude Findlay, on the U.S. television sitcom &quot;Maude&quot;, decides to go through with an abortion, in a move that shocks CBS executives and &quot;Maude&quot; advertisers. (Rue McClanahan makes her first appearance as Vivian Cavender in this two-parter; she will become a regular cast member the following season)
*December 31
**ORTF 3ème Chaîne launches in France
**The first installment of &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; airs on NBC, beginning a yearly tradition of Dick Clark-hosted New Year&#x27;s specials

<text>The year 1974 involved some significant events in television. Below is a list of television-related events of that year.

==Events==
*January 6 – CKGN-TV begins broadcasting in Brantford, Ontario.
*January 31 – CBS airs a multi-Emmy-winning adaptation of Ernest J. Gaines&#x27; novel &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman&quot;, which follows the 110-year life of a former slave from the Civil War to the Civil Rights Movement. Cicely Tyson portrays the title role.
*February 1 – KITC (now KIVI-TV) begins broadcasting in Boise, Idaho.
*February 2 – The Filipino government television station GTV 4 (now known as the People&#x27;s Television Network) begins operations, under the National Media Production Center.
*February 8 – After 20 years, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; airs its 5195th and final episode on CBS Daytime. The show is replaced ten days later by &quot;Tattletales&quot;, a game show hosted by Bert Convy.
*March 11 – The children&#x27;s special &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;, produced by comedic actress Marlo Thomas, airs on ABC.
*March 13 – &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot; airs on NBC. A made-for-television film, it told the story of Pvt. Eddie Slovik, the only American soldier to be executed for desertion since the American Civil War.
*March 18 – Lucille Ball ends her 23-year consecutive television reign when &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; is cancelled.
*April 5 – After 264 hour-long episodes, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; ends its run on NBC, then spins off to 10 years of &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;.
*April 6 – &quot;Waterloo&quot; wins the Eurovision Song Contest for Sweden and launches ABBA on their stellar global career.
*May 4 – Steve Frame (George Reinholt) marries Alice Matthews (Jacqueline Courtney) for the second time on a special hour-long broadcast of &quot;Another World&quot;, coinciding with the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary.
*June 8 – Jon Pertwee makes his final regular appearance as the Third Doctor in the concluding moments of Part Six of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;. Tom Baker briefly appears as the Fourth Doctor at the conclusion of this serial.
*August 5 – For the first time on a pre-school children&#x27;s programme, the UK show &quot;Inigo Pipkin&quot; covers the death of the main character, Inigo, as the actor who played him (George Woodbridge) had died. The show is renamed &quot;Pipkins&quot;.
*August 8 – US President Richard Nixon announces pending resignation (effective August 9) live on television.
*September 10 – The controversial TV movie &quot;Born Innocent&quot;, starring Linda Blair, airs on NBC. The film, which involved a fourteen-year-old being sent to what the television preview deemed a women&#x27;s prison (when in reality it was a reform school), drew heavy criticism due to an all-female rape scene, the first ever seen on American television. The scene was deleted in subsequent re-airings after a group of girls assaulted an eight-year-old with a pop bottle, influenced by the scene in the film.
*October 6 – &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, the popular British sketch comedy which aired its final episode this year, is first shown in the U.S. on KERA-TV in Dallas, Texas, at 10pm.
*December 28 – Tom Baker makes his first full appearance as the Fourth Doctor in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Robot&quot;.
*On the American soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot;, Meg Dale (Tudi Wiggins) calls her son Ben (Christopher Reeve) a &quot;bastard&quot;, the first time a profanity was spoken on American daytime television.

<doc id="169719" wikidata="Q8088" url="?curid=169719" title="1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1900 Summer Olympics (), today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad () and also known as Paris 1900, were an international multi-sport event that took place in Paris, France, from 14 May to 28 October 1900. No opening or closing ceremonies were held.

At the Olympic Congress of 1894, which convened in the Sorbonne building, Pierre de Coubertin proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in Paris in 1900. However, the delegates to the conference were unwilling to wait six years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896. A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and have Paris host the second Games.

The Games were held as part of the 1900 Exposition Universelle (World&#x27;s Fair). In total, 1,226 competitors took part in 19 different sports. This number relies on certain assumptions about which events were and were not &quot;Olympic&quot;. Many athletes, some of whom had won events, were unaware they had competed in the Olympic Games. Women took part in the games for the first time, with sailor Hélène de Pourtalès, born Helen Barbey in New York City, becoming the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who traveled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest.

Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals but were given cups or trophies. Professionals competed in fencing, as was tradition, and Albert Robert Ayat (France), who won the épée for amateurs and masters, was awarded a prize of 3,000 F (equivalent to in ). Some events were contested for the only time in the history of the Games, including angling, motor racing, ballooning, cricket, croquet, Basque pelota, 200m swimming obstacle race and underwater swimming. This was also the only Olympic Games in history to use live animals (pigeons) as targets during the shooting event. The host nation of France fielded 72% of all athletes (720 of the 997) and won the most gold, silver and bronze medal placings. U.S. athletes won the second-most in each while fielding the fifth-most participants, 75. British athletes won the third-most in each while fielding the second most participants, 102.

== Organization ==
The 1900 Games were held as part of the . The Baron de Coubertin believed this would help public awareness of the Olympics and submitted elaborate plans to rebuild the ancient site of Olympia, complete with statues, temples, stadia, and gymnasia. The director of the Exposition Universelle, Alfred Picard, thought holding an ancient sport event at the Exposition Universelle was an &quot;absurd anachronism&quot;. After thanking de Coubertin for his plans, Picard filed them away and nothing more came of it.

A committee was formed for the organization of the Games, consisting of some of the more able sports administrators of the day, and a provisional program was drawn up. Sports to be included at the games were track and field athletics, swimming, wrestling, gymnastics, fencing, French and British boxing, river and ocean yacht racing, cycling, golf, lifesaving, archery, weightlifting, rowing, diving, and water polo.

British and Irish sports associations and several influential American universities and sports clubs announced their desire to compete. Competitors from Russia and Australia also confirmed their intentions to travel to Paris.

On 9 November 1898, the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (&quot;Union of the French Societies for Athletic Sports&quot; or USFSA) announced that it would have the sole right to any organized sport held during the World&#x27;s Fair. It was an empty threat, but Viscount Charles de La Rochefoucauld, the nominated head of the organizing committee, stepped down rather than be embroiled in the political battle.
The Baron de Coubertin, also secretary-general of the USFSA, was urged to withdraw from active involvement in running the Games and did so, only to comment later, &quot;I surrendered—and was incorrect in doing so.&quot;

The IOC ceded control of the Games to a new committee to oversee every sporting activity connected to the 1900 Exposition Universelle. Alfred Picard appointed Daniel Mérillon, the head of the French Shooting Association, as president of this organization in February 1899. Mérillon published an entirely different schedule of events, which resulted in many of those who had made plans to compete with the original program withdrawing and refusing to deal with the new committee.

Between May and October 1900, the new organizing committee held many sporting activities alongside the Paris Exposition. The term &quot;Olympic&quot; rarely used in sporting events. Indeed, the term &quot;Olympic Games&quot; was replaced by &quot;Concours internationaux d&#x27;exercices physiques et de sport&quot; (&quot;International contests of physical exercises and of sport&quot; in English) in the official report of the sporting events of the 1900 Exposition Universelle. The press reported competitions variously as &quot;International Championships&quot;, &quot;International Games&quot;, &quot;Paris Championships&quot;, &quot;World Championships&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix of the Paris Exposition&quot;.

These poorly organized games, along with those of 1904, were termed decades later by several historians &quot;The Farcical Games.&quot; Years later, many competitors were unaware that they had competed in the Olympics. While there is an Official Report of these Games, complete records of results do not exist. De Coubertin commented later to friends, &quot;It&#x27;s a miracle that the Olympic Movement survived that celebration&quot;.

== Highlights ==
* These Olympic Games were the first organised under the IOC Presidency of Pierre de Coubertin
* Alvin Kraenzlein (United States) won the 60 metres (he was one of two people to ever win this event at the Olympic Games as it was withdrawn from Olympic competition after the 1904 Olympics), the 110 metre hurdles, the 200 metre hurdles and the long jump events; , these four individual gold medals are still a record for a track and field athlete. For his victory in the long jump, he was allegedly punched in the face by his rival Meyer Prinstein, who was prevented from competing in the final by officials of Syracuse University because it was scheduled for a Sunday.
* American-born Hélène de Pourtalès became the first female Olympic champion as part of the Swiss winning team in the 1-2 ton sailing event. Two months later, Charlotte Cooper (UK) became the first woman to win an individual Olympic event after winning the women&#x27;s singles tennis competition. She later went on to win the mixed doubles tournament.
* Three marathon runners from the United States contested the result saying the French runners who got first and second places took a short cut, and in fact they were the only contestants not spattered with mud.
* In the coxed pairs and eights events in rowing, crews replaced adult coxswain with children. The identities and ages of these boys were not recorded but they are believed to have been among the youngest of all Olympic competitors.

== Sports ==
Before July 2021, the IOC had never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot;. In fact, Pierre de Coubertin had ceded that entire determination to the organizers. The IOC webpage for the 1900 Summer Olympics affirms a total of 95 medal events. Weightlifting and wrestling were dropped since the 1896 Summer Olympics, while 12 new sports were added. Among the sports below, only croquet was not an international competition, being contested by French players only. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

== Venues ==
14 venues were used at the 1900 Summer Olympics to host 20 sports.

== Sport-by-sport overview ==
The standard of competition at the Games was variable. Despite a poor-quality track, a strong
contingent of top-class American collegiate athletes ensured the track and field competitions were of the highest quality. The tennis gold medalists were all former Wimbledon champions; swimming and fencing events were of a good standard; and even polo, a minority sport for the social elite, was well represented by some of the best players in the game. Other sports were noticeably weak in both quality and depth. Only athletics, swimming and fencing had competitors from more than ten nations.

=== Archery ===

The history of the archery competition at the 1900 Olympics is one of confusion. The IOC currently lists six events with Olympic status, but a case has been made that as many as eight other events equally deserve to be considered part of official Olympic history. About 150 archers competed in the six events that later had official status conferred. However, as many as 5,000 were involved in archery competition in conjunction with the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair. Belgian Hubert Van Innis took two gold medals and one silver and would add to his tally twenty years later in Antwerp.

=== Athletics ===
The track and field events were held at the home of the Racing Club de France at the Croix-Catelan stadium in Bois de Boulogne. No track was laid and races took place on an uneven field of grass littered with trees. Additional events were held for professionals and a series of handicap races also took place. These are not considered official Olympic events.

==== The sprints ====
In the seven events contested over 400 metres or less, the United States took 13 out of a possible 21 medals. Athletes from Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania all won gold medals. Indeed, two would-be dentists from the University of Pennsylvania were among the stars of the Games. Alvin Kraenzlein won 4 individual gold medals, a feat that has never repeated, while Walter Tewksbury took five medals including two golds. The hurdles in the 400 m hurdle race were -long telegraph poles arranged on the track and the race, uniquely in Olympic competition, had a water jump on the final straight. Adolphe Klingelhoeffer, who had Brazilian citizenship in 1900, competed for France in three events.

==== Middle- and long-distance races ====
United States dominance in sprinting was matched in the longer track races by United Kingdom. Only George Orton, who won Canada&#x27;s first Olympic title in the shorter of the two steeplechases, ruined a perfect record for the British. Orton won his title less than an hour after placing third in the 400-metre hurdles.

==== The Marathon ====

The most contentious of all the events in these Games began and ended in the Bois de Boulogne. Intended to follow the track of the old city wall, the course was poorly marked out and runners often got lost and had to double back on themselves before continuing. On some parts of the course, runners had to contend with distractions from cars, bicycles, pedestrians and animals. Arthur Newton of the United States finished fifth but stated he had not been passed by any other runner during the race. Another American, Richard Grant, claimed he was run down by a cyclist as he made ground on the leaders. French honour seemed to have been satisfied when Michel Théato crossed the finish line and a military band struck up La Marseillaise. However, modern research has revealed that Théato was born in Luxembourg and maintained Luxembourgian citizenship throughout his life.

==== Field events ====

The Hungarian discus thrower Rudolf Bauer was the only non-American crowned as Olympic Champion. American domination was even greater in the field events than the track events, with outstanding performances coming from Ray Ewry and Irving Baxter. Ewry started his Olympic career with a sweep of the three standing jumps, while Baxter finished second to Ewry three times and won both the regular high jump and pole vault. Meyer Prinstein became the first Jewish Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump.

=== Basque pelota ===
The chistera form of the game was played at this, the sport&#x27;s only appearance at full Olympic level. Two pairs entered and the Spanish partnerships of Amezola and Villota became their nations&#x27; first Olympic champions. The mano form of the game and a chistera tournament for professional players were contested unofficially.

=== Cricket ===
After the withdrawal of teams from the Netherlands and Belgium, only two teams played in the cricket tournament. A team made up of players from the Albion Cricket Club and the Standard Athletic Club, two Paris clubs consisting almost exclusively of British expatriates, played a touring team from the southwest of England. The Devon and Somerset Wanderers were no more than a team of competent club cricketers (made up from Blundells School old boys and members of Castle Cary Cricket Club), and only Montagu Toller and Alfred Bowerman were deemed good enough to play at county level for Somerset. The game was played before a small crowd at the Vélodrome de Vincennes. An emphatic second innings bowling performance from Toller captured victory for the visitors as time appeared to be running out for them. If the French had held out for five more minutes the game would have been a draw. Knowledge of the game would have been lost but for the forethought of John Symes, a member of the victorious team, who kept a scorecard in his own writing.

=== Croquet ===

The croquet tournament was notable as it marked the first appearance of women at Olympic level. Madame Desprès, Madame Filleul-Brohy and Mademoiselle Ohier were eliminated in the first round of competition. All players were French. A single paying spectator attended the tournament, an elderly English gentleman who travelled from Nice for the early stages. An unofficial two-ball handicap competition was also held. This was also the only Olympiad where croquet was part of the official programme, though there was the variant called roque at the 1904 Summer Olympics.

=== Cycling ===

The home nation won six of the nine medals available, including one that was initially awarded to Great Britain until this was reversed in 2024. A number of unofficial events were held for both amateurs and professionals.

=== Equestrian ===

Equestrian sport made its debut at the Olympic Games with three jumping events being held, plus two other events. The Italian rider Gian Giorgio Trissino won a gold and a silver. He narrowly missed making Olympic history by winning two medals in the same event. Competing with two different horses in the high jump, he jointly won the gold medal and finished in 4th place on his second horse.

=== Fencing ===
Nineteen nations were represented in the fencing competition, which was held in a field near
the cutlery exhibit at the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair. French fencers dominated the proceedings but both Cuba and Italy also took titles. The early rounds of the foil competitions were judged on style rather than the actual result of the contest. This meant that some fencers were eliminated without losing a contest while others were defeated and still progressed to the next rounds.

=== Football ===

The first football champions at the Olympics were the London amateurs of Upton Park F.C. A crowd of around 500 spectators saw them defeat their French rivals.

=== Golf ===

Margaret Ives Abbott, a student of art from Chicago, played in and won a nine-hole golf
tournament on an October Tuesday in Paris. She died in 1955 without being aware that the
tournament was part of the Olympic Games and she had become America&#x27;s first ever female
Olympic champion.

=== Gymnastics ===

135 gymnasts took part in a competition that involved elements from track and field and
weightlifting as well as gymnastic disciplines.

=== Polo ===

Eight separate tournaments were held in 1900 as part of the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair. Only the Grand Prix Internationale de l&#x27;Exposition is counted as an official medal event. Entries were from clubs rather than countries, and the winning Foxhunters club comprised English, Irish and American players.

Mexico won its first medal in this sport, a bronze won by Guillermo Hayden Wright, Marquez de Villavieja and three brothers: Eustaquio de Escandón y Barron, Pablo de Escandón y Barron and Manuel de Escandón y Barron.

=== Rowing ===

Competitions were held on the River Seine. The coxed fours event descended into disarray after the officials changed the qualifying criteria for the final several times, culminating in two finals: the first final was held without the original qualifiers, who boycotted the race to protest the decision to run six boats on a course laid out for four boats. Following this, officials decided to run another final for the boycotting crews. Both events are considered official Olympic competitions.

In a number of events, crews saw the advantage of having ultra-lightweight coxswains and recruited local boys for race days. Most of these remain a mystery; some could have been under ten years old.

=== Rugby union ===

Three teams competed in the Rugby tournament. A French representative team defeated a team from the German city of Frankfurt and Moseley Wanderers from England. The Moseley team had played a full game of rugby in England the day before they made the journey to Paris. They arrived in the morning, played the match in the afternoon and were back in their home country by the next morning. The proposed game between the British and German sides was cancelled, and both are credited as silver medalists. The Franco-Haitian centre Constantin Henriquez become the first black gold medalist.

=== Sailing ===
The 1900 sailing regatta differs from every other Olympic regatta in a number of ways.
In most classes, there were two distinct &quot;finals&quot;, boats were assigned time handicaps according to their weight within each class and cash prizes were handed out to the winner of each race. The IOC initially recognized the winner of the first race in each class as Olympic champion except in the case of the 10-20 ton class, which was decided on aggregate time over three races. However currently the participants of both first and second races in 3 classes (0-0.5t, 1-2t and 2-3t) are present in the as medalists, so the second races in these 3 classes were recognized by the IOC, as recommended by Olympic historian Bill Mallon. To support the recognition of a total of 95 medal events per Mallon&#x27;s suggestion, one more race in each of 2 other classes (0.5-1t and 3-10t) has been recognized by the IOC. Thus, for five of the eight events, two gold, two silver and two bronze medals were retrospectively awarded. Races were held at both Meulan and Le Havre and medals shared among five nations. France and Great Britain were the most successful of the countries involved. A number of people named as members of medal-winning crews by the IOC have been proved not to have competed; others have their participation seriously questioned by historical research.

=== Shooting ===

Switzerland&#x27;s Konrad Stäheli was the outstanding marksman of the Games, taking a trio of titles and leading his country to the top of the shooting medal table. The medals were shared between six different nations. There is a debate as to whether the live pigeon shooting event was a full Olympic event, Belgian Leon Lunden shot twenty-one birds on his way to the championship. Up to thirty unofficial shooting events were also held, most involving professional marksmen. Research has shown that one of the medal events in the IOC database (25m rapid fire pistol, also called military pistol cat. 6) was contested by professionals.

=== Swimming ===
The muddied waters of the Seine hosted the swimming events in 1900. Run with the current, the races produced very fast times by the standards of the day. John Arthur Jarvis of Great Britain, Frederick Lane of Australia and the German Ernst Hoppenberg each won two titles. Lane received a 50-pound bronze statue of a horse as a prize. A couple of unusual events were held. The obstacle race required both swimming underneath and climbing over rows of boats while Charles de Venville stayed submerged for over a minute to
win the underwater swimming event.

=== Tennis ===

A high-quality men&#x27;s tournament saw three past or future Wimbledon champions reach the semi-finals. Laurence Doherty reached the final when older brother Reggie stepped aside and let his sibling advance to the final. The two refused to play each other in what they considered a minor tournament. On the 11th of July a landmark was reached in the history of the Olympic Games. Charlotte Cooper, already three times Wimbledon champion, took the singles championship to become the first individual female Olympic champion, also winning the mixed doubles event.

=== Tug of war ===
A combined Sweden/Denmark team, made up of three competitors from each country, defeated the French team to win the title. One of the members of the French team was a Colombian citizen. They were left as the only participating teams; the United States had entered but were forced to scratch as three of their team were involved in the final of the hammer. Edgar Aabye was a journalist covering the Games for the Danish newspaper Politiken and was asked to join the team when another puller was taken ill.

=== Water polo ===

Osborne Swimming Club, representing Great Britain, were unchallenged in the tournament, scoring 29 goals and conceding only 3 in their 3 matches. In the final, they limited the number of shots on goal to avoid humiliating their opponents. One of its team members, Victor Lindberg, was from New Zealand, while Thomas William Burgess of the bronze medal-winning Libellule de Paris team represented Great Britain in the swimming events.

== Olympic status of sports and events ==
The 1900 Games were not governed by a specific Olympic organizing committee, but were instead held as an appendage to the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair. An enormous number of events was held, though many fall short of the standards later required for Olympic championship status.

After the several initial editions of the Olympic Games, decisions as to which Olympic events were termed &quot;official&quot; and which had &quot;unofficial&quot; or &quot;demonstration&quot; status were usually left to the Olympic organizing committees and/or the IOC. In the early Olympic Games, however, no decision as to the official status of any event was made at the time of the Games.

While a document from 1912 exists, listing results from the 1900 Games, and formed the original basis of the results of the Paris games in the IOC database, the reliability and authenticity of this paper has been questioned by Olympic historians. Further complicating matters, the IOC has never determined which events were Olympic and which were not.

All events satisfying all four of the retrospective selection criteria (restricted to amateurs, international participation, open to all competitors and without handicapping) are now regarded by historians as Olympic events, except for ballooning, while croquet, motorboating and boules satisfied three of these criteria (as only French athletes competed).

Of the three events that satisfied three criteria, only croquet has been accorded Olympic status. In this regard, one of the ten croquet players, Marcel Haëntjens, had been believed to be Belgian, and the croquet events were thus considered as international. Despite the Flemish name, it was discovered in recent times that Haëntjens was French.

Like all the Olympic events widely regarded as official, there were other events conducted during the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair:
* Angling
* Ballooning (hydrogen-filled, non-fueled)
* Baseball
* Boules
* Cannon shooting
* Fire fighting
* Kite flying
* Life saving
* Longue paume
* Military exercise
* Motor racing
* Motorcycle racing
* Pigeon racing
* Water motorsports

Scholastic and military events were also held across a range of sports. Four planned competitions were not organized due to a lack of participants: , field hockey, jeu de paume and lacrosse.

== Participating nations ==
According to the International Olympic Committee, 26 nations sent competitors to this edition. The concept of &quot;national teams&quot; chosen by National Olympic Committees did not exist at this point in time.

When counting the number of participating countries in the early Olympic Games, the IOC does not take into account otherwise unrepresented countries whose citizens competed for other countries. Modern research shows that at the 1900 Olympics, the athletes of at least four otherwise unrepresented countries competed for other countries in both individual and team sports. George Orton, gold medalist in 2500 metres steeplechase event and bronze medalist in 400 metres hurdles event, and Ronald J. MacDonald, both of Canada, competed for the U.S. athletics team. Orton ran for the University of Pennsylvania and was therefore assumed to be American, but he always considered himself a Canadian. Michel Théato, the winner of the marathon, competed for the French athletics team. He was a Luxembourger; however, this was only discovered decades later. Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría of Colombia was a silver medal-winner on the French tug of war team. Victor Lindberg of New Zealand was a gold medal-winner on the British water polo team. The IOC website lists all of them in the results section under their nationalities, but does not include their countries among the 26 participating countries.
Some sources also list athletes from the following nation as having competed at these Games: 
* – Adolphe Klingelhoeffer was the son of a Brazilian diplomat, and although he was born and raised in Paris, he had Brazilian citizenship in 1900, and maintained this citizenship until at least the 1940s per French athletics historian Alain Bouille. As this was discovered in late 2008, his participation is usually attributed to France.

Debuting nations at the games included Argentina, Belgium, Bohemia, Cuba, Haiti, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Persia, Peru, Romania, Russia and Spain.

Nations that participated in the previous games in Athens 1896 but were absent in Paris 1900 included Bulgaria and Chile.

Austria and Hungary competed as two sovereign countries. The polity known as Austria-Hungary is mistakenly considered a single sovereign country, while in reality was two sovereign states in real union with a single monarch who was titled both emperor of Austria and king of Hungary.

At the time, Bohemia was part of Austria, while Australia, Canada and India were all part of the British Empire.

Further to this, modern nations could be considered to have competed in some form in 1900, as Algeria, Croatia, Ireland, Poland and Slovakia had athletes compete, though these nations would not gain independence until many years later (Poland in 1918, the Irish Free State in 1922, Algeria in 1962, and Croatia and Slovakia in 1992).

Algeria sent four gymnasts who competed for France, while all of Ireland was considered a part of Great Britain: Irish athletes competed in athletics, polo, sailing and tennis. Further, a Polish fencer represented Russia, a Croatian fencer represented Austria, and two Slovakian athletes competed for Hungary.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees ===
The concept of &quot;national teams&quot; chosen by National Olympic Committees did not exist at this point in time.
== Medal count ==

The 1900 Olympics is unique in being the only Olympic Games to feature rectangular medals, which were designed by . Gilt silver medals were awarded for 1st place in shooting, lifesaving, automobile racing and gymnastics. Whilst 2nd place silver medals were awarded in shooting, rowing, yachting, tennis, gymnastics, sabre, fencing, equestrian and athletics. With 3rd place bronze medals being awarded in gymnastics, firefighting and shooting. In many sports, however, medals were not awarded. With most of the listed prizes were cups and other similar trophies. The International Olympic Committee has retrospectively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to all competitors who earned 1st, 2nd and 3rd-place finishes, respectively, in order to bring early Olympics in line with current awards.

For the first Olympic Games (until Antwerp in 1920), it is difficult to give the exact number of medals awarded to some countries, due to the fact that teams were composed of athletes from different countries. For Olympic Games before 1908 there is no universally accepted definition of nationality, and medal tables may vary depending on the chosen definition. For example, Australian Stanley Rowley competed as part of a team selected by the Amateur Athletic Association of England. The concept of &quot;national teams&quot; chosen by National Olympic Committees did not exist at this point in time.

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1900 Games.

== Notes ==
* At an earlier time the IOC database for the 1900 Summer Olympics listed 85 medal events, 24 participating countries and 997 athletes (22 women, 975 men). The Olympic historian and author, Bill Mallon, whose studies have shed light on the topic, suggested the number 95 events satisfying all four retrospective selection criteria (restricted to amateurs, international participation, open to all competitors and without handicapping) and now should be considered as Olympic events. In July 2021, the IOC upgraded its complete online database of all Olympic results explicitly to incorporate the data of the Olympic historians website, &quot;Olympedia.org&quot;, thus accepting Mallon&#x27;s recommendation (based on four applied criteria) for events of the 1900 Olympic Games. The eleven events, the results of which had nevertheless been shown within the earlier IOC database, have been added over the former total of 85. Оne shooting event (20 metre military pistol, which was an event for professionals) has been removed. Acceptance of Mallon&#x27;s recommendation increased the number of events to 95, and also entailed increasing the number of participation countries up to 26 and athletes up to 1226. After upgrading of the IOC online database the IOC web site results section contains 95 events. The IOC webpage for the 1900 Summer Olympics shows a total of 95 medal events, 26 participating countries and 1226 athletes. Furthermore, the IOC factsheet &quot;The Games of the Olympiad&quot; of November 2021 refers to 95 events, but still refers to old numbers of participating countries (24) and athletes (997).

<text>A melon is any of various plants of the family Cucurbitaceae with sweet, edible, and fleshy fruit. It can also specifically refer to Cucumis melo, commonly known as the &quot;true melon&quot; or simply &quot;melon&quot;. The term &quot;melon&quot; can apply to both the plant and its fruit. Botanically, a melon is a kind of berry, specifically a &quot;pepo&quot;. The word &quot;melon&quot; derives from Latin &quot;&quot;, which is the latinization of the Greek (&quot;mēlopepōn&quot;), meaning &quot;melon&quot;, itself a compound of (&quot;mēlon&quot;), &quot;apple&quot;, treefruit (&quot;of any kind&quot;)&quot; and (&quot;pepōn&quot;), amongst others &quot;a kind of gourd or melon&quot;. Many different cultivars have been produced, particularly of the true melon, such as the cantaloupe and honeydew.

==History==
Melons were thought to have originated in Africa. However, recent studies suggest a Southwest Asian origin, especially Iran and India; from there, they gradually began to appear in Europe toward the end of the Western Roman Empire. Melons are known to have been grown by the ancient Egyptians. However, recent discoveries of melon seeds dated between 1350 and 1120 BCE in Nuragic sacred wells have shown that melons were first brought to Europe by the Nuragic civilization of Sardinia during the Bronze Age. Melons were among the earliest plants to be domesticated in the Old World and among the first crop species brought by westerners to the New World. Early European settlers in the New World are recorded as growing honeydew and casaba melons as early as the 1600s. A number of Native American tribes in New Mexico, including Acoma, Cochiti, Isleta, Navajo, Santo Domingo and San Felipe, maintain a tradition of growing their own characteristic melon cultivars, derived from melons originally introduced by the Spanish. Organizations like Native Seeds/SEARCH have made an effort to collect and preserve these and other heritage seeds.

==Melons by genus==

===&quot;Benincasa&quot;===
* Winter melon (&quot;B. hispida&quot;) is the only member of the genus &quot;Benincasa&quot;. The mature winter melon is a cooking vegetable that is widely used in Asia, especially in India. The immature melons are used as a culinary fruit (e.g., to make a distinctive fruit drink).

===&quot;Citrullus&quot;===

* Egusi (&quot;C. lanatus&quot;) is a wild melon, similar in appearance to the watermelon. The flesh is inedible, but the seeds are a valuable food source in Africa. Other species that have the same culinary role, and that are also called egusi include &quot;Melothria sphaerocarpa&quot; (syn. &quot;Cucumeropsis mannii&quot;) and &quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;.
* Watermelon (&quot;C. lanatus&quot;) originated in Africa, where evidence indicates that it has been cultivated for over 4,000 years. It is a popular summer fruit in all parts of the world.

===&quot;Cucumis&quot;===

Melons in genus &quot;Cucumis&quot; are culinary fruits, and include the majority of culinary melons. All but a handful of culinary melon varieties belong to the species &quot;Cucumis melo L.&quot;
* Horned melon (&quot;C. metuliferus&quot;), a traditional food plant in Africa with distinctive spikes. Now grown in California, Chile, Australia and New Zealand as well.
* True melon (&quot;C. melo&quot;)
** &quot;C. melo cantalupensis&quot;, with skin that is rough and warty, not netted.
*** The European cantaloupe, with lightly ribbed, pale green skin, was domesticated in the 18th century, in Cantalupo in Sabina, Italy, by the pope&#x27;s gardener. It is also known as a &#x27;rockmelon&#x27; in Australia and New Zealand. Varieties include the French &quot;Charentais&quot; and the Burpee Seeds hybrid &quot;Netted Gem&quot;, introduced in the 19th century. The Yubari King is a highly prized Japanese cantaloupe cultivar.
*** The Persian melon resemble a large cantaloupe with a darker green rind and a finer netting.
** &quot;C. melo inodorus&quot;, casabas, honeydew, and Asian melons
*** Argos, a large, oblong, with orange wrinkled skin, orange flesh, strong aroma. A characteristic is its pointed ends. Growing in some areas of Greece, from which it gets its name.
*** Banana melon, an heirloom variety with salmon-colored flesh and an elongated banana shape and yellow rind
*** Canary melon, a large, bright-yellow melon with a pale green to white inner flesh.
*** Casaba, bright yellow, with a smooth, furrowed skin. Less flavorful than other melons, but keeps longer.
*** Crenshaw melon, a hybrid between a Casaba melon and a Persian melon that is described to have a very sweet flavor
*** Gaya melon, originally from Japan, a honeydew cultivar that is ivory in color and has a mild, sweet flavor
*** Hami melon, originally from Hami, Xinjiang, China. Flesh is sweet and crisp.
*** Honeydew, with a sweet, juicy, green-colored flesh. Grown as bailan melon in Lanzhou, China. There is a second variety which has yellow skin, white flesh and tastes like a moist pear.
*** Honeymoon melon, a variety of honeydew with golden rind and bright green flesh and a sweet flavor
*** Kajari melon, a sweet honeydew cultivar that is red-orange in color with green stripes reminiscent of a beach ball
*** Kolkhoznitsa melon, with smooth, yellow skin and dense, white flesh.
*** Japanese melons (including the Sprite melon).
*** Korean melon, a yellow melon with white lines running across the fruit and white inside. Can be crisp and slightly sweet or juicy when left to ripen longer.
*** Mirza melon, a large, cream-colored melon native to Central Asia with a sweet, savory flavor
*** Oriental pickling melon
*** Pixie melon, a sweet, palm-sized cantaloupe cultivar with a strange, cracked-looking netting
*** () or Santa Claus melon, a melon with a blotchy green skin and white sweet-tasting flesh.
*** Sugar melon, a smooth, white, round fruit.
*** Tiger melon, an orange, yellow and black striped melon from Turkey with a soft pulp.
** &quot;C. melo reticulatus&quot;, true muskmelons, with netted (reticulated) skin.
*** North American cantaloupe, distinct from the European cantaloupe, with the net-like skin pattern common to other &quot;C. melo reticulatus&quot; varieties.
*** Galia (or Ogen), small and very juicy with either faint green or rosy pink flesh.
*** Sharlyn melons, with taste between honeydew and cantaloupes, netted skin, greenish-orange rind, and white flesh.
** &quot;C. melo agrestis&quot;, Wilder melon cultivars, with smooth skin, and tart or bland taste. Often confused with cucumbers (Dosakai, Lemon Cucumber, Pie Melons).
** &quot;C. melo conomon&quot;, Conomon Melons, Pickling Melons, with smooth skin, and ranging from tart or bland taste (pickling melon) to mild sweetness in Korean Melon.Oriental Pickling melon, Korean Melon. Closely related to wilder melons (C Melo Var Agrestis).
** Modern crossbred varieties, e.g. Crenshaw (Casaba × Persian), Crane (Japanese × N.A. cantaloupe).

<doc id="169721" wikidata="Q2140891" url="?curid=169721" title="Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks">
<text>The September 11 attacks of 2001, in addition to being a unique act of terrorism, constituted a media event on a scale not seen since the advent of civilian global satellite links. Instant worldwide reaction and debate were made possible by round-the-clock television news organizations and by the internet. As a result, most of the events listed below were known by a large portion of the world&#x27;s population as they occurred.

The attacks themselves lasted less than two hours; the first hijacking commenced at approximately 8:14 am, and the final hijacked plane crashed at 10:03 am. All times given are in Eastern Daylight Time, (UTC−04:00).

==Major events==

7:59 a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 with registration number N334AA, carrying 76 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Hijacker and ringleader Mohamed Atta was piloting the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, with registration number N612UA carrying 56 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 9 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot Marwan al-Shehhi was piloting the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning first northwest, then south heading straight to New York.

8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with registration number N644AA with 58 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 6 crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour will pilot the plane into the West side of The Pentagon.

8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with registration number N591UA with 37 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 7 crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport), bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot is Ziad Jarrah. At this time, Flight 175 is being hijacked and Flight 11 is about to descend to New York and is 4 minutes away from crashing. 

8:42–8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above northwest New Jersey, about northwest of New York City, continuing southwest briefly before turning back to the northeast. At this time estimate, Flight 11 is about to descend over New York and is just minutes away from crashing.

8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. All passengers aboard are instantly killed with an unknown number inside the building. The aircraft enters the tower on impact.

8:50–8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast. The transponder is turned off by hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour.

9:03:02: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. All passengers and crew are killed together with an unknown number inside the building. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away. Out of the four attacks, it is the only one witnessed by a live television audience and confirms that the North Tower had been deliberately attacked.

9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast.

9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon. All 58 passengers and crew were killed aboard the aircraft, as well as an additional 125 (including emergency workers) on the ground. The crash starts a violent fire.

9:45: United States airspace is shut down by the Federal Aviation Administration; all operating aircraft are ordered to land at the nearest airport, and international flights are not permitted into the airspace.

9:57: The passengers aboard Flight 93 begin a revolt, planned by Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick, and others, moving against the hijackers in an attempt to take back the plane.

9:59:00: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175. Impact speed of the plane is considered one of the likely factors of the shorter amount of time between impact and collapse than that of the North Tower.

10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers as a result of fighting in the cockpit 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93&#x27;s target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C. but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed claims that the United States Capitol was the main target.

10:28:25: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour and 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed.

10:50:19: All five stories of the Pentagon on the West side where American 77 crashed collapse due to the fire started by the crash.

5:20:33 p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses after fires started inside the building.

==Detailed timeline of events==

===5:00 a.m.===
5:01: Ziad Jarrah in Newark calls Marwan al-Shehhi in Boston; this call was most likely to confirm the hijackers were ready to carry out the attacks.

===6:00 a.m.===
6:00: Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari travel on Colgan Air Flight 5930 from Portland International Jetport in Maine to Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts from where they will board American Airlines Flight 11.

7:15: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport and check-in for American Airlines Flight 77.

7:18: al-Mihdhar and Moqed arrive at the security checkpoint at Washington Dulles International Airport. Both set off alarms and are consequently given a more thorough search.

7:23–7:28: Al-Shehhi and his hijacking team board Flight 175.

7:59: Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston. Its destination is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California.

===8:00 a.m.===

8:00: President Bush has his daily intelligence briefing. The material is routine, mostly concerning the Al-Aqsa Intifada and other Israeli-Palestinian issues. He calls Condoleezza Rice about one item, but there is no mention in the report of Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda, nor are there any final warnings about the terrorist plot now actively in motion. The briefing lasts about twenty minutes, after which he says goodbye to the resort staff and departs in his motorcade. As the President&#x27;s scheduled event is considered a garden variety trip to promote his education agenda, accompanied by low-level aides and reporters, Chief of Staff Andrew Card remarks to him &quot;It should be an easy day.&quot;

8:01: United Airlines Flight 93 is pushed back from Gate A17 at Newark International Airport.

8:09: Flight 77 is pushed back from Gate D26 at Dulles International Airport.

8:13–8:20: Flight 11 is hijacked. Waleed and Wail al-Shehri rise from seats 2A and 2B and stab flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui. Atta rises from seat 8D and approaches the cockpit. Passenger Daniel Lewin rises from seat 9B and tries to stop Atta but is fatally stabbed by hijacker Satam al-Suqami, who sat in 10B. The hijackers also spray Mace in the first and business class cabins, forcing everyone in those sections to vacate to the back of the airplane. Flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney reports being shown a bomb by one of the hijackers.

8:13:35: Flight 11 has its last routine communication with the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA&#x27;s) Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (hereinafter &quot;Boston Center&quot;).
Boston Center: American 11, turn twenty degrees right.

American Airlines Flight 11: Turning right, American 11.
8:13:52: Boston Center Sector 46 controller Pete Zalewski instructs Flight 11 to climb to 35,000 feet twice, but receives no reply. He informs the Athens Sector controller that the flight is &quot;NORDO&quot; (no radio). Boston Center continues to attempt to re-establish contact with the flight without success.

8:14: Flight 175, another fully fueled Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, also departs from Logan International Airport in Boston; its destination is also Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. One of them, most likely al-Shehhi, communicated with Mohamed Atta shortly before American Airlines Flight 11&#x27;s takeoff.

8:19: Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11, alerts an American Airlines reservations center in Cary, North Carolina, to the hijacking via an airphone: &quot;[I&#x27;m] number 3 in the back. The cockpit is not answering, somebody&#x27;s stabbed in business class—and I think there&#x27;s Mace—that we can&#x27;t breathe—I don&#x27;t know, I think we&#x27;re getting hijacked.&quot; She then tells of the stabbings of two flight attendants.

8:20: Boston Center flight controllers decide that Flight 11 has probably been hijacked.

8:20: Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.

8:21: Flight 11&#x27;s transponder signal is turned off, but the flight can still be tracked via primary radar by Boston Center; prior to the 9/11 Commission&#x27;s report, news organizations reported this time as 8:13 or immediately thereafter.

8:24: A radio transmission comes from Flight 11: &quot;Eh... We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you&#x27;ll be okay. We are returning to the airport.&quot; It is believed that Atta mistakenly held a button directing his voice to radio rather than to the plane&#x27;s cabin as he intended. A few seconds later, a second transmission is received, in which Atta says &quot;Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you&#x27;ll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.&quot;

8:26:30: Flight 11 makes a 100-degree turn to the south, following the Hudson River toward New York City.

8:29:24: Boston Center alerts the neighboring Cleveland and New York ARTCCs regarding Flight 11. The flight&#x27;s position is estimated to be fifteen miles (24 km) southwest of Albany. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is not yet alerted.

8:33: Flight 175 reaches its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.

8:33:59: A third transmission from Atta onboard Flight 11: &quot;Nobody move, please. We are going back to the airport. Don&#x27;t try to make any stupid moves.&quot;

8:34: Boston Center traffic manager Dan Bueno notifies the tower controller at Otis Air National Guard Base at Cape Cod of the hijacking of Flight 11. The controller directs Bueno to contact Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), the northeast sector of NORAD. The controller then notifies Otis Operations Center that a call from NEADS might be coming. Two F-15 pilots begin to suit up.

8:37: Flight 175 confirms sighting of hijacked Flight 11 to flight controllers, 10 miles (16 km) to its south.

8:37:30: Flight 11 begins a rapid descent at 3,200 feet per minute, starting from an altitude of 29,000 feet. This descent continues until the moment of impact with the North Tower. Half a minute later, having descended one thousand feet, the flight makes a slight southward turn.

8:37:52: Boston Center control notifies NEADS of the hijacking of Flight 11, the first notification received by NORAD of a hijacking that morning. The controller requests military help to intercept the jetliner. As NEADS is running a training exercise at that point, it inquires as to the veracity of the request, with Boston Center responding that it is &quot;not an exercise, not a test.&quot;
8:41: The FAA&#x27;s New York Center requests information about Flight 11 over the radio. Flight 175 responds: &quot;We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston with someone, [it] sounded like someone keyed the mic and said: &#x27;everyone stay in your seats&#x27;&quot;. New York Center acknowledges and says it will pass the information on.

8:41: NEADS drives two fighter pilots at Otis Air National Guard Base to battle stations.

8:42: Flight 93, a Boeing 757, takes off with 37 passengers and seven crew members from Newark International Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport), bound for San Francisco International Airport, following a 42-minute delay due to congested runways. Four hijackers are aboard. Its flight path initially takes it close to the World Trade Center, which is within four minutes of being struck, before moving away westbound. All four planes are now in the air.

8:42–8:46 (approx.): In the skies over northern New Jersey, Flight 175 is hijacked. Most likely, two of the &quot;muscle hijackers&quot;, Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri, make the first moves, stabbing a flight attendant and then storming the cockpit, killing both pilots. Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi then order remaining passengers and crew to the back of the plane, allowing their leader, Marwan al-Shehhi, to take control. 

8:43:30: While descending at 10,000 feet, Flight 11 makes a final turn, turning south-southwestward towards New York City, aiming for the World Trade Center.

8:44–8:46: Flight attendant Amy Sweeney, aboard Flight 11, reports by telephone to Michael Woodward at the American Airlines Flight Services Office in Boston, &quot;Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent. We are all over the place.&quot; A minute later, Woodward asks her to &quot;describe what she sees out the window&quot;. She responds, &quot;I see the water. I see the buildings. I see buildings.&quot; After a short pause, she reports, &quot;We are flying low. We are flying very, very low. We are flying way too low.&quot; Seconds later she says, &quot;Oh, my God, we are way too low.&quot; The call ends with a burst of very loud, sustained static.

8:46: Flight 11 crashes almost directly midway into the North Tower&#x27;s central core at roughly , striking the center of the north face between floors 93 and 99. Hundreds are killed instantly, including everyone on the plane and untold others inside the North Tower. The impact gouges a plane-shaped hole spanning nearly the width of the skyscraper and triggers an explosion that can be seen and heard for miles. At least 166 windows are broken in the North Tower. The blast also shatters windows in the adjacent South Tower as its western and northern facades are battered by debris. Sweltering heat is felt by South Tower occupants across from the burning floors, and the smoke, blowing southeast, seeps into the building through air vents. Additionally, Flight 11&#x27;s explosion sends ignited jet fuel pouring down through various passages in the North Tower, causing fatal injuries nearly a hundred floors below when a fireball sweeps through the main lobby. Severed water pipes, collapsed walls, dislodged ceiling tiles and severed electrical wires are reported from the lobby to the 92nd floor. All three stairwells from the roof to the ground (labeled A, B and C) are clustered together in the impact region, with just of space between each one. The impact of the plane, given its size, instantly severs all three, rendering escape from the impact zone or above impossible. The 92nd floor, though technically the last floor below the impact zone, is also cut off from the rest of the tower due to the stairwells being blocked by debris from Flight 11&#x27;s impacted 93rd through 99th floors immediately above and the elevators being destroyed or inoperable from the 50th floor upward. People in the North Tower below the impact zone, as well as in the South Tower, start to evacuate.

BBC correspondent Stephen Evans was sitting in the foyer of the South Tower and described hearing a &quot;huge bang like somebody dropped a skip full of rubbish&quot; followed by &quot;two or three similar huge explosions&quot;, as the South Tower shook. French filmmaker Jules Naudet and Czech immigrant Pavel Hlava videotape the crash of Flight 11 with their video cameras from different locations. A camera belonging to local New York television station WNYW records the sound of the crash. While the impact is not shown, the camera does record the exact moment of the crash as a brief interruption of its video signal, followed by the image of the burning tower seconds afterward.
8:46:43: Chief of the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s 1st Battalion, Joseph W. Pfeifer, makes the first fire department radio message advising the FDNY Manhattan Fire Dispatch Office of the crash. Chief Pfeifer and personnel from other fire companies were several blocks north, on the corner of Church Street and Lispenard Street investigating an odor of gas in the street, and witnessed the attack, along with Jules Naudet, who was accompanying the firefighters at the time:
Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Battalion 1 to Manhattan.

Manhattan Dispatch: Battalion 1, K [go ahead].

Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): We just had a plane crash into the upper floor of the World Trade Center. Transmit a 2nd Alarm and start re-located companies into the area.

Manhattan Dispatch: 10-4 [message received], Battalion 1.
8:46:48: Two F-15 fighter jets are ordered to scramble from Otis Air National Guard Base, intended to intercept Flight 11.
Sergeant Jeremy W. Powell: This is HUNTRESS with an active air defense scramble for Panta 45, 46, time 12:46, authenticate delta x-ray. Scramble immediately, Panta 45, 46, heading 280, flight level 290, contact HUNTRESS on frequency 228.9, back-up 364.2. All parties acknowledge with initials.
Because Flight 11&#x27;s transponder is off, the pilots do not know the location of their target. When Flight 11 crashed, its track disappeared from radar. NEADS spends the next several minutes watching their radar screens in anticipation of Flight 11 returning a radar contact. However, unknown to NEADS at the time, Flight 11 has already impacted the North Tower. NEADS will not become aware of the crash at the World Trade Center until 8:50am.

8:48:08: WNYW breaks into a Paramount Pictures movie trailer for &quot;Zoolander&quot; to make the first broadcast report of an incident at the World Trade Center, less than two minutes after Flight 11&#x27;s crash. One of the station&#x27;s camera crews, already out on location at City Hall Park that morning for New York&#x27;s mayoral primary election, takes the first live pictures of black smoke coming from the North Tower. As these pictures are broadcast, the voice of reporter Dick Oliver is heard as he reports from the scene to anchor Jim Ryan, who was not in the studio at the time:
Three minutes later, Jim Ryan corrected the location of the first plane crash from the South Tower to the North Tower.

8:48:29: The first radio report of the incident is heard on WCBS-AM through traffic reporter Tom Kaminski. WCBS&#x27; traffic reports are delivered every ten minutes &quot;on the 8s&quot;, meaning that Kaminski&#x27;s traffic report was to come within two minutes of the initial impact of Flight 11 (although there is no record of how much time actually passed). At the time Kaminski was in &quot;Chopper 880&quot;, WCBS&#x27; helicopter that he reports from for morning and evening rush hour traffic reports. The following consists of WCBS anchor Pat Carroll crossing to Kaminski in the chopper before he files his report.

Pat Carroll: WCBS news time, 8:48, it&#x27;s traffic and weather together sponsored by Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre. Tom Kaminski, Chopper 880.

Tom Kaminski: Alright uh, Pat, we are just currently getting a look at the World Trade Center, We have something that has happened here at the World Trade Center. We noticed flame and an awful lot of smoke from one of the towers of the World Trade Center. We are just coming up on this scene, this is easily three-quarters of the way up. We are… This is… Whatever has occurred has just occurred, uh, within minutes and, uh, we are trying to determine exactly what that is. But currently we have a lot of smoke at the top of the towers of the World Trade Center, we will keep you posted.
8:49: The first report of an incident at the World Trade Center crosses the Associated Press newswire.

8:49:03: Local New York public radio station WNYC host Mark Hilan broadcasts that station&#x27;s first report of the incident.

8:49:34: The first network television and radio reports of an explosion or incident at the World Trade Center. CNN breaks into a Ditech commercial at 8:49. The CNN screen subtitle first reads &quot;WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER&quot;. Carol Lin, the first TV network anchor to break the news of the attacks, says:

Just a minute later, Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance, in an on-air phone call, says from his office in the CNN New York bureau that a large passenger commercial jet was seen to hit the World Trade Center. The first email bulletins of breaking news from CNN and MSNBC report &quot;fire at tower of World Trade Center&quot;. Both CNN and MSNBC&#x27;s websites receive such heavy traffic that many of their web servers fail under the strain of the vast amounts of traffic. BBC News web servers remain operational, and their website shows a picture of the North Tower on fire. Minutes later, email news bulletins revise the reports of fire to a plane crash.

8:50: NEADS is notified that a plane has struck the World Trade Center as its on-duty personnel continue to try to locate Flight 11 on radar.

8:50: FDNY 1st Battalion chief Joseph Pfeifer is the first fire chief to enter the World Trade Center after the North Tower impact. He is joined by several FDNY companies on entry as he starts setting up command in the tower.

8:50: Local New York radio station WOR news anchor Ed Walsh makes that station&#x27;s first on-air report of the incident.

8:50: WCBS-TV in New York breaks away from the CBS network to cover the attack, with anchor Mike Pomeranz providing that station&#x27;s first report.

8:50: On CNBC&#x27;s &quot;Squawk Box,&quot; host Mark Haines is interviewing a mutual fund portfolio manager, Bill Nygren of the Oakmark Select Fund, when he sees pictures of the burning North Tower. &quot;Is that the World Trade Tower?&quot; he asks. His on-air colleague Joe Kernen tells him that a plane had hit the tower. CNBC is the first NBC outlet to begin reporting on the disaster.

8:50: Local New York cable television channel NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan begins that channel&#x27;s coverage of the incident.

8:50: Local New York radio station WABC news anchor George Weber broadcasts that station&#x27;s first report of the incident.

8:50–8:54 (approx.): As it nears the border of West Virginia and Ohio, Flight 77 is hijacked. But unlike the other hijackings in which they killed members of the flight crew, the pilots of Flight 77 are sent to the back of the aircraft with all the other passengers and crew while Hani Hanjour takes the controls.

8:50:07: The traffic management units for Boston Center and New York Center state that they have both lost the primary target that they were tracking, referring to Flight 11. Roughly a minute later, New York Center passes on information supplied by Kennedy Tower about a fire at the World Trade Center.

New York Center: Kennedy Tower reports...you serious? Kennedy Tower reports that there was a fire at the World Trade Center. And that&#x27;s, ah, that&#x27;s the area where we lost the airplane.

8:50:47: Local New York television station WNBC breaks away from the NBC network to begin its coverage of the attack, with anchor Jane Hanson providing that station&#x27;s initial report.

8:51–10:28: With Flight 11 leaving more than a thousand people still alive but trapped in the top 18 floors of the now-burning North Tower, some 100–200 people plummet from the skyscraper. Most of the victims witnessed falling are left with no choice but to take their own lives by jumping to escape the heat, smoke and flames, although some of the falls are accidents caused by people losing their grip or balance. No form of airborne evacuation is attempted as smoke is too dense for a successful landing on the roof of either tower.

8:51: ABC, the first terrestrial television network to break news of the attack, was airing &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in the eastern half of the country at the time. After returning from a commercial break, WABC-TV in New York breaks away from the ABC network, with anchor Steve Bartelstein beginning that station&#x27;s own local coverage of the disaster, while on the network, &quot;GMA&quot; host Diane Sawyer makes this statement:

We want to tell you what we know, as we know it, but we just got a report in that there&#x27;s been some sort of explosion at the World Trade Center in New York City. 
One report said, and we can&#x27;t confirm any of this, that a plane may have hit one of the two towers of the World Trade Center, but again, you are seeing the live pictures here. We have no further details than that. We don&#x27;t know anything about what they have concluded happened there this morning. But we&#x27;re going to find out, and of course, make sure that everybody knows on the air.
Coverage of the incident began on the rest of the ABC network a minute later.

8:51: Matt Lauer, co-host of NBC News&#x27; &quot;Today&quot;, interrupts an interview with author Richard Hack and says to the audience, &quot;We wanna go live right now, and show you a picture of the World Trade Center, where I understand... Do we have it?&quot; However, NBC did not immediately have the picture ready and went to a regularly scheduled commercial break. They return with a shot of the burning tower.

8:51: GloboNews anchor Leila Sterenberg makes the first Brazilian television report of the first plane crash.

8:51: A flight controller at the FAA&#x27;s New York Center notices that Flight 175 had changed its transponder code twice four minutes earlier; he tries to contact the flight. Another flight in the area, Delta Air Lines flight 1489, reports the sight of smoke coming from lower Manhattan to New York Center. This is the first word any pilots in flight receive of the incident.

8:51: New York City&#x27;s Amateur Radio Emergency Service net is activated, with ham operators in the area assisting with emergency communications.

8:51:34: WINS-AM interrupts its 8:51 traffic report and anchor James Faherty relays word of the crash of Flight 11 to the listening audience, with the station having been notified by one of its employees who lives near the site.

8:52: Lee Hanson receives a phone call from his son, Peter, a passenger on United 175, who says: &quot;I think they&#x27;ve taken over the cockpit—an attendant has been stabbed—and someone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines—tell them it&#x27;s Flight 175, Boston to LA.&quot; Also on board Flight 175, a flight attendant calls a United Airlines office in Chicago, reporting that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the plane.

8:52: The F-15s at Otis Air National Guard Base are airborne. Still lacking an intercept vector to Flight 11 (and not aware that it has already crashed), they are sent to military controlled airspace off Long Island and ordered to remain in a holding pattern until between 9:09 and 9:13.

8:52: Anchor Chris Jansing makes the first announcement on MSNBC of a plane crash into the World Trade Center.

8:54: Rede Globo anchor Carlos Nascimento makes the first Brazilian terrestrial television report of the first plane crash. Minutes after, the network resumes its regular programming (children&#x27;s show &quot;Bambuluá&quot;) until starting continuous coverage of the events at 8:57.

8:55 (approx.): An announcement is made over the building-wide PA system by officials in the superficially damaged South Tower, &quot;The building is secure, please return to your desks.&quot; The South Tower&#x27;s occupants react in numerous ways, ranging from going back to their offices as suggested, ignoring it and evacuating anyway, or congregating in common areas such as the 78th floor sky lobby.

8:55: President George W. Bush arrives at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, as part of a scheduled visit to promote education and is reading &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; when White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, who is with Bush, informs him that a small twin-engine plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. Before entering the classroom, the President speaks to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who is at the White House. She first tells him it was a twin-engine aircraft—and then a commercial aircraft—that had struck the World Trade Center, adding &quot;that&#x27;s all we know right now, Mr. President.&quot;

8:56: Ten minutes after the North Tower of the World Trade Center was hit by Flight 11, the transponder on Flight 77 is turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft is lost. During radar blackout Flight 77 turns east, unnoticed by flight controllers. When primary radar information is restored at 9:05, controllers searching for Flight 77 to the west of its previous position are unable to find it. Flight 77 travels undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east toward Washington, D.C.

&quot;It&#x27;s getting bad, Dad. A stewardess was stabbed. They seem to have knives and Mace. They said they have a bomb. It&#x27;s getting very bad on the plane. Passengers are throwing up and getting sick. The plane is making jerky movements. I don&#x27;t think the pilot is flying the plane. I think we are going down. I think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building. Don&#x27;t worry, Dad. If it happens, it&#x27;ll be very fast. My God, my God.&quot;

The call ends abruptly just as Lee hears a woman scream. Shortly afterward, He witnesses the second aircraft impact the South Tower on live TV.

9:01–9:02: A manager from the FAA&#x27;s New York Center tells the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon, Virginia:

New York Center: We have several situations going on here. It&#x27;s escalating big, big time. We need to get the military involved with us.

ATCSCC: We&#x27;re, we&#x27;re involved with something else, we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on here.

Although it is uncertain whether the South Tower&#x27;s deputy fire safety director receives this order, an announcement is made over the tower&#x27;s PA system to &quot;begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted&quot;.

9:02: Air traffic controllers at New York Center watch Flight 175 as it descends rapidly to a very low altitude. During its descent, it barely avoids colliding with Tampa-bound Delta Airlines Flight 2315.

9:03: Flight 175 crashes at about 590 mph (950 km/h, 264 m/s or 513 knots) into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. The exploding jet fuel generates a massive fireball emerging from the southern, eastern and northern facades of the South Tower. East face windows on the already-burning North Tower are smashed as the shockwave from the explosion hits them. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the South Tower from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away. All 65 people on board the aircraft die instantly on impact, and unknown hundreds in the building as well. The impact causes the tower to sway at a very low frequency, described by at least one building occupant, Brian Clark, as feeling like his floor, floor 84, moved laterally by between six and eight feet, or between 1.8 and 2.4 metres. By this time, several media organizations, including the three major American broadcast television networks (which have interrupted their morning shows), are covering the immediate aftermath of the first plane crash, and so millions of viewers see the impact live. New York&#x27;s WNYW is among the first to specifically report that a second plane has crashed into the complex (many other news agencies do not realize that a second plane has crashed until several minutes later):

Jim Ryan: As you look at the picture from our chopper now, arriving at the scene, uh, Jim Friedl in Hoboken, uh, said it appeared to bank sharply and smash directly, perhaps purposefully into... Oh, my goodness. There&#x27;s another one. Oh, my goodness. There&#x27;s another one!

Lyn Brown: This seems to be on purpose.

Jim Ryan: Oh, my goodness. Now you...

Kai Simonsen (WNYW helicopter reporter): Was that a plane?

Jim Ryan: Now it&#x27;s obvious. I think that there&#x27;s a second plane just crashed into the World Trade Center. I think we have a terrorist act of proportions that we cannot begin to imagine at this juncture.

Kai Simonsen: Oh, my God.

Jim Ryan: My goodness, a second plane now has crashed into the other tower of the World Trade Center. [sigh] Obviously, suicide terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. What we have... what we have been fearing... &quot;[interrupted by unintelligible talkdown from Kai Simonsen]&quot; What we have been fearing for the longest time here apparently has come to pass. A disastrous terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Both towers, planes smashing into each one.

A massive evacuation begins in the South Tower below its impact zone. One of the stairwells in the South Tower remains unblocked from the top to the bottom of the tower because of the plane hitting at an offset from the vertical center line of the building, but it is filled with smoke. This leads many people to mistakenly go upwards towards the roof for a rooftop rescue that never comes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey kept the two sets of heavy metal doors leading to the building&#x27;s only roof exit tightly locked. The impact severs communication with several television and radio broadcast towers at the WTC; WPIX&#x27;s satellite feed freezes on a still image of the second impact which is all the station broadcasts until alternate transmitters are set up hours later. The affected television stations&#x27; terrestrial signals go off the air, however, they continue to broadcast, with their signals still receivable through local cable TV systems in the area, and WCBS-TV having backup transmitter facilities atop the Empire State Building.

Because of the North Tower&#x27;s obstruction of the South Tower from certain camera angles, some are initially unaware that a second plane has struck the South Tower, and instead mistakenly believe that the second explosion has occurred in the North Tower. As instant replays of the second plane crash are shown, the anchors on the three major broadcast networks speculate on whether they are witnessing a terrorist attack or some sort of very rare accident. CNN changes its headline to read &quot;Second plane crashes into World Trade Center.&quot; The crash occurred as CNN was taking a feed from WABC-TV, and anchor Steve Bartelstein first assumed that the explosion seen was caused when the fuselage of the first plane exploded.

9:03:18: The FAA&#x27;s New York TRACON stops all departures from airports in its jurisdiction. Ground movements at those airports are not yet stopped.

9:03: President Bush enters a classroom as part of his school visit.

9:03: FAA&#x27;s New York Center notifies NORAD (NEADS) of the hijacking of Flight 175, at the same time it crashes.

9:05: After brief introductions to the Booker elementary students, President Bush is about to begin reading &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; with the students when Chief of Staff Andrew Card interrupts to whisper to the president, &quot;A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.&quot; The president stated later that he decided to continue the lesson rather than alarm the students.

9:06: The FAA begins imposing blanket temporary flight restrictions, with the first restriction banning takeoffs of all flights bound to or through the airspace of New York Center from airports in that Center and the three adjacent Centers—Boston, Cleveland, and Washington. This is referred to as a First Tier groundstop and covers the Northeast from North Carolina north and as far west as eastern Michigan.

9:06: CNBC news anchor Alina Cho reports the evacuation of the New York Stock Exchange.

9:08: The FAA bans all takeoffs nationwide for flights going to or through New York Center airspace. ABC News reports later that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that runs the New York-area airports, asked the FAA for permission to close down the New York Center airspace.

9:11: The last PATH train leaves the World Trade Center. The station was vacant when the towers collapsed.

9:13: The F-15 fighters from Otis Air National Guard Base leave military airspace near Long Island, bound for Manhattan.

9:14: President Bush returns to an adjacent classroom commandeered by the U.S. Secret Service. The classroom contains a telephone, a television showing the news coverage, and several senior staff members. The president speaks to Vice President Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller, and prepares brief remarks.

9:15: NBC News reports unconfirmed statements from employees at United Airlines that an American Airlines aircraft had been hijacked prior to its destruction.

9:17: The FAA closes down all New York City-area airports. The city had initially asked the FAA to close down the airports.

9:19: United 93 en-route to San Francisco is over Central Pennsylvania. United Airlines flight dispatcher Ed Ballinger begins sending warning text messages to his flights: &quot;Beware any cockpit intrusion—Two a/c [aircraft] hit World Trade Center.&quot; Because he was sending this warning to his 16 transcontinental flights, this takes several minutes. His message would not be received onboard United 93 for another 4 minutes.

9:21: All bridges and tunnels into Manhattan are closed. The George Washington Bridge is however kept open to allow vehicle traffic to evacuate from Manhattan, and the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges are kept open for pedestrian evacuation. In addition, New Jersey Transit continues its train service into New York Penn Station to allow more people to evacuate the island.

9:21: Transport Canada, Canada&#x27;s transportation agency, activates its Situation Centre (SitCen) in Ottawa.

9:23: Ballinger&#x27;s warning message is sent to both Flight 93 and 175, and is received in the cockpit of Flight 93 a minute later.

9:24-9:38 (approximately): Three people either try to climb down or fall from a 79th floor window, 79-351, on the southern end of the South Tower&#x27;s east face close to the southeast corner. Firefighter Danny Suhr is preparing to enter the Tower when he&#x27;s struck by a jumper, Both of them are killed instantly. Besides these three individuals, nobody else is seen falling from the South Tower that day―an obvious dissimilarity from the situation in the North Tower, where more than a hundred people continuously fell to their deaths for nearly the entire time it burned.

9:24: The FAA notifies NORAD (NEADS) about the suspected hijacking of Flight 77. The FAA and NORAD establish an open line to discuss Flight 77, and shortly thereafter Flight 93.

9:25: ABC News correspondent John Nance mentions the possibility of the plane that hit the South Tower being a Boeing 767, among other types of planes.

9:25: The Otis-based F-15s establish an air patrol over Manhattan.

9:25: A video teleconference begins to be set up in the White House Situation Room, led by Richard A. Clarke, a special assistant to the president, that eventually includes the CIA, the FBI, the departments of State, Justice, and Defense, and the FAA.

9:25: The Associated Press informs CNN that the two plane crashes in the World Trade Center appeared to be an &quot;act of terrorism&quot;.

9:26: The FAA bans takeoffs of all civilian aircraft regardless of destination—a national groundstop.

9:26: White House counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke indicates he gave the instruction to raise the worldwide force protection condition for U.S military bases at around this time. This is likely the earliest instance this actual order was issued. Other evidence suggests the threat condition increase took place in steps, with the next step occurring sometime over the next hour. See link 

9:26: Flight 93&#x27;s pilot, Jason Dahl, replies to Ballinger&#x27;s text message, &quot;Ed, confirm latest mesg plz – Jason&quot;.

9:26: NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reports to MSNBC anchor Lester Holt that a top U.S. government official informed her that one of the two planes that hit the Twin Towers was an American Airlines plane from Boston to Los Angeles that was hijacked.

9:28:05: Flight 93 suddenly begins to descend as hijackers storm the cockpit and take over the flight. The entry of the hijackers is overheard by flight controllers at Cleveland. The flight descends roughly 700 feet before the autopilot corrects the altitude.

9:29: The FDNY&#x27;s Citywide Tour Commander issues a total recall of the Department, ordering all off-duty firefighters in New York City to report to their fire stations.
9:29: President Bush makes his first public statements about the attacks, in front of an audience of about 200 teachers and students at the elementary school. He states that he will be going back to Washington. &quot;Today, we&#x27;ve had a national tragedy,&quot; he starts. &quot;Two airplanes… have crashed… into the World Trade Center… in an apparent terrorist attack on our country,&quot; and leads a moment of silence. No one in the President&#x27;s traveling party has any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing.

9:30: Reuters reports that a plane was hijacked from Boston.

9:30: In the North Tower, six men escape express elevator Car 69-A. The elevator, which had been designed to traverse much of the building to reach the upper floors more quickly, had gotten stuck at the 50th Floor when Flight 11 hit the tower. With no exit at this floor, window cleaner Jan Demczur used his squeegee to attempt to cut a hole in the Sheetrock lining the elevator shaft. When the squeegee’s blade broke off and fell down the elevator shaft, he and the other five people in the elevator alternately used the handle to scrape away at the lining, eventually cutting a hole large enough for them to escape into an adjacent bathroom. They are found by firefighters, who immediately escort them to a stairwell. All six safely leave the tower five minutes before it collapses.

9:31: On C-SPAN, Washington Journal host Steve Scully starts that channel&#x27;s coverage of the morning&#x27;s incidents.

9:33–9:34: A tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport tells Secret Service operations center at the White House that &quot;an aircraft is coming at you and not talking with us,&quot; referring to Flight 77. The White House is about to be evacuated when the tower reports that Flight 77 has turned and is approaching Reagan National Airport.

9:34: The FAA&#x27;s Command Center relays information concerning Flight 93 to FAA headquarters.

9:35: The President&#x27;s motorcade departs from the elementary school, bound for Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport and Air Force One.

9:35: Flight 93 reverses direction over northeast Ohio and starts flying eastwards.

9:35: Based on a report that Flight 77 had turned again and was circling back toward the District of Columbia, the Secret Service orders the immediate evacuation of the Vice President from the White House.

9:36: Cleveland advises the FAA Command Center that it is still tracking Flight 93 and inquires whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft.

9:37: Vice President Cheney enters a tunnel leading to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, located under the White House East Wing.

9:37: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of the Pentagon at 530 mph (853 km/h, 237 m/s, or 460 knots) and its jet fuel starts a violent fire. The section of the Pentagon hit consists mainly of newly renovated, unoccupied offices. All 64 people on board are killed, as are 125 Pentagon personnel.

9:39: Another radio transmission is heard from Ziad Jarrah aboard Flight 93: &quot;Uh, this is the captain. I would like you all to remain seated. We have a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands, so please remain quiet.&quot;

9:39:12: NBC News Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski reports that &quot;it felt, just a few moments ago, like there was an explosion of some kind here at the Pentagon.&quot; NBC and MSNBC relay reports of the explosion but do not relay word of the crash of Flight 77 as they do not know the cause.

9:40: Video teleconference in White House Situation Room begins with the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. They are not yet aware of the Pentagon crash.

9:40:49: CNN&#x27;s Breaking News bulletin reads &quot;Reports of fire at Pentagon.&quot;

9:41: Local Washington, DC television station WUSA breaks away from the CBS network, with anchor Andrea Roane beginning that station&#x27;s local coverage of the explosion at The Pentagon.

9:41:15: The photograph &quot;The Falling Man&quot; is taken.

9:42: ABC News broadcasts its first pictures from Washington, D.C. of heavy smoke, from a perspective on the other side of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is situated a block west of the White House. Peter Jennings confirms a fire at The Pentagon two minutes later.

9:42: The main CBS network reports an explosion at the Pentagon.

9:42: Senior FAA traffic manager Ben Sliney issues the execution order for SCATANA grounding all air traffic over the United States and diverting any incoming international traffic to alternate destinations.

9:43: Abu Dhabi TV reports it received a call from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claiming responsibility for the World Trade Center attack, but this is soon denied by a senior officer of the group.

9:43: The White House and the Capitol are evacuated and closed.

9:45: United States airspace is shut down. No civilian aircraft are allowed to take off, and all aircraft in flight are ordered to land at the nearest airport as soon as possible. Nearly all international flights headed for the U.S. are redirected to Canada, while some flights from South America are diverted to Mexico. Transport Canada orders a complete closedown of Canadian airspace, but the Mexican airspace did not shut down. The FAA announces that civilian flights are suspended until at least noon September 12, while Transport Canada gives similar orders; the FAA further ordered that diverted U.S.-bound international flights should be taken in, launching the agency&#x27;s &quot;Operation Yellow Ribbon&quot;, with CFB Goose Bay being the first Canadian air facility to receive airliners originally bound for the U.S. Other airports across Canada received varying numbers of airliners; Gander International Airport in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador hosted 38 planes, consisting of 6,122 passengers and 473 crew, the second largest number out of any Canadian airport other than Halifax. The groundings would eventually last until September 14. Military and medical flights as well as Con Air flights continue. This is the fourth time all commercial flights in the U.S. have been stopped, and the first time a suspension was unplanned. All previous suspensions were military-related (Sky Shield I-III), from 1960 to 1962. Many newspapers (including &quot;The New York Times&quot;) mistakenly print that this is the first time flights have been suspended. This was, however, the first time commercial flights in Canada were stopped. 

9:45: CNN receives initial reports that, in addition to a fire at the Pentagon, there is also a fire at the National Mall. These reports on the National Mall, however, are later proven to be false.

9:46: A message is sent to Flight 93 from San Francisco, &quot;PLZ CONFIRM ALL IS NML... THX&quot;

9:46:36: The ARD news magazine &quot;Tagesthemen&quot;, hosted by Ulrich Wickert, broadcasts news of the attacks to Germany.

9:49: The FAA Command Center at Herndon suggests that someone at FAA headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance with Flight 93. Ultimately, the FAA makes no request before it crashes.

9:50 (approximately): The Associated Press reports that Flight 11 was apparently hijacked after departure from Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport. Within an hour this is confirmed for both Flight 11 and Flight 175.

9:51: Chief Orio Palmer of the FDNY&#x27;s 7th Battalion reaches the 78th Floor Sky Lobby of the South Tower along with Fire Marshal Ronald Bucca. Palmer reports that there are two pockets of fire and numerous dead bodies.

9:52: The National Security Agency intercepts a phone call between a known associate of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and someone in the Republic of Georgia, announcing that he had heard &quot;good news&quot;, and that another target was still to be hit.

9:53: CNN confirms a plane crash at the Pentagon.

9:55: A CNN correspondent mentions Osama bin Laden as someone determined to strike the US.

9:55: Air Force One leaves Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport.

9:57: Passenger revolt begins on Flight 93.

9:57: President Bush leaves Sarasota, Florida, on Air Force One. The plane reaches cruising altitude and circles for approximately 40 minutes while the destination of the plane is discussed.

9:59: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175. Its destruction is viewed and heard by a vast television and radio audience. As the roar of the collapse goes silent, tremendous gray-white clouds of pulverized concrete and gypsum rush through the streets. Most observers think a new explosion or impact has produced smoke and debris that now obscures the South Tower, but once the wind clears the smoke, it becomes clear that the building is no longer standing. No one who is still inside the South Tower at the time of its collapse survives. NY1 correspondent Kristen Shaughnessy, on the scene of the disaster, reports on the collapse of the South Tower at the instant it begins, while ABC News correspondent Don Dahler, who was home at the time of the incident and lived near the site, reports to anchor Peter Jennings on air that he has witnessed the tower collapse; Dahler&#x27;s report is perhaps the first broadcast specific confirmation of a collapse as his report is filed seconds after the event.

9:59: As the South Tower collapses, Father Mychal Judge, OFM, chaplain to the FDNY, is struck by falling debris on the lobby level of the North Tower. He dies of blunt force trauma to the head. He is found by Chief Pfeifer, Jules Naudet, and others from the North Tower Command Post who fled when they heard the South Tower collapse and took refuge in the nearby escalator as the debris cloud engulfed them. As Judge&#x27;s body is the first recovered and certified by the medical examiner&#x27;s office, he will be designated &quot;Victim 0001&quot; of the September 11 attacks.

===10:00 a.m.===
10:00: FDNY Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer (inside of the still standing North Tower) orders all FDNY personnel to evacuate, via radio.

Battalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Command post, Tower 1, all units. Evacuate the building. Command post, to all units.

Due to many communication limitations, numerous firefighters within the tower do not receive this transmission. Some personnel who do not hear the order only leave the building after being told by other firefighters that an evacuation order has been given. Others never receive the order at all.

10:01: The FAA Command Center advises FAA headquarters that an aircraft had seen Flight 93 &quot;waving his wings,&quot; the hijackers&#x27; efforts to defeat the passengers&#x27; counterattack.

10:02: Communicators with the Vice President in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center begin receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft—presumably hijacked—heading toward Washington. This is Flight 93.

10:02: CNN announces that the Sears Tower in Chicago has been evacuated.

10:03 (approximately): The National Military Command Center learns from the White House of Flight 93&#x27;s hijacking.

10:03: Flight 93 crashes at 583 mph (926 km/h, 272 m/s, or 509 knots), 80 miles (129 km) southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, concluding the attacks. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes on cell phones and at least three were planning on resisting the hijackers; the resistance was confirmed by Flight 93&#x27;s cockpit voice recording, on which the hijackers are heard making their decision to down the plane before the passengers succeed in breaching the cockpit door. The terrorists are believed to have been aiming for the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building, both of which had been evacuated 18 minutes before Flight 93 went down. The flight was still at least 10 minutes away from D.C. at the time of its crash, and probably closer to 20.

10:05: Andrea Mitchell, reporting for NBC from outside the Pentagon, reports that Osama bin Laden may have been involved in the attacks.

10:05: CNN&#x27;s headlines read: &quot;SOUTH TOWER AT WTC COLLAPSES.&quot;

10:05: The IDS Center in Minneapolis is evacuated.

10:07: NBC reports for the first time that the South Tower of the World Trade Center has collapsed. Prior to this time they have said only that a section of the building has fallen away.

10:07: NEADS, controlling the only set of fighters over Washington, first learns of the hijacking of Flight 93, 4 minutes after it actually crashed.

10:08: Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon reports to FAA headquarters that Flight 93 may be down near Johnstown, Pennsylvania; at 10:17 the Command Center concludes it is so.

10:10: British Prime Minister Tony Blair makes his first comments on the attacks at a meeting of the Trades Union Congress in Brighton, calling the attacks &quot;the new evil in our world today&quot;.

10:10: National Military Command Center directs Threat Condition Delta for U.S. military bases worldwide.

10:10: Part of the west side of the Pentagon collapses.

10:10: NEADS emphatically tells fighter pilots over Washington, &quot;Negative clearance to shoot.&quot; [i.e. they were not authorized to shoot.]

10:10–10:15 (approximately): Vice President Cheney, unaware that Flight 93 has crashed, authorizes fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane, reported to be 80 miles (129 km) from Washington, based not on radar (from which it has disappeared) but speed and trajectory projections.

10:13: Thousands are involved in an evacuation of the United Nations complex in New York.

10:13–10:22: The 9/11 Commission&#x27;s estimated arrival of Flight 93 over Washington had it not crashed in Pennsylvania.

10:14–10:19: A lieutenant colonel at the White House repeatedly relays to the NMCC that the Vice President has confirmed that fighters are cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they can verify that the aircraft was hijacked.

10:15: CNN&#x27;s headline reads, &quot;EXPLOSION ON CAPITOL HILL.&quot;

10:18: NBC reports that Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), has denied complicity in the attacks and is appalled by them.

10:20: President Bush, aboard Air Force One, tells Vice President Cheney that he has authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.

10:23: The Associated Press reports a car bomb has exploded outside the State Department in Washington, D.C. This and several other reports of terrorist acts in the capital are quickly found to be false.

10:24: Two men who were being evacuated through the underground shopping mall below the South Tower when it collapsed on them are able to climb up through thirty feet of debris to safety. 1010 WINS in New York City reports an explosion at the U.S. Supreme Court building. This is later revealed to be erroneous.

10:28: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses. Due to the destruction of the gypsum-encased stairwells on the impact floors (most skyscraper stairwells are encased in reinforced concrete), no one who was above the 91st floor in the North Tower escapes the collapse. Unlike the South Tower&#x27;s collapse, which killed everyone still inside the building, 16 individuals who were inside the collapsing North Tower survived and would later be rescued. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed. The second collapse is also viewed live on television and heard on radio. The North Tower collapses 1 hour and 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11—the building had continued burning even after the attacks ended with the crash of Flight 93. The cascade of debris from that collapse gouges out a portion of the south side of 7 World Trade Center and sets the bottom of the building on fire. New York City&#x27;s 1010 WINS reports the collapse live as it happens, broadcasting a live phone call with WINS news director Ben Mevorach, who witnessed the collapse from the Manhattan Bridge. On NBC News, Katie Couric says: &quot;The other tower of the World Trade Center has just collapsed.&quot;

Several long-distance videos of the collapse, such as CNN, were able to notice that, after the cloud of dust had partially cleared away, a portion of the building was still standing. It appeared to be the lower half of the northwest corner column of the North Tower, which, like a spire, grew larger and had more structure still standing near the bottom. The portion rose to a fairly good height considering the collapse around it, as it appeared to rise nearly forty stories off the ground. This piece remained standing for a few seconds after the initial collapse before it also came down. The debris cloud from the North Tower&#x27;s collapse is also significantly larger and more far-reaching than that of the South Tower&#x27;s, due to dust from that collapse being kicked up as the North Tower fell.

10:31: NORAD first communicates the Vice President&#x27;s shootdown authority to NEADS.

10:35: Air Force One, carrying the President, turns for Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana.

10:37: Associated Press reports that officials at the Somerset County Airport confirm that a large plane has crashed in western Pennsylvania. CNN&#x27;s Aaron Brown passes along reports that a 747 is &quot;down&quot; in Pennsylvania. He stresses these reports are unconfirmed. He also, in the confusion, reports another plane heading for the Pentagon. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is evacuated and closed. New York City&#x27;s 1010 WINS relays a report that the U.S. State Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. has been attacked by a car bomb. This is later reported to be false.

10:39: Another hijacked airliner is claimed to be headed for Washington, D.C. F-15s are scrambled and patrol the airspace above Washington, D.C. while other fighter jets sweep the airspace above New York City. They have orders, first issued by Vice President Cheney and later confirmed by President Bush, to shoot down any potentially dangerous planes that do not comply with orders given to them via radio. Eventually, the aircraft is revealed to be a medevac helicopter on its way to the Pentagon.

10:41: NBC News confirms that a plane has &quot;gone down&quot; in Somerset County. The earlier unconfirmed statements about an incident at the State Department in Washington, D.C. are reported as false.

10:43: CNN reports that a mass evacuation of Washington, D.C., and New York has been started. A few minutes later, New York mayor Rudy Giuliani orders an evacuation of Lower Manhattan.

10:49: Fox News is the first of the United States news networks to implement a news ticker at the bottom of its screen for supplementary information about the attacks. CNN adds one at 11:11, and MSNBC adds one at approximately 2:00 p.m. All three cable networks have used a news ticker continuously in the years since, and many local television stations have followed suit.

10:50:19: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire.

10:53: New York City&#x27;s primary elections are canceled.

===1:00 p.m.===

1:00 (approximately): Jets are scrambled from Elmendorf Air Force Base to shadow Flight 85.

1:04: President Bush puts the U.S. military on high alert worldwide (known as &quot;Force Protection Condition Delta&quot;). Taped remarks from the President were aired from Barksdale Air Force Base, stating that &quot;freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended.&quot; He also said that the &quot;United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts.&quot; He then leaves for a U.S. Strategic Command bunker located at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska.

1:24: ATC instructs Flight 85 to change its transponder code to 7500, the universal signal for hijack, expecting that, if they had not been hijacked, the pilots would respond to that effect. Instead, they simply comply with the instruction, which ATC takes as confirmation that the flight has indeed been hijacked.

1:27: Mayor Anthony A. Williams of Washington, D.C., declares a state of emergency; the District of Columbia National Guard arrives on site.

===2:00 p.m.===

2:39: At a press conference New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is asked to estimate the number of casualties at the World Trade Center. He replies, &quot;More than any of us can bear.&quot;

2:54: Flight 85 lands safely in Whitehorse. On the tarmac, Flight 85 was greeted by armed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers who, after interrogating the pilots, learned the whole ordeal was caused by a translation error.

===3:00 p.m.===
3:00 (approx.): Pasquale Buzzelli, who lost consciousness in a North Tower stairway during the collapse, awakens to find himself lying atop the debris with only a fractured foot.

===5:00 p.m.===

5:20:27: The east penthouse on top of 7 World Trade Center crumbles apart.

The building contained New York&#x27;s emergency operations center, operated by the NYC Office of Emergency Management, originally intended to respond to disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks. Due to the emergency personnel having more than enough time to evacuate the building since the collapse of the North Tower, there are no injuries or deaths as a result of the collapse.

===6:00 p.m.===
6:00: Explosions and tracer fire are reported in Kabul, Afghanistan by CNN and the BBC (early hours of September 12 local time). The Northern Alliance, involved in a civil war with the Taliban government, is later reported to have attacked Kabul&#x27;s airport with helicopter gunships.

6:00: The last of the aircraft headed for the U.S. lands in Canada at Vancouver International Airport, since it was flying over the Pacific.

6:54: U.S. President George W. Bush arrives at the White House in Washington, D.C.

===7:00 p.m.===

7:00: Efforts to locate survivors in the rubble that had been the twin towers continue. Fleets of ambulances are lined up to transport the injured to nearby hospitals, but they stand empty. &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, as the site of the WTC collapse becomes known henceforth, is the exclusive domain of New York City&#x27;s Fire Department and Police Department, despite volunteer steel and construction workers who stand ready to move large quantities of debris quickly. Relatives and friends of victims or likely victims, many displaying enlarged photographs of the missing printed on home computer printers, have appeared around New York. The New York Armory at Lexington Avenue and 26th Street and Union Square Park at 14th Street and Broadway become centers of vigil.

7:24: Members of Congress join on the steps of the United States Capitol and sing &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

8:30: U.S. President George W. Bush addresses the country from the White House in Washington, D.C. Among his statements:

As Bush speaks, members of Congress tell CNN that during private briefings with senior administration officials, they were told that the administration had enough evidence that it was &quot;confident&quot; the attacks are the work of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda terrorist network.

===9:00 p.m.===
9:00: President Bush meets his full National Security Council, followed roughly half an hour later by a meeting with a smaller group of key advisers. Bush and his advisers have evidence that Osama bin Laden is behind the attacks. Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet says that al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan are essentially one and the same. Bush says, &quot;Tell the Taliban we&#x27;re finished with them.&quot;

===10:00 p.m.===
10:00: There are reports (later proven incorrect) of many survivors buried in rubble in New York making cell phone calls. Only two more survivors will be pulled from the rubble on September 12 and neither of them had made cell phone calls.

===11:00 p.m.===
11:00: After 13 hours, the NYPD, FDNY and PAPD finally dig out Will Jimeno. They learn that Port Authority police sergeant John McLoughlin is also trapped. The NYPD, FDNY and PAPD will eventually dig him out at 8:00 a.m. the next morning after he has been there for almost a day.

11:30: Before retiring to bed, President Bush enters into his journal: &quot;The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today...We think it&#x27;s Osama bin Laden.&quot;

11:50: Footage of Flight 11 impacting the North Tower is aired for the first time. On CNN, Wolf Blitzer interrupts a conversation with NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly to show Jules Naudet&#x27;s footage of the impact.

The fight is watched live by well over 100 million and perhaps as many as one billion viewers worldwide including the 500,000 on HBO and 100 million viewers watching on closed-circuit theatre television.

*October 21 – NBC broadcasts the now legendary 12-inning long sixth game of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds. The game ends with Boston catcher Carlton Fisk&#x27;s home run to send the series to a climatic seventh game. In what becomes an iconic baseball film highlight, the NBC left-field game camera catches Fisk wildly waving his arms to his right after hitting the ball and watching its path while drifting down the first base line, as if he is trying to coax the ball to &quot;stay fair&quot;. The ball indeed stays fair and the Red Sox tie the Series. (According to the NBC cameraman Lou Gerard, located inside the left field wall scoreboard, cameramen at this time are instructed to follow the flight of the ball. Instead, Gerard is distracted by a rat nearby, thus he loses track of the baseball and instead decides to capture the image of Fisk &quot;magically&quot; waving the ball fair). The game is ranked Number 1 in MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;20 Greatest Games&quot;. 
*October 25 – The classic &quot;Chuckles Bites the Dust&quot; episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; airs on CBS

*November 10 – &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; on CBS changes its name to &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, in an attempt to modernize the show&#x27;s image (The show&#x27;s announcer, however, continues to call the series &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; in his announcements until the early 1980s)
*November 23 – Memories of the &quot;&quot;Heidi&quot; Game&quot; return to haunt NBC as that network is forced to join &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; in progress at the conclusion of an overtime NFL game
*December 1 – Top-rated &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, bowing to competition from NBC, expands to one hour in length; &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; moves to ABC

<doc id="169728" wikidata="Q730463" url="?curid=169728" title="Ale Yarok">
<text>Ale Yarok (), is a liberal political party in Israel best known for its ideology of legalizing cannabis. To date, it has had no representation in the Knesset. Ale Yarok has not yet met the electoral threshold for inclusion in any of the elections that they have contested.

== History ==
Established in 1999 by Boaz Wachtel, Shlomi Sandak, and Rafik Kimchi, the party gained 1% of the vote in the elections that year, and 1.2% in the 2003 elections, but both times failed to pass the 1.5% threshold for representation in the Knesset. After these elections and despite the strong results in the 2003 elections, the chairman of Ale Yarok, Boaz Wachtel announced that he was giving up the leadership of the party, but remained in the position due to party members requests.

Before the 2006 elections the party announced that it intended to run for a third time, despite the threshold for representation having been raised to 2%. The party competed for votes with the supporters of the Democratic Choice (which later stepped down from running in the election) and with Meretz-Yachad, which had also promised to act for the decriminalization of soft drugs; another competitor was the Green Party with a strong ecological platform. The party gained 1.3% of the vote, and came second among those parties failing to make the threshold. After the election, Wachtel passed the chairmanship to Ohad Shem-Tov.

Before the 2009 elections, Shem-Tov was expelled from the party by Shlomi Sandak who was the temporary chairman of the Green Leaf Party. Internal disputes led the party to split with Shem-Tov forming the Ale Yarok Alumni group. The Alumni party later allied with the Holocaust Survivors party to contest the 2009 Knesset elections. In this elections Ale Yarok was led by Israeli comedian Gil Kopatch.

For the 2013 elections, the party presented a broad liberal platform and ran with some members of the &quot;New Liberal Movement&quot; (an Israeli libertarian nonpartisan organization, also known as the Israeli Freedom Movement), under the name &quot;Ale Yarok-The Liberal list&quot;.

Oren Lebovitch has been the chairman of the party since December 2014. Lebovitch, the editor-in-chief of the Israeli Cannabis Magazine, lead the party to its highest number of voters on the March 2015 election.

== Ideology ==
The party&#x27;s current platform is based on the legalization of the cannabis plant, marijuana and hashish, expansion of human rights, free market and institutionalization of prostitution and gambling. In official publications the movement claims that &quot;the partition between right-wing and left-wing is anachronistic&quot;; it believes that any proposed solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be put on referendum in order to be legitimate. It takes a left-wing stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

<doc id="169729" wikidata="Q123679" url="?curid=169729" title="Abraham-Louis Breguet">
<text>Abraham-Louis Breguet (; 10 January 1747 – 17 September 1823), born in Neuchâtel, then a Prussian principality, was a Swiss-French horologist who made many innovations in the course of a career in watchmaking industry, including the tourbillon. He was the founder of the Breguet company, which is now a luxury watch division of the Swiss Swatch Group.

In his lifetime he was considered the leading watchmaker of his day, and he built up a clientele that included many leading public figures and members of the European nobility.
Alongside his friend and contemporary John Arnold, Breguet is now widely acknowledged as one of the greatest horologists of all time. One of his famous ancestors was Jean Breguet (who died in 1593) a Protestant pastor in Neuchâtel very much influenced by the ideas of John Calvin.

== Life ==
Breguet was born in Neuchâtel to Jonas-Louis Breguet and Suzanne-Marguerite Bolle. Breguet&#x27;s father died in 1758 when he was ten, and his formal schooling ended when he was 12. Breguet&#x27;s mother remarried Joseph Tattet, who came from a family of watchmakers. Tattet had a showroom in Paris; the family tried for some time to entice the young Breguet into the trade, to no avail, but he eventually took to it with great interest and in 1762, aged 15, he was sent to be apprenticed to an unknown Versailles master-watchmaker. At this time the Court had a great influence on the trade and the best watchmakers established themselves around Versailles.

The young Breguet soon &quot;astonished&quot; his master with his aptitude and intelligence, and to further his education he took evening classes in mathematics at the Collège Mazarin under Abbé Marie, who became a friend and mentor to the young watchmaker. Through his role as tutor to the dukes of Angoulême and de Berri, Abbé Marie was able to arrange for Breguet to be introduced to King Louis XVI of France, and the king&#x27;s interest in mechanics led to many royal commissions for the rising watchmaker, including a &quot;perpetuelle&quot; (self-winding watch), with which the king was especially pleased. Unfortunately, Marie met a tragic end, either through murder or suicide, and soon after Breguet lost both his mother and his step-father, leaving him to support himself and his younger sister. How he managed this in the period between his parents&#x27; deaths and the establishment of his business is unknown.

Breguet was allowed to marry in 1775 after finishing his apprenticeship. He and his bride, Cécile Marie-Louise L&#x27;Huillier, set up their home and the Breguet watchmaking company; its first known address was at 51, quai de l&#x27;Horloge in the Île de la Cité in Paris (by the 1920s this location was designated as #39). Ca. 1812 the firm&#x27;s address was 79, quai de l&#x27;Horloge du Palais, although Salomons speculated that this might have been merely a change of number and name, not of the actual location. By the year of Breguet&#x27;s death in 1823, the firm also had a shop at 4, place de la Bourse, which is known because both addresses appear on the label of watch #4004. The firm later moved to Rue de la Paix and in the early 20th century to 2, rue Édouard-VII.

Breguet invented or developed innovative escapements, including the tourbillon, automatic winding mechanisms, and the overcoil (an improvement of the balance spring with a raised outer coil). Within ten years Breguet had commissions from the aristocratic families of France and even the French queen, Marie Antoinette. Cécile died in 1780. He met Abraham-Louis Perrelet in Switzerland and became a Master Clockmaker in 1784. In 1787 Abraham-Louis established a partnership with Xavier Gide, which lasted until 1791.

Ca. 1792 the Duke of Orléans went to England and met John Arnold, Europe&#x27;s leading watch and clockmaker. The Duke showed Arnold a clock made by Breguet, who was so impressed that he immediately travelled to Paris and asked Breguet to accept his son as an apprentice.

As Breguet&#x27;s fame gradually increased he became friendly with revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat, who also hailed from Neuchâtel. Salomons&#x27; biography records that Marat and Breguet were at the house of a mutual friend one day when an angry crowd gathered outside, shouting &quot;Down with Marat!&quot;, but Breguet contrived their escape by disguising Marat as an old woman, and they left the house arm in arm, unmolested. In 1793 Marat discovered that Breguet was marked for the guillotine, possibly because of his friendship with Abbé Marie (and/or his association with the royal court); in return for his own earlier rescue, Marat arranged for a safe-pass that enabled Breguet to escape to Switzerland, from where he travelled to England. He remained there for two years, during which time he worked for King George III. When the political scene in France stabilised, Breguet returned to Paris.

In 1795 Breguet returned to Paris with many ideas for innovations in watch and clock making. He set up business again in Quai de l&#x27;Horloge and quickly established a reputation among the new wealthy classes in the Empire. Breguet did not staff his workshops in the traditional way, with unskilled apprentices, but instead sought out the finest available watchmakers in Paris, whom he employed to make watches to his own designs.
At the 1798 Exposition des produits de l&#x27;industrie française Breguet was given an honorable distinction, the highest award, for &quot;a free escapement with constant force, applicable to the improvement of both astronomical clocks and longitude clocks. This clock has the very singular effect of resetting the time in a watch.&quot;
Circa 1807 Breguet brought in his son, Antoine-Louis (born 1776) as a business partner, and from this point, the firm became known as Breguet et Fils. Breguet had previously sent his son to London to study with the great English chronometer maker, John Arnold, and such was the mutual friendship and respect between the two men that Arnold, in turn, sent his son, John Roger, to spend time with Breguet. Breguet met another watchmaker Louis Moinet, recognised his worth at once, and the two men worked closely together. From 1811 on, Moinet became Breguet&#x27;s personal adviser.

Breguet became a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1814 and the following year gained an official appointment as chronometer-maker to the French Navy. He entered the French Academy of Sciences in 1816 as a full member, and received the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour from the hands of Louis XVIII in 1819. In 1822 the future engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then aged sixteen, studied for some months with Breguet in Paris. Brunel had a French father so he spoke perfect French.

According to Salomons&#x27; biography, Breguet was known for his kindness and good humour. It is recorded that if a workman came to Breguet with a finished piece of work and an invoice for payment, and Breguet was satisfied with the work, then if the invoice ended in a zero, Breguet would add a tail to the zero to make it a &#x27;9&#x27;, thereby enabling the workman to be paid nine francs more than he had asked for. He was also known for his encouragement of his young apprentices, often advising them &quot;Do not be discouraged, or allow failure to dishearten you.&quot;

The business grew from strength to strength, and when Abraham-Louis Breguet died in 1823 it was carried on by Antoine-Louis. After Antoine-Louis retired in 1833 (he died in 1858) the business continued under Abraham-Louis&#x27; grandson Louis François Clément Breguet (1804–1883); his great-grandson Louis Antoine (1851–1882) was the last of the Breguet family to run the business. Although he had two sons and a daughter, they did not enter the business, so he took on noted English watchmaker Edward Brown of Clerkenwell to look after the Paris factory. Brown eventually became his partner and, after Breguet&#x27;s death, the owner and head of the company. His sons Edward and Henry Brown headed the firm into the 20th century and after Edward retired in the early 1900s, Henry became the sole proprietor.

== Works and influence ==

Breguet made three series of watches, and the highest numbering of the three reached 5120, so in all, it is estimated that the firm produced around 17,000 timepieces during Breguet&#x27;s life. Because of his minute attention to detail and his constant experimentation, no two Breguet pieces are exactly alike. Following his introduction to the court, Queen Marie-Antoinette developed a fascination for Breguet&#x27;s unique self-winding watch and Louis XVI of France bought several pieces. His achievements soon attracted a wealthy and influential clientele that comprised a veritable &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; of the period: Louis XVI and his Queen Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon Bonaparte, Joséphine de Beauharnais, Louis XVIII, Alexander I of Russia, George IV of the United Kingdom, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

Legend has it that it was the ill-fated French queen herself who commissioned Breguet&#x27;s masterpiece, the &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (No. 160), which is now widely regarded as one of the most important and valuable timepieces ever made. In fact, it was commissioned in 1783 by a member of the Marie-Antoinette Guards, possibly as a gift for the queen, and it took almost twenty years to complete—work stopped for around seven years (1789–1795) during the period of Breguet&#x27;s exile—and it was not finished until around 1802. Even by the standards of the day, it was an astronomically expensive piece; the commission specifically called for every watch function and complication known at that time and the use of the most valuable materials (including gold, platinum, rubies and sapphires), with no limit placed on time or cost. Breguet company records indicate that the factory costs eventually came to the colossal sum of 30,000 francs – more than six times the cost of Breguet&#x27;s other major work, (No. 92), which was sold to the Duc De Preslin for 4800 francs. The &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; remained in the possession of the Breguet company until it was sold to Sir Spencer Brunton in 1887, eventually finding its way into the collection of Breguet expert David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons in the 1920s.

Breguet&#x27;s most remarkable piece anticipated the wristwatch by a century; he designed this, together with his friend John Arnold, for Caroline Bonaparte, Queen of Naples, in 1810. Many honours recognised his enormous contribution to horology. Each watch from his workshops demonstrated the latest horological improvements in an original movement, mostly fitted with lever or ruby-cylinder escapements that he perfected. Breguet took refuge in Switzerland from the excesses of the French Revolution. He returned to Paris overflowing with the ideas that produced the Breguet balance-spring, his first carriage clock (sold to House of Bonaparte), the sympathique clock and its dependent watch, the tact watch, and finally the tourbillon, patented in 1801.

Although Breguet is probably best known for his luxury watches and carriage clocks, he also made a number of important scientific clocks. In 1818 Lieutenant-General Thomas Brisbane, a keen amateur astronomer, purchased a Breguet mean-time regulator clock (No. 3180, 1815–1820). It is thought that Breguet originally made the clock for the French Commission of Longitude, but sold it to Brisbane for use in his observatory at Largs in Scotland. It cost Brisbane the considerable sum of 2,500 francs, and the fact he chose to buy French rather British, even in the nationalistic political climate of the early nineteenth century, gives some idea of how well regarded Breguet was internationally. Brisbane brought the clock to Australia in 1821 and it was installed in Australia&#x27;s first astronomical observatory at Parramatta. The New South Wales government purchased the clock from Brisbane when he returned to England in 1825 and it remained in use there until the Parramatta observatory closed in 1847. It was put into storage for a decade before being reinstalled in the new government observatory at The Rocks, and was one of the few instruments that the new Government Astronomer, Rev. W. Scott, felt was good enough to use in the new observatory. It remained in use there for another 70 years, until it was replaced in 1912. The clock is now part of the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.

== The Salomons Collection ==
British philanthropist, scientist and MP Sir David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons (1851–1925) developed a lifelong passion for horology and he became one of the leading authorities on Breguet and his timepieces. In 1921 he published the seminal volume, &quot;Breguet 1747–1823&quot;, the first major book on the subject, which included a biography, an analysis of Breguet&#x27;s key inventions, listings of major pieces, and a detailed timeline of production, using examples from his own unique collection for illustrations.

Over his lifetime, Salomons amassed the world&#x27;s largest private Breguet collection, which ultimately grew to 124 pieces, including what are considered to be the two greatest examples of Breguet&#x27;s watchmaking work – the &quot;Marie Antionette&quot; and the double-faced &quot;Duc de Praslin&quot; watches. In 1924 Salomons donated the &quot;Duc de Praslin&quot; (pictured at left) to the Musée des Techniques du Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers in Paris, but it was subsequently stolen. Fortunately, after three months of tinkering with the watch, the thief was apprehended when he took it to a renowned Parisian watch specialist for repair.

After Salomons&#x27; death in 1925, his daughter Vera donated 57 of his best Breguet pieces, including the &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; and a &quot;Sympathiques&quot; clock to the L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art in Jerusalem, which was founded by her brother. Salomons left the remainder of the collection to his wife, who eventually sold them at auction, although according to one account, she was initially rebuffed when she approached Sotheby&#x27;s, because the staffer with whom she dealt could not believe that someone &quot;off the street&quot; could possibly have amassed such a collection. In 1980, British master horologist George Daniels catalogued the Breguet watches and clocks in the museum and published a study on them.

Three years later, on the night of 15 April 1983, the Mayer Institute was burgled and 106 rare timepieces, including the entire Salomons collection, were stolen. The audacious multimillion-dollar theft was Israel&#x27;s largest-ever robbery – by this time, the &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; alone was valued at US$30 million. There was a substantial insurance payout, but the case remained unsolved until August 2006, when the perpetrator was revealed as Namaan Diller, a notorious Israeli burglar who had fled to the US after the break-in.

Just before he died in 2004, Diller had confessed his crime to his wife, Nili Shamrat, and in August 2006 she attempted to sell a batch of the stolen items (including the &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; watch and a Breguet &quot;Sympathique&quot; clock) back to the museum, although her initial asking price of $2 million was eventually cut down to just US$35,000. When police searched the couple&#x27;s Los Angeles home, more of the missing items were found, and documents recovered led them to safes and storage units in France, the Netherlands and Israel; by 2008 all but ten of the items Diller stole from the Mayer Museum had been recovered.

== 2011 &quot;montre à tact&quot; discovery ==
In 2011 a member of the public brought in a pocket watch to be assessed by the experts of the BBC TV series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; at Blair Castle in Perthshire, Scotland. &quot;Roadshow&quot; expert Richard Price stated that the timepiece was an early Breguet &quot;montre à tact&quot; (&quot;tactile watch&quot;), dating from 1801.

The watch was enclosed on both sides by discs covered with a blue translucent enamel over a Guilloché base machined in a chevron pattern. The front face was fitted with a single arrow-shaped hand in silver, encrusted with small diamonds, and the case was surrounded by twelve large diamonds enclosed by a wavy gold band, which was faced with lighter blue enamel. The enamelled back hinged open to reveal a gold cover plate and a smaller two-handed watch face. The mechanism cover bore the engraved signature of Breguet and also bore the mark of Recordon, his London agent at the time (suggesting that it was originally made for an English client). The gold cover plate protected the mechanism, which bore another signature by Breguet, and the watch number.

Price then revealed that a similar watch, in much worse condition and with all the gems stripped from it, had recently sold for over UK£20,000. He declared the newly discovered Breguet to be the greatest watch he had ever seen in his 28 years with the programme, and assessed its value as at least UK£50,000, although it may be worth considerably more – another example sold for US$288,000, while a &quot;montre à tact&quot; of very similar design, commissioned by Napoleon&#x27;s wife Joséphine de Beauharnais for her sister Hortense, was sold by Christie&#x27;s in Geneva for US$1.3 million in 2007.

Breguet invented the &quot;montre à tact&quot; in 1799. Although these single-hand &quot;tact&quot; watches are sometimes called &quot;blind man&#x27;s watches&quot;, few blind people of that era could have afforded such luxury items, and these timepieces were designed for Breguet&#x27;s wealthiest clients. The &quot;montre à tact&quot; (touch watch) enabled them to tell the time without removing the watch from their pocket because, in that period, it was considered highly impolite to consult one&#x27;s watch during a social gathering.

The device also enabled owners to tell the time in the dark. This was done by turning the front disc clockwise until it went no further (because of the cam inside) and then feeling at which hour marker (indicated by the surrounding circle of jewels) the watch hand was positioned. In the case of the 2011 discovery, the 12 o&#x27;clock position was marked by the chain attachment. The watch was also fitted with a small internal dial with two normal hands so that the exact time could be read when the case was opened.

== Timeline of Breguet&#x27;s works ==

* 1775–1780 Improved the automatic winding mechanism – his perpetual watch.
* 1783 Invented the gong for repeater watches (bells were used until then). 
* 1783 Designed the apple-shaped (&quot;aiguilles à pomme&quot;) hands, known as &#x27;Breguet&#x27; hands. These hollow, eccentric &quot;moon&quot; tip hands are a variant of the hands first used by Jean-Antoine Lépine, the only difference is that Lépine&#x27;s hands were not eccentric. Since their invention, Breguet hands have graced watch and clock dials alike until today.
* 1787 Adopted and improved the lever escapement. Abraham-Louis Breguet used it in its definitive form from 1814 (this form is still in use).
* 1793 Developed a small watch showing the equation of time.
* 1790 Invented the &#x27;pare-chute&#x27; anti-shock device.
* 1794 Invented a retrograde display mechanism.
* 1795 Invented the Breguet spiral (flat spiral balance spring with overcoil).
* 1795 Invented the &quot;Sympathique&quot; (&#x27;sympathetic&#x27;) clock, a master carriage clock which rewinds and sets to time a detachable pocket watch.
* 1799 Invented the &quot;montre a tact&quot; (&quot;tactile&quot;) watch that could be read by feel in the pocket or the dark.
* 1801 Patented the tourbillon escapement, developed circa 1795.
* 1802 Invented the echappement naturel, a double-escape wheeled chronometer escapement that needed no oil.
* 1821 Developed the &quot;inking&quot; chronograph, in partnership with Frédérick Louis Fatton.

Generally speaking, Abraham-Louis Breguet was distinguished by the highest attention paid to aesthetic watch design.

In 2009 the Louvre in Paris presented a major exhibition of Breguet&#x27;s work, arranged chronologically, with 146 exhibits in eight sections that covered every phase of his career. Highlights included some of Breguet&#x27;s most complicated watches:

* No. 45, which displays both the Gregorian and the Republican &quot;decimal&quot; calendars (Breguet made only three Republican calendar timepieces)
* No. 1160, the replica of the famous No. 160 &quot;Marie-Antoinette&quot;,
* &quot;Perpétuelle&quot; self-winding watches
* multiple original tourbillons, including an unusual large-scale demonstration tourbillon later purchased by King George IV of the United Kingdom
* examples of the &quot;pare-chute&quot; shock-protection system, constant force escapements
* a superb &quot;Sympathique&quot; watch and clock set from the personal collection of Queen Elizabeth II.

<doc id="169734" wikidata="Q81464" url="?curid=169734" title="Spinach">
<text>Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a leafy green flowering plant native to central and Western Asia. It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae. Its leaves are a common edible vegetable consumed either fresh, or after storage using preservation techniques by canning, freezing, or dehydration. It may be eaten cooked or raw, and the taste differs considerably; the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming.

It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as . Spinach may overwinter in temperate regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular, and very variable in size: long and broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, in diameter, and mature into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster across containing several seeds.

In 2022, world production of spinach was 33 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 93% of the total.

==Etymology==

Originally from Persian &quot;aspānāḵ&quot;, the name entered European languages from medieval Latin &quot;spinagium&quot;, which borrowed it from Arabic &quot;isbanakh&quot;. The English word &quot;spinach&quot; dates to the late 14th century from the Old French word &quot;espinache&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Common spinach (&quot;S. oleracea&quot;) was long considered to be in the family Chenopodiaceae, but in 2003 that family was merged into the Amaranthaceae in the order Caryophyllales. Within the family Amaranthaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, Spinach belongs to the subfamily Chenopodioideae.

==Description==

As opposed to most flowering plants used as vegetables, spinach is a dioecious plant, meaning different plants can have either female or male flowers.
The flowers are small, green and wind pollinated. 

==History==

Spinach is thought to have originated about 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia from which it was introduced to India and later to ancient China via Nepal in 647 CE as the &quot;Persian vegetable&quot;. In 827 CE, the Arabs introduced spinach to Sicily. The first written evidence of spinach in the Mediterranean was recorded in three 10th-century works: a medical work by al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in the West) and in two agricultural treatises, one by Ibn Waḥshīyah and the other by Qusṭus al-Rūmī. Spinach became a popular vegetable in the Arab Mediterranean and arrived in the Iberian Peninsula by the latter part of the 12th century, where Ibn al-ʻAwwām called it &quot;&quot;, &#x27;the chieftain of leafy greens&#x27;. Spinach was also the subject of a special treatise in the 11th century by Ibn Ḥajjāj.

Spinach first appeared in England and France in the 14th century, probably via Iberia, and gained common use because it appeared in early spring when fresh local vegetables were not available. Spinach is mentioned in the first known English cookbook, the &quot;Forme of Cury&quot; (1390), where it is referred to as &#x27;spinnedge&#x27; and &#x27;spynoches&#x27;. During World War I, wine fortified with spinach juice was given to injured French soldiers with the intent to curtail their bleeding.

== Culinary use ==

=== Nutrients ===

Raw spinach is 91% water, 4% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference serving providing of food energy, spinach has a high nutritional value, especially when fresh, frozen, steamed, or quickly boiled. It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, manganese, and folate (31-52% DV), with an especially high content of vitamin K (403% DV) (table). Spinach is a moderate source (10–19% of DV) of the B vitamins, riboflavin and vitamin B6, vitamin E, potassium, iron, magnesium, and dietary fiber (table).

Although spinach contains moderate amounts of iron and calcium, it also contains oxalates, which may inhibit absorption of calcium and iron in the stomach and small intestine. Cooked spinach has lower levels of oxalates, and its nutrients may be absorbed more completely.

Cooking spinach significantly decreases its vitamin C concentration, as vitamin C is degraded by heating. Folate levels may also be decreased, as folate tends to leach into cooking liquid.

Spinach is rich in nitrates and nitrites, which may exceed safe levels if spinach is over-consumed.

=== Cuisine===

Spinach is eaten raw, in salads, and cooked in soups, curries, or casseroles. Dishes with spinach as a main ingredient include spinach salad, spinach soup, spinach dip, saag paneer, pkhali, ispanakhi matsvnit, and spanakopita. 

In classical French cuisine, a spinach-based dish may be described as à la Florentine.

== Production ==

In 2022, world production of spinach was 33 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 93% of the total.

===Marketing and safety===

Fresh spinach is sold loose, bunched, or packaged fresh in bags. Fresh spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days. Fresh spinach is packaged in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, fresh spinach loses most of its folate and carotenoid content over this period of time. For longer storage, it is canned, or blanched or cooked and frozen.

Some packaged spinach is exposed to radiation to kill any harmful bacteria. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to an absorbed dose of 4.0 kilograys, having no or only a minor effect on nutrient content.

Spinach may be high in cadmium contamination depending on the soil and location where the spinach is grown.

Due to spinach&#x27;s high content of vitamin K, individuals taking the anticoagulant warfarin, which acts by inhibiting vitamin K, are instructed to minimize consumption of spinach (and other dark green leafy vegetables).

== In popular culture ==

The comics and cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man is portrayed as gaining strength by consuming canned spinach. The accompanying song lyric is: &quot;I&#x27;m strong to the finich , &#x27;cuz I eats me spinach.&quot; This is usually attributed to the iron content of spinach, but in a 1932 strip, Popeye states that &quot;spinach is full of vitamin A&quot; and that is what makes people strong and healthy. As it happens, spinach is not a better source of dietary iron than many other vegetables. The false idea that spinach is an especially good source of dietary iron is an academic urban legend.

<doc id="169757" wikidata="Q4854937" url="?curid=169757" title="Bang Bang Jump Up">
<text>Bang Bang Jump Up is a solitary jump up in Stokes, Shire of Carpentaria, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
Bang Bang Jump Up is 106 km southwest of Normanton on the Burke Developmental Road, where the terrain rises abruptly from 20 metres above sea level to 50 metres above sea level after many kilometres of flat terrain.

This jump up is noted because it is one of the few elevated areas located in the middle of an expansive flat grassland. The unusual name for the hill has landed it on a number of lists for interesting or unusual place names. The name is presumably derived from the nearby Bang Bang Homestead and/or Bang Bang Waterhole.

<doc id="169764" wikidata="Q17966" url="?curid=169764" title="Humpty Doo">
<text>Humpty Doo is a town in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, situated just south of the Arnhem Highway, approximately 40 km from Darwin. At the , Humpty Doo had a population of 4,313 people. Its local government area is Litchfield Municipality. The town is a popular stopping point for tourists travelling between Darwin and Kakadu National Park, and boasts many attractions of its own. The main industries are agriculture and tourism; however, most residents commute to Darwin or Palmerston for work, and many regard it as a dormitory town.

==Origin of the name==

The name of the town has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. It first appeared in 1910 as &quot;Umpity Doo&quot;, and is of uncertain origin. The following derivations have been suggested:
#from the army slang term &quot;umpty&quot;, used for the dash when reading Morse code
#from a colloquialism meaning &quot;everything done wrong or upside down&quot;
#from &quot;Umdidu&quot;, an Aboriginal name supposedly meaning &quot;popular resting place&quot;

==History==
The Djerimanga (also known as Woolner) people are recognised as the traditional owners and first inhabitants of an area, from the present day site of Humpty Doo east into the Adelaide River wetlands. Their way of life remained unchanged until the first contact with European explorers in the 19th century, most likely during the 1864 expedition to explore the areas surrounding the Adelaide River, led by Boyle Travers Finniss.

In September 1869, Surveyor General of South Australia, George Goyder, completed work to divide the hinterland surrounding the present day Litchfield Shire into parcels. These parcels were subsequently divided into smaller allotments, and made available to settlers as pastoral leases and freehold titles.

Following the discovery of gold near Pine Creek during the 1880s, the subsequent influx of Chinese miners to the Northern Territory led to a high demand for food crops such as rice. Rice planted on the floodplains near Humpty Doo was used to meet this demand, with some success. Experiments with other tropical crops, including sugar cane, coffee and rubber, were attempted, most of these planted in the vicinity of Beatrice Hill to the east of the present day town. Experiments were made with livestock too and it was hoped that the banks of the Adelaide River could be developed to include loading facilities for live cattle export.

By 1887, plantations on the floodplains had been abandoned due to the financial difficulties of the land owners. Despite this, rubber trees and coffee bushes showed particular potential. A single harvest of 10 tons of coffee beans was exported to Melbourne during the short lived experiment.

In 1910, the name &quot;Umpity Doo&quot; first appeared, to describe buildings and improvements on a survey plan of Agricultural Lease No. 28, held by Oscar Herbert. Herbert died in 1974 at nearby Koolpinyah Station.

In 1954, after some experimentation by CSIRO and based on previous successful rice crops, a joint Australia-U.S. company called Territory Rice Ltd. was formed and established the Humpty Doo Rice Project, with a plan to irrigate the sub-coastal plain of the Adelaide River in order to commercially produce rice. The rice project was 20 km east of the present town, on part of the Humpty Doo Station where the name &quot;Humpty Doo&quot; was first used. The plan was a complete failure due to several factors: an invasion of geese, soil that was too saline, and an insufficient amount of drainage, all combined with poor management. The company gave up the land to the government in 1962. The irrigation dam, called Fogg Dam, still exists and is a good site for bird watching.

Local resident, Neville Skewes, opened a small store on Mount Bundey Road (now the Arnhem Highway) in 1967. At this time, there was very little development, with most of the surrounding area being bushland. On 11 September 1971, after being granted a liquor licence, Skewes and his wife Helen opened the Humpty Doo Hotel-Motel. The opening of the Hotel coincided with further improvements to the road east to Kakadu and Arnhem Land, and encouraged further urbanisation of the area around Humpty Doo.

In 1982, the Royal Australian Navy opened the Humpty Doo Transmitting Station. This replaced a facility at Coonawarra East that was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. The station supports the naval base , located in Darwin.

On 21 July 2007, the town played host to the first of the &#x27;Triple J goes AWOL&#x27; concerts, sponsored and organised by the national youth radio station Triple J.

==Climate==
Humpty Doo, like the rest of the outer Darwin area, experiences a tropical savannah climate (Köppen Aw), with two distinct seasons. The wet season is when the highest rainfall occurs and runs from November–December through until April. During these months the area is subject to the effects of monsoon troughs and there is the threat of tropical cyclones. The wet season is characterised by higher average temperatures, high humidity, and a greater proportion of rainy days and often associated thunderstorms.

The dry season from May to October brings lower humidity, significantly cooler overnight temperatures, and minimal rainfall. It is characterised by sunny days with clear skies.

==Economy==

The town is known for agriculture experiments that have occurred, including the failed rice crops of the 1950s.

A more successful agricultural experiment was the growing of mangos. Top-quality fruit from Humpty Doo is picked earlier than Queensland mangos and fetches a top price in southern markets.

There is a honey farm located in outer Humpty Doo, Humpty Doo Apiaries.

==Infrastructure==

===Education===
There are several schools in Humpty Doo catering for students in Transition through to Year 12.

Humpty Doo Primary School, located on Freds Pass Rd, is a public school for Transition - Year 6 students. The site also has a pre-school and offers an after school childcare program. The school includes students from diverse ethnic backgrounds: 15% of students identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, another 25% of the student population are from Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Indonesian, Cambodian, Spanish, Dutch, or Chinese language backgrounds. There were 394 students enrolled at the school as of August 2010.

Saint Francis of Assisi School and Early Learning Centre on Challenor Circuit is a Catholic school that provides an alternative for students in Transition to Year 7. The school was established in 1997 and draws enrollments from across the rural outer Darwin. As of 2012, the total student enrollment is approximately 160. The principal is Neal Maxwell.

The town has a public secondary school, Taminmin College, formerly Taminmin High School. Established in 1983, the college provides middle years schooling for students in Years 7 – 9, a senior college for Years 10 – 12 and Vocational Education and Training (VET) pathways. Student enrollments are drawn from an area of over 7000sq km. School facilities include a 150ha conservation area for the study of conservation and land management, a 75ha mixed produce and livestock farm for agricultural studies, an air-conditioned gymnasium, sports fields, and a library which is open to students and the wider Humpty Doo community. The school prepares senior students to sit their [NTCET] examinations, as well as having programs in place to provide vocational pathways such as trade apprenticeships on completion of studies. The current principal is Mrs. Sue Healy. As of August 2019, there were 1110 students enrolled at the college.

Tertiary and further vocational education and training are available through Charles Darwin University, with campuses in both Darwin and Palmerston.

===Public transport===
In January 2012, the Northern Territory Government opened a new $900,000 bus interchange park and ride facility to provide better public transport services for commuters travelling between the rural area, Darwin and Palmerston. This development includes:
*15m x 30m (49ft x 98ft) shaded bus/drop off terminal with seating
*CCTV surveillance
*a self-cleaning toilet
*water bubbler
*irrigated landscaping
*secure push bike enclosure
*46 car park bays
*four motor cycle parking bays
*two disabled parking bays
*an undercover bicycle shed accommodating up to 20 bikes.

Darwinbus provide 12 buses on weekdays and 6 on Saturdays. A return trip to either Darwin or Palmerston costs $4.

The following bus routes operate to the Humpty Doo park and ride as of April 2012:
*Express Route 28 - Humpty Doo to Darwin via Coolalinga and Palmerston Interchange (and reverse) - Monday to Friday
*Route 440 - Humpty Doo to Humpty Doo via Virginia, Noonamah, and Palmerston - Monday to Saturday
*Route 445 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via Cox Peninsula, Noonamah, and Coolalinga (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday
*Route 447 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via McMinns Lagoon and Howard Springs (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday
*Route 450 - Humpty Doo to Palmerston via Girraween and Howard Springs (PM service reversed) - Monday to Saturday

Special events buses also run from this interchange. There are currently no services on Sunday.

On the day of the , only 3.4% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 72.5% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

===Utilities===
The Humpty Doo waste transfer station is one of three waste management and recycling facilities operated by the Shire of Litchfield, and is the only station accommodating commercial waste. It is open 7 days per week. There is a fee that applies for commercial users. Non-recyclable waste is compacted and transferred to the Shoal Bay Waste Management Facility. The facility is capable of handling cardboard and paper, glass bottles, whitegoods, steel, plastic containers, aluminium cans, cardboard, green waste, and oil.

==Attractions==
The Humpty Doo Hotel is well known and features in several bush ballads, including &quot;The Man from Humpty Doo&quot; by Ted Egan and &quot;Humpty Doo Waltz&quot; by Slim Dusty. It opened in 1971, survived Cyclone Tracy in 1974 and has since become a local icon. In addition to comfortable visitor accommodation, the hotel features a bar area with open walls, a concrete floor, and an iron roof. Local live music acts regularly perform here.

Another tourist attraction is the Big Boxing Crocodile outside the United Petroleum station (formerly known as the Bush Shop) on the Arnhem Highway. This humorous attraction is a reference to the large crocodile population in the area and is one of the many famous &quot;big things&quot; found around Australia.

Graeme Gow&#x27;s Reptile World is also an attractive stop for tourists on their way to Kakadu, with a collection of at least 300 species of snake

The Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve is approximately 25 km (15.5 mi) east of the town and can be accessed off the Arnhem Highway. The reserve is situated on the Adelaide River floodplains, and is one of few publicly accessible natural wetland environments in the Top End all year round. The reserve is a wildlife refuge, and is significant both as a remnant of the failed Territory Rice Ltd venture, and its cultural significance to the local Aboriginal people. Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve features many walking trails and observation areas. Ranger guided activities are also available. At the end of the wet season, in around March–April, native wading birds including jabirus can be observed in large numbers near the dam wall.

Wishart Siding, a heritage listed relic of the North Australia Railway is located near the junction of the Stuart and Arnhem Highways a short distance west of town. The site dates back to 1915 and was used as an accommodation facility for maintenance workers when the line was operational. It is the only facility remaining of its kind along the alignment of the former railway.

The Window on the Wetlands Visitor Centre overlooks the wetlands of the Adelaide River floodplain. The centre sits on top of Beatrice Hill the site of several failed agricultural experiments. Visitors to the centre receive an introduction to the eco-systems of the Northern Coastal Wetlands region. The centre features interactive touch screen displays about the native wildlife and local history, and there is an observation deck on the top floor that provides the best views of the surrounding environment, culturally significant to the local Aboriginal people. Entry is free and the centre is open all year round, seven days a week. The building itself is designed to blend into the natural contours of the landscape.

==Notable residents==

* The World Wrestling Entertainment character Outback Jack–portrayed by Peter Stilsbury between 1986 and 1988–was billed as coming from Humpty Doo. The character was an outback bushman in the vein of Crocodile Dundee.
* Professional Australian rules footballers to have come from Humpty Doo include Nakia Cockatoo and Tayla Thorn.
* Harold Thomas, the designer and copyright holder of the Australian Aboriginal flag moved here in 1972 and still lives there.

==Trivia==
The 9th Fighter Squadron of the 49th Fighter Group attached to the United States&#x27; 5th Air Force gained the nickname &quot;Humpty Doo Fighters&quot; while stationed in the area in 1942. The squadron was accommodated in a camp referred to by Lucien Hubbard as Humpty Doo after the cattle station with the same name while acting as a publicity correspondent. The actual campsite location was further south than the township of Humpty Doo, to the east of Noonamah.

A rhabdovirus isolated from the midge &quot;Lasiohelea&quot; spp. at Humpty Doo is referred to as the &quot;Humpty Doo virus&quot;. No cases of human infection by Humpty Doo virus are known. In the literature of virology, it is only referenced as infecting kangaroos.

A bacterial species of the genus Burkholderia was first isolated during routine screening of a water well in Humpty Doo. &quot;Burkholderia humptydooensis&quot; has been proposed as its taxonomic name.

From September 2009 to December 2009, the numbers station Cherry Ripe is believed to have been broadcast from Humpty Doo until its discontinuation.

The wishbone spider species &quot;Aname humptydoo&quot; owes its specific epithet to being collected from Humpty Doo. It is yet to be recorded from any other locality.

<doc id="169774" wikidata="Q25164" url="?curid=169774" title="Nynorsk">
<text>Nynorsk (; ) is one of the two official written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 12 May 1885, it became the state-sanctioned version of Ivar Aasen&#x27;s standard Norwegian language (&quot;Landsmål&quot;), parallel to the Dano-Norwegian written standard known as Riksmål. The name Nynorsk was introduced in 1929. After a series of reforms, it is still the written standard closer to , whereas Bokmål is closer to Riksmål and Danish.

Between 10 and 15 percent of Norwegians (primarily in the west around the city of Bergen) have Nynorsk as their official language form, estimated by the number of students attending secondary schools. Nynorsk is also taught as a mandatory subject in both high school and middle school for all Norwegians who do not have it as their own language form.

==History==
Norway had its own written and oral language—Norwegian. After the Kalmar Union, Norway became a less important part of Denmark. At that time, Danish was declared the written language of Norway until 1814, and Danish with Norwegian intonation and pronunciation was on occasion spoken in the cities (see Dano-Norwegian). With the independence of Norway from Denmark, Danish became a foreign language and thus lost much of its prestige, and a conservative, written form of Norwegian, Landsmål, had been developed by 1850. By this time, however, the Danish language had been gradually reformed into the written language Riksmål, and no agreement was reached on which of the two forms to use. In 1885, the parliament declared the two forms official and equal.

Efforts were made to fuse the two written forms into one language. A result was that Landsmål and Riksmål lost their official status in 1929, and were replaced by the written forms Nynorsk and Bokmål, which were intended to be temporary intermediary stages before their final fusion into one hypothesised official Norwegian language known at the time as Samnorsk. This project was later abandoned and Nynorsk and Bokmål remain the two officially sanctioned standards of what is today called the Norwegian language.

Both written languages are in reality fusions between the Norwegian and Danish languages as they were spoken and written around 1850, with Nynorsk closer to Norwegian and Bokmål closer to Danish. The official standard of Nynorsk has been significantly altered during the process to create the common language form Samnorsk. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk population has stayed firm with the historical Aasen norm where these alterations of Nynorsk were rejected, which is known as Høgnorsk (, analogous to High German). Ivar Aasen-sambandet is an umbrella organization of associations and individuals promoting the use of Høgnorsk, whereas Noregs Mållag and Norsk Målungdom advocate the use of Nynorsk in general.

The Landsmål (Landsmaal) language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time.

The word &quot;Nynorsk&quot; also has another meaning. In addition to being the name of the present, official written language standard, Nynorsk can also refer to the Norwegian language in use after Old Norwegian, 11th to 14th centuries, and Middle Norwegian, 1350 to about 1550. The written Norwegian that was used until the period of Danish rule (1536-1814), closely resembles Nynorsk (New Norwegian). A major source of old written material is Diplomatarium Norvegicum in 22 printed volumes.

In 2023 Jon Fosse received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the first person awarded this prize to write in Nynorsk.

==Early Nynorsk studies and dictionaries==

After the transition from Middle Norwegian to New Norwegian/Nynorsk (), several studies of the language were assembled. The oldest of these is a language overview and collection of proverbs from the early 1600s Vest-Agder. Later in the century, a dictionary from Robyggjelaget was written. Neither of these works were printed until more recently. In 1646, however, Christen Jensøn (1610-1653), born in Askvoll, Norway, released a dictionary which documented the Nynorsk language in Sunnfjord.

In 1749, Erik Pontoppidan released a dictionary of Norwegian words that were incomprehensible to Danish people, &quot;Glossarium Norvagicum Eller Forsøg paa en Samling Af saadanne rare Norske Ord Som gemeenlig ikke forstaaes af Danske Folk, Tilligemed en Fortegnelse paa Norske Mænds og Qvinders Navne&quot;. Pontoppidan&#x27;s dictionary was criticised by Torleiv Hannaas for being a somewhat haphazard collection of rarities, and for being written by someone who was not proficient in Nynorsk, in contrast with Jensøn&#x27;s dictionary. It is agreed, and also admitted by Pontoppidan himself, that the scope of Pontoppidan&#x27;s work was not to provide a complete or rigid study of Nynorsk, but to make an attempt to further the understanding of the language.

==Ivar Aasen&#x27;s work==
A systematic study of the Norwegian language was made by Ivar Aasen in the mid 19th century. After the dissolution of Denmark–Norway and the establishment of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1814, Norwegians considered that neither Danish, by now a foreign language, nor by any means Swedish, were suitable written norms for Norwegian affairs. The linguist Knud Knudsen proposed a gradual Norwegianisation of Danish. Ivar Aasen, however, favoured a more radical approach, based on the principle that the spoken language of people living in the Norwegian countryside, who made up the vast majority of the population, should be regarded as more Norwegian than that of upper-middle class city-dwellers, who for centuries had been substantially influenced by the Danish language and culture. This idea was not unique to Aasen, and can be seen in the wider context of Norwegian romantic nationalism. In the 1840s, Aasen traveled across rural Norway and studied its dialects. He preferred the rural dialects of Vestlandet and inland Østlandet, whilst avoiding the city dialects and focusing less on the dialects of southern Østlandet and southern coast of Skagerrak, which he considered to be too much corrupted by Danish. In 1848 and 1850, he published the first Norwegian grammar and dictionary, respectively, which described a standard that Aasen called Landsmål. New versions detailing the written standard were published in 1864 and 1873, and in the 20th century by Olav Beito in 1970.

During the same period, Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb standardised the orthography of the Faroese language. Spoken Faroese is closely related to Landsmål and dialects in Norway proper, and Lucas Debes and Peder Hansen Resen classified the Faroese tongue as Norwegian in the late 17th century. Faroese is now regarded as a separate language.

Aasen&#x27;s work is based on the idea that Norwegian dialects had a common structure that made them a separate language alongside Danish and Swedish. The central point for Aasen therefore became to find and show the structural dependencies between the dialects. In order to abstract this structure from the variety of dialects, he developed some basic criteria, which he called &quot;the most perfect form&quot;. He defined this form as the one that best showed the connection to related words, with similar words, and with the forms in Old Norwegian. No single dialect had all the &quot;perfect forms&quot;; each dialect had preserved different aspects and parts of the language. Through such a systematic approach, Aasen believed one could arrive at a uniting expression for all Norwegian dialects, what he called &quot;the fundamental dialect&quot;; Einar Haugen called it &quot;Proto-Norwegian&quot;.

The idea that the study should end up in a new written language marked Aasen&#x27;s work from the beginning. A fundamental idea for him was that the fundamental dialect should be Modern Norwegian, not Old Norwegian or Old Norse. Therefore, he did not include grammatical categories which were extinct in all dialects. At the same time, the categories that were inherited from the old language and were still present in some dialects should be represented in the written standard. Haugen has used the word &quot;reconstruction&quot; rather than &quot;construction&quot; about this work.

===Conflict===
From the outset, Nynorsk was met with resistance among those who believed that the Dano-Norwegian then in use was sufficient. With the advent and growth of mass media, exposure to the standard languages increased, and Bokmål&#x27;s position is dominant in many situations. This may explain why negative attitudes toward Nynorsk persist, as is seen with many minority languages. This is especially prominent among students, who are required to learn both of the official written languages. There are however many individual reasons for both positive and negative attitudes towards Nynorsk. Many claim that obligatory learning of both language forms is unnecessary, and that students would be better off spending their time on learning a foreign language, or simply focusing on one of the language forms.

Some critics of obligatory Nynorsk and Bokmål as school subjects have been very outspoken about their opposition. For instance, during the 2005 election, the Norwegian Young Conservatives made an advertisement where a candidate for parliament threw a copy of the Nynorsk dictionary into a barrel of flames. After strong reactions to this book burning, they apologized and chose not to use the video.

== Geographical distribution ==
Bokmål has a much larger basis in the cities and generally outside of the western part of the country. Most Norwegians do not speak either Nynorsk or Bokmål as written, but a Norwegian dialect that identifies their origins. Nynorsk shares many of the problems that minority languages face.

In Norway, each municipality and county can choose to declare either of the two language standards as the official language or remain &quot;standard-neutral&quot;. As of 2020, 90 municipalities had declared Nynorsk the official standard, while 118 had chosen Bokmål; another 148 were &quot;neutral&quot; between the two, numbers that have been stable since the 1970s. As for counties, three have declared Nynorsk as their official standard: Møre og Romsdal, Telemark and Vestland. Most municipalities in Rogaland and few in the &quot;standard-neutral&quot; counties have declared Nynorsk as their official standard. Ålesund was the largest municipality with Nynorsk as its official language form, until the area of Haram, Norway (a Nynorsk-majority area) was separated from the rest of the municipality from 1 January 2024, and the remaining Ålesund municipality opted for &quot;standard-neutrality&quot;.

The main standard used in primary schools is decided by referendum within the local school district. The number of school districts and pupils using primarily Nynorsk has decreased from its height in the 1940s, even in Nynorsk municipalities. Nynorsk is also part of the school curriculum in high school and elementary school for all students in Norway, where students are taught to write it.

The prevailing regions for Nynorsk are the rural areas of the western counties of Rogaland, Vestland and Møre og Romsdal, where an estimated 90% of the population writes Nynorsk. Some of the rural parts of Innlandet, Buskerud, Telemark and Agder also write primarily in Nynorsk. In the Sunnmøre region of Møre og Romsdal, all municipalities (except the Bokmål-majority Ålesund) have stated Nynorsk as the official standard. In Vestland, almost all municipalities have declared Nynorsk as the official standard – the city of Bergen being one of only two exceptions.

== Status of the language form ==
Written Nynorsk is found in all the same types of places and for the same uses (newspapers, commercial products, computer programs, etc.) as other written languages. Most of the biggest newspapers in Norway have certain articles written in Nynorsk, like &quot;VG&quot; and &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, but are mainly Bokmål. There are also nationwide newspapers where Nynorsk is the only Norwegian-language form of publication, among them are &quot;Dag &amp; Tid&quot; and &quot;Framtida.no&quot;. Many local newspapers have also chosen Nynorsk as the only language form of publication, like &quot;Firdaposten&quot;, &quot;Hallingdølen&quot;, &quot;Hordaland&quot; and &quot;Bø blad&quot;. Many newspapers are also officially neutral, conforming to either Nynorsk or Bokmål in an article as they see fit, like &quot;Klassekampen&quot; and &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;. Commercial products produced in the Nynorsk areas of Norway are also often distributed with Nynorsk text, like types of Gamalost. Many computer programs and apps that serve the whole country often present a choice between Bokmål and Nynorsk, especially those produced by the Norwegian government.

There are also requirements by law that many Norwegian institutions have to follow. These laws are in order to keep Nynorsk and Bokmål as equals, which has been seen as an important case since the creation of the language forms. For instance the State-owned broadcaster NRK is required by law to have at least 25% of their content in Nynorsk. This means that at least one quarter of their content on broadcast and online media has to be in Nynorsk. There is also a requirement for state organs and universities to have content written in Nynorsk. Every student in the country should be presented the opportunity to take their exam in either Nynorsk or Bokmål.

== Spoken Nynorsk ==
Nynorsk is first and foremost a written language form but it does appear as a spoken language. Spoken Nynorsk is often referred to as normed Nynorsk speech. Bokmål speech in Eastern Norway often conforms to Urban East Norwegian, whereas Bokmål speech in Bergen and Trondheim is called &quot;pen-bergensk&quot; (lit. fine Bergenish) and &quot;pen-trøndersk&quot; (lit. fine Trondheimish), respectively. Normed Nynorsk speech is mostly used in scripted contexts, like news broadcasts from television stations, such as NRK and TV2. It&#x27;s also widely used in theaters, like Det Norske Teatret and by teachers. Since the 1970s, the motto of the Nynorsk movement has largely been &quot;speak dialect, write Nynorsk&quot;, which has marginalized the use of normed Nynorsk speech to mainly scripted contexts. This is in contrast to the normed Bokmål speech which many speakers use in all social settings. Outside of scripts, it is quite common to rather speak a Norwegian dialect. Compared to many other countries, dialects have a higher social status in Norway and are often used even in official contexts. At the same time, it is not uncommon for dialect speakers to use a register closer to the Nynorsk writing standard when deemed suitable, especially in formal contexts.

==Grammar==
Nynorsk is a North Germanic language, close in form to both Icelandic and the other form of written Norwegian (Bokmål). Nynorsk grammar is closer in grammar to Old West Norse than Bokmål is, as the latter was influenced by Danish.

===Nouns===
Grammatical genders are inherent properties of nouns, and each gender has its own forms of inflection.

Standard Nynorsk and all Norwegian dialects, with the notable exception of the Bergen dialect, have three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. The situation is slightly more complicated in Bokmål, which has inherited the Danish two-gender system. Written Danish retains only the neuter and the common gender. Though the common gender took what used to be the feminine inflections in Danish, it matches the masculine inflections in Norwegian. The Norwegianization in the 20th century brought the three-gender system into Bokmål, but the process was never completed. In Nynorsk these are important distinctions, in contrast to Bokmål, in which all feminine nouns may also become masculine (due to the incomplete transition to a three-gender system) and inflect using its forms, and indeed a feminine word may be seen in both forms, for example or (&quot;the book&quot;) in Bokmål. This means that (&quot;a small star – the star&quot;, only masculine forms) and (only feminine forms) both are correct Bokmål, as well as every possible combination: , or even . Choosing either two or three genders throughout the whole text is not a requirement either, so one may choose to write (&quot;the time&quot; ) and (&quot;the book&quot; ) in the same work in Bokmål. This is not allowed in Nynorsk, where the feminine forms have to be used wherever they exist.

In Nynorsk, unlike Bokmål, masculine and feminine nouns are differentiated not only in the singular form but also in the plural forms. For example:

That is, nouns generally follow these patterns, where all definite articles/plural indefinite articles are suffixes:

The gender of each noun normally follows certain patterns. For instance will all nouns ending in be masculine, like the word (job application). Almost all nouns ending in will be feminine, like the word (expectation). The nouns also get an irregular inflection pattern, with and in the plural indefinite and plural definite (just like the masculine) but inflected like a feminine noun in every other way. There are a few other common nouns that have an irregular inflection too, like which means man and is a masculine word, but for plural it gets an umlaut (just like English): (men) and it gets a plural definite that follows the inflection pattern of a feminine word: (the men). The word which means son is another word that is inflected just like a masculine word except for the plural, where it is inflected like a feminine noun with an umlaut: (sons), (the sons).

Here is a short list of irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in Bokmål too and some of which even follow the same irregular inflection as in Bokmål (like the word in the first row: ):

==== Genitive of nouns ====

Expressing ownership of a noun (like &quot;the girl&#x27;s car&quot;) is very similar to how it is in Bokmål, but the use of the reflexive possessive pronouns , , , are more extensive than in Bokmål due to the preservation of historical grammatical case expressions.

=== Compound words ===

Compound words are constructed in exactly the same way as Bokmål.

===Inflection===
A grammatical gender is not characterized by noun inflection alone; each gender can have further inflectional forms. That is, gender can determine the inflection of other parts of speech which agree grammatically with a noun. This concerns determiners, adjectives and past participles.

The inflection patterns and words are quite similar to those of Bokmål, but unlike Bokmål the feminine forms are not optional, they have to be used. As for adjectives and determiners, the list of words with a feminine inflection form are quite few compared to those for the masculine and neuter after the 2012 language revision. All the past participles for strong verbs are for instance no longer inflected for the feminine (with an inflection ending ) and there is just a handful of adjectives left with a feminine form, one of which is the adjective as is shown in the inflection table below.

====Adjectives====
Adjectives have to agree with the noun in both gender and number just like Bokmål. Unlike Bokmål, Nynorsk has a more completed system of adjective agreement comparable to that of the Swedish language (see Nynorsk past participles).

Just like in Bokmål, adjectives have to agree after certain copula verbs, like in this case the verb for &quot;to be&quot;: ( is its present tense). Other important copula verbs where predicative agreement happens are and (both mean &quot;become&quot;). Other copula verbs are also (looks like) and the reflexive verbs in Nynorsk. When verbs are used other than these copula verbs, the adjectives like in the example above will no longer be adjectives but an adverb. The adverb form of an adjective is the same as the neuter form of the adjective, just like in Bokmål. For instance (he does little). Adverbs are not inflected, like most European languages. The system of agreement after copula verbs in the Scandinavian languages is a remnant of the grammatical case system. The verbs where the subject and predicate of the verb had the same case are known as copula verbs. The system of grammatical case disappeared but there was still specific gender forms that was left.

Most adjectives will follow this pattern of inflection for adjectives, which is the same as in Bokmål:

Examples of adjectives that follow this pattern are adjectives like fin (nice), klar (ready/clear), rar (weird).

Adjectives/perfect participles that end in a diphthong (like the word , which means straightforward/fine) will follow this inflection pattern:

=====Comparison=====
All adjective comparison follow this pattern:


====Participles====
Past participles of verbs, which are when the verb functions as an adjective, are inflected just like an adjective. This is very similar to the system of agreement in the Swedish language, where all participles have an inflection for gender, number and definiteness. In contrast, participles in Bokmål are only in general inflected for number and definiteness and shares many of the inflections it got from the Danish language. The inflections of these participles are inferred from the verb conjugation class they pertain to, described in the verb section. In Nynorsk, the verb (to write, strong verb) has the following forms:
In fact, all strong verbs are conjugated in this pattern:
Strong verbs had an optional feminine form prior to the 2012 language revision that still are used among some users.
Some of the weak verbs have to agree in only number (just like in Bokmål), while many have to agree in both gender and number (like in Swedish). The weak verbs are inflected according to their conjugation class (see Nynorsk verb conjugation).

All -verbs get the following inflections:
All -verbs (with in preterite) and -verbs get the following inflections:

All other -verbs (those with in preterite) get the following inflections:

All short verbs get the following inflections:

Present participles are like all other living Scandinavian languages not inflected in Nynorsk. In general, they are formed with the suffix on the verb stem; (a writing student).

==== Definiteness inflection ====
As can be seen from the inflection tables for adjectives and past participles, they all have their own inflection for definiteness. Just like Bokmål, when adjectives and past participles are accompanied by the articles in the following table below, the adjective/past participle gets the definite inflection and the following noun also gets the definite inflection - a form of double definiteness. Nynorsk requires the use of double definiteness, where as in Bokmål this is not required due to its Danish origins, but the usage in Bokmål depends on the formality of the text. That is, in Bokmål it is perfectly fine to write &quot;I første avsnitt&quot; (which means; &quot;in the first paragraph&quot;), while the same sentence in Nynorsk would be &quot;I det første avsnittet&quot; which is also the most common way to construct the sentence in the Norwegian dialects and is also legal Bokmål.

Like most Scandinavian languages, when the noun is definite and is described by an adjective like the phrase &quot;the beautiful mountains&quot;, there is a separate definite article dependent on the gender/number of the noun. In Nynorsk these articles are: &quot;den&quot;/&quot;det&quot;/&quot;dei&quot;. The following noun and adjective both gets a definite inflection. When there is no adjective and the articles &quot;den&quot;/&quot;det&quot;/&quot;dei&quot; are used in front of the noun (like &quot;dei fjella&quot;, English; &quot;those mountains&quot;), the articles are inferred as the demonstrative &quot;that&quot;/&quot;those&quot; depending on if the noun is plural or not. The difference between the demonstrative &quot;that&quot; and the article &quot;the&quot; is in general inferred from context when there is an adjective involved.

====Determiners====
The determinatives have inflection patterns quite similar to Bokmål, the only difference being that the masculine form is often used for the feminine in Bokmål.
Examples:

* &quot;Min eigen bil&quot; (My own car)
* &quot;Mi eiga hytte&quot; (My own cabin)
* &quot;Mitt eige hus&quot; (My own house)
* &quot;Mine eigne bilar&quot; (My own cars)

&quot;Bil&quot; (car) is a masculine noun, &quot;hytte&quot; (cabin) is a feminine noun and &quot;hus&quot; (house) is a neuter noun. They all have to agree with the determinatives &quot;min&quot; and &quot;eigen&quot; in gender and number.

Examples:

* &quot;Eg har ingen bil&quot; (I have no car)
* &quot;Eg har inga hytte&quot; (I have no cabin)
* &quot;Eg har inkje hus&quot; (I have no house)
* &quot;Eg har ingen hytter&quot; (I have no cabins)

&quot;Bil&quot; (car) is a masculine noun, &quot;hytte&quot; (cabin) is a feminine noun and &quot;hus&quot; (house) is a neuter noun. They all have to agree with the determinative &quot;ingen&quot; in gender and number.

These words are used in a variety of contexts, as in Bokmål.

&quot;Nokon/noka&quot; means someone/any, while &quot;noko&quot; means something and &quot;nokre/nokon&quot; means some (plural).

Examples:

* &quot;Eg har ikkje sett nokon bil&quot; (I have not seen any car)
* &quot;Eg har ikkje sett noka hytte&quot; (I have not seen any cabin)
* &quot;Eg har ikkje sett noko hus&quot; (I have not seen any house)
* &quot;Eg har ikkje sett nokre/nokon bilar&quot; (I have not seen any cars)

&quot;Bil&quot; (car) is a masculine noun, &quot;hytte&quot; (cabin) is a feminine noun and &quot;hus&quot; (house) is a neuter noun. They all have to agree with the determinative &quot;nokon&quot; in gender and number.

===Verb conjugation===
As in other continental Scandinavian languages, verb conjugation in Nynorsk is quite simple as verbs are not conjugated by person, unlike English and other Indo-European languages. Verbs are divided into two conjugation classes: strong and weak verbs. The weak verbs are further divided into different categories: &quot;a&quot;-verbs, &quot;j&quot;-verbs, short verbs and &quot;e&quot;-verbs (some &quot;e&quot;-verbs with &quot;-de&quot; in the preterite tense and some with &quot;-te&quot; in the preterite tense). The conjugation class decides what inflection the verb will get for the different tenses and what kind of past participle inflection it gets. &quot;E&quot;-verbs with &quot;-de&quot; in the preterite will for instance be inflected in both gender and number for the past participles; while those with &quot;-te&quot; will be inflected only in number, as described in the past participle section. Unlike Bokmål, Nynorsk has a more marked difference between strong and weak verbs—a common pattern in dialects across Norway. The system resembles the Swedish verb conjugation system.

To identify what conjugation class a verb pertains to; &quot;j&quot;-verbs will have &quot;-je&quot; or &quot;-ja&quot; in the infinitive, &quot;e&quot;-verbs have &quot;-er&quot; in the present tense, &quot;a&quot;-verbs have &quot;-ar&quot; in the present tense and &quot;-a&quot; in the preterite. 

Strong verbs have no ending in their present and preterite forms. The only difference between these forms is ablaut.

Just like in Bokmål and in most other Germanic languages, there is no difference between the simple tenses and the continuous tenses in Nynorsk. This means for instance that &quot;drikk&quot; will cover both of the English present forms &quot;drink&quot; and &quot;drinking&quot;.

All users can choose to follow a system of either an &quot;-e&quot; or an &quot;-a&quot; ending on the infinitives of verbs. That is, one can for instance choose to write either &quot;å skrive&quot; or &quot;å skriva&quot; (the latter is common in west Norwegian dialects). There is also a system where one can use both &quot;-a&quot; endings and &quot;-e&quot; endings at certain verbs, this system is known as kløyvd infinitiv.

As can be shown from the conjugation tables, the removal of the vocal ending of the infinitive creates the imperative form of the verb &quot;kjøp deg ei ny datamaskin!&quot; (buy yourself a new computer!). This is true for all weak and strong verbs.

====Ergative verbs====
There are ergative verbs in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. A verb in Norwegian that is ergative has two different conjugations, either weak or strong. The two different conjugation patterns, though similar, have two different meanings. A verb with a weak conjugation as in the section above, will have an object, that is, the weak conjugated verb is transitive. The verb with strong conjugation will not have an object. The strongly conjugated verbs are intransitive. The system of ergative verbs is more pronounced in Nynorsk than in Bokmål. An ergative verb in Bokmål will have two different conjugations only for the preterite tense for strong verbs due to the influence of Danish that did not have strong ergative verbs, while all ergative verbs in Nynorsk have two different conjugations for all tenses like Swedish. Ergative verbs are also very common in Norwegian dialects, like in the following example.
Other verbs that are ergative are often j-verbs; &quot;liggje&quot; (to lie down), &quot;leggje&quot; (to lay down). These are differentiated for all tenses, just like Bokmål.

====Passive construction====

Just like the other Scandinavian languages and Bokmål, there is passive construction of verbs. In general, the passive is created by taking the verb stem and adding the suffix &quot;-ast&quot;. For instance the verb &quot;hente&quot; (English: fetch) has the passive form &quot;hentast&quot;. This suffix was inherited from Old Norse and is the same suffix that exists in modern-day Icelandic. In fact, all the verb forms &quot;berast&quot;, &quot;reddast&quot;, &quot;opnast&quot;, &quot;seljast&quot; in the table below are Icelandic verb forms too.

In contrast to Bokmål, the passive forms of verbs are only used after auxiliary verbs in Nynorsk, and never without them. Without an auxiliary verb there would rather be a passive construction by the use of the verbs &quot;vere&quot;/&quot;bli&quot;/&quot;verte&quot; (to be/to become) and then the past participle verb form. For instance, the following sentence is not a valid sentence in Nynorsk: &quot;Pakka hentast i dag&quot; (the package will be fetched today), there would rather be a construction like &quot;Pakka vert henta i dag&quot;. This is due to the reduction of sentences that are ambiguous in meaning and due to the historic legacy of Old Norse. Bokmål and certain languages like Swedish and Danish have evolved another passive construction where the passive is not reflexive. In the general case, this can lead to confusion as to &quot;han slåast&quot; means that &quot;he is fighting&quot;» or that &quot;he is being hit&quot;, a reflexive or a non reflexive meaning. Nynorsk has two different forms that separate this meaning for the verb &quot;slå&quot; (&quot;slåast&quot; and &quot;slåst&quot;), but in the general case it does not. Nynorsk solves this general ambiguity by mainly allowing a reflexive meaning, which is also the construction that has the most historical legacy behind it. This was also the only allowed construction in Old Norse.

There are reflexive verbs in Nynorsk just like the other Scandinavian languages, and these are not the same as passives. Examples are &quot;synast&quot; (think, looks like), &quot;kjennast&quot; (feels), etc. The reflexive verbs have their own conjugation for all tenses, which passives do not. A dictionary will usually show an inflection table if the verb is reflexive, and if it is passive the only allowed form is the word alone with an &quot;-ast&quot; suffix.
====Reflexive verbs====
Reflexive verbs like &quot;å kjennast&quot; (to feel) are conjugated this way

In general, all reflexive verbs are conjugated by this pattern. These have a reflexive meaning, see the examples below. Every reflexive verb is also a copula verb, so they have adjective agreement with adjectives like &quot;kald&quot; (cold), just like in Bokmål and the other Scandinavian languages.
====&quot;T&quot; as final sound====
One of the and the preterite verb ending in Bokmål is &quot;-et&quot;. Aasen originally included these &quot;t&quot;s in his Landsmål norms, but since these are silent in the dialects, it was struck out in the first officially issued specification of Nynorsk of 1901.

Examples may compare the Bokmål forms &quot;skrevet&quot; (&#x27;written&#x27;, past participle) and &quot;hoppet&quot; (&#x27;jumped&#x27;, both past tense and past participle), which in written Nynorsk are &quot;skrive&quot; (Landsmål &quot;skrivet&quot;) and &quot;hoppa&quot; (Landsmål &quot;hoppat&quot;). The form &quot;hoppa&quot; is also permitted in Bokmål.

Other examples from other classes of words include the neuter singular form &quot;anna&quot; of &quot;annan&quot; (&#x27;different&#x27;, with more meanings) which was spelled &quot;annat&quot; in Landsmål, and the neuter singular form &quot;ope&quot; of &quot;open&quot; (&#x27;open&#x27;) which originally was spelled &quot;opet&quot;. Bokmål, in comparison, still retains these &quot;t&quot;s through the equivalent forms &quot;annet&quot; and &quot;åpent&quot;.

===Pronouns===
The personal pronouns in Nynorsk are the only case inflected class in Nynorsk, just like English.

As can be seen from the inflection table, the words for &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot; etc. have to agree in gender with the object as described in the determiners section.

Like in Icelandic and Old Norse (and unlike Bokmål, Danish and Swedish), nouns are referred to by &quot;han&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;det&quot; (he, she, it) based on the gender of the noun, like the following:
==== Ordering of possessive pronouns ====

The main ordering of possessive pronouns is where the possessive pronoun is placed after the noun, while the noun has the definite article, just like in the example from the table above; &quot;boka mi&quot; (my book). If one wishes to emphasize ownership, the possessive pronoun may come first; &quot;mi bok&quot; (my&#x27; book). If there is an adjective involved, the possessive pronoun also may come first, especially if the pronoun or adjective is emphasized; &quot;mi eiga hytte&quot; (my own cabin), &quot;mi første bok&quot; or &quot;den første boka mi&quot; (my first book). In all other cases the main ordering will be used. This is in contrast to other continental Scandinavian languages, like Danish and Swedish, where the possessive comes first regardless, just like English. This system of ordering possessive pronouns in Nynorsk is more similar to how it is in the Icelandic language today.

=== Adverbs ===

Adverbs are in general formed the same way as in Bokmål and other Scandinavian languages.

=== Syntax ===

The syntax of Nynorsk is mainly the same as in Bokmål. They are for instance both SVO.

==Word forms compared with Bokmål Norwegian==

Many words in Nynorsk are similar to their equivalents in Bokmål, with differing form, for example:

The distinction between Bokmål and Nynorsk is that while Bokmål has for the most part derived its forms from the written Danish language or the common Danish-Norwegian speech, Nynorsk has its orthographical standards from Aasen&#x27;s reconstructed &quot;base dialect&quot;, which are intended to represent the distinctive dialectical forms.

<text>Lake Cadibarrawirracanna, informally known as Lake Cadi, is a salt lake located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Anna Creek in the state&#x27;s Far North region about north-west of the state capital of Adelaide. 

A South Australian government source describes the lake as having a length of , a width of and an area of .

Lake Cadibarrawirracanna, meaning &quot;the stars were dancing&quot;, is said to be the second longest official place name in Australia. In Arabana language, it is &quot;Kardipirla warrakanha&quot;, where kardipirla is stars, warra- is dance, play, -ka is simple past tense, and -nha is a proper noun marker.

The lake is located within the boundaries of the Anna Creek Station pastoral lease and has public access established under the &quot;Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989&quot; via an access road connecting to the Coober Pedy to William Creek Road about to the south. The intersection with the access road is about from Coober Pedy in the west and about from William Creek in the east.

The lake is the subject of a song named &quot;Carra Barra Wirra Canna&quot; written by Morva Cogan and which was recorded in the 1960s by the Australian singer and musician, Rolf Harris.
