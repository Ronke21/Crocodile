<text>Liepāja () is a state city in western Latvia, located on the Baltic Sea. It is the largest city in the Courland region and the third-largest in the country after Riga and Daugavpils. It is an important ice-free port.

In the 19th and early 20th century, it was a favourite place for sea-bathers and travellers, with the town boasting a fine park, many pretty gardens and a theatre. Liepāja is however known throughout Latvia as the &quot;City where the wind is born&quot;, likely because of the constant sea breeze. A song of the same name () was composed by Imants Kalniņš and has become the anthem of the city. Its reputation as the windiest city in Latvia was strengthened with the construction of the largest wind farm in the nation (33 Enercon wind turbines) nearby.

Liepāja is chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2027.

==Names and toponymy==
The name is derived from the Livonian word &quot;Liiv,&quot; which means &quot;sand&quot;. The oldest written text mentioning Līva village (&quot;Villa Liva&quot;) is a treaty between the bishop of Courland and the master of the Livonian Order dated 4 April 1253. In 1263, the Teutonic Order established a town which they called &quot;Libau&quot; in German and this was used until 1920. The Lettish name &quot;Liepāja&quot; was mentioned for the first time in 1649 by Paul Einhorn in his work &quot;Historia Lettica&quot;. A Russian name in Cyrillic from the time of the Russian Empire was (&quot;Libava&quot;) or (&quot;Libau&quot;), although (&quot;Liepaya&quot;), a transliteration of Liepāja, has been used since World War II.

Some other names for the city include &quot;Liepoja&quot; in Lithuanian, the nearest neighbour, &quot;Lipawa&quot; in Polish, and &quot;Libow&quot; in English.

==History==

===Early history===
It is said that the original settlement at the location of modern Liepāja was founded by Curonian fishermen from Piemare as &quot;Līva&quot;, but Henry of Livonia (Henricus de Lettis), in his famous &quot;Chronicle&quot;, makes no mention of the settlement. The Teutonic Order established a village which they called &quot;Libau&quot; here in 1263, followed by Mitau two years later. In 1418 the village was sacked and burned by the Lithuanians.

===Livonian confederation===
During the 15th century, a part of the trade route from Amsterdam to Moscow passed through Līva, where it was known as the &quot;white road to &quot;Lyva portus&quot;&quot;. By 1520 the river Līva had become too shallow for easy navigation, and development of the city declined.

=== Duchy of Courland and Semigallia ===

In 1560, Gotthard Kettler, first Duke of Courland and Semigallia, loaned all the Grobiņa district, including Libau, to Albert, Duke of Prussia for 50,000 guldens. Only in 1609 after the marriage of Sofie Hohenzollern, Princess of Prussia, to Wilhelm Kettler did the territory return to the Duchy. During the Livonian War, Libau was attacked and burnt by the Swedes. Along with Courland it was under Polish–Lithuanian suzerainty.

In 1625, Duke Friedrich Kettler of Courland granted the town city rights, which were affirmed by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1626. Under Duke Jacob Kettler (1642–1681), Libau became one of the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 Couronian colonization was started from the ports of Libau and Ventspils (Windau). Kettler was an eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. For the town&#x27;s faithful stance in the Polish-Swedish war, the Polish King John Casimir granted Lipava the right to collect customs duties on goods in the port in 1659, while King Augustus II approved the magistrate&#x27;s decision to expand the port in 1698.

In 1697–1703, a canal was cut to the sea and a more modern port was built. In 1701, during the Great Northern War, Libau was captured by Charles XII of Sweden, but by the end of the war, the city had returned to titular Polish possession. In 1710 an epidemic of plague killed about a third of the population. In 1780 the first Freemasonry lodge, &quot;Libanons&quot;, was established by Provincial Grand Master Ivan Yelagin on behalf of the Provincial Lodge of Russia; it was registered as number 524 in the Grand Lodge of England. In 1794, the city was captured by the Polish insurgents during the Kościuszko Uprising.

=== Russian Empire ===

Courland passed to the control of the Russian Empire in 1795 during the Third Partition of Poland and was organized as the Courland Governorate of Russia. Growth during the nineteenth century was rapid. During the Crimean War, when the British Royal Navy was blockading Russian Baltic ports, the busy yet still unfortified port of Libau was briefly captured on 17 May 1854 without a shot being fired, by a landing party of 110 men from HMS &quot;Conflict&quot; and HMS &quot;Amphion&quot;.

In 1857, an Imperial Decree provided for a new railway to Libau. That year the engineer Jan Heidatel developed a project to reconstruct the port. In 1861–1868 the project was realized – including the building of a lighthouse and breakwaters. Between 1877 and 1882 the political and literary weekly newspaper &quot;Liepājas Pastnieks&quot; was published – the first Latvian language newspaper in Libau. In the 1870s the further rapid development of Russian railways, especially the 1871 opening of the Libava-Kaunas and the 1876 Liepāja–Romny Railways, ensured that a large proportion of central Russian trade passed through Libau. By 1900, 7% of Russian exports were passing through Libau. The city became a major port of the Russian Empire on the Baltic Sea, as well as a popular resort. During this time of economic expansion, the city architect Paul Max Bertschy provided the design for many of the city&#x27;s both public and private buildings, making an imprint on the architecture which can still be seen today.
On the orders of Alexander III, Libau was fortified against possible German attacks. Fortifications were subsequently built around the city, and in the early 20th century, a major military base was established on the northern edge. It included formidable coastal fortifications and extensive quarters for military personnel. As part of the military development, a separate port was excavated exclusively for military use. This area became known as Kara Osta (War Port) and served military needs throughout the twentieth century.

Early in the twentieth century, the port of Libau became a central point of embarkation for immigrants travelling to the United States and Canada. By 1906 the direct ship service to the United States was used by 40,000 migrants per year. Simultaneously, the first Russian training school of submarine navigation was founded. In 1912 one of the first water aerodromes in Russia was opened in Libau. In 1913, 1,738 ships entered Libau, with 1,548,119 tonnes of cargo passing through the port. The population had increased from 10,000 to over 100,000 within about 60 years.

=== World War I and War of Independence ===
Following the outbreak of World War I, the German cruiser SMS &quot;Magdeburg&quot; shelled Liepāja (then part of Russia), and other vessels laid mines off the approaches to the port. Liepāja was occupied by the German Army, on 7 May 1915, and in memory of this event, a monument was constructed on Kūrmājas Prospect in 1916 and removed in 1919 by the new Latvian State. Liepāja&#x27;s local government issued its own money for a while in this period – &quot;Libaua rubles&quot;. An advanced German Zeppelin base was constructed at Vaiņode, near Liepāja, with five hangars, in August 1915. On 23 October 1915, the German cruiser was sunk by the British submarine , west of Liepāja.
With the collapse of Russia and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the occupying German forces had a quiet time, but the subsequent defeat in the West of the German Empire and the Allied denunciation of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty changed everything. Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on 18 November 1918, and the Latvian Provisional Government under Kārlis Ulmanis was created. Bolshevik Russia now advanced into Latvian territory and met little resistance here. Soon the Provisional Government and remaining German units were forced to leave Riga and retreated all the way to Liepāja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the Venta river. The Bolsheviks announced a Latvian Soviet Republic. Latvia now became the main theatre of Baltic operations for the remaining German forces in 1919. In addition, a &quot;Landeswehr&quot; was formed to work in conjunction with the German forces.

In Liepāja, a coup organized by Germans took place on 16 April 1919 and Ulmanis government was forced to flee and was replaced by Andrievs Niedra. The Ulmanis government found shelter on the steamship &quot;Saratov&quot; in Liepāja port. In May a British cruiser squadron arrived at Liepāja to support Latvian independence and requested the Germans to leave.

During the war, the words of &quot;The Jäger March&quot; were written in Liepāja by Heikki Nurmio.

The German &quot;Freikorps&quot;, having recaptured Riga from the Bolsheviks, departed in late 1919 and the Bolsheviks were driven out of the Latvian hinterlands in early 1920. In 1920, over 2,500 Polish soldiers of the former Polish Legion in Finland, who fought for Finnish independence from Russia, were evacuated from Finland to Liepāja and then further to Poland (see also &quot;Latvia–Poland relations&quot;).

=== 1920–1940 ===

During the interwar period, Liepāja was the second major city in Latvia.
In an attempt to put Libau &#x27;on the map&#x27;, on 31 January 1922, the Libau Bank was founded with significant new capital, transforming the old Libau Exchange Bank which had belonged to the Libau Exchange Association, and it eventually became the fourth-largest of Latvia&#x27;s joint stock banks. However, when a Riga branch of the bank was opened, the business centre of gravity shifted from Liepāja so that by 1923 its Riga &#x27;branch&#x27; was responsible for 90% of the turnover. The German consul in Liepāja reported at the time that &quot;Riga, the economic heart of the country, draws all business to itself.&quot; The Latvian government ignored the pleas of the Libau Exchange Association to frustrate this. In 1935 KOD () started to manufacture the light aircraft LKOD KOD-1 and LKOD KOD-2 at Liepāja. However it became evident in this year that trade with the new Soviet Union had virtually collapsed.

=== World War II ===

The ports and human capital of Liepāja and Ventspils were targets of Joseph Stalin. He signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact in part to gain control of this territory. When the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Latvia in 1940, it nationalized private property. Many thousands of former owners were arrested and deported to the gulag camps in Siberia.

In 1941, Liepāja was among the first cities captured by the 291st Infantry Division of Army Group North after Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa, its war against the Soviet Union. German Nazis and Latvian collaborators virtually exterminated the local Jewish population, which had numbered about 7,000 before the war. Film footage of an Einsatzgruppen execution of local Jews was taken in Liepāja. Most of these mass murders took place in the dunes of Šķēde north of the city. Fewer than thirty Jews survived in Liepāja by the end of the war.

One of the very few surviving films documenting the mass murder of Jews during the first stages of the Holocaust is a short film by a German soldier who witnessed the massacres of Liepāja Jews in July 1941 near the city&#x27;s lighthouse.

During the war, the German navy&#x27;s U-boat crews received their torpedo training at Liepāja.

During the period of 1944–1945, as the Soviet Union began its offensive to the Baltic Sea, Liepāja was within the &quot;Courland Pocket&quot;. It was occupied by the Red Army on 9 May 1945. Thousands of Latvians fled as refugees to Germany. The city had been devastated during the war, and most of the buildings and industrial plant were destroyed.

=== Latvian SSR ===
On 25–29 March 1949, the Soviet Union organized a second mass deportation to Siberia from Liepāja. In 1950 a monument to Stalin was erected on Station square (). It was dismantled in 1958 after the Party Congress that discussed his abuses.
During 1953–1957, the city center was reconstructed under the direction of architects A. Kruglov and M. Žagare. In 1952–1955 the Liepāja Academy of Pedagogy building was constructed under the direction of A. Aivars. In 1960 the &quot;Kurzeme&quot; shopping centre was opened. During the Soviet administration, Liepāja was a closed city; even local farmers and villagers needed a special permit to enter it.

The Soviet military set up its Baltic naval base and nuclear weapon warehouses there; The Beberliņš sandpit was dug out to extract sand used for constructing underground warehouses. In 1967 the Soviets completely closed the port to commercial traffic. One-third of the city was taken up with a Soviet naval base; its military staff numbered 26,000. The 14th Submarine Squadron of the USSR&#x27;s Baltic Fleet (, call sign &quot;Комплекс&quot;) was stationed there with 16 submarines (Types: 613, 629a, 651); as was the 6th group of Rear Supply of the Baltic Fleet, and the 81st Design Bureau and Reserve Command Center of the same force.

In 1977, Liepāja was awarded the Order of the October Revolution for heroic defense against Nazi Germany in 1941. Five residents were awarded the honorary title Hero of Socialist Labor: Anatolijs Filatkins, Artūrs Fridrihsons, Voldemārs Lazdups, Valentins Šuvajevs and Otīlija Žagata. Because of the rapid growth of the city&#x27;s population, a shortage of apartment houses resulted. To resolve this, the Soviet government organized development of most of the modern Liepāja districts: Dienvidrietumi, Ezerkrasts, Ziemeļu priekšpilsēta, Zaļā birze and Tosmare. The majority of these blocks were constructed of ferro-concrete panels in standard projects designed by the state Latgyprogorstroy Institute (). In 1986 the new central city hospital in Zaļa birze was opened.
=== 1990–present ===
After Latvia regained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, Liepāja has worked hard to change from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last Russian troops left Liepāja. Since then, Liepāja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an active partner in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia&#x27;s largest naval flotilla, the largest warehouses of ammunition and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army.

The former closed military town has been transformed into the northern neighbourhood of Karosta, occupying a third of the area of the city of Liepāja and attracting tourists to the remains of the military era.

At the beginning of the 21st century, many ambitious construction projects were planned for the city, including a NATO military base, and Baltic Sea Park, planned as the biggest amusement park in the Baltic states. Most of the projects have not yet been realised due to economic and political factors. Liepāja&#x27;s heating network was renovated with the cooperation of French and Russian companies: Dalkia and Gazprom, respectively. In 2006, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, a direct descendant of Jacob Kettler visited Liepāja. In 2010 the coal cogeneration 400 MW power plant was built in Liepāja with the support of the government.

== Geography ==

Liepāja is situated on the coast of the Baltic Sea in the south-western part of Latvia. The westernmost geographical point of Latvia is located approximately to the south thus making Liepāja Latvia&#x27;s furthest west city. The city occupies a 1.5-6.5 km wide coastal dune embankment and a foothill plain in the Bartau Plain of the Seaside Lowland. Liepāja is surrounded by the Dienvidkurzeme Region, and is bordered to the north by Medze Parish, to the east by Grobiņa Parish, and to the south by Nīca Parish, with its western border following the Baltic Sea coast. The Trade Channel () connects the lake to the sea dividing the city into southern and northern parts, which are often referred to as Vecliepāja (Old Town) and Jaunliepāja (New Town) respectively. Along the coast, the city extends northwards until it reaches the Karosta Channel (). North of the Karosta Channel is an area called Karosta which is now fully integrated into Liepāja and is the northernmost district of the city. Liepāja&#x27;s coastline consists of an unbroken sandy beach and dunes. Natural areas cover about one third of the territory of the city. These areas are mostly located on the outskirts of the city and are not connected to the small green areas in the central part of the city.

=== Forests ===
Liepāja&#x27;s urban forest covers 1368.9 ha, of which 83% are forest stands, the rest is covered by swamps (4.7%), meadows and sandhills (9.5%), flood plains and infrastructure sites (less than 3% in total). Private landowners own 109.6 ha, while 92% of the forest land area, or 1259.3 ha, belongs to the municipality. The urban forest consists of five separate forest massifs: the largest one is in the northern part of the city – the Karosta Forest. Other forests include Reiņu Forest, the forests near the regional hospital, the south-western forest and the Zaļā birze Forest. The city is characterised by a wide variety of forest growth types, determined and influenced by the geological and hydrological conditions of the area. Dry forests cover 39% of the forest area, forests on wet mineral soils 13%, swamp forests 22% and drained forests 26%.
=== Surface waters ===
The water areas cover 1009 ha (17% of the total area of the city). The hydrological system of the City of Liepāja consists of various elements, including the Liepāja and Tosmare Lakes, which border the city to the east and are Natura 2000 sites (a quarter of the lake is located in the city, the rest is located in the Otanķi and Nīca municipalities). There are also rivers – the Vērnieku River, Kalējupīte and Ālande, canals: Tirdzniecības, Karostas, Cietokšņa and Pērkones (former river), as well as the artificial reservoir Beberliņi. The city is located on the Baltic Sea coast. According to the Latvian classification of river basin districts, the territory of the city of Liepāja falls within the Venta river basin district.

=== Soils ===
The prevailing soil type and the prevailing geographical landscape of the area are determined by the low-fertility sandy loams and difficult natural drainage conditions characteristic of the Seaside Lowland. In terms of mechanical composition, sandy soils predominate, with typical podzols in the uplands and peaty podzolic gley vegetation in the depressions, as well as turf gley vegetation and turf podzolic gley vegetation. Due to the high humidity, the area is characterised by waterlogging.

=== Climate ===

The climate in Liepāja is strongly influenced by the close proximity to the sea and is therefore located in the warm-summer humid continental climate zone noted as &quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen classification. The outflow of sea air creates relatively low summer and high winter temperatures for these latitudes. Liepāja has the highest average air temperature in Latvia at . In terms of hours of sunshine, Liepāja has one of the highest averages of 1940 hours of sunshine per year. Winter is characterised by frequent thaws, so snow cover in the Seaside Lowlands is usually very patchy, rarely exceeding 5–10 cm in depth. During the winter the sea around Liepāja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some land-fast ice may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea water usually reaches its summer maximum temperature at the beginning of August, while being less warm than, for example, in the Gulf of Riga due to the open sea. Winters are milder than inland areas to the east and comparable to the opposite coast on the Swedish mainland.

The number of windy days is high compared to inland areas of Latvia. The prevailing winds in the area tend to be all westerly and southerly. Their average speed is 6.1 m/s. Maximum wind speeds (greater than 20 m/s) are usually observed in autumn and winter, in most cases from the west. On 17–18 October 1967, the strongest storm in the history of the country occurred, and on 18 October the highest wind gust ever recorded in Latvia – 48 m/s – was recorded in Liepāja. The city has on average the most stormy days of the year – 7.9, when the average wind speed reaches 10.8 m/s. In 1971, this figure was as high as 36 days. The long-term trends indicate a very significant decrease in the number of stormy days.

== Architecture ==

Liepāja&#x27;s architecture features buildings from different centuries: classical wooden buildings from the 17th century, highly regarded brick architecture, Eclecticism and Art Nouveau buildings at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as some buildings of the interwar period, Soviet-era functionalism and contemporary architecture. Many buildings were destroyed during World War II, which resulted in the destruction of almost the entire city built-up area between the Trade Canal and the Rose Square – more than 100 buildings. The development of Liepāja was entirely determined by economic conditions – initially the establishment of the port, and later, from the late 19th century, the expansion of industry.

=== Early architecture ===

Liepāja reached its first period of construction and architectural prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries. The development of the architecture and artistic styles of the buildings was reflected in the houses of the wealthier inhabitants, where Mannerism, Baroque, Classicism and other styles can be found. The common people built their homes using traditional building methods typical of the countryside. The oldest type of building in Liepāja is a wooden log house on a low stone plinth with a steep tiled roof. This type of building can be found on Kungu Street, which was the main street of the town in the 17th century. The building on 24 Kungu Street is notable for the visit of Tsar Peter I of Russia in 1697, while the neighbouring building on 26 Kungu Street was visited by King Charles XII of Sweden in 1700. Other notable buildings are those at 6 Lielā Street, 3 Kungu Street, 13 Stendera Street, and the warehouses at 1 and 2 Jāņa Street and 4/6 and 10/12 Zivju Street. After several unsuccessful attempts to build a harbour during the previous century, the Trade Canal was dug in 1703, which contributed to the growth of the city. At this time, the port warehouses were built out of wood, characterised by a high plinth created as a semi-basement. Most of the older warehouses were concentrated in Jūras Street, one of which was moved to the Open-Air Museum in the 1930s, while the others have not survived. Residential buildings in the harbour area were very small and densely distributed. In 1848 there were 664 buildings in the town, of which only 46 were stone-built. Although wooden buildings were constructed, the most luxurious were built with roof extensions and ornate doors, panelling and beautifully painted pot stoves. The most ornate building in 18th century Liepāja was the Holy Trinity Cathedral
=== Bertschy ===
With the construction of the Grobiņa highway in 1841 and the Liepāja-Romny railway in the 1870s, the city took on a different character. This was further marked by the appointment of Paul Max Bertschy as the city&#x27;s first architect in 1871. The houses built by Bertchy form the most notable part of Liepāja&#x27;s historic buildings. The wide range of Bertschy&#x27;s diverse works includes the oil extraction plant and linoleum factory, mansions at 14 and 16 Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street, 15 Peldu Street, tenement houses on 44 Peldu Street, the Peldu Institution (bath house) in Jūrmala Park, the hospital complex on Dārtas Street, the gymnasium building at 4 Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street, the café at 2 Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street, the St. Anne&#x27;s Church, the Rome Hotel and others. His red brick buildings are also well known. The architecture of this period uses high-quality woodwork, such as doors. The painted staircases are remarkable, not only in the luxurious houses, but also in the workers&#x27; tenements on 6 Palmu Street, 9 Avotu Street, 28 Republikas Street and 21 Kuršu Street.

=== Art Nouveau ===

Liepāja is home to examples of the Art Nouveau style of architecture on a European scale. There are dozens of Art Nouveau buildings in the city, which in absolute numbers is more than in other European cities. Graudu Street is almost entirely defined by Art Nouveau along its entire length. Most of the buildings are built in the restrained and laconic style of Northern National Romanticism. Paul Max Bertchy designed several Art Nouveau buildings, but also significant are those by Theodor Max Bertchy (Bertchy junior), Ludwig Melville, Charles Carr, Lars Sonke, Pauls Kampe, Adolf Kucner, Gustav Janicek, William Losow, Max Kuhn, Alexander Zehrensen and Vasily Kosyakov. The Art Nouveau in Liepāja reflects mostly Latvian – German and partly also Russian as well as other interchanges.

The most outstanding examples of Art Nouveau are the buildings on 2/6 Kūrmājas Prospect, 9 Ausekļa Street, 28, 34, 36/38, 44, 46, 27/29 and 45 Graudu Street, 3, 9, 16 and 23 Dzintaru Street, 8 Krišjāņa Barona Street, 23 Liepu Street, 33/35 Peldu Street, 1 and 11 Pasta Street, 4 and 5 Lielā Street, 2 Teātra Street, 18 Baznīcas Street, 21A Bāriņu Street, 22 Tirgoņu Street, 1, 5, 17 and 21 Kuršu Street, 8/10 and 16 Rožu Street, 6 Alejas Street (yard), 43 Toma Street, 11 Dīķa Street, 4 and 11 Avotu Street, 19 and 28 Republikas Street, 5, 13, 15/17, 19, 25 and 66 Uliha Street, 1 Raiņa Street, 10/12 Kroņu Street etc.
=== Karosta ===
In the northern part of the city, under the guidance of the best Russian military architects and engineers, the Karosta complex was built, which was and is completely different from the rest of the city, both in function and in the character and traditions of its buildings. The Karosta is still an outstanding example of a militarised complex in Latvian architectural history. The district was built for the Russian army and is dominated by the Orthodox cathedral in the centre. The most important objects of the Karosta are the officers&#x27; meeting house and the residential complex, as well as the unique fortification system that encircled the entire city and connected the different parts of the city with underground passages. During World War I, the fortifications were partially blown up.

=== Interwar period ===
During the interwar period, architect Jānis Blaus designed the project for the Latvian Society House in Liepāja. The building was erected in 1934 on the Rose Square. The Army Economic Store building was built in 1934–1935 according to the design of architect Aleksandrs Rācenis, but was destroyed during the Second World War. The pawnshop and savings bank building at 3 Teātra Street was built in 1936–1937. During this period, the Friendly Vocation Primary School (now the 5th Secondary School; K. Bikše) and the Jaunliepāja Lutheran Church (K. E. Strandmann) were also built.

=== Soviet era ===
Liepāja&#x27;s city centre was devastated by the Second World War, and new development master plans were needed. The architecture and urban planning of Latvia, which was part of the USSR, was regulated by the uniform urban planning and building regulations of the Soviet Union. New centres for cities destroyed during the war were planned according to standardised formal principles – International Modernism, where streets had to be wide and squares regular, symmetrical, with a Lenin monument in the centre. Public buildings were designed to be representative – in line with Soviet architectural principles – large, spacious, imposing. In 1957, the building that now houses the University of Liepāja was built in a heavy eclectic style, designed by the architect Andrejs Aivars. An almost identical building is located in Daugavpils. The &quot;Kurzeme&quot; department store was built with large windows on the exterior walls and shop windows on the ground floor. During the Soviet period, the historical buildings of Liepāja&#x27;s Old Town were eliminated over a wide area by the construction of a tram line from &quot;Kurzeme&quot; to Peldu Street. Changes also affected Lielā Street. Due to the military port, Liepāja was a closed city, and thus construction in the city was rather slow until the 1970s, when the construction of new factories (&quot;Lauma&quot;, agricultural machinery factory, &quot;Hidrolats&quot;) and residential areas were built, the most important of which is the Ezerkrasts district.

=== Contemporary architecture ===
After the restoration of independence, an artificial ice rink (architect U. Pīlēns), a Catholic monastery (A. Kokins) in Jaunliepāja, the &quot;Māja&quot; shop (reconstruction; A. Padēlis-Līns), new market pavilions in the city centre (U. Pīlēns) were built. The most remarkable building of the 21st century is the Great Amber Concert Hall. New-age construction is characterised by the use of new materials and technologies, as well as rationalism and functionalism.

== Administration ==
Fourteen deputies and a mayor make up the Liepāja City Council. City&#x27;s voters select a new government every four years, in June. The Council selects from its members the Chairman of City Council (also called City Mayor), the two Vice chairmen (Deputy Mayors)

which are full-time positions. City Council also appoints the members of four standing committees, which prepare issues to be discussed in the Council meetings: Finance Committee; City Economy and Development Committee; Social Affairs, Health Care, Education and Public Order Committee; Culture and Sports Committee. The City of Liepāja had an operating budget of 104 million euros in 2022. Traditionally, political leanings in Liepāja have been right-wing. In recent years the Liepāja Party has dominated the polls.
== Demographics ==
Liepāja&#x27;s population structure has been multicultural and this impacted city&#x27;s social life, economy and administration. Liepāja&#x27;s population structure started to change after the abolition of serfdom in 1817. The number of inhabitants in 1800 is 4500, but in 1840 there already were 11 000 citizens. The number of city inhabitants has doubled in 40 years. It continued to grow and in 1881 Liepāja already had 29 600 inhabitants. Liepāja&#x27;s population grew fastest before World War I, almost tenfold in 50 years. It doubled during the 50 years of Soviet occupation, when population growth was hampered by the existence of the closed military port. Until World War I there was a high proportion of Baltic Germans, until World War II there was a high proportion of Jews, and during the Soviet occupation the number of Russians increased. The proportion of Latvians increased from 16% in 1863 to 85% in 1943 until World War II, but decreased again after the war.

With 68,945 inhabitants in 2019, Liepāja is the third-largest city in Latvia. Its population has declined since the withdrawal of Soviet military forces; the last of which left in 1994. In addition, many ethnic Russians emigrated to Russia in 1991–2000. More recent causes include economic migration to Western European countries after Latvia joined the EU in 2004, and lower birth rates. The demographic situation in Liepāja is unfavourable, as the natural population growth is negative. However, the trend of people leaving Liepāja is gradually decreasing, and in 2018 a positive migration balance was achieved for the first time in many years. Favourable migration trends are more and more significantly compensating for the negative natural increase, so the overall population decline trend has been significantly reversed in 2017 and 2018. The dependency load is 690 children, adolescents and pensioners per 1000 inhabitants, which is the highest value among the major cities. The population decreased by an average of 750 inhabitants per year between 2012 and 2018.

=== Religion ===

Liepāja has a number of churches. As elsewhere in central and western Latvia, Protestant churches, mostly Lutheran, are predominant. Holy Trinity Cathedral houses the seat of the Lutheran Bishop of Liepāja. Other Lutheran congregations are St. Anne, Church of the Cross and Church of Luther. There are four Baptist congregations in the city, among them are St. Paul church and Church of Zion.

Owing to the regional importance of Liepāja during the last decades of the Russian Empire, a number of Russian Orthodox churches were established in the city early in the twentieth century. Their congregations are chiefly drawn from the Russian-speaking population.

The Catholic faith is represented in Liepāja by a St. Joseph Cathedral – the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Liepāja, Catholic primary school and the Catholic centre. The structure of the Catholic centre was used to represent the Vatican in Expo 2000 in Hanover and was transferred to Liepāja after the event.

Other Christian sects include Old Ritualists, Adventist, Pentecostal, Latter-day Saints and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, who have single congregations and churches.

== Economy ==

After the collapse of USSR&#x27;s centrally planned economy, Liepāja had to deal with issues of rundown infrastructure. To provide business incubation and development for the city, Liepāja Special Economic Zone (Liepāja SEZ) was established. According to the law, Liepāja SEZ was established on March 1, 1997, and it will exist until December 31, 2035. The purpose of the Liepāja SEZ is to develop a business environment, manufacturing, shipping and air traffic, as well as international trade through Latvia. The aim of the Liepāja SEZ is to attract investment for expanding of manufacturing and infrastructure, and to create new work places and to ensure the development of the region. In the beginning, investment growth remained slow due to a shortage of a skilled labour force, but the scheme proved to be successful as positive tendencies can be seen with formation of new businesses.

After joining the European Union in 2004, many companies were faced with strict European rules and tense competition. In 2007 &quot;Liepājas cukurfabrika&quot; and &quot;Liepājas sērkociņi&quot; closed down; &quot;Līvu alus&quot;, &quot;Liepājas maiznieks&quot; and &quot;Lauma&quot; have been sold to European investors. in 2013, the steel production company Liepājas Metalurgs went bankrupt, which was one of the largest economic disasters in modern Latvian history, costing the state around 230 million LVL (327 million EUR). Today, the city&#x27;s economic development is mainly driven by Liepāja Special Economic Zone, Trade Port and the companies placed there. In 2021, the companies in Liepāja with the largest turnover are TOLMETS, AE Partner, and Jensen Metal

== Transport ==

Liepāja&#x27;s transport system consists of 31 bus lines (5 of which are connected to Grobiņa), as well as one Liepāja tram line, which is 7 kilometres long. The tram line was founded after the opening of the first Liepāja power plant in 1899, which makes it the oldest electric tram line in the Baltic states; it is now operated by the municipal company Liepājas tramvajs. In 2013, the tram line was extended by 1.7 km from the Dienvidrietumu residential area (Klaipėda Street) to the Ezerkrasts residential area with a turnaround at the end of Mirdzas Ķempes Street. Liepāja has direct bus connections to Riga, Riga International Airport, Ventspils, Jelgava, Klaipėda and other destinations.

Liepāja has a railway connection to Jelgava and Riga and through them to the rest of Latvia&#x27;s railway network. There is just one passenger station in the New Town, but the railway extends further and links to the port. There is also a northward railway track leading to Ventspils, but in recent decades it has fallen into disuse for economic reasons. The railway provides the main means of delivering cargo to the port. Two main highways, the A9 and A11, connect the city and its port to the rest of the country. The A9 leads north-west towards Riga and central Latvia and the A11 leads south to the border with Lithuania and its only port Klaipėda and to Palanga International Airport. The city also hosts Liepāja International Airport, one of three international airports in Latvia; it is located outside the city limits, north of the Lake of Liepāja near Cimdenieki. However, as of 2020 the airport only serves private, military flights or flight training as the national carrier airBaltic no longer has any low capacity fleet to facilitate flights from the airport.

The Port of Liepāja has a wide water area and consists of three main parts. The Winter harbour is located in the Trade channel and serves small local fishing vessels as well as medium cargo ships. Immediately north of the Trade channel is the main area of the port, separated from the open sea by a line of breakwaters. This part of the port can accommodate large ships and ferries. Further north is Karosta harbour, also called Karosta channel, which was formerly a military harbour but is now used for ship repairs and other commercial purposes. Liepāja also welcomes yachts and other leisure vessels which can enter the Trade channel and moor almost in the center of the city.

== Education ==
=== History ===
The idea to open a school was born in 1560 during a church survey, and schools existed in Liepāja before 1625. However, it was the granting of city rights that encouraged the further development of schools, as the maintenance of schools was considered one of the city&#x27;s responsibilities. Both German and Curonian children were encouraged to attend the newly founded school. It was announced to the &quot;non-Germans&quot; that those children who were sent to the school would be freed from all servitude and even freed from serfdom; they would also be given help for further education. At the beginning the school was a one-class school; the second class was opened in 1638; from 1650 the school had 3 classes, and in 1750 the 4th class was opened. In 1788 a new school building was built, and in 1806 the town school was transformed into the county&#x27;s highest school after 250 years of existence. This county school was attended by Krišjānis Valdemārs and Kronvaldu Atis. In 1866, the county school was converted into the Nikolai Gymnasium. In 1861, a maritime class was opened at the county school, which was added to the Liepāja Maritime School in 1876. The first girls&#x27; high school was opened in 1871, and by 1874 there were already 2 girls&#x27; high schools, one of which was turned into a gymnasium in 1886. In the following years, the Russification of schools, which started with the law of 1889, turned all schools into Russian schools, however, there were schools attended by Latvian children in their majority, where Latvian was taught as a subject and religious studies were taught in Latvian. Schools with Latvian as the only language only appeared after Latvia gained independence.

During the First Free State there were three secondary schools, 25 primary schools, two technical schools, a trade school, a secondary school of applied arts, a trade institute, a technical evening craft school, a Jewish craft school, a fishing and fish farming school. There was also a folk conservatory and various evening courses. In December 1919, a separate children&#x27;s section was opened in the library – the first in Latvia.

After World War II, Liepāja was home to the Liepāja Pedagogical Institute (founded in 1954; in 1945 as the Pedagogical School, in 1950 as the Liepāja Teachers&#x27; Institute), the General Technical Faculty of the Riga Polytechnic Institute, a maritime school, a medical school, a polytechnic, the Liepāja Applied Arts High School (founded in 1926), a music school, ten comprehensive schools, two vocational-technical high schools and two technical schools.

=== Today ===
Liepāja has wide educational resources. In March 2019, the Liepāja City Council decided to merge Secondary School No. 2 with Secondary School No. 12 to form a new secondary school, taking full advantage of the modernised learning environment of Secondary School No. 2, In 2022, the city has 21 kindergartens, twelve general education institutions and two private schools, 2 music schools and two boarding schools providing education in the city&#x27;s largest residential districts. Interest education for children and youth is available in 8 municipal institutions: Children and Youth Centre, Youth Centre, Centre for Young Technicians, Art and Creation Centre &quot;Vaduguns&quot;, Complex Sport School, Gymnastics School, Tennis Sports School, Sports School &quot;Daugava&quot; (football, track-and-field athletics) and Basketball Sports School.

== Culture ==

Liepāja is known as a city rich in deep cultural and historical traditions, and has a very important place in the cultural landscape of Latvia and the region. Liepāja is home to both state and municipal institutions, as well as the University of Liepāja and privately funded artistic groups and departments. The city has a remarkable legacy in terms of its historical cultural environment, buildings, monuments, visual art collections, museums and libraries. Liepāja has a strong tradition of performing arts and intangible cultural heritage – crafts, folk art, traditional culture – in both Latvian and minority groups. Cultural tourism and creative industries are developing. There is a strong cultural education base (in its professional forms). Certain sectors are relatively underdeveloped in Liepāja (fine arts, literature, declining cinema, etc.).

Liepāja took part in the competition for the European Capital of Culture (ECOC) status in 2014, but on 15 September 2009 the European Commission jury recommended that Riga be awarded the status. Having taken part in the competition for the European Capital of Culture status in 2027, on 10 May 2022 the jury awarded the status to Liepāja.

=== Symbols ===
Liepāja has three officially approved symbols: a coat of arms, a flag and an anthem. The coat of arms was adopted four days after the jurisdiction gained city rights on 18 March 1625, and the present version is introduced in 1925; while the flag was first officially proclaimed in 1938 with the &quot;Law on the Flag of the City of Liepāja&quot;. The coat of arms of Liepāja is described as: &quot;on a silver background, the lion of Courland with a divided tail, who leans upon a linden () tree with its forelegs&quot;. The flag of Liepāja has the coat of arms in the center, with red in the top half and green in the bottom. The anthem &quot;The City where the Wind is Born&quot; (&quot;Pilsētā, kurā piedzimst vējš&quot;) was approved in 1999 and premiered in the first hour of 2000. Imants Kalniņš wrote the song &quot;In the City where the Wind is Born&quot; in 1973, dedicating it to Liepāja and the people of Liepāja, with lyrics by Māris Čaklais. It was first performed by Austra Pumpure, and even then the song gained the status of an unofficial anthem of Liepāja residents. Liepāja also has its own special dish – &#x27;Liepājas menciņi&#x27; (smoked, dried cod with potatoes, onions and dill in heavy cream, fried in a ceramic pot), which is based on an ancient recipe from South Courland. Dried, smoked or lightly dried codfish was used in the diet of the coastal inhabitants of Courland – Livonians and Curonians – even before the arrival of German settlers in the 13th century.

The use of Liepāja&#x27;s symbols is regulated by the Binding Regulations adopted by the City Council on 25 February 1999.

<text>Shannon Airport () is an international airport located in County Clare in Ireland. It is adjacent to the Shannon Estuary and lies halfway between Ennis and Limerick. With almost 2 million passengers in 2023, the airport is the third busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and the fifth busiest on the island. Shannon has had a long association with transatlantic flight, owing to its position on the west coast of Ireland and being the most westerly international airport in Europe. One half of Shanwick Oceanic Control, which controls all air traffic on the north eastern quadrant of the North Atlantic Ocean is located close to the airport in nearby Ballygirreen.

The airport was built in the late 1930s, with the first commercial flight taking place in 1939. Shannon was the landing point for the first transatlantic proving flight in 1945 and became the world&#x27;s first duty-free airport in 1947. By the 1960s, it was a busy refuelling stop for many transatlantic carriers. Europe&#x27;s first United States border preclearance facility opened in 1986. At , Shannon has the longest runway in Ireland, which allowed it to be a designated alternative landing site for the Space Shuttle.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
In the late 1930s, transatlantic air traffic was dominated by flying boats, and a flying boat terminal was located at Foynes on the south side of the Shannon Estuary. However, it was realised that changing technology would require a permanent runway and airport.
In 1936, the Government of Ireland confirmed that it would develop a site at Rineanna for the country&#x27;s first transatlantic airport. The land on which the airport was to be built was boggy and on 8 October 1936 work began to drain it. In July 1939, a SABENA Savoia-Marchetti S.73 from Brussels via Croydon Airport was the first commercial flight to use the Rineanna airfield.

By 1942, a serviceable airport had been established and was named Shannon Airport. BOAC began scheduled service to Bristol on 21 February 1942 to provide a land plane connection between England and the flying boat terminal at Foynes. Aer Lingus began scheduled service to Dublin in August 1942.

=== Transatlantic service ===

By the end of World War II in 1945, the existing runways at Shannon were extended to allow transatlantic flights to take off. The first Air Services Agreement between Ireland and the United States in 1945 permitted U.S. airlines to serve only Shannon, and permitted Irish airlines to serve only Boston, Chicago and New York.

On 16 September 1945, the first transatlantic proving flight, a Pan Am DC-4, landed at Shannon from Gander. On 24 October 1945, the first scheduled transatlantic commercial flight using a land plane, an American Overseas Airlines DC-4, &quot;Flagship New England&quot;, stopped at the airport on the New York City–Gander–Shannon–London route. Trans World Airlines began service between New York and Paris via Gander and Shannon on 5 February 1946, and began a Shannon-Dublin tag flight in 1971 after the US Civil Aeronautics Board threatened to ban Aer Lingus from landing in New York. Aerlinte Eireann began service from Dublin to New York via Shannon on 28 April 1958.

In 1947, the &quot;Customs Free Airport Act&quot; established Shannon as the world&#x27;s first duty-free airport, a move promoted by Brendan O&#x27;Regan. Shannon became a model for other duty-free facilities worldwide.

In 1969, it was announced that a new government agency, Aer Rianta (now the Dublin Airport Authority), would be given responsibility for Shannon Airport. Passenger numbers at the airport reached 460,000 that year. With the increase in passengers and the introduction of the Boeing 747, it was decided that a new enlarged terminal was needed. The first commercial operation of a 747 took place in April 1971, while the new terminal officially opened in May that year.

=== Aeroflot service ===
Aeroflot began service to Shannon in September 1975 as a stop between the Soviet Union and other Communist bloc countries, such as Cuba and Angola. Aeroflot kept its own fuel storage at Shannon and allowed the airport to sell the Soviet fuel to other airlines.

The United States demanded that Ireland suspend Aeroflot&#x27;s Shannon operations following the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983, and Ireland temporarily banned Aeroflot later that year. Nonetheless, the Aeroflot operation returned and developed into a hub by the mid-1990s, with flights to New York, Chicago, Washington, Miami, and Havana, largely using Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft.

The cooperation between Aeroflot and Aer Rianta at Shannon also led to a joint venture between the two companies to open duty-free shops at Sheremetyevo Airport in 1987.

On 30 September 1994, Shannon was the site of the &quot;circling over Shannon&quot; diplomatic incident involving Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

=== The &quot;Shannon stopover&quot; ===
In 1990, the U.S.-Irish bilateral agreement was changed to allow Irish airlines to serve Los Angeles and additional U.S. airlines to serve Dublin via Shannon. An amendment in 1993 allowed airlines to provide direct transatlantic services to Dublin, but 50% of transatlantic flights had to either originate or stop over in Shannon. During the 1990s, the airport began to struggle. However, 1996 saw the beginning of Continental Airlines flying between Dublin, Shannon and Newark, New Jersey. Shannon began to rebound in the late 1990s with the success of the Irish economy, the improving situation in Northern Ireland and an influx of American tourists.

In 2005, an agreement was reached regarding a transitional period. Beginning in November 2006 and ending in April 2008, the agreement gradually eliminated restrictions on cargo services. For passenger service, it reduced the stopover requirement and allowed Irish airlines to serve three additional U.S. destinations.

In 2007, the European Union and the U.S. announced that an agreement had been reached on an open skies aviation policy (EU–US Open Skies Agreement). The agreement came into effect from 30 March 2008, leading to the abolition of the Shannon Stopover, although this would have happened under the 2005 agreement anyway.

=== 2000s ===
Ryanair increased services and passenger numbers at the airport until 2008. In 2007, Shannon carried 3.2 million passengers. However, after a disagreement with the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in 2008, Ryanair announced that the number of based aircraft would be reduced from four to one and 150 jobs would be lost.

CityJet launched a twice-daily route to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2008 when Aer Lingus closed its London Heathrow flights. The company based an Avro RJ85 at Shannon. More services were under consideration, including a route to London City Airport; however CityJet pulled out of Shannon in October 2009 after Aer Lingus reinstated its Heathrow flights.

=== Independent operation, 2012 to present ===
In December 2012, it was announced that Shannon Airport would separate from the Dublin Airport Authority, which still owns Dublin and Cork airports. On 31 December 2012 at 11:59 pm, Shannon Airport became a publicly owned commercial airport and is now operated and run by the Shannon Airport Authority plc. Shannon announced a target in 2012 to grow its passenger numbers to 2.5 million annually within five years. However, Shannon has fallen short of its stated targeted figure with just 1.74 million flying through the airport in 2017.

In March 2013, the new company appointed Neil Pakey as its first CEO. Traffic figures for June 2013 report an 8% increase on the previous year, the first time a traffic increase has been recorded in three years. On 21 March 2013, Ryanair announced a new twice-weekly route to Alicante, Spain, to begin on 5 June for the summer months. That brought Shannon&#x27;s total to 33 seasonal scheduled summer routes. In August 2013, Aer Lingus announced a 1x weekly service to Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain, every Saturday during the winter months, using an A320. In October 2013, United Airlines confirmed it will increase capacity by 88% on its Shannon-Chicago route for 2014. In late 2013, Aer Lingus announced 2 new routes to Málaga, Spain, (two weekly) and to Bristol, UK, (one daily). Ryanair also announced 8 new routes from Shannon to continental Europe. The new routes began from the start of April 2014, and a second Boeing 737-800 was based at Shannon to accommodate the extra 300,000 passengers a year it would bring in. The destinations announced were Berlin Schonefeld, Beauvais, Memmingen, Warsaw Modlin, Kraków, Nice, Faro, and Fuerteventura.

On 4 July 2014, the &quot;Bank of Ireland Runway Night Run&quot; featured 1,200 people running along Shannon&#x27;s runway to raise money for charity.

In late 2014, Aer Lingus Regional operator Stobart Air said that they would close their Shannon base in early 2015. They returned in June 2015 operating six flights weekly Birmingham service followed by six flights weekly Edinburgh service. In late 2015, they announced a new CEO for Shannon, Matthew Thomas. Ryanair announced that it will be ending its Paris and Memmingen routes in late 2016, and it also reduced its Manchester and London Stansted routes. Ryanair is aiming for 720,000 passengers in Summer 2017 even though they were close to 800,000 in Summer 2016. In October 2016, SAS announced a new route to Stockholm from 1 August 2017 to 7 October 2017. Shortly after that, Lufthansa announced a weekly service to Frankfurt, running from April to October in 2017. In September 2017, Ryanair announced a new Route to Reus. It will run through summer 2018 operating 2x weekly (Tuesdays and Saturdays), replacing the route to Berlin. The same day, Air Canada announced a new 4x weekly service to Toronto with the Boeing 737 MAX. In February 2018, Ryanair announced it would resume flights to Bristol and Liverpool from May 2018. In late 2018, Ryanair announced a new twice weekly service to Ibiza, and the resumption of flights to East Midlands, both beginning in April 2019. The East Midlands, Bristol and Ibiza flights are all being ceased at the end of the 2019 summer season due to fears of Brexit and the 737 MAX groundings. Due to the 737 MAX groundings, Air Canada and Norwegian Airlines suspended their routes to Shannon. This reduced the number of passenger by 120,000. On 23 October 2019, Lauda announced that they will launch a twice weekly flight to Shannon from their base in Vienna, operating every Wednesday and Saturday. The airport handled 1,864,762 passengers in 2018. This number is the highest passenger numbers since gaining independence from the DAA.

=== Usage for military stopovers ===
Shannon Airport has a history of foreign military use. A large part of its business in recent years has been military stopovers, currently almost all American; however, the airport was also frequently used by the Soviet military until the 1990s, since Ireland, having a traditional policy of military neutrality, was not a member of NATO. There were some restrictions, such as carrying no arms, ammunition, or explosives, and that the flights in question did not form part of military exercises or operations. Shannon saw military transports throughout the Cold War and during the first Gulf War.

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Irish government offered the use of Shannon to the US government. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, the government still allowed United States Armed Forces to use the airport. This caused controversy and was the subject of protests and a challenge brought to the High Court. As of November 2008, approximately 1.2 million troops had passed through Shannon since the beginning of the Iraq War. In 2012–2013, the military flight contracts are held by Omni Air International.

On 6 December 2005, the BBC programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; alleged that Shannon was used on at least 33 occasions by United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) flights, thought to be part of a US policy called extraordinary rendition. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the number to be 33, though referring to &quot;Ireland&quot; rather than Shannon, while Amnesty International has alleged the number of flights to be 50. Casement Aerodrome has seen similar reports. The United States and Ireland have denied these allegations. German Khaled El-Masri, who was mistakenly tortured by the CIA after being abducted by the Macedonian police, was taken to an Afghan black site by a plane which had stopped at Shannon Airport on its way to North Macedonia to pick him up. In response, Amnesty International Ireland reported that &quot;the Irish Government knew that the CIA used Shannon Airport as part of their renditions operations&quot; and called for an independent investigation into the use of Shannon Airport for extraordinary renditions operation by the USA.

After a call by the Irish Human Rights Commission that the Irish government inspect aircraft supposed to be a part of the US extraordinary rendition program, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern rejected these proposals. In a leaked diplomatic cable written by US Ambassador to Ireland Thomas C. Foley, Foley reported that Ahern thought it &quot;might not be a bad idea to allow the random inspection of a few planes to proceed, which would provide cover if a rendition flight ever surfaced. He seemed quite convinced that at least three flights involving renditions had refueled at Shannon Airport before or after conducting renditions elsewhere&quot;.

== Facilities ==
=== Overview ===
The current airport terminal was opened on 27 March 2000 by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Mary O&#x27;Rourke. This facility has 40 check-in desks, five baggage carousels and 14 boarding gates (including six airbridges). There are nearly 20 aircraft parking stands. The car parks can hold 4,200 cars.

Much of the older landside section of the airport has been renovated with new &#x27;Shannon Airport&#x27; branding. An airside area renovation and passenger separation project was completed in Summer 2010.

When Eirjet existed, its head office was located on the grounds of Shannon Airport.

In 2024, Aer Lingus announced the airline would be closing its Shannon based cargo facility citing low demand and lack of commercial justification to remain present there. Cargo operations managed by IAG Cargo reviewed the ongoing operations at Shannon airport and decided it would be beneficial to close the facility at the end of 2024.

=== U.S. Customs and Border Protection pre-clearance ===

In 1986, a United States border preclearance facility was opened at Shannon, eliminating the need to go through immigration on arrival in the United States. This operation was administered by the US Justice Department, specifically the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The first port director was Denis Riordan, who led the operation from 1988 to 1998.

In November 2008, it was announced that US customs and agriculture inspections would be added, making Shannon the first airport in Europe to offer this service and to enable passengers to arrive in New York on a &quot;domestic&quot; basis. To have these facilities put in place, a two-storey, extension to the main terminal building was constructed. The facility opened the morning of 5 August 2009.

These services were extended to cover private aircraft in 2010, making Shannon the first airport in Europe to offer US border preclearance for private aircraft. Shannon is the only airport to do so in Europe as of September 2016.

Between 2009 and 2020, British Airways operated business class–only flights between London City Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Of these, the westbound flights stopped for fuel in Shannon to allow them to take off from the short runway of the London City Airport, which is located in the London Docklands area. This stop also allowed passengers to clear US Customs and Immigration in Shannon rather than at JFK. Introduced in 2009, two flights per day, one of which carried the flight number BA1, were operated using A318 aircraft capable of operating steep approaches. The flights were halved in 2017, and in 2020, amid their suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that the flights would not be resumed.

===Security===
In 2021, Shannon Airport deployed CT scanners at passenger security checkpoints, enabling it to lift the restrictions on liquids which had been in place since 2006.

== Ground transportation ==

=== Road ===
Shannon Airport is the end destination of the N19 national route, which connects to the N18/M18 Limerick–Ennis–Galway route. It is also the western end of European road E20. A dual carriageway section of the N19 was finished in 2004, bypassing the town of Shannon, and a new interchange and dual carriageway north to Ennis were completed in 2007 on the N18 (M18). It is approximately west of Limerick and around south of Galway. Dublin is approximately away and Cork is around away.

=== Bus ===
Bus Éireann services from/to the airport:
* Route 51: Galway – Limerick – Cork
* Route 343: Limerick – Shannon – Ennis
From 20th June 2024 Expressway will commence route X51 on nonstop service to both Galway and Limerick 

=== Car hire ===
Car hire is available in the arrivals hall of the terminal building, with five car rental firms operating at the airport. Private-hire coaches and buses such as Eirebus are available from many operators; these need to be pre-booked and can transport passengers to any destination in Ireland.

=== Car parking ===
Shannon Airport offers both short-term and long-term parking within the airport with over 5,000 spaces available. All car parks operate 24 hours and are regularly patrolled by Airport Police.

=== Rail link ===
For many years, a rail link to the airport (as a spur from the nearby Limerick–Ennis line) has been proposed, but nothing has materialised. Connecting with the nearest major stations (Ennis railway station and Limerick railway station) requires bus or taxi. Sixmilebridge is the nearest station to the airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==

Due to the location of Shannon, the airport receives a large number of emergency stopovers.

* 16 July 1943 – British Overseas Airways Corporation de Havilland DH91 &quot;Fortuna&quot; crash-landed short of the Runway 14 threshold. There were no injuries.
* 18 June 1946 – an Aer Lingus Douglas DC-3, EI-ACA, &quot;Charlie Alpha&quot;, on a domestic flight from Rineanna to Dublin crashed shortly after takeoff with only minor injuries reported. The aircraft made a wheels-up landing short of the runway and was damaged beyond repair.
* 28 December 1946 – TWA Lockheed Constellation NC86505 Flight 6963 crashed attempting to land at the airport in poor visibility. The aircraft was routing Paris, Shannon, Gander, New York. The aircraft crashed on its second attempt short of runway 14 on Inishmacnaughtan Island. Nine of the 23 people on board died.
* 15 April 1948 – Pan Am Flight 1-10, a Lockheed Constellation crashed attempting to land at the airport. 30 Passengers and crew died in the post crash fire. There was one survivor.
* 5 September 1954 – Lockheed Super Constellation PH-LKY, KLM Flight 633 from Amsterdam to New York City, using Shannon as a refuelling stop, crashed just after takeoff into a mudbank adjacent to the airport. 28 people on board died. There were 28 survivors.
* 15 July 1956 – a Swissair Convair CV-440-11 crashed on approach to the airport due to pilot error. The aircraft was on its delivery flight from San Diego, California, to Zürich via New York, Gander and Shannon. The crash killed all four crew on board.
* 14 August 1958 – Lockheed Super Constellation PH-LKM KLM Flight 607-E from Amsterdam to New York crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after a refuelling stop at Shannon, killing all 99 passengers and crew on board.
* 22 June 1959 - Pan American DC-6B N5026K, Clipper Panama, caught fire and burned on the runway as it was preparing to take off. The aircraft was preparing for a flight to New York. The number 1 propeller blade on the number 4 engine detached due to metal fatigue. The imbalance on the spinning propeller caused the engine to detach from the engine housing and a fire erupted on the wing. The eight occupants escaped from the aircraft, which was subsequently destroyed by fire.
* 26 February 1960 – an Alitalia Douglas DC-7C I-DUVO crashed after the port wingtip struck the wall of a cemetery after taking off from the airport. The aircraft had made an unscheduled refuelling stop en route from Rome to New York. The aircraft had not gained sufficient height to clear the hilltop where the cemetery is located. The aircraft then crashed in the field where it exploded and disintegrated, scattering wreckage over a wide area. 34 people out of 52 passengers and crew on board died as a result of the accident. One cabin crew member, a steward who was seated at the rear of the aircraft, survived the accident.
* 26 March 1961 - An Eagle Airways DC-6A G-APOM was damaged and subsequently destroyed by fire during a touch and go training exercise. The aircraft had landed on runway 24 and was accelerating for takeoff when the landing gear was inadvertently raised before the aircraft became airborne. The DC-6 settled onto the runway, veered to the left off the paved surface and onto the grass. A fire began on the port wing and eventually consumed and destroyed the aircraft. There were no injuries among the six crew, who evacuated the aircraft.
* 10 September 1961 – a President Airlines Douglas DC-6 crashed into the river Shannon after taking off from the airport on a flight to Gander. The disaster killed all 83 passengers and crew, one of the worst air disasters in Ireland&#x27;s history. One cabin crew member survived the crash but died a few hours after being rescued.
* 30 September 1977 – an Interconair Bristol 175 Britannia 253 EI-BBY crashed in a field to the right of runway 24 after severe vibration on the approach. The left wing broke off and caught fire, but none of the six crew were injured in the crash.
* 2 October 1977 - Capitol Air DC-8-61 N911CL aborted takeoff on runway 24 as it accelerated for takeoff en route Rome-Shannon-Windsor Locks. There was a failure of tyres on the left main wheel bogie during taxi, and as the aircraft accelerated the tyre shredded and sent tyre fragments up into the wing underside, rupturing the fuel tanks. The escaping fuel ignited and caused a rapid large fire under the left wing. ATC spotted the fire as did the crew of a sister aircraft which was taxiing in after landing. The aircraft was just at the point of V1 when takeoff was abandoned and the DC-8 decelerated and stopped just short of the end of runway 24. The aircraft was evacuated and approximately 50 passengers were injured during the evacuation. The aircraft was seriously damaged but repaired and returned to service a number of months later. Had the aircraft become airborne, it is likely the left wing would have failed and the aircraft would have crashed.
* 20 June 1979 – American Airlines Flight 293 landed in Shannon after being hijacked.
* 5 February 2024 – Cargolux Boeing 747-400 &quot;LX-NCL&quot;, carrying flowers from Miami to Amsterdam, diverted to Shannon Airport due to a cargo deck fire warning. The aircraft landed safely and the crew was evacuated, but airport fire crews found no evidence of heat, smoke or fire. The runway where the flight landed was closed for two hours.

== Environmental issues ==
As Shannon Airport has been built adjacent to the Shannon Estuary, it is likely to have problems with rising sea levels and high waters in the Shannon. The government is working on plans to protect both the airport and the town.

<text>The James Richardson Corporation, also going by the name James Richardson Group or JR/Group, is an Australian furniture, hospitality, real estate and retail corporation, headquartered in the Abbotsford suburb of Melbourne, Australia. It is privately owned and employs approximately 2,300 people worldwide. It is perhaps best known among consumers for its duty-free retail stores in airports and border crossings in Australasia and the Middle East. The company is a household name in Israel due to its duty-free stores in Terminal 3 of Ben Gurion Airport.

==History==

Scottish-born James Richardson (c. 1864–1951) immigrated from Ayrshire to New South Wales in 1886 and worked at the Wentworth Hotel, Sydney before relocating to Melbourne as a barman at Hotel Windsor. By July 1916 Richardson was the proprietor of two wine and spirits stores in Melbourne. In 1928 he commissioned the building of the Hotel Alexander, which became the seventh in his hotel chain and along with his four wine and spirit shops made him &quot;the biggest figure in Australia&#x27;s hotel trade.&quot; He sold off five hotels in 1944 and when he died in August 1951 he was &quot;worth approximately £2 million.&quot;

==Duty-free retail==

===Australia and New Zealand===
Eight duty-free stores in Australia and three in New Zealand operate under the trade name &quot;JR/Duty Free&quot;. Seven are located inside international airports and four in major city centres.

James Richardson first began duty-free retailing in Australia in 1972, opening a single store at Brisbane Airport. The company expanded over the next two decades, opening further duty-free stores in Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport, Perth Airport and Cairns Airport, and twenty-three stores in all major city centres. The company sold this entire operation to Swissair in 1995, choosing instead to concentrate on the furniture and textiles business and the company&#x27;s Israeli duty-free retail operation.

Ten years later, the company, this time trading under its current trade name, &quot;JR/Duty Free&quot;, again reentered the Australian market, opening city centre duty-free stores in Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, and later Brisbane, and winning a ten-year concession to operate at Darwin Airport from February 2007.

In 2009, &quot;JR/Duty Free&quot; was awarded one of the available duty-free concessions in Auckland Airport in New Zealand, and purchased the duty-free concession at Wellington International Airport from a rival firm. Both operations commenced in July of that year, and in 2010, another store opened in Christchurch International Airport.

Over the last few years, &quot;JR/Duty Free&quot; has continued to expand, reopening stores in Cairns Airport in March 2012, Perth Airport in November 2013, and most recently, Brisbane Airport in September 2014.

===Israel===

In 1987, the Israel Airports Authority issued a tender for a total area of more than 1,000 square metres (of retail space) (at Ben Gurion Airport). Five companies bid for the tender and James Richardson was the winner.

The company stores in Israel officially opened on 14 November 1988. The company has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars (into the venture), including a new store with an 800-square metre cosmetics and perfume area, a 300-square metre consumer electronics area, a 150-square metre watch store and a 150-square metre fashion area.

Turnover has increased continuously since the start of operations. Total sales in the first year were about 20 million US dollars, while in recent years the total sales in Israel today is over 400 million: an increase of about 2,000% in 20 years.

There are now eight James Richardson duty-free stores in Terminal 3 of Ben-Gurion Airport. In addition, James Richardson operates duty-free stores at the Allenby Bridge border crossing with Jordan, the Taba Border Crossing with Egypt, and operates at the ports of Haifa and Ashdod - including providing supplies for ships crews, and warehouses for supplies for UN forces and diplomats.

The company also operates a store in Haifa Airport, in cruise ships of the Israeli cruise line Mano, and the duty-free carts on Arkia and Israir flights.

In 1989, James Richardson pioneered a shopping storage and pickup service, which led to increased sales and was subsequently adopted by the company in its other stores in Australia and New Zealand. The service was the brainchild of Ze&#x27;ev Sarig, then responsible for security at Ben Gurion Airport (and later became its managing director). The idea came to him after buying a bottle of whiskey on his way abroad. The service allows passengers to make duty-free purchases before leaving the country, store them at the airport, and receive them upon their return. The service was first implemented in August 1989, and within two months it had already been used by some 8,000 passengers.

<text>Immunosuppression is a reduction of the activation or efficacy of the immune system. Some portions of the immune system itself have immunosuppressive effects on other parts of the immune system, and immunosuppression may occur as an adverse reaction to treatment of other conditions.

In general, deliberately induced immunosuppression is performed to prevent the body from rejecting an organ transplant. Additionally, it is used for treating graft-versus-host disease after a bone marrow transplant, or for the treatment of auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, or Crohn&#x27;s disease. This is typically done using medications, but may involve surgery (splenectomy), plasmapheresis, or radiation. A person who is undergoing immunosuppression, or whose immune system is weak for some other reasons (such as chemotherapy or HIV), is said to be &quot;immunocompromised&quot;.

==Deliberately induced==

Administration of immunosuppressive medications or immunosuppressants is the main method for deliberately inducing immunosuppression; in optimal circumstances, immunosuppressive drugs primarily target hyperactive components of the immune system. People in remission from cancer who require immunosuppression are not more likely to experience a recurrence. Throughout its history, radiation therapy has been used to decrease the strength of the immune system. Dr. Joseph Murray of Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for work on immunosuppression.

Immunosuppressive drugs have the potential to cause immunodeficiency, which can increase susceptibility to opportunistic infection and decrease cancer immunosurveillance. Immunosuppressants may be prescribed when a normal immune response is undesirable, such as in autoimmune diseases.

Steroids were the first class of immunosuppressant drugs identified, though side-effects of early compounds limited their use. The more specific azathioprine was identified in 1960, but it was the discovery of ciclosporin in 1980 (together with azathioprine) that allowed significant expansion of transplantation to less well-matched donor-recipient pairs as well as broad application to lung transplantation, pancreas transplantation, and heart transplantation. After an organ transplantation, the body will nearly always reject the new organ(s) due to differences in human leukocyte antigen between the donor and recipient. As a result, the immune system detects the new tissue as &quot;foreign&quot;, and attempts to remove it by attacking it with white blood cells, resulting in the death of the donated tissue. Immunosuppressants are administered in order to help prevent rejection; however, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections and malignancy during the course of such treatment.

==Non-deliberate immunosuppression==

Non-deliberate immunosuppression can occur in, for example, ataxia–telangiectasia, complement deficiencies, many types of cancer, and certain chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The unwanted effect in non-deliberate immunosuppression is immunodeficiency that results in increased susceptibility to pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses.

Immunodeficiency is also a potential adverse effect of many immunosuppressant drugs, in this sense, the scope of the term &quot;immunosuppression&quot; in general includes both beneficial and potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system.

B cell deficiency and T cell deficiency are immune impairment that individuals are born with or are acquired, which in turn can lead to immunodeficiency problems. Nezelof syndrome is an example of an immunodeficiency of T-cells.

<text>DB Cargo (; previously known as Railion and DB Schenker Rail) is an international transport and logistics company. It is responsible for all of the rail freight transport activities of the German railway company Deutsche Bahn (the DB Group) both inside Germany and on a global level. DB Cargo has a registered office in Mainz and a further administrative office in Frankfurt am Main.

The company was founded as &quot;DB Cargo AG&quot; on 1 January 1999 under the second stage of liberalisation reform of the German railway system (Bahnreform) underway around this time. Initial operations were primarily focused on the rail freight market within Germany; however, during early 2000, the company was reorganised under the &quot;Railion&quot; holding company as part of a merger between DB Cargo and the Dutch state-owned rail company Nederlanse Spoorwegen&#x27;s rail freight operations. This new structure was designed for the cooperation, and incorporation, of future partnerships with other rail freight companies; between 2004 and 2009, Railion expanded its operations into Italy, Switzerland, and Poland, typically via acquisitions. Following the acquisition of Schenker AG in the early 2000s, the company was restructured again and adopted the &quot;DB Schenker Rail&quot; branding. During 2016, to indicate its core focus on rail freight transportation, the company was once more rebranded as &quot;DB Cargo AG&quot;; this naming scheme has been progressively replicated across the majority of its international subsidiaries as well.

The services provided by DB Cargo include both block train and single wagonload transport services, the latter of which have been abandoned by many of the company&#x27;s rivals. Based on the number of kilometres travelled, DB Cargo is the market leader in both Germany and Europe, although its transport services have been in decline for several years. Seeking to reverse this decline, a more flexible price structure was adopted alongside various cost-cutting measures in 2016. During the early 2020s, major global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have challenged the company and driven changes. Within the context of the battle against climate change, however, the role of DB Cargo is also thought to be increasingly important, as the company offers transport options that are entirely carbon neutral. However, the company has been criticised for a lack of investment into both its rolling stock and infrastructure, and thus constraining its performance. In late 2019, Sigrid Evelyn Nikutta took on the role of CEO of DB Cargo.

== History ==
=== German rail reform ===
At the end of the 1990s, the operational business of Deutsche Bahn was reorganised into five legally independent joint-stock companies. This measure formed part of the second stage of the German rail reform. Within the scope of this restructuring, a precursor company was initially established in 1997, which had the purpose of facilitating a transformation of the entity&#x27;s rail freight transport division structured under public law into a private enterprise company. Accordingly, on 1 January 1999, the company &quot;DB Cargo AG&quot; was ultimately founded to undertake these operations. The headquarters of DB Cargo AG were established in Mainz.

=== European expansion ===
At first, DB Cargo solely focused on its domestic activities. Accordingly, the Deutsche Bahn Group produced investment plans that directed billions in its subsidiary in order to improve its position in the German transport and logistics market. As the competitive environment with other European providers became increasingly challenging in the late 1990s, Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Dutch state-owned rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) announced plans to merge their rail freight transport activities in 1998.

Together, DB Cargo and NS Cargo reached revenues of around 6.9 billion Deutsche Mark (3.5 billion euros) and had roughly 50,000 employees. Their amalgamation was the first ever cross-border rail merger, in which Deutsche Bahn retained its majority share of 94%. A financial holding company, &quot;Railion GmbH&quot;, was created for this new company, and commenced operations during early 2000.

=== Internationalisation ===
The successful creation and launch of Railion laid the foundation for the establishment of a leading European transport and logistics company. Specifically, from the onset, the organisation was open to the incorporation of further partners. While the European Commission and European Parliament aimed to promote competition among providers, the providers themselves instead opted to foster cooperation. During 2001, the Danish state-owned rail company Danske Statsbaner (DSB) opted to merge its rail freight transport activities into the joint venture, becoming its third partner and received shares totalling 2% in Railion in return, thus decreasing the stake of Deutsche Bahn in the venture to 92%.

The cooperation between DB, NS and DSB has reportedly played an essential role in Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s long-term strategy for expansion in other European countries. This strategy covered not only state-owned rail companies but also the acquisition of private sector rivals, for example in Italy (2004), Switzerland (2007) and Poland (2009). These were joined by a multitude of smaller acquisitions such as the transport and logistics divisions of RAG AG. In Sweden, where Deutsche Bahn was unable to acquire its chosen target, the company instead focused on establishing collaborative ventures. At the end of the 2000s, Railion was therefore able to not only offer connections across large stretches of Europe running from north to south, but reliably serve rail route that run from west to east as well.

Despite this expansion into the rai freight sectors of several neighbouring nations, the presence of effective competition to provide freight services had reportedly made a negative impact on the company&#x27;s economic development by May 2005. Recognising the company&#x27;s unfavourable financial position, Deutsche Bahn opted to respond by enacting numerous cost-saving measures; these were credited with a significant improvement in Railion&#x27;s circumstances. During 2010, the rail freight transport crisis was initially deemed to have been largely resolved.

=== Linking rail and road ===
During early 2003, Deutsche Bahn transferred its share in Railion to the (which later became &quot;DB Mobility Logistics&quot;). After the successful acquisition of the then-listed logistics company &quot;Stinnes&quot;, including its freight forwarding subsidiary Schenker AG, a restructuring of responsibilities took place within Deutsche Bahn. Subsequently, DB Cargo, NS Cargo and most of the other Railion companies solely focused on freight forwarding while Stinnes and Schenker took on central tasks in the fields of rail freight transport and sales. By consolidating all of its transport and logistics activities, Deutsche Bahn also aimed to achieve growth in the freight transport domain. The company adjusted its image to reflect this aim and as a result, DB Cargo was renamed &quot;Railion Deutschland&quot;.

At this point, the general objective pursued by Deutsche Bahn was to better cover the entire transport chain with all transportation means and routes. Over the years that followed, however, this approach mainly resulted in a shift of its freight transport activities away from the rails and towards the road network instead. The company realised that it needed to improve the links between its rail and road transport in particular, and securing acquisitions was one way to do so. In 2009, Deutsche Bahn abandoned the Railion brand and instead chose to consolidate all of its rail freight transport activities under the name DB Schenker Rail. At the time, its organisational structure remained unchanged. Media reports, however, already began to speculate about a stock market launch of the newly formed DB Schenker division.

=== Company restructuring ===
During the 2010s, the business operations of DB Schenker Rail experienced a significant decline. One of the primary factors behind this decline was the economic slump that had followed the global economic and financial crisis. The company initially responded to this negative development by introducing a more flexible price structure. It aimed to use a combination of block trains for large clients and bookings of single wagons to establish a fixed timetable that would in turn increase the capacity utilisation of its trains. Other measures considered included the closure of numerous freight railway stations in order to reduce fixed costs, and efforts to reduce staff headcount at all levels of the business.

News of these cost reduction measures was quickly met with sharp criticism by various trade unions; their opposition included demands that the approach be abandoned immediately, and accusations of the company&#x27;s mismanagement. Following several months of negotiations, the Deutsche Bahn Group and its works council finally agreed on a restructuring programme for DB Cargo during February 2007. Under this programme, the previously proposed across-the-board job cuts that year were avoided, instead, the new approach aimed for the gradual reduction of headcount over a period of several years. On the whole, the company retained its ambition to grow its freight transport activities.

To reflect the company&#x27;s focus on its core business activities in the domain of rail freight transport, it was again renamed, adopting the &quot;DB Cargo AG&quot; designation in early 2016. The name was also readopted for its most important German and international subsidiaries and continues to apply in the present day. Accordingly, DB Cargo and DB Schenker are equal sister companies within the integrated rail system of the DB Group.

=== Recent developments ===
According to media reports, DB Cargo reduced its fleet size by nearly one half in the 2000s and 2010s. The remaining locomotives were increasingly replaced by multi-system models that can also be used in the international rail network. Furthermore, the company also equipped its inventory of wagons with whisper brakes, which had reportedly halved the noise pollution generated by the movement of its freight trains. Another area of investment by the company has been the addition of state-of-the-art sensors and telematics, which has reportedly been responsible for improvements in its competitiveness. Seeking to progress developments in this area, between 2016 and 2019, DB Cargo played a leading role in the &quot;Innovative Freight Wagons&quot; research project conducted on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BWVI). Although the wagons used by DB Cargo have generally become older in recent years, they have also increased in size so that they can transport larger quantities of goods.

As of 2020, the majority of freight is still being transported by road, DB Cargo stands to gain from the increased interest in its services due to the expectation that rail freight transport will play an essential role in achieving climate targets. Within this context and based on expert opinions, in September 2019, the German Federal Government announced plans to transfer millions of lorry trips from road to rail, although similar attempts made in previous years had reportedly achieved little progress. One of the main measures planned towards achieving this aim is the gradual optimisation of train drivers&#x27; productivity. The current changes being implemented at DB Cargo form part of the strategy to strengthen Deutsche Bahn in its entirety that was launched in 2019.

During the global outbreak of the novel respiratory disease COVID-19, which hindered cross-border logistics due to limitations in the area of passenger and goods transport, the company was able to secure its transport operations successfully. DB Cargo provided additional capacities for transporting supplies for the population, especially food and hygiene products. The running of large special freight services, such as the &quot;Pasta Express&quot; from Italy, attracted considerable media attention. Shortly after the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, DB Cargo started hauling aid from across Europe to Ukraine; however, military officials have issued warnings that DB Cargo lacks sufficient capacity to meet the needs of a large scale military conflict in Eastern Europe.

== Organisational structure ==

DB Cargo AG, a public limited company under German law, acts as a holding company for the operational entities. Its corporate purpose covers rail and road services for the transportation of all kinds of goods and the procurement and operation of stationary and mobile means of transport such as locomotives, railcars, wagons and other containers. Its articles of association also cover related services. The holding company is entitled to carry out all activities deemed to serve the specified business purpose either directly or indirectly. This includes the establishment and management of companies and the acquisition of other companies.

=== Owners ===
DB Cargo AG has a share capital of 256,007,000,000 euros, which is divided into 51,201,400 no-par value bearer shares. When it transferred the assets and liabilities of its former freight transport division as part of the spin-off for the establishment of a new company, Deutsche Bahn AG acquired all of the company&#x27;s shares and is therefore the sole shareholder of DB Cargo AG. A control and profit-and-loss-transfer agreement is in place between the parent company and subsidiary. DB Cargo AG is included in the consolidated financial statement of Deutsche Bahn. The company Deutsche Bahn AG is in turn wholly owned by the Federal Republic of Germany.

=== Management ===
==== Management board ====
The Board of Management of DB Cargo AG is composed of at least two people, one of whom is responsible for staff-related and social matters in connection with employees. Otherwise, the Supervisory Board determines the number and identities of the members of the Board of Management The current Members of the DB Cargo AG Board of Management are Sigrid Evelyn Nikutta (Chairwoman), Ursula Biernert (Human Resources), Thorsten Dieter (Service), Ralf Günter Kloß (Production), Martina Niemann (Finance/Controlling) and Pierre Timmermans (Sales). The percentage of women on the board exceeds the average value of other German companies.

==== Supervisory board ====
The supervisory board of DB Cargo AG has 20 members. It is composed of shareholder and employee representatives in equal measure, who are elected according to the regulations of the and . The supervisory board currently has six female and 14 male members. Its chairman is , who has been the CEO of Deutsche Bahn since 2017. The vice-chairman is Martin Burkert, a member of the board of the (EVG). Claus Weselsky, chairman of the German Train Drivers&#x27; Union (GDL), is another member of the supervisory board, which therefore contains representatives from the two leading trade unions for the rail industry in Germany.

=== Companies ===
The business operations of DB Cargo are divided into three regions: Germany, Central Europe and Western &amp; Eastern Europe. The German company DB Cargo AG is responsible for both operational services in the field of rail freight transport in Germany and central functions such as production, sales, finance and human resources for the entire DB Cargo Group.

During 2010, Deutsche Bahn joined several other railway companies in becoming a partner of the European , represented by its subsidiary DB Schenker Rail (now DB Cargo). Ever since it was established, the alliance has focused on the objective of making single wagonload transport, namely freight trains with wagons used by different clients, a more competitive alternative to lorry transport. Xrail also aims to achieve more customer-friendly service, efficiency and punctuality in cross-border transport, for example with its universal booking system, &quot;Xrail Capacity Booking&quot; (XCB).

== Services ==
=== Service catalogue ===
The service catalogue of DB Cargo consists of a wide variety of basic, additional and special services. The company&#x27;s core products particularly include block train and single wagonload transport services, the combination of rail and road, and carbon-neutral transport, for example for Audi. The latter is becoming increasingly important given that rail transport currently has the lowest carbon emissions of all carriers and also achieved the largest savings in recent years (1995–2015).

The company additionally offers a wide range of industry solutions, for example for the chemicals industry and the timber and building materials trades. DB Cargo is also active on an international level. Its global operations particularly focus on transport between Europe and Asia, where the company has an extensive network. Its service portfolio also includes related services such as the sale and rental of locomotives and wagons.

=== Key figures ===
In the 2018 business year, DB Cargo transported more than 255 million tonnes of goods in 2,686 traction units and 82,895 goods wagons. Leased or hired materials are factored into these totals. The company provided its services on around 4,200 sidings belonging to clients in Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. It transported goods along a route network covering a total of 33,000 kilometres in Germany and, according to calculations by the (BAG), achieved an average punctuality rate of 72.9% when providing these services.

== Criticism ==
During 2019, DB Cargo was reportedly operating at a loss. Critics have accused Deutsche Bahn of having neglected the necessary maintenance work on, and the modernisation of, DB Cargo&#x27;s infrastructure; claims have also been made that the comparably high average age of its locomotives and wagons is a prime example of this problem. In September 2019, the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) responded to criticism by the German Federal Court of Auditors regarding the company&#x27;s lack of investments by arguing that DB Cargo and other segments had yet to exhaust their full potential.

During mid 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted an investigation into the allegedly unfair provision of state aid to DB Cargo from the German government. Limited amounts of state aid, such as to offset the abnormal economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have been approved by the EC in the past.

Single wagonload transport have played a special role in the economic development of DB Cargo and the wider rail freight sector alike. In the late 2010s, experts were issuing demands that the company subsidise its activities, or shrink its business, in this area in order to remain a strong competitive alternative to lorry transport.

Following the Great Belt Bridge rail accident, in which eight people died, a union representative from DB Cargo was convicted of evidence tampering.

<doc id="168954" wikidata="Q7863235" url="?curid=168954" title="U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence">
<text>The U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (National Violence Commission) was formed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in on June 10, 1968, after the April 4 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the June 5 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.

==Background==

The National Violence Commission established task forces on assassination, group violence, individual acts of violence, law enforcement, media and violence, firearms, and violence in American history. As reported by John Herbers in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the Chairman of the commission, Milton Eisenhower, stated that the Task Force Report on Individual Acts of Violence was &quot;by all odds the most important&quot; of the reports written for the commission.

The National Violence Commission was formed only a few months after release of the final report of the Kerner Commission, which assessed the big city protests of the 1960s. In its final report in December 1969, the Violence Commission, as the Kerner Commission, concluded that the most important policy issue was lack of employment and educational opportunity in inner city neighborhoods. The Commission framed lack of inner city opportunity within a larger American economy that prized material success and within a tradition of violence that the media transmitted particularly well:

In one of its most important final report passages, the National Violence Commission observed:
To be a young, poor male; to be undereducated and without means of escape from an oppressive urban environment; to want what the society claims is available (but mostly to others); to see around oneself illegitimate and often violent methods being used to achieve material success; and to observe others using these means with impunity – all this is to be burdened with an enormous set of influences that pull many toward crime and delinquency. To be also a Negro, Mexican or Puerto Rican American and subject to discrimination and segregation adds considerably to the pull of these other criminogenic forces.

The Violence Commission recommended new investments in jobs, training and education – totaling $20B per year in 1968 dollars. A long run &quot;reordering of national priorities&quot; was in order, said the Violence Commission, which shared the Kerner Commission&#x27;s moral vision that there could be no higher claim on the nation&#x27;s conscience. A majority of the members of the National Violence Commission, including both Republicans and Democrats, recommended confiscation of most handguns, restrictions on new handgun ownership to those who could demonstrate reasonable need, and identification of rifle and shotgun owners. &quot;When in man&#x27;s long history other great civilizations fell&quot;, concluded the Violence Commission, &quot;it was less often from external assault than from internal decay…The greatness and durability of most civilizations has been finally determined by how they have responded to these challenges from within. Ours will be no exception.&quot;

==Continuation==

In 1981, the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation was formed as the private sector continuation of both the National Violence Commission and Kerner Commission.
Founding and other early Eisenhower Foundation Trustees included: A. Leon Higginbotham, former Vice Chair of the National Violence Commission and federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge; Fred Harris, former Member of the Kerner Riot Commission and former United States Senator; Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, former Chairman of the 1966 President&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice and former Attorney General of the United States; David Ginsburg, former Executive Director of the Kerner Riot Commission and Counselor to the President during the Johnson Administration; Milton Eisenhower, former Chair of the National Violence Commission and President Emeritus of Johns Hopkins University; Patricia Roberts Harris, former Member of the National Violence Commission and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Edward Brooke, former Member of the Kerner Riot Commission and former United States Senator; Marvin Wolfgang, former co-director of Research on the National Violence Commission and Professor of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania; Henry Cisneros, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former Mayor of San Antonio; Lloyd Cutler, former Executive Director of the National Violence Commission and former Counselor to Presidents Carter and Clinton; Elmer Staats, former Comptroller General of the United States; James Rouse, President of the Rouse Corporation and Founder of the Enterprise Foundation; Frank Stanton, former President of CBS, Inc., and Chairman of the American Red Cross; and Alan Curtis, President of the Eisenhower Foundation.

Mindful of the findings of the two Commissions, the Trustees of the Foundation focused on the inner city. As it evolved, the Foundation&#x27;s mission was to identify, finance, replicate, evaluate, communicate, advocate for and scale up politically feasible multiple solution inner city ventures. The priority was on wraparound and evidence based strategies that worked for the inner city and high risk racial minority youth. Over the decades, examples of evidence-based inner city Eisenhower Foundation successes have included the Quantum Opportunities Program, the Youth Safe Haven-Police Ministation Program, the Argus Learning for Living Program and Full Service Community Schools.

==Updates==

The Eisenhower Foundation has released two updates of the National Violence Commission, as well as updates of the Kerner Riot Commission. Eisenhower Foundation President Alan Curtis edited the Foundation&#x27;s 15 year update of the Violence Commission, published by Yale University Press in 1985. Curtis and Eisenhower Foundation Trustee Elliott Currie, Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California, Irvine, co-authored the Foundation&#x27;s 30 year update in 1999.

The 1985 National Violence Commission update was featured on the &quot;CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot; and presented in a forum at the Harvard Kennedy School, a forum at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, and a forum at the United States Senate at which Senator Edward Kennedy was keynote speaker. The Senate forum was published in a special issue of the &quot;Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot; edited by Curtis and covered in a story in &quot;Foundation News.&quot; The &quot;Foundation News&quot; story concluded:
The policy message that emerged from the [Senate forum] participants was clear. Using a public-private approach, efforts should be made to combine employment, community involvement and family to prevent crime; move away from a federal policy of increased incarceration; reverse the &quot;trickle down&quot; policy of federal anti-crime programs affecting neighborhoods to a &quot;bubble-up&quot; process emanating from the local level; and formulate a new cooperative role for police as supporters, not strictly enforcers.

Titled &quot;To Establish Justice, To Insure Domestic Tranquility&quot;, the 1999 update of the National Violence Commission was featured in a debate on the PBS &quot;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;. Curtis observed to reporter Ray Suarez:

The original Violence Commission predicted that we would have a city of the future in which the middle class would escape to the suburbs, drive to work in sanitized quarters, and work in buildings protected by high tech. That city of the future has come true. An editorial in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; said that city was Detroit.

Domestic tranquility is roughly the same [in 1999 as in 1969] in spite of the increase in prison building. On the other hand, we haven’t had an increase in justice. We have 25 percent of all our young children living in poverty. We have the greatest inequality in terms of wealth and income and wages in the world. One of every three African-Americans is in prison, on probation or on parole at any one time – and one out of every two in cities.

That is a direct result of the racial bias in our sentencing system and our mandatory minimum sentences. For example, crack-cocaine sentences are longer, and crack cocaine is used more by minorities. Powder cocaine sentences are shorter, and powder cocaine is used more by whites. The result is that our prison populations are disproportionately filled with racial minorities. Yet, at the same time, prison building has become a kind of economic development policy for [white] communities which send lobbyists to Washington.
In addition, the National Violence Commission updates were covered by news stories in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;,
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;,
&quot;Newsweek&quot;
and &quot;USA Today&quot;,
interviews on NPR,
and editorials in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;,
&quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;
and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;,
among other media.

For example, the 1999 &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; editorial focused on the Violence Commission&#x27;s 1969 &quot;city of the future&quot; prediction of &quot;suburban neighborhoods, increasingly far-removed from the central city, with homes fortified by an array of security devices; high-speed police-patrolled expressways becoming sterilized corridors connecting safe areas [and] urban streets that will be unsafe in differing degrees…That was in 1969. Sounds like any metropolitan area you know?&quot;

==Firearms policy==
In 2012, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; published commentary by Curtis that reminded the nation of how, in 1969, a majority of National Violence Commission members, including both Republicans and Democrats, recommended confiscation of most handguns, restrictions on new handgun ownership to those who could demonstrate reasonable need, and identification of rifle and shotgun owners.

The Eisenhower Foundation states on its website:Given that America is the only advanced industrialized nation in the world without effective firearms regulations and given that America, not surprisingly, therefore leads the industrialized world in firearms killings, the Foundation believes a new grassroots coalition against firearms in America should build on the recommendations of the National Violence Commission and better integrate the advocacy of, among others, the Brady Campaign, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, racial minorities, women, outraged parents, teachers, youthful voters, grandparents and voters who view firearms control as a key policy against terrorist acts and mass killings.

<text>Wilhelm Frick (12 March 1877 – 16 October 1946) was a convicted war criminal and prominent German politician of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) who served as Minister of the Interior in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s cabinet from 1933 to 1943 and as the last governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

As the head of the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (criminal police) in Munich, Frick took part in Hitler&#x27;s failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, for which he was convicted of high treason. He managed to avoid imprisonment and soon afterwards became a leading figure of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in the Reichstag. In 1930, Frick became the first Nazi to hold a ministerial-level post at any level in Germany in Thuringia as state Minister of the Interior.

After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Frick joined the new government and was named Minister of the Interior. Additionally, on 21 May 1935, Frick was named &quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für die Reichsverwaltung&quot; (General Plenipotentiary for the Administration of the Reich). He was instrumental in formulating laws that consolidated the Nazi regime (&quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;), as well as laws that defined the Nazi racial policy, most notoriously the Nuremberg Laws. On 30 August 1939, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Frick was appointed by Hitler to the six-person Council of Ministers for Defense of the Reich which operated as a war cabinet. Following the rise of the SS, Frick gradually lost favour within the party, and in 1943 he was replaced by Heinrich Himmler as interior minister. Frick remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio until Hitler&#x27;s death in 1945.

After World War II, Frick was tried and convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and executed by hanging.

==Early life==
Born in the Palatinate municipality of Alsenz, then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, Germany, the last of four children of Protestant teacher Wilhelm Frick sen. (d. 1918) and his wife Henriette (née Schmidt). He attended the gymnasium in Kaiserslautern, passing his Abitur exams in 1896. He went on studying philology at the University of Munich, but soon after turned to study law at Heidelberg and Humboldt University of Berlin. He received his doctorate of law in 1901. He joined the Bavarian civil service in 1903, working as an attorney at the Munich Police Department. He was appointed a &quot;Bezirksamtassessor&quot; in Pirmasens in 1907 and became acting district executive in 1914. Rejected as unfit, Frick did not serve in World War I. He was promoted to the official rank of a &quot;Regierungsassessor&quot; and, at his own request, re-assumed his post at the Munich Police Department in 1917.

On 25 April 1910, Frick married Elisabetha Emilie Nagel (1890–1978) in Pirmasens. They had two sons and a daughter. The marriage ended in an ugly divorce in 1934. A few weeks later, on 12 March, Frick remarried in Münchberg Margarete Schultze-Naumburg (1896–1960), the former wife of the Nazi Reichstag MP Paul Schultze-Naumburg. Margarete gave birth to a son and a daughter.

==Nazi career==

In Munich, Frick witnessed the end of the war and the German Revolution of 1918–1919. He sympathized with right-wing &quot;Freikorps&quot; paramilitary units. Chief of Police Ernst Pöhner introduced him to Adolf Hitler, whom he helped willingly with obtaining permission to hold political rallies and demonstrations.

Elevated to the rank of an &quot;Oberamtmann&quot; and head of the Political department of the Munich police from 1923, he and Pöhner participated in Hitler&#x27;s failed Beer Hall Putsch on 9 November. Frick tried to suppress the State Police&#x27;s operation, wherefore he was arrested and imprisoned, and tried for aiding and abetting high treason by the People&#x27;s Court in April 1924. After several months in custody, he was given a suspended sentence of 15 months&#x27; imprisonment and was dismissed from his police job. Later during the disciplinary proceedings, the dismissal was declared unfair and revoked, on the basis that his treasonous intention had not been proven. Frick went on to work at the Munich social insurance office from 1926 onwards, in the rank of a &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; 1st class by 1933.

In the aftermath of the putsch, Wilhelm Frick was elected a member of the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; parliament in the federal election of May 1924. He had been nominated by the National Socialist Freedom Movement, an electoral list of the far-right German Völkisch Freedom Party and then banned Nazi Party. On 1 September 1925, Frick joined the re-established Nazi Party. On 20 May 1928, he was one of the first 12 deputies elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as Nazi Party members. He associated himself with the radical Gregor Strasser; making his name by aggressive anti-democratic and antisemitic Reichstag speeches, he climbed to the post of the Nazi parliamentary group leader (&quot;Fraktionsführer&quot;) in 1928. He would continue to be elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in every subsequent election in the Weimar and Nazi regimes.

In 1929 Thuringian state election, as the price for joining the coalition government of the &quot;Land&quot; (state) of Thuringia, the NSDAP received the state ministries of the Interior and Education. On 23 January 1930, Frick was appointed to these ministries, becoming the first Nazi to hold a ministerial-level post at any level in Germany (though he remained a member of the Reichstag). Frick used his position to dismiss Communist and Social Democratic officials and replace them with Nazi Party members, so Thuringia&#x27;s federal subsidies were temporarily suspended by Reich Minister Carl Severing. Frick also appointed the eugenicist Hans F. K. Günther as a professor of social anthropology at the University of Jena, banned several newspapers, and banned pacifist drama and anti-war films such as &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. He was removed from office by a Social Democratic motion of no confidence in the Thuringian Landtag parliament on 1 April 1931.

==Reich Minister==

When Reich president Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933, Frick joined his government as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the Interior. Together with Reichstag President Hermann Göring, he was one of only two Nazi &quot;Reichsministers&quot; in the original Hitler Cabinet, and the only one who actually had a portfolio; Göring served as minister without portfolio until 5 May. Though Frick held a key position, especially in organizing the federal elections of March 1933, he initially had far less power than his counterparts in the rest of Europe. Notably, he had no authority over the police; in Germany law enforcement has traditionally been a state and local matter. Indeed, the main reason that Hindenburg and Franz von Papen agreed to give the Interior Ministry to the Nazis was that it was almost powerless at the time. A mighty rival arose in the establishment of the Propaganda Ministry under Joseph Goebbels on 13 March.

Frick&#x27;s power dramatically increased as a result of the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933. The provision of the Reichstag Fire Decree giving the cabinet the power to take over state governments on its own authority was actually his idea; he saw the fire as a chance to increase his power and begin the process of Nazifying the country. He was responsible for drafting many of the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; laws that consolidated the Nazi regime. Within two weeks of the Enabling Act&#x27;s passage, Frick helped draft the &quot;Second Law on the Coordination of the States with the Reich&quot; (7 April 1933) appointing &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governors) to take over the state governments. He also initiated and drafted the Law Against the Formation of Parties (14 July 1933) that formally made the NSDAP the only legal party in Germany. Under the 30 January 1934 &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot;, which converted Germany into a highly centralized state, state parliaments were dissolved and the newly implemented &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; were made directly responsible to him. He also drafted the Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat (14 February 1934) that abolished the upper chamber of the Reich parliament. Frick also was made a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. 

On 10 October 1933, Hitler appointed Frick a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 1 May 1934, he replaced Minister-President Göring as Prussian Minister of the Interior, which gave him control over the police in Prussia. As a member of the Prussian cabinet, he also became an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Prussian State Council. By 1935, he also had near-total control over local government. He had the sole power to appoint the mayors of all municipalities with populations greater than 100,000 (except for the city states of Berlin and Hamburg, where Hitler reserved the right to appoint the mayors himself if he deemed it necessary). He also had considerable influence over smaller towns as well; while their mayors were appointed by the state governors, as mentioned earlier the governors were responsible to him.
Frick was instrumental in the racial policy of Nazi Germany drafting laws against Jewish citizens, like the &quot;Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service&quot; and the notorious Nuremberg Laws in September 1935. Already in July 1933, he had implemented the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring including forced sterilizations, which later culminated in the killings of the Action T4 &quot;euthanasia&quot; programme supported by his ministry. Frick also took a leading part in Germany&#x27;s re-armament in violation of the 1919 Versailles Treaty. He drafted laws introducing universal military conscription and extending the Wehrmacht service law to Austria after the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot;, as well as to the &quot;Sudetenland&quot; territories of the First Czechoslovak Republic annexed according to the Munich Agreement.

In the summer of 1938 Frick was named the patron &quot;(Schirmherr)&quot; of the Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest in Breslau, a patriotic sports festival attended by Hitler and much of the Nazi leadership. In this event he presided the ceremony of &quot;handing over&quot; the new Nazi Reich Sports League (NSRL) standard to &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; Hans von Tschammer und Osten, marking the further nazification of sports in Germany. On 11 November 1938, Frick promulgated the Regulations Against Jews&#x27; Possession of Weapons.

From the mid-to-late 1930s Frick lost favour irreversibly within the Nazi Party after a power struggle involving attempts to resolve the lack of coordination within the Reich government. For example, in 1933 he tried to restrict the widespread use of &quot;protective custody&quot; orders that were used to send people to concentration camps, only to be begged off by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. His power was greatly reduced in June 1936 when Hitler named Himmler the Chief of German Police, which effectively united the police with the SS. On paper, Frick was Himmler&#x27;s immediate superior. In fact, the police were now independent of Frick&#x27;s control, since the SS was responsible only to Hitler. A long-running power struggle between the two culminated in Frick&#x27;s being replaced by Himmler as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the Interior in August 1943. However, he remained in the cabinet as a &quot;Reichsminister&quot; without portfolio. Besides Hitler, he and Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk were the only members of the Third Reich&#x27;s cabinet to serve continuously from Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor until his death.

Frick&#x27;s replacement as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the Interior did not reduce the growing administrative chaos and infighting between party and state agencies. Frick was then appointed as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, making him Hitler&#x27;s personal representative in the Czech lands. Its capital Prague, where Frick used ruthless methods to counter dissent, was one of the last Axis-held cities to fall at the end of World War II in Europe.

==Trial and execution==
Frick was arrested, and was arraigned at the Nuremberg trials, where he was the only defendant besides Rudolf Hess who refused to testify on his own behalf. Frick was convicted of planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and for his role, as Minister of the Interior, in formulating the Enabling Act and the Nuremberg Laws – laws under which people were deported to concentration camps, many of them being murdered there. Frick was also accused of being one of the most senior people responsible for the existence of the concentration camps.
Frick was sentenced to death on 1 October 1946, and was hanged at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October. Of his execution, journalist Joseph Kingsbury-Smith wrote:

His body, along with those of the other nine executed men and the corpse of Hermann Göring, was cremated at the Ostfriedhof Cemetery in Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

<doc id="168958" wikidata="Q1243029" url="?curid=168958" title="Friday the 13th (1980 film)">
<text>Friday the 13th is a 1980 American independent slasher film produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, written by Victor Miller, and starring Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, and Kevin Bacon. The plot follows a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while they are attempting to reopen an abandoned summer camp with a tragic past.

Prompted by the success of John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), director Cunningham put out an advertisement to sell the film in &quot;Variety&quot; in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay. After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in New Jersey in the summer of 1979, on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with Paramount Pictures acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while Warner Bros. secured international distribution rights.

Released on May 9, 1980, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was a major box office success, grossing $59.8 million worldwide. Critical response was divided, with some praising the film&#x27;s cinematography and score, while numerous others derided it for its depiction of graphic violence. Aside from being the first independent film of its kind to secure distribution in the U.S. by a major studio, its box office success led to a long series of sequels, a crossover with the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film series, and a 2009 series reboot. A direct sequel, &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;, was released one year later.

== Plot ==
In 1958, at Camp Crystal Lake, two counselors sneak inside a cabin to have sex, where an unseen assailant murders them. In present day, camp counselor and cook Annie Phillips is driven halfway to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake by truck driver Enos. Enos warns her about the camp&#x27;s troubled past, beginning when a young boy drowned in Crystal Lake in 1957. After being dropped off at the halfway point, Annie hitches another ride from an unseen person, who eventually slashes her throat.

At the camp, counselors Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda, and Alice, along with owner Steve Christy, refurbish the cabins. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves for supplies. Ned sees someone walk into a cabin and follows. While Jack and Marcie have sex, they are unaware of Ned&#x27;s dead body above them. When Marcie leaves for the bathroom, Jack&#x27;s throat is pierced with an arrow. The killer kills Marcie next with an axe. Brenda hears a little boy&#x27;s voice calling for help and ventures outside, where the lights turn on. Brenda screams.

Worried by their friends&#x27; disappearances, Alice and Bill investigate. They find the axe in Brenda&#x27;s bed and the phones disconnected. Steve returns and recognizes the unseen killer who stabs him. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator. Alice finds his body pinned with arrows to the door. She flees to the main cabin, where Brenda&#x27;s body is thrown through the window.

Mrs. Voorhees, a middle-aged woman who claims to be a friend of Steve, arrives. She reveals that her son, Jason, was the young boy who drowned in 1957 and she blames his death on neglect by the counselors because they were having sex instead of supervising him. Revealing herself as the killer, she attempts to kill Alice. At the shore, they struggle until Alice is able to decapitate her with a machete. Exhausted, Alice falls asleep inside a canoe that floats out on Crystal Lake. When she awakes, Jason&#x27;s decomposing corpse emerges from the lake and drags her underwater, at which point she awakens in a hospital, surrounded by a police sergeant and medical staff. The sergeant says there was no sign of a boy at the lake, to which Alice says, &quot;Then he&#x27;s still there.&quot;

===Development===

&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on the film &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;. Cunningham, inspired by John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, wanted &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; to be shocking, visually stunning and &quot;[make] you jump out of your seat.&quot; Wanting to distance himself from &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, Cunningham wanted &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; to be more of a &quot;roller-coaster ride&quot;.

The original screenplay was tentatively titled &quot;A Long Night at Camp Blood&quot;. While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, after which Miller began redeveloping. Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; using the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; title. Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were &quot;no problems&quot; with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, &quot;There was a movie before ours called &quot;Friday the 13th: The Orphan&quot;. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.&quot;

The screenplay was completed in mid-1979 by Victor Miller, who later went on to write for several television soap operas, including &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;; at the time, Miller was living in Stratford, Connecticut, near Cunningham, and the two had begun collaborating on potential film projects. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody&#x27;s mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. &quot;I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I&#x27;d always wanted—a mother who would have killed for her kids.&quot; Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers&#x27; decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. &quot;Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain.&quot;

The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script; in Miller&#x27;s final draft, the film ended with Alice merely floating on the lake. Jason&#x27;s appearance was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini stated that &quot;The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen &quot;Carrie&quot;, so we thought that we need a &#x27;chair jumper&#x27; like that, and I said, &#x27;let&#x27;s bring in Jason&#x27;&quot;.

===Casting===
A New York-based firm, headed by Julie Hughes and Barry Moss, was hired to find eight young actors to play the camp&#x27;s staff members. Cunningham admits that he was not looking for &quot;great actors&quot;, but anyone that was likable, and appeared to be a responsible camp counselor. The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need to look good, read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, Kevin Bacon, Laurie Bartram, Peter Brouwer, and Adrienne King, who had previously appeared on soap operas. The role of Alice Hardy was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. The producers originally wanted Sally Field for the role of Alice, but realized that they could not afford an established high-profile actress and went for unknowns instead. According to Adrienne King. &quot;originally, [the producers] were looking really hard for a name actress to play Alice. They finally realized that even if they could find somebody like that who was willing to do it, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford her, so they decided to go with new talent instead.&quot; King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes&#x27;s office, and Cunningham felt she embodied the qualities of Alice. After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last. As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition.
With King cast in the role of lead heroine Alice, Laurie Bartram was hired to play Brenda. Kevin Bacon, Mark Nelson and Jeannine Taylor, who had known each other prior to the film, were cast as Jack, Ned, and Marcie respectively. It is Bacon and Nelson&#x27;s contention that, because the three already knew each other, they already had the specific chemistry the casting director was looking for in the roles of Jack, Ned, and Marcie. Taylor has stated that Hughes and Moss were highly regarded while she was an actress, so when they offered her an audition she felt that, whatever the part, it would &quot;be a good opportunity.&quot;

&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was Nelson&#x27;s first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition, the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which, Nelson acknowledges, made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, &quot;It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.&quot; Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from polio, and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular. Ned is believed to have given birth to the &quot;practical joker victim&quot; of horror films. According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, or Bob Clark&#x27;s &quot;Black Christmas&quot; before that. He served as a model for the slasher films that would follow &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.
The part of Bill was given to Harry Crosby, son of Bing Crosby. Robbi Morgan, who played Annie, was not auditioning for the film when she was offered the role; while in her office, Hughes looked at Morgan and proclaimed, &quot;You&#x27;re a camp counselor.&quot; The next day, Morgan was on the set. Morgan only appeared on set for a day to shoot all her scenes. Rex Everhart, who portrayed Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, so she had to either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis—Savini&#x27;s assistant—who would sit in the truck with her. It was Peter Brouwer&#x27;s girlfriend that helped him land a role on &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. After recently being written off the show &quot;Love of Life&quot;, Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an assistant director for &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer&#x27;s girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.

Estelle Parsons was initially asked to portray the film&#x27;s killer, Mrs. Voorhees, but declined with her agent citing that the film was too violent, and did not know what kind of actress would play such a part. Shelley Winters was also offered the part, but turned it down. Hughes and Moss sent a copy of the script to Betsy Palmer, in hopes that she would accept the part. Palmer could not understand why someone would want her for a part in a horror film, as she had previously starred in films such as &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, &quot;The Angry Man&quot;, and &quot;The Tin Star&quot;. Palmer only agreed to play the role because she needed to buy a new car, even when she believed the film to &quot;be a piece of shit.&quot; Stavrakis subbed for Betsy Palmer as well, which involved Morgan&#x27;s character being chased through the woods by Mrs. Voorhees, although the audience only sees a pair of legs running after Morgan. Palmer had just arrived in town when those scenes were about to be filmed, and was not in the physical shape necessary to chase Morgan around the woods. Morgan&#x27;s training as an acrobat assisted her in these scenes, as her character was required to leap out of a moving jeep when she discovers that Mrs. Voorhees does not intend to take her to the camp. Betsy Palmer explains how she developed the character of Mrs. Voorhees:

Cunningham wanted to make the Mrs. Voorhees character &quot;terrifying&quot;, and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act &quot;over the top.&quot; There was also the fear that Palmer&#x27;s past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary. Palmer was paid $1000 per day for her ten days on set. Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Manny&#x27;s Orphans&quot;, failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees. According to Lehman, he went in very intense and afterward Cunningham told him he was perfect for the part. In addition to the main cast, Walt Gorney came on as &quot;Crazy Ralph&quot;, the town&#x27;s soothsayer. The character of Crazy Ralph was meant to establish two functions: foreshadow the events to come, and insinuate that he could actually be the murderer. Cunningham has stated that he was apprehensive about including the character, and is not sure if he accomplished his goal of creating a new suspect.

===Filming===

The film was shot in and around the townships of Hardwick, Blairstown, and Hope, in Warren County, New Jersey in September 1979. The camp scenes were shot on a working Boy Scout camp, Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco which is located in Hardwick. The camp is still standing and still operates as a summer camp.

Tom Savini was hired to design the film&#x27;s special effects based upon his work in George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978). Savini&#x27;s design contributions included crafting the effects of Marcie&#x27;s axe wound to the face, the arrow penetrating Jack&#x27;s throat, and Mrs. Voorhees&#x27;s decapitation by the machete. The cinematography in the film employs recurrent point-of-view shots from the perspective of the villain. A live snake was killed during filming as part of a scene where Alice discovers it in her cabin.

During the filming of the fight sequences between King and Palmer&#x27;s characters, Palmer suggested rehearsing the scene based on her theater training: &quot;I said to Adrienne that night, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we rehearse this scene, I have to slap you,&#x27; because on stage when you slap somebody, you slap them.&quot; While rehearsing, Palmer slapped King in the face, and she began crying: &quot;She collapsed to the floor, crying, &#x27;Sean! [Cunningham] She hit me.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well, of course I hit her, we were rehearsing the scene.&#x27; He said, &#x27;No, no, no Betsy, we don&#x27;t hit people in movies. We miss them.&#x27;&quot;

===Music===

When Harry Manfredini began working on the musical score, the decision was made to only play music when the killer was actually present so as to not &quot;manipulate the audience&quot;. Manfredini pointed out the lack of music for certain scenes: &quot;There&#x27;s a scene where one of the girls ... is setting up the archery area ... One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It&#x27;s a huge scare, but if you notice, there&#x27;s no music. That was a choice.&quot; Manfredini also noted that when something was going to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, and the scare would be that much more effective.

Because the killer, Mrs. Voorhees, appears onscreen only during the final scenes of the film, Manfredini had the job of creating a score that would represent the killer in her absence. Manfredini borrows from the 1975 film &quot;Jaws&quot;, where the shark is likewise not seen for the majority of the film but the motif created by John Williams cued the audience to the shark&#x27;s invisible menace. Sean S. Cunningham sought a chorus, but the budget would not allow it. While listening to a Krzysztof Penderecki piece of music, which contained a chorus with &quot;striking pronunciations&quot;, Manfredini was inspired to recreate a similar sound. He came up with the sound &quot;ki ki ki, ma ma ma&quot; from the final reel when Mrs. Voorhees arrives and is reciting &quot;Kill her, mommy!&quot; The &quot;ki&quot; comes from &quot;kill&quot;, and the &quot;ma&quot; from &quot;mommy&quot;. To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words &quot;harshly, distinctly and rhythmically into a microphone&quot; and ran them into an echo reverberation machine. Manfredini finished the original score after a couple of weeks, and then recorded the score in a friend&#x27;s basement. Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as &quot;iconographic&quot;. Manfredini says, &quot;Everybody thinks it&#x27;s cha, cha, cha. I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Cha, cha, cha? What are you talking about?&#x27;&quot;

In 1982, Gramavision Records released an LP record of selected pieces of Harry Manfredini&#x27;s scores from the first three Friday the 13th films. On 13 January 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini&#x27;s scores from the first six films. It sold out in less than 24 hours.

==Release==
===Distribution===
A bidding war over distribution rights to the film ensued in 1980 between Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and United Artists. Paramount executive Frank Mancuso, Sr. recalled: &quot;The minute we saw &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, we knew we had a hit.&quot; Paramount ultimately purchased domestic distribution rights for &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; for $1.5 million. Based on the success of recently released horror films (such as &quot;Halloween&quot;) and the low budget of the film, the studio deemed it a &quot;low-risk&quot; release in terms of profitability. It was the first independent slasher film to be acquired by a major motion picture studio. Paramount spent approximately $500,000 in advertisements for the film, and then an additional $500,000 when the film began performing well at the box office.

===Marketing===
A full one-sheet poster, featuring a group of teenagers imposed beneath the silhouette of a knife-wielding figure, was designed by artist Alex Ebel to promote the film&#x27;s U.S. release. Scholar Richard Nowell has observed that the poster and marketing campaign presented &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; as a &quot;light-hearted&quot; and &quot;youth-oriented&quot; horror film in an attempt to draw interest from America&#x27;s prime theater-going demographic of young adults and teenagers. Warner Bros. secured distribution rights to the film in international markets.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was first released on DVD in the United States by Paramount Home Entertainment on October 19, 1999. The disc sold 32,497 units. On February 3, 2009, Paramount released the film again on DVD and Blu-ray in an unrated uncut, for the first time in the United States (previous VHS, LaserDisc and DVD releases included the R-rated theatrical version). The uncut version of the film contains approximately 11 seconds of previously unreleased footage.

In 2011, the uncut version of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was released in a 4-disc DVD collection with the first three sequels. It was again included in two Blu-ray sets: &quot;Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection&quot;, released in 2013 and &quot;Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, in 2018. Paramount&#x27;s Blu-ray was re-released as a &quot;40th Anniversary Limited Edition&quot; steelbook in 2020. In 2020, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Shout! Factory released a 4K scan of the original film, as well as parts 2-4, in a complete series box set. The film grossed $868,529 in DVD and Blu-Ray home sales.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; opened theatrically on May 9, 1980, across the United States, ultimately expanding its release to 1,127 theaters. It earned $5,816,321 in its opening weekend, before finishing domestically with $39,754,601, with a total of 14,778,700 admissions. It was the 18th highest-grossing film that year, facing competition from other high-profile horror releases such as &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot;, &quot;The Fog&quot;, and &quot;Prom Night&quot;. The worldwide gross for the film was $59,754,601. Of the seventeen films distributed by Paramount in 1980, only one, &quot;Airplane!&quot;, returned more profits than &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was released internationally, which was unusual for an independent film with, at the time, no well-recognized or bankable actors; aside from well-known television and movie actress Betsy Palmer. The film would take in approximately $20 million in international box office receipts. Not factoring in international sales, or the cross-over film with &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;″s Freddy Krueger, the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; is the highest-grossing film of the franchise.

To provide context with the box office gross of films in 2014, the cost of making and promoting &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;—which includes the $550,000 budget and the $1 million in advertisement—is approximately $4.5 million. With regard to the US box office gross, the film would have made $177.72 million in adjusted 2017 dollars. On July 13, 2007, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was screened for the first time on Blairstown&#x27;s Main Street in the very theater which appears shortly after the opening credits. Overflowing crowds forced the Blairstown Theater Festival, the sponsoring organization, to add an extra screening. A 30th Anniversary Edition was released on March 10, 2010. A 35th-anniversary screening was held in the Griffith Park Zoo as part of the Great Horror Campout on March 13, 2015.

=== Critical response ===
====Original theatrical reviews====
Linda Gross of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to the film as a &quot;silly, boring, youth-geared horror movie&quot;, though she praised Manfredini&#x27;s &quot;nervous musical score&quot;, the cinematography, as well as the performances, which she deemed &quot;natural and appealing&quot;, particularly from Taylor, Bacon, Nelson, and Bartram. &quot;Variety&quot;, however, deemed the film &quot;low budget in the worst sense—with no apparent talent or intelligence to offset its technical inadequacies—&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; has nothing to exploit but its title.&quot; &quot;The Miami News&quot;″s Bill von Maurer praised Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;low-key&quot; direction, but noted: &quot;After building terrific suspense and turning over the audience&#x27;s stomachs, he doesn&#x27;t quite know where to go from there. The movie begins to sag in the middle and the expectations he has built up begin to sour a bit.&quot; Lou Cedrone of &quot;The Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a shamelessly bad film, but then Cunningham knows this. This is sad.&quot;

Many critics compared the film unfavorably against John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, among them Marylynn Uricchio of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, who added: &quot;&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; is minimal on plot, suspense, and characterization. It&#x27;s not very original or very scary, but it is very low-budget.&quot; Dick Shippy of the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; similarly suggested that Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; played &quot;like Hitchcock when compared to Cunningham&#x27;s dreadful tale of butchery.&quot; &quot;The Burlington Free Press&quot;″s Mike Hughes wrote that the film &quot;copies everything, that is, except the quality&quot; of &quot;Halloween&quot;, concluding: &quot;The lowest point of the movie comes near the end, when it exploits the genuine grief and madness of the villain. By then, things simply aren&#x27;t fun anymore.&quot; Ron Cowan of the &quot;Statesman Journal&quot; noted the film as a &quot;routine &#x27;endangered teenagers&#x27; exploitation movie&quot;, adding that &quot;Cunningham betrays a rather plodding approach to suspense for most of the film, sometimes allowing his camera to act as the killer, sometimes as the victim. And the victims, of course, deliberately put themselves in peril.&quot;

A significant number of reviews criticized the film for its depiction of violence: &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; derided the film, writing: &quot;Gruesome violence, in which throats are slashed and heads are split open in realistic detail, is the sum content of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, a sick and sickening low budget feature that is being released by Paramount. It&#x27;s blatant exploitation of the lowest order.&quot; Michael Blowen of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; similarly referred to the film as &quot;nauseating&quot;, warning audiences: &quot;Unless your idea of a good time is to watch a woman have her head split by an ax or a man stuck to a door with arrows, you should stay away from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. It&#x27;s bad luck.&quot; The film&#x27;s most vocal detractor was Gene Siskel, who in his review called Cunningham &quot;one of the most despicable creatures ever to infest the movie business.&quot; He also published the address for Charles Bluhdorn, the chairman of the board of Gulf+Western, which owned Paramount, as well as Betsy Palmer&#x27;s home city and encouraged fellow detractors to write to them and express their contempt for the film. Attempting to convince people not to see it, he even gave away the ending. Siskel and Roger Ebert spent an entire episode of their TV show berating the film (and other slasher films of the time) because they felt it would make audiences root for the killer. Leonard Maltin initially awarded the film one star, or &#x27;BOMB&#x27;, but later changed his mind and awarded the film a star and-a-half &quot;simply because it&#x27;s slightly better than &quot;Part 2&quot;&quot; and called it a &quot;gory, cardboard thriller...That younger viewers made it a box-office juggernaut is one more clue as to why SAT scores keep declining. Still, any movie that spawns this many sequels must have done &quot;something&quot; right&quot;.

====Contemporary====
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; holds an approval rating of 66% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Rather quaint by today&#x27;s standards, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; still has its share of bloody surprises and a &#x27;70s-holdover aesthetic to slightly compel.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 22 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. It was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards, and Palmer was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress.

Bill Steele of IFC ranked the film the second-best entry in the series, after &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; (1981). Critic Kim Newman, in a 2000 review, awarded the film two out of five stars, referring to it as &quot;a pallid &quot;Halloween&quot; rip-off, with a mediocre shock count and a botched ending... As the bodies pile up amongst this testy crowd of horny teens, there remains a vacant hole were [sic] someone scary should be. In a strange way, this film stands unique amongst all slasher films as one where the killer is nearly intangible.&quot; Jeremiah Kipp of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; reviewed the film in 2009, noting &quot;a kind of minimalism at work, eschewing anything special in terms of mood, pacing, character, plot, and tension.&quot; Further commenting on the revelation of the killer&#x27;s identity, Kipp observed:

In 2012, Bill Gibron of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;This movie feels at least twice as long as its 90-minute running time and not always in a good way. There are far too many pointless pauses between the bloodletting. On the positive side, Tom Savini&#x27;s make-up work is flawless, and Betsy Palmer&#x27;s turn as big bad Pamela V. has to go down in history as one of the meanest &#x27;mothers&#x27; in the entire horror genre. For those who think it&#x27;s a classicthink again. Of a type? Absolutely. Of faultless movie macabre? No way.&quot;

Scott Meslow of &quot;The Week&quot; reviewed the film in 2015, assessing its original critical reception in a contemporary context: &quot;Before it became an absurdly prolific franchise, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was a cynical, one-off attempt to make a fast buck on a sleazy slasher movie that accidentally ended up spawning a decades-spanning, multimillion-dollar phenomenon... What&#x27;s most striking about &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; is how little regard anyone but its fans seem to have for it.&quot;

===Analysis===
====Teen sexuality====
Film scholar Williams views &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; as &quot;symptomatic of its era&quot;, particularly Reagan-era America, and part of a trajectory of films such as &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974) and &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (1975), which &quot;exemplify a particular apocalyptic vision moving from disclosing family contradictions to self-indulgent nihilism.&quot; The film&#x27;s recurring use of point-of-view shots from the killer&#x27;s perspective have been noted by scholars such as Philip Dimare as &quot;inherently voyeuristic&quot;. Dimare regards the film as a &quot;cautionary tale that succeeds in warning against the sexual impropriety even as it fetishizes violent transgression.&quot;

Film critic Timothy Shary notes in his book &quot;Teen Movies: American Youth on Screen&quot; (2012) that while &quot;Halloween&quot; introduced a &quot;more subtle sexual curiosity within its morbid moral lesson,&quot; films such as &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; &quot;capitali[zed] on the reactionary aspect of teen sexuality, slaughtering wholesale those youth who deigned to cross the threshold of sexual awareness.&quot; Commenting on the film&#x27;s violence and sexuality, film scholar David J. Hogan notes that, &quot;throughout the film, teenage boys are hideously dispatched, but not with the same buildup and attention to detail that Cunningham and makeup wiz Tom Savini reserved for nubile young girls.&quot;

====Gender of villain====
The film has spurred critical discussion in regard to its villain being female, a plot point examined at length by film scholar Carol J. Clover in her book &quot;Men, Women, and Chainsaws&quot;. Clover notes the revelation of Pamela Voorhees as the killer as &quot;the most dramatic case of pulling out the gender rug&quot; in horror film history. Commenting on the first-person point-of-view shots from the killer, Clover writes: &quot;&#x27;We&#x27; [the audience] stalk and kill a number of teenagers over the course of an hour of movie time without even knowing who &#x27;we&#x27; are; we are invited, by conventional expectation and by glimpses of &#x27;our&#x27; own bodily partsa heavily booted foot, a roughly gloved handto suppose that &#x27;we&#x27; are male, but &#x27;we&#x27; are revealed, at the film&#x27;s end, as a woman.&quot;

On the killer&#x27;s identity, Dimare has noted:

===Legacy===

Contemporary scholars in film criticism, such as Tony Williams, have credited &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; for initiating the subgenre of the &quot;stalker&quot; or slasher film. Cultural critic Graham Thompson also considers the film as a template, along with John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), that &quot;instigated a rush&quot; of films of its type, in which young people away from supervision are systematically stalked and murdered by a masked villain. While critical reception of the film has been varied in the years since its release, it has attained a significant cult following. In 2017, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the film ninth in a list of the best slasher films of all time.

Film scholar Matt Hills wrote of the film&#x27;s legacy: &quot;&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; has not just been critically positioned as intellectually lacking, it has been othered and devalued in line with the conventional aesthetic norms of the academy and official film culture, said to lack originality and artfulness, to possess no nominated or recognized auteur, and to be grossly sensationalist in its focus on Tom Savini&#x27;s gory special effects.&quot; The film was nominated in 2001 for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Thrills.

In April 2018, Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, where the film was shot, held &quot;Crystal Lake Tours&quot;, an event dedicated to the making of the film which brought attendees to nine of the filming locations on the property. The event was attended by actress Adrienne King, who recounted the making of the film to fans.

==Other media==
===Sequel and franchise===

As of 2018, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; has spawned ten sequels, including a crossover film with &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; villain Freddy Krueger. &quot;Friday the 13th Part II&quot; introduced Jason Voorhees, the son of Mrs. Voorhees, as the primary antagonist, which would continue for the remaining sequels (with exception of the fifth movie) and related works. Most of the sequels were filmed on larger budgets than the original. For comparison, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; had a budget of $550,000, while the first sequel was given a budget of $1.25 million. At the time of its release, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; had the largest budget, at $30 million. All of the sequels repeated the premise of the original, so the filmmakers made tweaks to provide freshness. Changes involved an addition to the title—as opposed to a number attached to the end—like &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; and &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, or filming the movie in 3-D, as Miner did for &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; (1982). One major addition that would affect the entire film series was the addition of Jason&#x27;s hockey mask in the third film; this mask would become one of the most recognizable images in popular culture.

A reboot to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; was released theatrically in February 2009, with &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift hired to script the new film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shan/Swif&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film focused on Jason Voorhees, along with his trademark hockey mask. The film was produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller through Bay&#x27;s production company Platinum Dunes, for New Line Cinema. In November 2007, Marcus Nispel, director of the 2003 remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, was hired to direct. The film had its United States release on February 13, 2009.

===Novelization===
In 1987, seven years after the release of the motion picture, Simon Hawke produced a novelization of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees&#x27; actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason&#x27;s death.

===Comic books===
A number of scenes from the film were recreated in &quot;Friday the 13th: Pamela&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a two-issue comic book prequel released by WildStorm in 2007. In 2016, the book &quot;On Location in Blairstown: The Making of Friday the 13th&quot; was released detailing the planning and filming of the movie.

===Video game===
In 2007, Xendex released game-adaptation movie &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; for mobile phones. In the game, the player plays as Annie Phillips (but unlike in the film she doesn&#x27;t die), one of the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. While the staff is preparing the camp for its first summer weekend, an &quot;unknown stalker&quot; begins murdering each of them. The player must discover the truth and escape the camp alive.

===&quot;Crystal Lake&quot; prequel series===
On October 31, 2022, a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; prequel streaming series was announced, titled &quot;Crystal Lake&quot;. It will be written and executive produced by Bryan Fuller and Victor Miller, along with executive producers Marc Toberoff and Rob Barsamian. A24 will serve as the studio behind the series and will air on Peacock. In January 2023, Adrienne King was cast in a recurring undisclosed role. She previously portrayed Alice Hardy in the 1980 original film and its 1981 sequel where her character was killed off during the opening of the film. Writing for the series was slated to begin in late January 2023 with Kevin Williamson writing one episode for season one. On May 6, 2024, unconfirmed reports stated that the series was no longer happening. However, the following day, Bloody Disgusting confirmed that the series was still happening but was going through a retooling process.

Founded in 1999 as a joint venture by Arriva and Nederlandse Spoorwegen, after Arriva took full ownership in 2003, the brand was retired in 2005.

==History==

NoordNed was established by Arriva and Nederlandse Spoorwegen, each having a 49% shareholding. In May 1999 it commenced operating regional train services on the Leeuwarden to Harlingen and Leeuwarden to Stavoren lines. It also operated rail services between Leeuwarden and Groningen on behalf of Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

On 28 May 2000 it commenced operating services between Groningen and Nieuweschans, and Roodeschool under a five-year concession.

In December 2003, Arriva became the sole owner. In December 2005, NoordNed commenced operating 15 year contracts in Groningen and Friesland. In December 2005 the NoordNed brand was retired with all operations merged with Arriva&#x27;s other Netherlands operations.

<text>Charles Edward Coughlin ( ; October 25, 1891 – October 27, 1979), commonly known as Father Coughlin, was a Canadian–American Catholic priest and antisemite based near Detroit. He was the founding priest of the National Shrine of the Little Flower. Dubbed &quot;The Radio Priest&quot; and considered a leading demagogue, he was one of the first political leaders to use radio to reach a mass audience. During the 1930s, when the U.S. population was about 120 million, an estimated 30 million listeners tuned in to his weekly broadcasts.

Coughlin was born in Ontario to working-class Irish Catholic parents. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1916, and in 1923 he was assigned to the National Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan. Coughlin began broadcasting his sermons during a time of increasing anti-Catholic sentiment across the globe. As his broadcasts became more political, he became increasingly popular.

Initially, Coughlin was a vocal supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal; he later fell out with Roosevelt, accusing him of being too friendly to bankers. In 1934, he established a political organization called the National Union for Social Justice. Its platform called for monetary reforms, nationalization of major industries and railroads, and protection of labour rights. The membership ran into the millions but was not well organized locally.

After making attacks on Jewish bankers, Coughlin began to use his radio program &quot;Golden Hour&quot; to broadcast antisemitic commentary. In the late 1930s, he supported some of the policies of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The broadcasts have been described as &quot;a variation of the Fascist agenda applied to American culture&quot;. His chief topics were political and economic rather than religious, using the slogan &quot;Social Justice&quot;.

After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, the National Association of Broadcasters forced the cancellation of &quot;Golden Hour.&quot; In 1942, the Archdiocese of Detroit forced Coughlin to close his newspaper &quot;Social Justice&quot; and forbade its distribution by mail. Coughlin vanished from the public arena, working as a parish pastor until retiring in 1966. He died in 1979 at age 88.

==Early life and work==
Charles Coughlin was born on October 25, 1891, in Hamilton, Ontario, the only child of Irish Catholic Amelia (née Mahoney) and Thomas Coughlin. Born in a working-class neighbourhood, he lived in a modest home situated between a Catholic cathedral and convent. His mother, who had regretted not becoming a nun, was the dominant figure in the household and instilled a deep sense of religion in Charles.

After his secondary education, Coughlin attended the University of Toronto, enrolling in St. Michael&#x27;s College, run by the Congregation of St. Basil, and graduating in 1911. Coughlin then entered the Basilian Fathers. The Basilians were a traditional order that denounced usury and supported social justice. Coughlin prepared for the priesthood at St. Basil&#x27;s Seminary and was ordained in Toronto in 1916. The Basilians then assigned him to teach at Assumption College, their institution in Windsor, Ontario.

In 1923, a reorganization of Coughlin&#x27;s religious order resulted in his departure. The Vatican ordered the Basilians to change from a society of common life to a monastic life. The members of the order were required to take the traditional three religious vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.

Unwilling to accept the monastic life, Coughlin applied for incardination, or transfer, out of the Basilians to the Archdiocese of Detroit. He was accepted in 1923 and moved to Detroit. The archdiocese assigned Coughlin to pastoral positions in several parishes. In 1925, when Coughlin was exiting a building in Detroit, he saw a man stealing a trunk from the back of his car. When Coughlin confronted the thief, he dropped the trunk and swung at him. The fight continued until Coughlin knocked him unconscious. The incident received coverage in the Detroit newspapers.

In 1926, he was assigned to the newly founded Shrine of the Little Flower, a congregation of 25 families in Royal Oak, Michigan.

==1926 to 1942==

In 1926, Coughlin began broadcasting his Sunday sermons from local radio station WJR. He later said that he started his radio show in response to the Ku Klux Klan burning a cross at the shrine and wanted to provide support to local Catholics. However, the broadcast also provided him with extra income to pay back the diocesan loan owed by the shrine. Coughlin started on WJR with a weekly, hour-long radio program. A gifted speaker, he had a rich speaking voice and used a careful cadence.

When the Goodwill Stations radio network acquired WJR in 1929, owner George A. Richards recognized Coughlin&#x27;s talent as a broadcaster. Richards encouraged Coughlin to focus his program more on politics than religion. Coughlin then started attacking income inequality, blaming the American banking system and the Jews for the poverty of American workers. The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio network signed a contract for Coughlin&#x27;s program in 1930 for national broadcast. It was called the &quot;Radio League of the Little Flower&quot;.

=== 1931 to 1934 ===

By 1931, Coughlin had raised enough money from &quot;Radio League&quot; to construct the huge Charity Crucifixion Tower at the Shrine of the Little Flower.

In 1931, CBS received complaints from several affiliate stations about Coughlin&#x27;s political views. CBS management was also concerned about his attacks on the administration of US President Herbert Hoover. CBS then demanded a review of Coughlin&#x27;s scripts prior to broadcast, which he refused. When Coughlin&#x27;s contract ended with CBS, the network decided not to renew it.

Coughlin and Richards then established an independently financed radio network. His show became the &quot;Golden Hour of the Shrine of the Little Flower&quot;, with WJR and WGAR in Cleveland serving as core stations. With Coughlin paying for the airtime on a contractual basis, the number of affiliates carrying &quot;Golden Hour&quot; increased to 25  stations by August 1932. Regional radio networks, such as the Yankee Network, the Quaker State Network, the Mohawk Network and the Colonial Network, also started carrying &quot;Golden Hour&quot;. Coughlin&#x27;s radio network became the largest one of its type in the United States. Leo Fitzpatrick, who had given Coughlin his initial airtime over WJR in 1926 and was retained as a part-owner when Richards purchased the station, continued to serve as a confidant and advisor to Coughlin.

With the United States suffering through the Great Depression, Coughlin strongly endorsed New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in the 1932 Presidential election. He was invited to attend the June 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. An early supporter of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal reforms, Coughlin coined the popular phrase &quot;Roosevelt or Ruin&quot;. Another phrase Coughlin created was &quot;The New Deal is Christ&#x27;s Deal&quot;.After Roosevelt was elected in November 1932, he politely received Coughlin&#x27;s policy proposals, but showed no interest in enacting them.

By 1933, Securities and Exchange Commission President Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a strong New Deal and Roosevelt supporter who reportedly was a friend of Coughlin, warned that he was &quot;becoming a very dangerous proposition&quot; as an opponent of Roosevelt and &quot;an out and out demagogue&quot;. That same year, &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; wrote, &quot;Perhaps no man has stirred the country and cut as deep between the old order and the new as Father Charles E. Coughlin.&quot;

=== 1934 to 1936 ===

In 1934, Coughlin founded the National Union for Social Justice (NUSJ), a nationalistic workers&#x27; rights organization. Its leaders were impatient with what they considered the Roosevelt&#x27;s unconstitutional and pseudo-capitalistic monetary policies. The NUSJ soon gained a strong following among nativists and opponents of the Federal Reserve, especially in the American Midwest.

By 1934, Coughlin was perhaps the most prominent Catholic speaker on political and financial issues. His radio audience included tens of millions of Americans every week. Historian Alan Brinkley wrote that &quot;by 1934, he [Coughlin] was receiving more than 10,000 letters every day&quot; and that &quot;his clerical staff at times numbered more than a hundred.&quot; He foreshadowed modern talk radio and televangelism. However, the University of Detroit Mercy states that &quot;Golden Hour&#x27;s&quot; peak audience was in 1932.

It is estimated that at peak, one-third of the nation listened to his broadcasts. The &quot;Golden Hour&quot; office was receiving up to 80,000 letters per week from listeners. Author Sheldon Marcus said that the size of Coughlin&#x27;s radio audience &quot;is impossible to determine, but estimates range up to 30 million each week&quot;.

In 1934, Roosevelt sent Kennedy and Detroit Mayor Frank Murphy to visit Coughlin and try to temper his attacks. Coughlin visited Roosevelt several times at his estate in Hyde Park, New York. In a bid to control the excesses of the radio industry, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, establishing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FCC Chairman Frank R. McNinch warned that it would not allow broadcasters to use their networks or stations as “...an instrument of racial or religious persecution.”

Coughlin&#x27;s attacks on Roosevelt continued to increase. He began denouncing him as a tool of Wall Street. Coughlin opposed the New Deal with growing vehemence, attacking Roosevelt, capitalists and alleged Jewish conspirators. He encouraged the third-party candidacy of Louisiana Governor Huey Long for president in the 1936 election, but that was cut short by Long&#x27;s assassination in 1935. Under Coughlin&#x27;s direction, the NUSJ founded the Union Party in preparation for the 1936 elections.

=== 1936 to 1938 ===

In early 1936, at Kennedy&#x27;s urging, Bishop Francis Spellman and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli tried to mute Coughlin&#x27;s vitriol. While the American Catholic hierarchy did not approve of Coughlin, only Coughlin&#x27;s superior—Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit—had the canonical authority to curb him. Gallagher was a strong supporter of Coughlin and refused to stop him. The church hierarchy also feared the backlash from Coughlin&#x27;s Catholic supporters if they reprimanded him.

Coughlin opened a new church building at the Shrine of the Little Flower in 1936, an octagonal structure shaped like a tent. One of its unique features was an altar positioned at the center of worship. This design did not become common in Catholic churches until the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.

With the start of the 1936 US Presidential Election, Coughlin was ready to support a third party candidate running against Roosevelt. At a NUSJ rally at Cleveland Municipal Stadium on May 11, 1936, Coughlin predicted that NUSF would &quot;take half of Ohio&quot; in the upcoming primary election, citing multiple congressional candidates with NUSJ backing. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July, Coughlin accused Roosevelt of &quot;leaning toward international socialism&quot; by his failure to support the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco. Coughlin presided over the Townsend Convention held in July at Cleveland Public Hall on July 23. In his speech on July 16, Coughlin called Roosevelt a liar and a communist, referring to him as &quot;Franklin Doublecross Roosevelt.&quot;

At the Union party convention at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland on August 16, Coughlin endorsed the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, House Representative William Lemke. Coughlin fainted near the end of his speech. In an August 16th &quot;Boston Post&quot; article, Coughlin referred to Kennedy as the &quot;shining star among the dim &#x27;knights&#x27; in the [Roosevelt] Administration&quot;.

Coughlin promised his radio audience that he would retire from broadcasting if he failed to deliver nine million votes for Lemke; he only received 850,000 votes. Roosevelt won the election on November 5 by a landslide. According to a 2021 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, Coughlin&#x27;s criticisms did reduce Roosevelt&#x27;s share of votes versus the 1932 election. After the election, both the Union Party and its parent organization, the NUSJ, disbanded; Coughlin took a two-month retirement from the &quot;Golden Hour&quot;.

After Bishop Gallagher died in January 1937, Pope Pius XI replaced him with Archbishop Edward Mooney. Coughlin then left retirement to return to the Golden Hour, in honor of Gallagher&#x27;s memory. In October 1937, Mooney rebuked Coughlin for casting aspersions on Roosevelt&#x27;s sanity over his nomination of U.S. Senator Hugo Black to the US Supreme Court.

=== 1938 ===

By 1938, the &quot;Golden Hour&quot; was being broadcast to a peak of 58 affiliates. In May 1938, Coughlin called for a &quot;crusade against the anti-Christian forces of the Red Revolution&quot; in &quot;Social Justice&quot;. That led him to found a new organization, the Christian Front. Its membership numbered several thousand. Unlike the NUSJ, the Christian Front membership was mainly of Irish-American men in New York City and other eastern cities.

On November 9 and 10, 1938, Nazi organizations and sympathizers attacked Jewish businesses and synagogues throughout Germany in what became known as the Kristallnacht. When the owner of WMCA in New York, Donald Flamm, saw the preliminary script for the November 20 broadcast of &quot;Golden Hour,&quot; he immediately demanded that Coughin change inflammatory references to Jews. However, Flamm did not get to view the final script.

On the November 20 broadcast, Coughlin deflected blame from the Nazis for Kristallnacht. He referred to &#x27;millions&#x27; of Christians who had allegedly been murdered in the Soviet Union by its government. Speaking of Germany, Coughlin said, &quot;Jewish persecution only followed after Christians first were persecuted.&quot; After the broadcast finished, the WMCA booth announcer said, &quot;Unfortunately, Father Coughlin has uttered many misstatements of fact&quot;.

After the broadcast, WMCA, WIND and WJJD all demanded advance copies of the script for the November 27 program. When Coughlin failed to deliver them, all three stations canceled it. Flamm remarked that the show &quot;was calculated to stir up religious and racial hatred and dissension in this country&quot;. Coughlin then pulled all the future broadcasts from the three stations, accusing them of being under &quot;Jewish ownership&quot;. In the December 5th issue of &quot;Social Justice,&quot; Coughlin wrote a column that plagiarized portions of a 1935 speech by the German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, a rabid antisemite.

On December 14, Cardinal George Mundelein, archbishop of Chicago, issued the first formal condemnation of Coughlin by the Catholic hierarchy. Mundelein said that Coughlin was: &quot;...not authorized to speak for the Catholic Church, nor does he represent the doctrine or sentiments of the Church.&quot;

Four days later, thousands of Coughlin&#x27;s followers, many associated with the Christian Front, picketed WMCA&#x27;s studios in protest. Some of them yelled antisemitic statements, such as &quot;Send Jews back where they came from in leaky boats!&quot; and &quot;Wait until Hitler comes over here!&quot; The protests at WMCA continued for 38 weeks. Coughlin attended some of the protests.

Coughlin increasingly attacked Roosevelt&#x27;s policies. The administration decided that, although the First Amendment protected free speech, it did not necessarily apply to broadcasting because the radio spectrum was a &quot;limited national resource&quot; and as a result was regulated as a publicly owned commons. The authorities imposed new regulations and restrictions on radio stations for the specific purpose of forcing Coughlin off the air. For the first time, the authorities required regular radio broadcasters to seek operating permits.

When Coughlin&#x27;s operating permit was denied, he was temporarily silenced. Coughlin worked around the new restrictions by purchasing air time and playing his speeches via transcription. However, having to buy the weekly air time on individual stations severely reduced his reach and also strained his financial resources.

=== 1939 ===

In 1939, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis used Coughlin&#x27;s radio talks to illustrate propaganda methods in their book &quot;The Fine Art of Propaganda&quot;, which was intended to show propaganda&#x27;s effects against democracy. Coughlin was praised in January 1939 by &quot;Regime Fascista&quot;, an Italian newspaper aligned with the fascist government of Italy.

After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, Coughlin appealed to &quot;Golden Hour&quot; listeners to travel to Washington D.C. as &quot;an army of peace&quot;. His aim was to stop the repeal by Congress of the Neutrality Acts, a series of arms embargoes passed during the 1930s to ensure American neutrality in a European conflict. This call led Coughlin&#x27;s opponents to accuse him of stoking incitement bordering on civil war.

Coughlin&#x27;s call for a march on Washington finally motivated the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) to take action against the &quot;Golden Hour.&quot; Fearing FCC intervention, NAB formed a self-regulating Code Committee that limited the sale of air time to controversial individuals. The Committee created a code, which was ratified in October 1939, that required all radio broadcasters to submit their scripts to the radio stations for review before broadcast. Stations that did not comply with the code faced the threat of license revocation. This code was drafted specifically as a response to Coughlin and &quot;Golden Hour&quot;. WJR, WGAR and the Yankee Network, all of which carried &quot;Golden Hour&quot;, threatened to quit the NAB over the new code, but eventually adopted it. 

=== 1940 to 1942 ===

In January 1940, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided the Brooklyn headquarters for the Christian Front, arresting 17 men on charges of plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. Coughlin then issued a statement, saying that while he was not a member of the Christian Front and disavowed violence, he did not disassociate himself from the group. He called the Front &quot;pro-American, pro-Christian, anti-Communist and anti-Nazi&quot;. The trials for the 17 men ended in acquittals and hung juries, albeit one of the defendants committed suicide.

In the September 23, 1940, issue of &quot;Social Justice&quot;, Coughlin announced that he was cancelling &quot;Golden Hour,&quot; forced &quot;...by those who control circumstances beyond my reach&quot;. Coughlin now had to rely on &quot;Social Justice&quot; to reach his followers. In 1940, reversing his previous position, Kennedy attacked Coughlin&#x27;s isolationism. After the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the U.S. declaration of war against the Axis Powers, anti-interventionist movements rapidly lost public support. Isolationists such as Coughlin were tagged as enemy sympathizers.

On April 14, 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle wrote a letter to Postmaster General Frank Walker, suggesting that he revoke the second-class mailing privilege of &quot;Social Justice&quot;. Using the Espionage Act of 1917 as its legal justification, Walker temporarily suspended the mailing permit for &quot;Social Justice&quot; on April 14. Walker scheduled a hearing on its permanent suspension for April 29, later postponed until May 4. Unable to mail &quot;Social Justice&quot; to its subscribers, Coughlin was confined to distributing it by private delivery trucks only in the Boston area.

Biddle also convened a federal grand jury to consider sedition charges against &quot;Social Justice&quot; and Coughlin. Biddle asked banker Leo Crowley, a Roosevelt appointee, to offer a deal to Archbishop Mooney; the US Justice Department would not prosecute Coughlin if he closed &quot;Social Justice&quot; and stopped all his political activities.

On May 1, Mooney ordered Coughlin to confine himself only to the pastoral duties of the Shrine of the Little Flower. The alternative was his suspension from active ministry and federal indictment. Coughlin complied with Mooney&#x27;s order and &quot;Social Justice&quot; ceased publication. The May 4 hearing before the Postmaster General was canceled.

==Later life==
Coughlin served as pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower until his retirement in 1966. During this period, the Archdiocese of Detroit reviewed all of Coughlin&#x27;s public speeches in advance. In 1951, he attended Richards&#x27;s funeral. Richards died following a long legal fight to keep his broadcast licenses amid accusations of antisemitism and of using the stations to further his political interests.

Coughlin died in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in 1979 at age 88. Church officials stated that he had been bedridden for several weeks. He was buried in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

Pope Francis designated the Shrine of the Little Flower as a minor basilica in 2015.

== Viewpoints ==
===Antisemitism===
The television producer Norman Lear recounts in his autobiography how Coughlin&#x27;s radio broadcasts disturbed him deeply at age nine. As a Jew, they made him aware of the widespread antisemitism in American society.

Coughlin believed Jewish bankers were behind the 1917 October Revolution in Russia that brought the Bolsheviks into power, backing the Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy theory. During the last half of 1938, &quot;Social Justice&quot; printed weekly installments from the 1903 &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion,&quot; a fraudulent antisemitic text.

Coughlin denied being antisemitic on several occasions. However, he received indirect funding from the German Government.

=== Communism and socialism ===
In January 1930, Coughlin began attacking socialism and Soviet Communism, both ideologies strongly opposed by the Catholic Church. In 1933, Coughlin criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to extend diplomatic recognition by the United States of the Soviet Union.

Coughlin criticized American capitalists, stating that their greed was making communist ideologies attractive to workers. He warned, &quot;Let not the workingman be able to say that he is driven into the ranks of socialism by the inordinate and grasping greed of the manufacturer.&quot;

=== Capitalism ===
The historian Michael Kazin wrote that Coughlin&#x27;s followers saw capitalism and communism as equally evil. They believed that they were defending those people who were joined more by piety, economic frustration, and a common dread of powerful, modernizing enemies than through any class identity. In a 1930 broadcast, Coughlin stated, 
“We have lived to see the day that modern Shylocks have grown fat and wealthy, praised and deified, because they have perpetuated the ancient crime of usury under the modern racket of statesmanship.” 
Coughlin proclaimed in 1935: &quot;I have dedicated my life to fight against the heinous rottenness of modern capitalism because it robs the laborer of this world&#x27;s goods. But blow for blow I shall strike against Communism, because it robs us of the next world&#x27;s happiness.&quot;The NUSJ&#x27;s articles of faith included work and income guarantees, the nationalization of key industries, wealth redistribution through increased taxation of the wealthy, federal protection of labor unions, and limiting property rights in favor of government control of the country&#x27;s assets for public good. Coughlin said,

One of Coughlin&#x27;s slogans was &quot;Less care for internationalism and more concern for national prosperity&quot;, which appealed to isolationists and many Irish Catholics.

=== Money supply ===
Coughlin spoke about the negative influence of what he termed as &quot;money changers&quot;. He also condemned what he called the government &quot;...permitting a group of private citizens to create money...&quot; at the nation&#x27;s expense. He said that the Great Depression was a &quot;cash famine&quot; and proposed the nationalization of the Federal Reserve System as the solution. In January 1934, Coughlin testified before the US Congress, saying, &quot;If Congress fails to back up the President in his monetary program, I predict a revolution in this country which will make the French Revolution look silly!&quot; He also said to the Congressional hearing, &quot;God is directing President Roosevelt.&quot;Coughlin urged Roosevelt to use the unlimited coinage of silver to inflate the money supply and reorganize the financial system. The US Government increased investment in silver for a limited period following the American Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which resulted in U.S. silver mines being nationalized between 1934 and 1943 through stamp taxes.

===Federal Reserve===
In the 1930s, Coughlin called on Congress to take back control of the money supply from the Federal Reserve Banks. He said that Congress had the authority under Article I of the US Constitution to coin money and regulate its value.

=== Fascism ===
As the 1930s progressed, Coughlin&#x27;s views changed. Eventually he became &quot;openly antidemocratic&quot;, according to the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, &quot;calling for the abolition of political parties and questioning the value of elections&quot;. His views mirrored those of Richards, who held reactionary conservative beliefs.

In 1936, Coughlin expressed sympathy for the fascist governments of Adolf Hitler in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy, terming them as an antidote to Communism. A &quot;New York Times&quot; report from Berlin in 1938 identified Coughlin as &quot;the German hero in America for the moment&quot; with his sympathetic statements towards Nazism as &quot;a defensive front against Bolshevism&quot;.

However, in February 1939, when the American Nazi organization the German American Bund held a large rally in New York City, Coughlin immediately distanced himself from them. On the &quot;Golden Hour&quot;, he said: &quot;Nothing can be gained by linking ourselves with any organization which is engaged in agitating racial animosities or propagating racial hatreds. Organizations which stand upon such platforms are immoral and their policies are only negative.&quot;

=== Prohibition ===
Coughlin was critical of Prohibitionism, which he said was the work of &quot;fanatics&quot;.

<text>ProRail () is a Dutch government organisation responsible for the maintenance and extension of the national railway network infrastructure (not the metro or tram), the allocation of rail capacity, and controlling rail traffic. Prorail is a part of NS Railinfratrust, the Dutch railway infrastructure owner.

Its Utrecht headquarters is in the former offices of Nederlandse Spoorwegen (known as &quot;De Inktpot&quot;, &quot;The Inkwell&quot;), the largest brick building in the Netherlands. The building currently features a &quot;UFO&quot; on its facade resulting from an art program in 2000.

==History==
The creation of ProRail can be traced back to policies of the Dutch government implemented during the 1990s; it was decided that rail operations should be reorganised, and that the private sector should have a greater involvement in their operations, in order to improve operations. In 1998, the first outsourced small-scale maintenance operations took place. Despite this direction, government ownership of the national railway infrastructure operator has been retained. Instead, ProRail was established on 1 January 2003 when three separate organisations responsible for rail infrastructure in the Netherlands were merged. Upon its creation, ProRail became responsible for the total cost of ownership and the long-term availability of the rail infrastructure, as well as to avoid operational safety being compromised.

One early reform of the organisation, implemented for the 2007–2011 timeframe, was for all contracts to be publicly tender based on performance and process specifications. This was intended to facilitate effective competition to be awarded contract work while retaining the public service orientation sought by the government. Key functions, such as track inspection, had transitioned to the private sector by 2006. Jan Swier, ProRails Strategic Advisor for Maintenance and Renewals, noted that there were initial concerns over this safety-critical work being performed externally, yet the work has been effectively performed, aiding by the introduction of sophisticated track inspection machinery. All track is inspected twice per month while busy main lines can be inspected as often as once per week. Trackwork, such as grinding, was largely outsourced; working practices also changed, moving from corrective grinding to preventive grinding to both ease and lower the cost of the work. The implementation of real time asset monitoring was also pursued, by 2006, approximately 1,000 switches in The Netherlands had been equipped with remote condition monitoring equipment.

In the late 2000s, in response to repeated year-on-year rises in both passenger and freight traffic on the network, ProRail developed a new &#x27;Triple A&#x27; strategy to deliver a 50 percent increase in capacity, to be achieved via the adoption of smarter planning, the reorganisation of train services, and new construction works. In late 2008, the Ministry of Transport allocated €4.5 billion for a multi-year investment to introduce the Triple A strategy along several key railway corridors. During the early 2010s, ProRail trialed high-frequency twin-track operations as a means of expanding capacity.

Throughout the 2010s, ProRail has increasing the use of digital working practices and technologies throughout its operations; amongst other changes, various paper forms have been replaced with digital counterparts delivered via mobile devices. Trials of technology for various purposes, such as digital visual indicators of train occupancy, have been carried out. Continuous weather monitoring now routinely informs operations so that services can be reshaped where appropriate to minimise the impact of bad weather even prior to its arrival. The organisation has also made use of digital twins of key pieces of infrastructure to improve maintenance operations. In 2021, the &quot;ProRail Monitoring Platform&quot; (PMP) was revealed, which monitors the majority of infrastructure assets overseen by the organisation and it intended to enable the transition from condition-based monitoring to performing predictive maintenance, facilitating more efficient use of resources.

In 2014, the organisation released a report on various scenarios for rolling out the next generation European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) across the Netherlands. The Dutch government directed that digital railway signaling be rolled out nationwide; ProRail and NS have partnered to implement ERTMS and will initially focus upon retrofitting rolling stock for level 2 operations. During March 2022, ProRail announced that the French company Thales Group had been selected to provide signaling apparatus, referred to as the Central Safety System (CSS), in support of the ERTMS rollout. In September of that year, the multinational engineering firm Arcadis were contracted to provide engineering services for the rollout.

During June 2022, ProRail appealed to the Dutch government to subsidise train operators of both passenger and freight services, noting that its charges has to comply with the European rules for consumer compensation, yet the sector would suffer due to double digit price rises. In January 2023, figures released for 2022 showed that rail users had been subject to some of the worst performance statistics recorded in recent years in terms of delays and cancellations, which was in part attributable to strikes. That same month, RailGood, an employers’ organisation representing the rail freight industry, publicly claimed that ProRail was letting down rail freight operators; specific complaints included increased infrastructure charges for 2023, which RailGood referred to &quot;excessive&quot;, as well as allegations of mismanagement of the railway infrastructure.

==Operations==
===Railinfrabeheer===
&quot;Railinfrabeheer&quot; (Rail Infrastructure Management, RIB) takes care of the infrastructure. This does not include most sidings on private property, these were sold off to Strukton Rail Short Line BV in 2015. Maintenance is carried out by several contractors, including VolkerRail, Strukton and ASSET Rail. Part of this division is the &quot;Incidentenbestrijding&quot; (Incident Response Unit) which manages various incidents on the network, like breakdowns, collisions or derailments.

===Timetable management===
The capacity the whole railway network is controlled by ProRail. Every year on the second Sunday of December the new timetable for the following year goes into effect. Planning this new timetable is done years in advance. In the planning stage all users can state the train services they wish to operate in this year. 

Companies using the ProRail network are:
* Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), using most of the network for long-distance intercity-services and local trains along the same lines. This network is commonly known as &quot;hoofdrailnet&quot; (main rail network).
* NMBS/SNCB, Thalys, Eurostar and DB, which operate various international services to neighbouring countries (including local trains to those countries).
* Connexxion (including Breng), Qbuzz, Arriva and Keolis on the other contracted lines. Arriva is the biggest in this respect, with train running in the north, east and south of the country.
* Cargo operators including DB Cargo, Rotterdam Rail Feeding, CapTrain, Rail Force One and Lineas. Most other cargo operators plan their trains shortly before departure, and thus are managed by Traffic Control.
* RailExperts, Train Charter Services and many cargo operators use the network for charters, ad-hoc trains or empty movements. These are mostly planned at short notice, using empty pathing provided in the timetable.

===Railverkeersleiding===
&quot;Railverkeersleiding&quot; (Traffic Control) is responsible for managing current operations on the network. Traffic Control is the section which operates signals and communicates with drivers. Short-term planning, less than 52 hours before the day of the train service, is also part of this division. All companies use this facility to compensate for unplanned events.

== Funding ==
Funding for ProRail is primarily provided via a government subsidy, on top of which fees are charged to the various railway operators (called &quot;infraheffing&quot;). The government subsidy totalled around €2.5 billion from 2014–2017, and the &quot;infraheffing&quot; totalled approximately €200 million in 2006, the remaining income was listed as &#x27;other&#x27;. The fee that the public transport operators initially had to pay for this is lower than the cost, but has been progressively increased over time. In 2003, it was €0.64 per train km and €0.54 to €2.16 for stopping at a station.

== Performance oriented maintenance ==
Railways in the Netherlands are not maintained by ProRail itself. Instead, it is subcontracted to recognised maintenance contractors. This model has been contrasted with that of the privately owned British rail infrastructure owner Railtrack (replaced by Network Rail in October 2002), although ProRail has stated that it has intentionally made efforts to learn from the shortcomings of Railtrack, which had collapsed prior to ProRail&#x27;s creation. The Dutch railway network is subdivided into 21 areas. For each area, all of the regular maintenance is contracted as one package, which is won by the contractor that submits the best offer. The contractor receives a fixed sum per month, and is fined in case of failure to meet the required performance. Contractors are incentivised to minimise cost, while ensuring good performance of the assets. This is called prestatiegericht onderhoud (performance oriented maintenance).

As of 2019, the recognised maintenance contractors are:
* ASSET Rail (a joint venture by Arcadis and Dura Vermeer)
* BAM Infra Rail
* Strukton Rail
* VolkerRail

<doc id="168975" wikidata="Q360819" url="?curid=168975" title="Håkan Lans">
<text>Anders Håkan Lans (born 2 November 1947 in Enskede) is a Swedish inventor, employed by the Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA), and then Stockholm University whose primary contribution is the Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) datalink technology used in Automatic Identification System (AIS) for vehicle navigation.

Lans has won many notable Swedish honors for his inventions. Lans is also known for various ultimately unsuccessful legal disputes over his computer-related patents.

== STDMA ==
Håkan Lans is the designer of a tracking system which makes use of a Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) datalink. The STDMA datalink is currently in use in Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS is a short range coastal tracking system which is mandatory aboard international voyaging ships with gross tonnage (GT) of 300 or more tons, and all passenger ships regardless of size.

STDMA is also in use as one of the three physical layer models proposed for Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), a cooperative surveillance technique for air traffic control. Lans&#x27;s protocol is used for ADS-B in Sweden.

For his STDMA invention, Lans was nominated for the 2007 European Inventor Award, though he did not win. Lans also won the 
The STDMA patent was awarded to Lans in 1996, but a US patent ex-parte reexamination certificate was issued in 2010 canceling all claims.

== Computer graphics ==

In the late 1960s, Lans invented a graphics tablet with a handheld puck. He sold the technology to Houston Instruments, which marketed the device as the &quot;HIpad&quot; in 1971. Some thereby claim Lans to be the inventor of the computer mouse, despite others making similar inventions independently several years earlier. In 1996 Lans received the highest award of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology for his tablet puck.

Lans holds a patent on a memory controller for a framebuffer: &quot;Data processing system and apparatus for color graphics display&quot;. Framebuffers with memory controllers had been in common use for years at the time of his 1979 patent filing. In 1997 Lans as an individual sued eleven companies for allegedly infringing his patent. The eleven cases were soon combined. The merits of the case were never heard, however, because the defendants, led by Digital Equipment Corporation, counterclaimed that the patent had been assigned to Uniboard AB, a patent holding company wholly owned by Lans. Lans lost the case and was ordered to pay defendants&#x27; legal fees, a ruling that was upheld on appeal. The subsequent attempted suit by Uniboard AB failed because the patent had expired ten months before the suit.

These legal failures led to a dispute between Lans and his attorneys, who Lans sued for misconduct. The attorneys&#x27; defense was that they had not been told about the transfer to Uniboard AB. This suit was settled in April 2012. 

In 1984 Lans patented a color calligraphic photo plotter, though it was never mass produced. Despite color displays, color frame buffers, and color calligraphic displays already being common prior to 1984, Lans insists that his filings constitute the invention of color computer graphics.

== Recognition ==
Lans received the award Inventor of the Year in Sweden in 1990, the Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences&#x27; gold medal in 1993, The International Seatrade Award in 1993, the Polhem Prize in 1995, KTH&#x27;s grand prize in 1996, the Flight Aerospace Industry Award in 1997, the Swedish Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics Thulin Medal in gold in 1999, was appointed the International Swede of the Year in 2000, was appointed an honorary doctor of technology at Uppsala University in 2001, in 2002 received H. M. The King&#x27;s Medal, 8th size with high blue ribbon and the André Prize from the Swedish Patent and Registration Office in 2003.

<doc id="168977" wikidata="Q959519" url="?curid=168977" title="Trillian (character)">
<text>Tricia Marie McMillan, also known as Trillian Astra, is a fictional character from Douglas Adams&#x27; series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. She is most commonly referred to simply as &quot;Trillian&quot;, a modification of her birth name, which she adopted because it sounded more &quot;space-like&quot;. According to the movie version, her middle name is Marie. Physically, she is described as &quot;a slim, darkish humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes,&quot; looking &quot;vaguely Arabic.&quot;

==Biography==
Tricia McMillan is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The trilogy later reveals that Trillian eventually left the party with Zaphod Beeblebrox, who, according to the Quintessential Phase, is directly responsible for her nickname.

In the radio series, she is carried off and forcibly married to the President of the Algolian Chapter of the Galactic Rotary Club and consequently does not appear in the second radio series at all. The later radio series (the Tertiary Phase and beyond) reveal this (probably) occurred only in the artificial universe within the Guide offices. In the books, which the third, fourth and fifth series follow, she saves the universe from the Krikketeers and later becomes a Sub-Etha Radio reporter under the name Trillian Astra.

Some drafts of the movie&#x27;s screenplay, and Robbie Stamp&#x27;s &quot;making of&quot; book covering the movie, state that Trillian was to be revealed as half-human, an acknowledged divergence from Douglas Adams&#x27; original storyline. This would have been done in order to underline the loneliness of Arthur Dent, the only 100% Homo sapiens remaining in the universe, after Earth&#x27;s demolition. This idea was scrapped after the &quot;making of&quot; book was written, and the scene revealing Trillian&#x27;s heritage (by the mice, to Arthur, on the Earth Mark II) was re-written. An interview with actress Zooey Deschanel, included on the DVD version, has her mention that Trillian is half-human, suggesting the interview was recorded prior to the change of plan.

==Relationships==
In the novels and radio series, Trillian does not have a romantic relationship with Arthur (although when Arthur starts seeing Fenchurch, Ford Prefect asks him what happened to Trillian). In the fifth book, Trillian is revealed as the mother of Random Dent. It is unclear for how long (if ever) Trillian had a relationship with Zaphod. They seem to travel away from each other after the third book, although in the fourth one Arthur states Trillian is with Zaphod, and in the fifth Trillian implies that she hadn&#x27;t had a child with Zaphod simply because they&#x27;re different species. In the sixth novel, &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, she pursues a relationship with Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged; she accuses Arthur of carrying a torch for her as well.

The 2005 film puts a different spin on the character. The main emotional arc of the movie is a love triangle between Trillian, Zaphod, and Arthur. Trillian is initially attracted to Arthur when she meets him on Earth, but she&#x27;s disappointed by his apparent lack of spontaneity. During their travels, Trillian discovers that Zaphod may be the more superficially exciting choice, but Arthur is the man who truly cares about her, Arthur commenting when he is about to have his head cut open by the mice that his feelings for Trillian are the only thing that he ever had questions about where the answer made him happy. The film concludes with Arthur and Trillian sharing a brief kiss as they prepare to return to the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; with Ford and Zaphod as Slartibartfast plans to restart Earth, Arthur concluding that he is ready to move on from the planet now that there is a world to come back to.

==Portrayals==
Trillian was played on radio by Susan Sheridan, on television by Sandra Dickinson (who also reprised an alternate-universe version of the role in the fifth and sixth radio series, playing both original and alternate-universe versions in the latter), on the Original Records LP version by Cindy Oswin, and in the 2005 film by Zooey Deschanel. In &quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, she is portrayed by Tali, a model.

In the original radio series, she is portrayed with an English accent – in both the TV series and movie she is played as an American. The &quot;Quintessential Phase&quot; of the radio series features Sandra Dickinson in the role of the alternate version of Tricia McMillan as a &quot;blonder and more American&quot; Trillian – the radio series indicates that the character is otherwise identical to the first Trillian and was born in the United Kingdom. In the book &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, it is said that both the alternate Tricia McMillan and Trillian have an English accent. In &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; novel, she is described as follows: &quot;She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress, she looked vaguely Arabic.&quot; She has consistently not been portrayed as such in the television and film adaptions, although the film adaptation Trillian is closer to her appearance in the books than it was in the television series.

==Appearances==
Trillian comes closest of all female characters to appearing in the entire &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; saga.

<doc id="168985" wikidata="Q6403" url="?curid=168985" title="Lake Geneva">
<text>Lake Geneva is a deep lake on the north side of the Alps, shared between Switzerland and France. It is one of the largest lakes in Western Europe and the largest on the course of the Rhône. Sixty percent () of the lake belongs to Switzerland (the cantons of Vaud, Geneva and Valais) and forty percent () to France (the department of Haute-Savoie).

== Name ==
While the exact origins of the name are unknown, the name was in use during the time of Julius Caesar. comes from Ancient Greek () meaning &quot;port&#x27;s lake&quot;. In Medieval Latin it was known as , although this name was also used for a town or district on the lake, or ; the equivalent in Old French was . Following the rise of Geneva it became (translated into English as &quot;Lake Geneva&quot;), but was the common name on all local maps and is the customary name in the French language. In contemporary English, the name &quot;Lake Geneva&quot; has become predominant.

==Geography==
Lake Geneva is divided into three parts because of its different types of formation (sedimentation, tectonic folding, glacial erosion): 
# (), the eastern part from the Rhône estuary to the line of Meillerie–Rivaz
# (), the largest and deepest basin with the lake&#x27;s largest width
# (), the most south-west, narrower, and less-deep part from Yvoire–Promenthoux next Prangins to the exit in Geneva

According to the Swiss Federal Office of Topography, Swisstopo, designates that part of the which lies within the cantonal borders of Geneva (excluding the cantonal exclave Céligny), so about from Versoix–Hermance to the Rhône outflow in Geneva.

The Chablais Alps border is its southern shore, and the western Bernese Alps lie over its eastern side. The high summits of Grand Combin and Mont Blanc are visible from some places.

The lake lies on the course of the Rhône. The river has its source at the Rhône Glacier near the Grimsel Pass to the east of the lake and flows down through the canton of Valais, entering the lake between Villeneuve and Le Bouveret, before flowing slowly towards its egress at Geneva. Other tributaries are La Dranse, L&#x27;Aubonne, La Morges, La Venoge, La Vuachère, and La Veveyse.
Lake Geneva is the largest body of water in Switzerland, and greatly exceeds in size all others that are connected with the main valleys of the Alps. It is in the shape of a crescent, with the horns pointing south, the northern shore being and the southern shore in length. The crescent form was more regular in a recent geological period, when the lake extended to Bex, about south of Villeneuve. The detritus of the Rhône has filled up this portion of the bed of the lake, and it appears that within the historical period, the waters extended about beyond the present eastern margin of the lake. The greatest depth of the lake, in the broad portion between Évian-les-Bains and Lausanne, where it is just in width, has been measured as , putting the bottom of the lake at above sea level. The lake&#x27;s surface is the lowest point of the cantons of Valais and Vaud. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is Monte Rosa at 4,634 metres above sea level.
The beauty of the shores of the lake and of the sites of many of the places near its banks has long been celebrated. However, it is only from the eastern end of the lake, between Vevey and Villeneuve, that the scenery assumes an Alpine character. On the south side, the mountains of Savoy and Valais are for the most part rugged and sombre, while those of the northern shore fall in gentle vine-covered slopes, thickly set with villages and castles.

The snowy peaks of the Mont Blanc Massif are shut out from the western end of the lake by the Voirons mountain, and from its eastern end by the bolder summits of the Grammont, Cornettes de Bise, and Dent d&#x27;Oche, but are seen from Geneva, and between Nyon and Morges. From Vevey to Bex, where the lake originally extended, the shores are enclosed by comparatively high and bold mountains, and the vista terminates in the grand portal of the defile of St. Maurice, cleft to a depth of nearly between the opposite peaks of the Dents du Midi and the Dent de Morcles.

The shore between Nyon and Lausanne is called because it is flatter. Between Lausanne and Vevey it is called Lavaux and is famous for its hilly vineyards.

The average surface elevation of above sea level is controlled by the in Geneva.

== Climate ==

Due to climate change, the average temperature of deep water (more than deep) increased from in 1963 to in 2016 (an increase of in 53 years), while the average temperature of surface water ( deep) increased from in 1970 to in 2016 (up in 46 years).


===Bise===
Lake Geneva (and particularly the lakeside parts of the city of Geneva) can be affected by the cold Bise, a northeasterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter. The strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the difference in air pressure between Geneva and Güttingen in canton of Thurgau. The Bise arises when the air pressure in Güttingen is higher than in Geneva.

==Environment==

In 563, according to the writings of Gregory of Tours and Marius Aventicensis, a tsunami wave swept along the lake, destroying the fort of Tauredunum and other settlements, and causing numerous deaths in Geneva. Simulations indicate that this Tauredunum event was most likely caused by a massive landslide near the Rhône delta, which caused a wave high to reach Geneva within 70 minutes. In 888, the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy, and, with it, was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire in 1033.

In the late 1960s, pollution made it dangerous to swim at some beaches of the lake; indeed, visibility underwater was near zero. By the 1980s, intense environmental pollution (eutrophication) had almost wiped out all the fish. Endemic whitefish species &quot;Coregonus fera&quot; was last recorded in the lake in 1920 and is now extinct. Although the name &quot;fera&quot; is still used for the only coregonid present in the lake, this is not the original species but the introduced &quot;C. palaea&quot;. Today, pollution levels have been dramatically cut back, and it is again considered safe to swim in the lake. Major leisure activities practiced include sailing, wind surfing, boating (including water skiing and wake-boarding), rowing, scuba diving, and bathing.

A total of four submarines have plied the depths of Lake Geneva. In 1964, Jacques Piccard launched a tourist-oriented submarine, the &quot;Auguste Piccard&quot; (named for his explorer father), for the Swiss National Exhibition, meant to honor the Expo 64 theme of accomplishments by Swiss engineers and industry. After operating through to 1965 in Lake Geneva, Piccard used the vessel for scientific exploration in other parts of the world. Piccard later built the &quot;F.-A. Forel&quot;, launched in Lake Geneva in 1978 and used primarily for scientific research until it was retired in 2005. In 2011, in a collaborative operation led by , two &quot;Mir&quot; submersibles were used for ten weeks to conduct extensive scientific research in Lake Geneva.

On a scientific footnote, in 1827, Lake Geneva was the site for the first measurement of the speed of sound in (fresh) water. French mathematician Jacques Charles François Sturm and Swiss physicist Daniel Collodon used two moored boats, separated by a measured distance, as the transmitting and receiving platforms for the sounds of exploding gunpowder. The loud airborne sound coupled into the lake, establishing a loud underwater sound that could be measured at a distance. The flash of the exploding gunpowder provided the visual starting cue for the timepiece, and the underwater explosion sound striking a bell provided the finish cue.

The lake is rich in wildlife, especially birds: both the common buzzard and the red kite breed here in considerable numbers.

== Sport events ==
Yacht racing is a popular sport, and high-performance catamarans have been developed specifically for the lake. The design of the &quot;Alinghi 5&quot;, the defender of the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup, was influenced by those racing catamarans. The best-known event, the (not to be confused with other events having the same name) runs from Geneva to the end of the lake and back.

The rowing event also takes place on Lake Geneva. Competitors row once around the entire lake, making this event the longest non-stop rowing regatta in the world.

Several competitions for swimmers are organised yearly, the longest of which spans the length of the lake from Chillon Castle to Geneva (70km) and is known as &quot;The Signature&quot;. Other events include the crossing of the lake from Lausanne to Evian (13km), from Montreux to Clarens (1.8 km), in Geneva (1.8 km), all in summer, and the , 125m in Geneva in December.

== Notable residents ==

Edmund Ludlow, famous as one who had signed the death warrant of English King Charles I, was granted on 16 April 1662 protection in and continued to live at Vevey until his death in 1692. Mary and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron holidayed by the lake and wrote ghost stories, one of which became the basis for the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Sisi) was stabbed to death on the quayside in Geneva in September 1898. Vladimir Lenin rented a little &quot;chalet&quot; at the French bank, near Geneva. Actor Charlie Chaplin spent his final years and died in Vevey (there is a memorial statue of him along the promenade; his home at Corsier-sur-Vevey is now a museum of his life and career). Actors Noël Coward, James Mason, Sir Peter Ustinov, Richard Burton, and Audrey Hepburn all lived in villages on the shores of or in view of the lake. David Bowie moved to a chalet to the north of Lake Geneva in 1976, which inspired him to take up painting and informed the first stages of the &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot;. Pop singer Phil Collins lives in a home overlooking the lake. Rock band Queen owned and operated Mountain Recording Studios (which is still in use today) in Montreux, and a statue of lead singer Freddie Mercury, who also owned a second home in Montreux, stands on the northern shore of the lake. Writer Vladimir Nabokov also took residence in Montreux, where he died in 1977. Former Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher lives with his family in a home overlooking the lake.

<text>Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals, fungi, and bacteria. It is the main storage form of glucose in the human body. 

Glycogen functions as one of three regularly used forms of energy reserves, creatine phosphate being for very short-term, glycogen being for short-term and the triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat) being for long-term storage. Protein, broken down into amino acids, is seldom used as a main energy source except during starvation and glycolytic crisis &quot;(see bioenergetic systems)&quot;. 

In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up 5–6% of the organ&#x27;s fresh weight: the liver of an adult, weighing 1.5 kg, can store roughly 100–120 grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass): the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.

The amount of glycogen stored in the body mostly depends on oxidative type 1 fibres, physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Different levels of resting muscle glycogen are reached by changing the number of glycogen particles, rather than increasing the size of existing particles though most glycogen particles at rest are smaller than their theoretical maximum.
Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times; in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores, primarily from the liver (glycogen in skeletal muscle is mainly used as an immediate source of energy for that muscle rather than being used to maintain physiological blood glucose levels). Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake from the blood, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues. Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.

Glycogen is an analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.

==Structure==
Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 residues per one molecule of glycogen.

Like amylopectin, glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.

Each glycogen is essentially a ball of glucose trees, with around 12 layers, centered on a glycogenin protein, with three kinds of glucose chains: A, B, and C. There is only one C-chain, attached to the glycogenin. This C-chain is formed by the self-glucosylation of the glycogenin, forming a short primer chain. From the C-chain grows out B-chains, and from B-chains branch out B- and A-chains. The B-chains have on average 2 branch points, while the A-chains are terminal, thus unbranched. On average, each chain has length 12, tightly constrained to be between 11 and 15. All A-chains reach the spherical surface of the glycogen.

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles (18 mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.

Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified. Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure.

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or &quot;fed&quot; state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

Glucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===

Muscle glycogen appears to function as a reserve of quickly available phosphorylated glucose, in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, for muscle cells. Glycogen contained within skeletal muscle cells are primarily in the form of β particles. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.

Skeletal muscle needs ATP (provides energy) for muscle contraction and relaxation, in what is known as the sliding filament theory. Skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity, as well as throughout high-intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity. During anaerobic activity, such as weightlifting and isometric exercise, the phosphagen system (ATP-PCr) and muscle glycogen are the only substrates used as they do not require oxygen nor blood flow. 

Different bioenergetic systems produce ATP at different speeds, with ATP produced from muscle glycogen being much faster than fatty acid oxidation. The level of exercise intensity determines how much of which substrate (fuel) is used for ATP synthesis also. Muscle glycogen can supply a much higher rate of substrate for ATP synthesis than blood glucose. During maximum intensity exercise, muscle glycogen can supply 40 mmol glucose/kg wet weight/minute, whereas blood glucose can supply 4 - 5 mmol. Due to its high supply rate and quick ATP synthesis, during high-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking, jogging, or running), the higher the exercise intensity, the more the muscle cell produces ATP from muscle glycogen. This reliance on muscle glycogen is not only to provide the muscle with enough ATP during high-intensity exercise, but also to maintain blood glucose homeostasis (that is, to not become hypoglycaemic by the muscles needing to extract far more glucose from the blood than the liver can provide). A deficit of muscle glycogen leads to muscle fatigue known as &quot;hitting the wall&quot; or &quot;the bonk&quot; &quot;(see below under glycogen depletion)&quot;. 

== Structure Type ==
In 1999, Meléndez et al claimed that the structure of glycogen is optimal under a particular metabolic constraint model, where the structure was suggested to be &quot;fractal&quot; in nature. However, research by Besford et al used small angle X-ray scattering experiments accompanied by branching theory models to show that glycogen is a randomly hyperbranched polymer nanoparticle. Glycogen is not fractal in nature. This has been subsequently verified by others who have performed Monte Carlo simulations of glycogen particle growth, and shown that the molecular density reaches a maximum near the centre of the nanoparticle structure, not at the periphery (contradicting a fractal structure that would have greater density at the periphery).

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a &quot;ferment&quot; in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called &quot;la matière glycogène&quot;, or &quot;sugar-forming substance&quot;. Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, M.A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ()n was established by August Kekulé in 1858.

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the nonreducing end of the glycogen chain.

The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===

Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:
In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100. Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6 phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the α(1→6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5 carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes or transport proteins necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===

Long-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete&#x27;s glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as &quot;hitting the wall&quot; in running and &quot;bonking&quot; in cycling.

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways:
* First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum.
* Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting, low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel, sparing carbohydrate use from all sources.
* Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores. This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.

When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.

===Nanomedicine===
Glycogen nanoparticles have been investigated as potential drug delivery systems.

<text>The Ford Anglia is a small family car that was designed and manufactured by Ford UK. It is related to the Ford Prefect and the later Ford Popular. The Anglia name was applied to various models between 1939 and 1967. In total, 1,594,486 Anglias were produced. It was replaced by the Ford Escort.

Unique variants of the Anglia were produced by Ford Australia and by the Italian subsidiary of Ford.

==Anglia E04A (1939–1948)==
The first Ford Anglia model, the E04A, was released on 31 October 1939 as the smallest model in the UK Ford range. It replaced the Ford 7Y and was a facelift of that model. The Anglia was a simple vehicle aimed at the affordable end of the market, with few features. Most were painted Ford black. Styling was typically late-1930s, with an upright radiator. Standard and deluxe models were available, with the latter having better instrumentation, and on prewar models, running boards. Both front and rear suspensions used transverse leaf springs, and the brakes were mechanical.

The two-door Anglia is similar to the longer, four-door, E93A Ford Prefect. A bulge at the back enabled a spare wheel to be removed from its vertical outside stowage on the back of the car and stowed flat on the boot floor, which usefully increased luggage space. Some back-seat leg room was sacrificed to the luggage space, being reduced from in the Ford 7Y to in the Anglia. The Anglia replaced the 7Y saloon, but the van version of the earlier model continued to be built until 1946, after which some very minor changes sufficed to rename the van the &quot;E04C&quot;.

The domestic market engine was the straight-four side-valve engine familiar to drivers of predecessor models since 1933. The 1172 cc straight-four engine from the Ford Ten was fitted for some export markets, including North America, where imports began for model year 1948; these cars used the slightly more aerodynamic &quot;three-hole&quot; grille from the 1937–38 Ford Ten 7W, prefacing the 1949 E494A facelift. They also had sealed-beam headlights and small, separate parking lights mounted underneath, as well as dual taillights, into which flashing turn signals could be added without adding additional lights. A minor styling change was made in December 1947, with the name &quot;Anglia&quot; now incorporated in the top of the grille surround.

The car retained a vacuum-powered wiper with its tendency to slow down or stop above about , the point at which the suction effect from the induction manifold disappeared; however, the Anglia&#x27;s wipers were supported by a vacuum reservoir, which partially addressed the propensity to stop entirely when the car was accelerated.

A contemporary road test commended the Anglia&#x27;s ability to pull away from in top gear. Compulsory driving tests had only recently been introduced in the UK. Most potential buyers would approach the vehicle without the benefit of formal driving tuition. The cars did have synchromesh between second and top gears, but not between first and second, so many would have sought, wherever possible, to avoid moving changes down to first.

Production, hindered by the diversion of Ford&#x27;s factory to military production during the Second World War, ceased in 1948 after 55,807 had been built. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945.

The E04A was also built in Australia from 1940 to 1945 and was produced in tourer and roadster body styles. The former had a rear seat and the latter was a two-seater convertible.


==Anglia A54A (Australia: 1946–1948)==

The Australian-built Anglia A54A used the chassis and front panels of the British E04A and was offered in four-door saloon, tourer, coupe utility, and panel van body styles. The 8 hp, 933 cc engine was used, and all models featured running boards.

Three different types of radiator grilles were fitted to A54A models. Both the original and the revised E04A grilles were used and a third style, unique to the A54A, was introduced in 1948. This featured a centrally placed vertical chrome strip.


==Anglia E494A (1949–1953)==
The 1949 model, code E494A, was a makeover of the previous model with a rather more 1940s-style front end, including the sloped, twin-lobed radiator grille. Again, it was a very spartan vehicle and in 1948, it was Britain&#x27;s lowest-priced four-wheel car. The 10 hp, 1172 cc engine was again available in export markets; this model is called the E493OA.

An Anglia tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1948 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 38.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £309 including taxes.

Including all production, 108,878 were built. When production as an Anglia ceased in October 1953, it continued as the extremely basic Ford Popular until 1959.


==Anglia A494A (Australia: 1949–1953)==

The Australian-built A494A Anglias of the 1949 to 1953 period shared the frontal styling and wheelbase chassis of their British E494A counterparts, but differed in many other ways, notably in the range of body styles offered. A494As were produced in four-door saloon, two-door tourer, two-door coupe utility, and two-door roadster utility models. All body styles had running boards, and the boot of the Australian saloon was less prominent than that of the British saloon. The 933 cc, 8 hp unit was initially the only engine offered, but the 1172 cc, 10 hp engine became available from 1950.

At the time of its introduction, the A494A Tourer was the cheapest new car on the Australian market.

==Anglia 100E (1953–1959)==
In 1953, Ford released the 100E, designed by Lacuesta Automotive. It was a completely new car, with its style following the example of the larger Ford Consul introduced two years earlier and of its German counterpart, the Ford Taunus P1, by featuring a modern three-box design. The 100E was available as a two-door Anglia and a four-door Prefect. During this period, the old Anglia was available as the 103E Popular, touted as the cheapest car in the world.

Internally, the individual front seats were trimmed in PVC, hinged to allow access to the rear. The instruments (speedometer, fuel gauge, and ammeter) were placed in a cluster around the steering column, and the gear change was floor-mounted. A heater and radio were optional extras. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver&#x27;s side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and &#x27;magic ribbon&#x27; AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and &#x27;58/&#x27;59 PA models, and included a glovebox.

Under the bonnet, the 100E still housed an antiquated, but actually new, side-valve engine sharing the bore and stroke of the old unit, but now with larger bearings and inlet valves and pump-assisted cooling. The three-speed gearbox was retained. Some models were fitted with a semiautomatic &quot;Manumatic&quot; gearbox. A second wind-screen wiper was now included at no extra cost, although the wipers&#x27; vacuum-powered operation was also retained; by now, this was seen as seriously old-fashioned and the wipers were notorious for slowing down when driving up steep hills, or coming to a complete rest when trying to overtake. The separate chassis construction of the previous models was replaced by unitary construction and the front suspension used &quot;hydraulic telescopic dampers and coil springs&quot; – now called MacPherson struts, a term that had not yet entered the public lexicon – with antiroll bar and semielliptic leaf springs at the rear. The car&#x27;s wheelbase was the shortest of any Anglia, but the front and rear tracks were increased to , and cornering on dry roads involved a degree of understeer; the steering took just two turns between locks, making the car responsive and easy to place on the road, although on wet roads, it was easy to make the tail slide out. A rare option for 1957 and 1958 was Newtondrive clutchless gearchange. The electrical system became 12-volt.

A facelift of the Anglia 100E was announced in October 1957. This included a new mesh radiator grille, new front lamp surrounds, a larger rear window, larger taillights, and chrome bumpers.

The 100E sold well; by the time production ceased in 1959, 345,841 had rolled off the production line. From 1955, two estate car versions were built, similar to the Thames 300E vans, but fitted with side windows, folding rear seats, and a horizontally split tailgate. This necessitated moving the fuel tank. These were the basic Escort and better appointed Squire, which sported wood trim down the sides. This feature has become a common feature of some Ford estates/station wagons ever since. The basic van variant was badged as a Thames product, as were all Ford commercials following the dropping of the Fordson badge.

An Anglia saloon tested by the British &quot;Motor&quot; magazine in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 29.4 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £511 including taxes.


==Anglia 105E (1959–1968)==

The fourth Anglia model, the 105E, was introduced in 1959. Its American-influenced styling included a sweeping nose line, muted tailfins, and on deluxe versions, a full-width slanted chrome grille in between prominent &quot;eye&quot; headlamps. Basic Anglias featured a narrower, painted grille. Its smoothly sloped line there looked more like a 1950s Studebaker (or even early Ford Thunderbird) than the more aggressive-looking late-&#x27;50s American Fords, possibly because its British designers used wind-tunnel testing and streamlining. Like late-&#x27;50s Lincolns and Mercurys (and later the Citroën Ami of France and the Consul Classic), the car sported a backward-slanted rear window (so that it would remain clear in rain, according to contemporary marketing claims). In fact, this look was imported from the 1958 Lincoln Continental, where it had been the accidental result of a design specification for an electrically opening (breezeway) rear window. An estate car joined the saloon in the line-up in September 1961. The instrument panel had a red light for the generator and a green one for the oil pressure.

The new styling was joined by something the smaller Fords had been needing for some time – a new engine – a 997 cc overhead valve (OHV) straight four with an oversquare cylinder bore that became known as the Kent. Acceleration from rest was still sluggish, but it was much improved from earlier cars. Also new for British Fords was a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three forward gears; this was replaced by an all-synchromesh box in September 1962 (on 1198 cc powered cars). The notoriously feeble vacuum-powered windscreen wipers of earlier Anglias were replaced with more conventional electrically powered ones. The Macpherson-strut independent front suspension used on the 100E was retained.

In October 1962, 24-year-old twins Tony and Michael Brookes and a group of friends took an Anglia 105E fitted with the £13 Ford Performance Kit to Montlhéry Autodrome near Paris and captured six International Class G World Records averaging . These were 4, 5, 6 and 7 days and nights and . The Anglia&#x27;s strength and durability meant only tyre changes were required.

The car&#x27;s commercial success has subsequently been overshadowed by the even greater sales achieved by the Ford Cortina. In 1960, when 191,752 Anglias left Ford&#x27;s Dagenham plant in the 105E&#x27;s first full production year, it set a new production-volume record for Ford of Britain. From October 1963, production continued at Ford&#x27;s new Halewood plant at Merseyside alongside the newly introduced Corsair models. The Anglia Super introduced in September 1962 for the 1963 model year shared the longer-stroke 1198 cc version of the Ford Kent 997 cc engine of the newly introduced Ford Cortina. The Anglia Super was distinguished by its painted contrasting-coloured side stripe.

A new Anglia saloon tested by the British &quot;Motor&quot; magazine in 1959 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 26.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £610 including taxes of £180.

The old 100E Anglia became the new 100E Popular and the four-door Prefect bodyshell remained available as the new Ford Prefect (107E), which had all 105E running gear, including engine, gearbox and axle whilst retaining the 100E wheels, while the 100E Escort and Squire remained available, unchanged. In 1961, the Escort and Squire were replaced by the 105E Anglia estate. The 100E delivery van also gave way to a new vehicle based on the 105E.

In South Africa, the Anglia&#x27;s popularity came late. Sales really took off in early 1966, with the local introduction of the Anglia Super, and 1967 was the car&#x27;s best year, with a ninth place in overall automobile registrations. Production actually continued longer in South Africa than anywhere else; it was built alongside the Escort from remaining stock until at least the end of 1968.

===105E-based Thames and Anglia Vans===
Anglia 105E-based Thames 307E 5- and 7-cwt vans released in 1961 were fitted with the 997 cc engine from the Anglia 105E. Although they shared front body panels with the Anglia saloon, the vans were structurally quite different, with a taller windscreen and differently shaped passenger doors, which curved up to the rear along their bottom edges to avoid damage from kerbing. Left-hand drive export versions were designated Thames 308E. The Anglia name was used for certain export markets.

From October 1962, the 5- and 7-cwt vans were also offered with the 1198 cc engine from the Ford Anglia Super and these were designated Thames 309E. Left hand drive export versions were designated Thames 310E.

In March 1965, the use of the Thames name was discontinued, and from that time, all Anglia-based vans were marketed as Ford Anglias. Production ended in November 1967 with a total of 205,001 vans having been produced.

=== Anglia Torino 105E (1965–1967)===

The Anglia Torino 105E was developed by the Italian subsidiary of Ford, using the chassis and mechanical components of the 105E Saloon, with new body panels. The Torino was styled by Giovanni Michelotti and built in Turin by Officine Stampaggi Industriali; 10,007 examples were sold in Italy. The model was also marketed in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.


==Anglia Super 123E (1962–1967)==

From 1962, the 123E Anglia Super was available alongside the 105E, replacing the last of the line of Prefects, with a larger 1198 cc engine and other refinements.

The same car was also sold in continental Europe. One mainland Europe-only variant was the Anglia Sportsman, which carried its spare tyre on the back, somewhat similar to the continental kit often seen in the United States. Chrome bumper overriders, broad whitewall tyres and optionally a side stripe kicking up at the end into the taillights/fin were also fitted. The Super only arrived in South Africa in 1966, although it did boost sales considerably. Towards the end of the run, Ford experimented with two colours of metallic paint on the Anglia, &quot;Blue Mink&quot; and &quot;Venetian Gold&quot;; 250 were made in the blue and 500 were made in the gold.

Anglia saloons were provided with various levels of trim. The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel-slatted grille, and limited interior trim. The Deluxe had a chrome side strip, chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor, and full-width chrome radiator grille. The top of the range was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear.

Optional extras were the mechanical upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super, retaining the Deluxe trim, or the upgrade of a Deluxe to a Super trim, but retaining the 997 cc engine, an option rarely taken up.

<text>Lake Winnipeg () is a very large, relatively shallow lake in North America, in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Its southern end is about north of the city of Winnipeg. Lake Winnipeg is Canada&#x27;s sixth-largest freshwater lake and the third-largest freshwater lake contained entirely within Canada, but it is relatively shallow (mean depth of ) excluding a narrow deep channel between the northern and southern basins. It is the eleventh-largest freshwater lake on Earth. The lake&#x27;s east side has pristine boreal forests and rivers that were in 2018 inscribed as Pimachiowin Aki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The lake is from north to south, with remote sandy beaches, large limestone cliffs, and many bat caves in some areas. Manitoba Hydro uses the lake as one of the largest reservoirs in the world. There are many islands, most of them undeveloped.

== Hydrography ==

Lake Winnipeg has the largest watershed of any lake in Canada, receiving water from four provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Manitoba) and four U.S. states: (North Dakota and Minnesota via tributaries of the Red River, South Dakota via rivers draining into Lake Traverse, and Montana via tributaries of the Oldman River).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart/Watkinson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The lake&#x27;s watershed measures about .

Lake Winnipeg drains northward into the Nelson River at an average annual rate of 2,066 cubic metres per second (72,960 cu ft/s) and forms part of the Hudson Bay watershed, which is one of the largest drainage basins in the world. This watershed area was known as Rupert&#x27;s Land when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was chartered in 1670.

=== Tributaries ===

The Saskatchewan River flows in from the west through Cedar Lake, the Red River (including Assiniboine River) flows in from the south, and the Winnipeg River (draining Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake) enters from the southeast. The Dauphin River enters from the west, draining Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis. The Bloodvein River, Berens River, Poplar River and the Manigotagan River flow in from the eastern side of the lake which is within the Canadian Shield.

Other tributaries of Lake Winnipeg (clockwise from the south end) include Meleb Drain (drainage canal), Drunken River, Icelandic River, Washow Bay Creek, Sugar Creek, Beaver Creek, Mill Creek, Moose Creek, Fisher River, Jackhead River, Kinwow Bay Creek, Jackpine Creek, Mantagao River, Solomons Creek, Jumping Creek, Warpath River, South Two Rivers, North Two Rivers, South Twin Creek, North Twin Creek, Saskachaywiak Creek, Eating Point Creek, Woody Point Creeks, Muskwa Creek, Buffalo Creek, Fiddler Creek, Sturgeon Creek, Hungry River, Cypress Creek, William River, Bélanger River, Mukutawa River, Crane Creek, Kapawekapuk Creek, Marchand Creek, Leaf River, Pigeon River, Taskapekawe Creek, Bradbury River, Petopeko Creek, Loon Creek, Sanders Creek, Rice River, Wanipigow River, Barrie Creek, Mutch Creek, Sandy River, Black River, Sandy Creek, Catfish Creek, Jackfish Creek, Marais Creek, Brokenhead River and Devils Creek.

==Geology==
Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba are remnants of prehistoric Glacial Lake Agassiz, although there is evidence of a desiccated south basin of Lake Winnipeg approximately 4,000 years ago. The area between the lakes is called the Interlake Region, and the whole region is called the Manitoba Lowlands.

==Natural history==
===Fish===
The varying habitats found within the lake support a large number of fish species, more than any other lake in Canada west of the Great Lakes. Sixty of seventy-nine native species found in Manitoba are present in the lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart/Watkinson_occurence&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Families represented include lampreys (Petromyzontidae), sturgeon (Acipenseridae), mooneyes (Hiodontidae), minnows (Cyprinidae), suckers (Catostomidae), catfish (Ictaluridae), pike (Esocidae), trout and whitefish (Salmonidae), troutperch (Percopsidae), codfish (Gadidae), sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae), sculpins (Cottidae), sunfish (Centrarchidae), perch (Percidae), and drum (Sciaenidae).

Two fish species present in the lake are considered to be at risk, the shortjaw cisco and the bigmouth buffalo.

Rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked in Manitoba waters by provincial fisheries as part of a put and take program to support angling opportunities. Neither species is able to sustain itself independently in Manitoba.
Smallmouth bass was first recorded from the lake in 2002, indicating populations introduced elsewhere in the watershed are now present in the lake.
White bass were first recorded from the lake in 1963, ten years after being introduced into Lake Ashtabula in North Dakota.
Common carp were introduced to the lake through the Red River of the North and are firmly established.

===Birds===
Lake Winnipeg provides feeding and nesting sites for a wide variety of birds associated with water during the summer months. 

Isolated, uninhabited islands provide nesting sites for colonial nesting birds including pelicans, gulls and terns. Large marshes, shores and shallows allow these birds to successfully feed themselves and their young. Pipestone Rocks are considered a globally significant site for American white pelicans. In 1998, an estimated 3.7% of the world&#x27;s population of this bird at the time were counted nesting on the rocky outcrops. The same site is significant within North America for the numbers of colonial waterbirds using the area, especially common terns. Other globally significant nesting areas are found at Gull Island and Sandhill Island, Little George Island and Louis Island. Birds nesting at these sites include common and Caspian terns, herring gulls, ring-billed gulls, double-crested cormorants and greater scaups.

Lake Winnipeg has two sites considered globally important in the fall migration. Large populations of waterfowl and shorebirds use the sand bars east of Riverton as a staging area for fall migration. The Netley-Libau Marsh, where the Red River enters Lake Winnipeg, is used by geese, ducks and swallows to gather for the southward migration.

Piping plovers, an endangered species of shorebird, are found in several locations around the lake. The Gull Bay Spits, south of the town of Grand Rapids, are considered nationally significant nesting sites for this species.

===Environmental issues===

Lake Winnipeg is suffering from many environmental issues such as an explosion in the population of cyanobacteria, caused by excessive amounts of phosphorus seeping into the lake. The phosphorus levels are approaching a point that could be dangerous for human health.

The Global Nature Fund declared Lake Winnipeg as the &quot;threatened lake of the year&quot; in 2013.

In 2015, there was a major uptick of zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg, the reduction of which is next to impossible because of a lack of natural predators in the lake. The mussels are devastating to the ecological opportunities of the lake.

== History ==
It is believed Henry Kelsey was the first European to see the lake, in 1690. He adopted the Cree language name for the lake: (), meaning &quot;muddy waters&quot;. La Vérendrye referred to the lake as &quot;Ouinipigon&quot; when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Later, the Red River Colony to its south took the lake&#x27;s name for Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba.

Lake Winnipeg lies along one of the oldest trading routes in North America to have flown the British flag. For several centuries, furs were traded along this route between York Factory on Hudson Bay (which was the long-time headquarters for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company) over Lake Winnipeg and the Red River Trails to the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers at Saint Paul, Minnesota. This was a strategic trading route for the First British Empire. With the establishment of the Second British Empire after Britain&#x27;s loss of the Thirteen Colonies, a significant increase in trade occurred over Lake Winnipeg between Rupert&#x27;s Land and the United States.

In 2016 the Indigenous place name &quot;Weenipagamiksaguygun&quot; was approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. It is an Anishinaabe name for the lake as used by the Poplar River First Nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Language selection - Natural Resources Canada / Sélection de la langue - Ressources naturelles Canada 2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
=== Transportation ===
Because of its length, the Lake Winnipeg water system and the lake was an important transportation route in the province before the railways reached Manitoba. It continued to be a major transportation route even after the railways reached the province. In addition to aboriginal canoes and York boats, several steamboats plied the lake, including &quot;Anson Northup&quot;, &quot;City of Selkirk&quot;, &quot;Colvile&quot;, &quot;Keenora&quot;, &quot;Premier&quot;, &quot;Princess&quot;, &quot;Winnitoba&quot;, &quot;Wolverine&quot; and most recently the diesel-powered &quot;MS Lord Selkirk II&quot; passenger cruise ship.

=== Communities ===
Communities on the lake include Grand Marais, Lester Beach, Riverton, Gimli, Winnipeg Beach, Victoria Beach, Hillside Beach, Pine Falls, Manigotagan, Berens River, Bloodvein, Sandy Hook, Albert Beach, Hecla Village and Grand Rapids. A number of pleasure beaches are found on the southern end of the lake, which are popular in the summer, attracting many visitors from Winnipeg, approximately 80 km south.
=== Recreational Angling ===
Lake Winnipeg is widely recognized as a premier angling destination, attracting anglers from around the globe &quot;targeting it&#x27;s abundant walleye, sauger and channel catfish populations&quot; along with northern pike, yellow perch, gold eye, mooneye. Angling efforts vary from casting lines from shore, trolling its depths or dropping a line through the ice in search of a Master Angler Walleye, considered to be a Walleye caught in Manitoba by hook and line measuring over 71cm (28&quot;).

As of 2010 &quot;over 50,000 anglers fished more than 389,000 days on the Red River and Lake Winnipeg combined&quot; and &quot;contribute an estimated $20,000,000 to $32,000,000 annually. and as of 2018 that had grown to nearly 100,000 adult anglers fishing Lake Winnipeg and its southern tributaries, adding $102,000,000 to the provincial GDP supporting some 1,500 jobs. 

Many licensed outfitters offer a wide array of services from guided fishing trips to equipment rentals and accommodations in service of recreational anglers.

Recent introduction of new angling regulations aim to ensure the sustainability of the fishery, with an extended season closure during the spring walleye spawn, reduced possession limits, and an end to the retention of trophy sized fish.

=== Commercial fisheries ===
Lake Winnipeg has important commercial fisheries. It contributes 57% of the province&#x27;s total production and 75% of the landed value of the harvest in Manitoba. Average annual landings from Lake Winnipeg from 2009 to 2015 were 6,539,739 kg, with an average value of $15,357,975. The lake was once the main source of goldeye in Canada, which is why the fish is sometimes called Winnipeg goldeye. Walleye and whitefish together account for over 90 percent of its commercial fishing.

<text>Lake Manitoba () is the 14th largest lake in Canada and the 33rd largest lake in the world with a total area of . It is located within the Canadian province of Manitoba about northwest of the province&#x27;s capital, Winnipeg, at .

==History==
The lake, its shores populated by the Assiniboine and Cree, was made known to Europeans by La Vérendrye in the mid-1730s. He and his sons travelled from Fort La Reine through this lake to explore the Saskatchewan River and its environs. Forts were established on both the Saskatchewan and Cedar Lake. It also was part of the fur trade route to Hudson Bay.

The name derives from Cree &quot;manitou-wapow&quot; or Ojibwa &quot;manidoobaa&quot;, both meaning &quot;straits of Manitou, the Great Spirit&quot;, a toponym referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of the lake. These narrows were an area that the spirit could be heard. What exactly was heard, and in what exact location, seems to be a mystery. The lake was known to French explorers as &quot;Lac des Prairies&quot;.

The short-lived Republic of Manitobah and its successor the province of Manitoba both take their name from this lake.

=== Manipogo ===
For many years there have been claims that a monster similar to Scotland&#x27;s Loch Ness Monster and British Columbia&#x27;s Ogopogo lives in the lake. It has been named Manipogo. Sightings of this serpent like sea monster have been going on since roughly 1908.

==Geography==

The irregularly shaped lake, about long, is the smallest of a group of three large lakes, the other two being Lake Winnipeg (the largest) and Lake Winnipegosis, which are found on the floor of the prehistoric Glacial Lake Agassiz. The lake is subdivided into two connected but distinctly different basins: a small, irregular-shaped north basin and a much larger south basin. It is part of the watershed of the Nelson River and Hudson Bay.

The southern tip of the lake, north of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, ends in the Delta Marsh, an important staging ground for migrating birds.

Communities on the lake include Fairford, Steep Rock, St. Laurent, and Sandy Bay.

=== Tributaries and outflows ===
The lake is primarily fed by Lake Winnipegosis to its northwest via the Waterhen River, with an average annual contribution of . The Whitemud River and local overland flow average about . Precipitation contributes about . From 1970 to 2003 the Portage Diversion has contributed an average annual volume of from the Assiniboine River. Lake Manitoba drains northeast into Lake Winnipeg through the Fairford River to Lake St. Martin and then to the Dauphin River. The average annual river outflow is . Average evaporation is per year. Most of the water inflow is from the Waterhen River (42% of the inflow) and from precipitation directly on the lake&#x27;s surface (40%), while nearly 50% of the outflow is by evaporation. This explains its hyposaline nature.

=== Water control dam ===
Severe flooding around the lake led to the excavation of an improved outlet channel between 1899 and 1901. In 1933 following dry years in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Province constructed a concrete control dam across the Fairford River immediately downstream of the channel. A new dam was constructed in 1961. The new structure is operated to try to control levels between above sea level.
=== Flood in 2011 ===
Due to above average snowfall over the winter of 2010–2011, and above average precipitation in the spring over the Lake Manitoba watershed, forecasted water levels on Lake Manitoba called for levels above the regulated upper range of above sea level and around the flood stage of above sea level. With the added inflows of the Portage Diversion due to high water levels on the Assiniboine River and its tributaries, of up to of water the lake peaked at above sea level on July 21. On May 31, 2011, when the lake was already very high, , strong winds from the north and the north-west of gusting to caused major damage to beaches and communities on the south basin of the lake including Twin Lakes Beach, St. Laurent, St. Ambroise, Delta Beach, Lynch Point, Big Point, and large areas of farmland.

===Historical floods===
Unlike a river which can rise and recede relatively quickly, large lakes like Lake Manitoba require months or even years for lake levels to rise and fall. Below are the flood years on record in which Lake Manitoba was above flood stage, as defined by Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation (MIT), of ASL. However, beginning around a level of ASL, localized flooding of agricultural land around the lake can occur.

*In 1881-82 lake levels were not recorded. However, given the topography around Lake Manitoba, a level of ASL would be required to cause the lake to drain back into the Assiniboine River, which occurred in both 1881 and 1882. Also, a flow of was recorded on the Fairford River in 1881, long before significant channel improvements were made. Based on a rating curve for flows on the Fairford River during this period, the flows correlate with a lake level as high as ASL. Furthermore, in his 1890 study entitled &quot;Report of Exploration of the Glacial Lake Agassiz in Manitoba&quot;, Warren Upham states that Lake Manitoba rose approximately above its lowest level, which records show to be around ASL, suggesting a peak of ASL.
*Lake Levels did not begin to be recorded until 1914. However, in 1913 a flow rate of on the Fairford River was recorded, which based on a rating curve for flows during this period would correspond with a lake level of greater than ASL.
*On May 31, 2011, during a major wind event, Lake Manitoba was measured at ASL at Twin Lakes Beach. As a result of the high water level with wind set-up and wave action, significant damage occurred along the south basin of Lake Manitoba. The 2011 peak flood level is the wind-eliminated peak lake level.

==Fishing==
Lake Manitoba is one of the three main lakes in Manitoba&#x27;s $30-million annual commercial fishing industry.

The main marketable fish species caught on Lake Manitoba has changed from whitefish in the late 19th century to walleye, sauger and yellow perch today. There has been a large increase in rough fish like carp. Tullibee catch remains high, although it is not considered a commercial species.

The total recorded catch of the commercial winter fishery on the lake has declined from annually in the late 1940s to less than in 2002.

<text> (, , NS ) is the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands. It is a Dutch state-owned company founded in 1938. The Dutch rail network is the busiest in the European Union, and the third busiest in the world after Switzerland and Japan.

The rail infrastructure is maintained by network manager ProRail, which was split off from NS in 2003. Freight operator NS Cargo merged with DB Cargo in 2000. NS runs 4,800 scheduled domestic trains a day, serving 1.1 million passengers. The NS also provides international rail services from the Netherlands to other European destinations and carries out concessions on some foreign rail markets through its subsidiary Abellio.

== History ==

===Early years===

World War I caused an economic downturn in the Netherlands that caused the two largest Dutch railway companies, Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (HSM) and Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (SS), to become unprofitable. The companies avoided bankruptcy by integrating their operations, which was complete by 1917. The cooperation was for both economic and ideological reasons, and the state provided support by buying shares in both companies. In 1938, the state bought the remaining shares and merged the companies to create NS; NS was not nationalised.
During World War II, NS was forced by the Germans to construct railways to Westerbork transit camp and transport almost a hundred thousand Jews to extermination camps. The company&#x27;s only wartime strike was during the Dutch famine of 1944–45; NS opted not to strike a year earlier.

NS played a pivotal role in the post-war reconstruction of the Netherlands; it provided the required logistical services in a time when there was little alternative to rail transport. The company declined in the 1960s – like many other railways – and operated at a loss. There was increased competition from other modes of transport. In addition, national coal distribution from Limburg became less profitable; the discovery of a gas field near Slochteren led to coal losing market share to natural gas in power plants and homes. NS&#x27; response, the &quot;Spoorslag &#x27;70&quot; plan which increased service and introduced intercity service, failed to restore profitability. The company was deemed nationally important and received state subsidies.

===Reforms and reversal===

NS was reorganized following the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s and the 1991 EU Directive 91/440; the latter required railway infrastructure and transport activities to be managed independently. Although the state called the process &quot;corporatization&quot; (&quot;verzelfstandiging&quot;), it really only meant the withdrawal of subsidies. The changes were carried out by Rob den Besten, who became chief executive officer of NS after the retirement of Leo Ploeger.

NS&#x27; infrastructure division was split off into NS Railinfratrust. Plans to split the remainder of NS met with limited success due to trade union opposition; the new companies created were NS Reizigers and locomotive maintenance company NedTrain. Passenger transport was to be conducted on a commercial basis, but the state continued to subsidize non-viable routes. Internally, route managers assumed de facto control, The freight business, NS Cargo, merged with Deutsche Bahn; the resulting company operated as Railion in 2000 and then as DB Cargo. Performance deteriorated after the reforms, and the company suffered multiple unorganized strikes. The entire board of directors resigned in late-2001.

Another change in strategy followed. Karel Noordzij became CEO in 2002 and reversed many of the reforms to restore confidence in the company. The state no longer considered competitive passenger service to be viable, and began granting concessions with the goal of one concession per line. NS received a concession to run main line routes until 2025.

===Recent years===

The timetable change on 10 December 2006 saw the most routes to approximate the symmetry minute in clock-face schedules to the one used in most other European countries. The previous symmetry minute 46 led to problems with cross-border trains. the company&#x27;s CEO is former minister Wouter Koolmees, after Marjan Rintel left to become CEO of KLM.

NS was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused massive drops in passenger numbers. The company received significant financial support from the national government in order to keep the company solvent. In 2022, the company made significant cuts in its timetable, running fewer and shorter trains, as a consequence of personnel shortages.

== Controversies ==
NS has been involved in various controversies.
* Technical problems with the high-speed V250 trains, which started their services on 29 July 2013, and ended on 17 January 2014, led to the resignation of CEO Bert Meerstadt in June 2016 and a parliamentary investigation in 2016. The High Speed Alliance (HSA), an NS (80%) / KLM (20%) joint venture almost went bankrupt due to the late introduction of the trains in combination with a too high price for the concession which the company paid to the Dutch government. HSA was liquidated in 2017.
* In 2013, it was revealed that NS had been using a subsidiary in Ireland, NS Financial Services Company (NSFSC), to reduce its tax liability in the Netherlands. The procedure was determined to be lawful, but it was unfavorable for the Dutch taxpayers for a state-owned company to avoid national taxes. From 1998 the NS used the favourable tax climate in Ireland, which resulted in a profit for NS of more than €270 million but a loss to the Dutch state of €21 million in 2012 alone. The corporate tax rate in Ireland was 12.5%, in the Netherlands 25% at that time. NS used its Irish subsidiary to buy new trains, among others the high-speed V250 trains from the Italian firm AnsaldoBreda. The Dutch Minister of Finance, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, wrote to the parliament that NS would stop this tax evasion. Most rolling stock was transferred to the Netherlands-based NS Lease in December 2017. NSFSC was wound up in April 2019.
* In 2015 it became clear that a subsidiary of NS, Abellio, had shown unfair behaviour about a tendering for public transport in the province of Limburg. The company had obtained confidential information from a competitor, Veolia, through a former employee of Veolia who had been hired by Abellio subsidiary Qbuzz. On 5 June 2015, it became clear that CEO Timo Huges of the NS had given incomplete and incorrect information about the tendering procedure. According to Minister Dijsselbloem, Huges had acted &quot;sloppy, inaccurate and in violation of the law.&quot; Consequently, Huges resigned from his position.

==Coverage==
The NS covers most of the country, with almost all cities connected, mostly with a service frequency of two trains an hour or more and at least four trains per hour between all of the largest five cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Eindhoven) as well as some smaller cities (Nijmegen, Amersfoort, Arnhem, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Dordrecht and Leiden). From December 2008 train frequencies were increased on the following services: Arnhem–Nijmegen (8 trains per hour) and The Hague–Rotterdam (12 trains per hour), Amsterdam Centraal–Hoofddorp (16 trains per hour). A night train service was added between Utrecht, Gouda and Rotterdam. Trains usually run between 5:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. although there is also a nightline which connects major cities in the Randstad throughout the night, as well as in weekends also some major cities in North Brabant.

In addition to its domestic services, NS is also a partner (along with Stena Line and British railway company Greater Anglia) in the &quot;Dutchflyer&quot; service. NS has also entered into a partnership with KLM to operate services on the new HSL-Zuid under the name Intercity Direct towards Breda and Brussels. Intercity Direct is part of NS International; other services such as Eurostar to France and Intercity-Express to Germany and Switzerland are also part of NS International.

===Rail network===

The &quot;hoofdrailnet&quot; is the official core internal passenger rail network of the Netherlands. Currently, NS has a concession until 1 January 2034 to provide all passenger services on this network, except that on some stretches there is an overlap with lines for which other operators have a concession. Some of the most notable of these stretches are those from Elst railway station to Arnhem Centraal railway station, where NS shares tracks with Arriva, and further on to Arnhem Velperpoort. Here the tracks are shared by three operators, as Breng, ultimately part of Transdev, operates there in addition to the two previously mentioned operators. Officially the overlaps do not constitute competition on the same lines.

The concession was free of charge until 2009, and costs an increasing amount since then, up to €30 million for the year 2014. The concession distinguishes the main stations and other stations. Except on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the main stations have to be served at least twice an hour per direction from 6 a.m. to midnight and the other stations at least once an hour. Exceptions are possible until the start of the next concession.

The next concession period is 2025–2035. For the 2015–2025 concession, requirements include: for every train service where on average more than one-third of the passengers travel longer than 30 minutes, a train with a toilet is used, every newly ordered train has a toilet and in 2025 every train has to have a toilet. The last trains on the hoofdrailnet without a toilet were the NS SGMm (the so-called classical &quot;Sprinter&quot;, retired 2018–21) and the Sprinter Lighttrain (SLT, these trains have since had on-board toilets retrofitted).

==Types of train service==

NS provides three kinds of train service:
# A stops at all stations, and is mainly used for local traffic. On some smaller lines, though, it is the only kind of service. The name is derived from the &#x27;Sprinter&#x27; (2900 class) rolling stock; however, the service was sometimes operated using older style rolling stock (such as &#x27;Plan V/T&#x27;: 400, 500, 800, and 900 class). Since December 2019, all Sprinter services are run exclusively with Sprinter trains.
# services only stop at larger stations and were introduced in the 1970s to provide fast train connections throughout the country. Intercity services are operated by DDZ, VIRM and ICM class trains. An exception is the service between The Hague and Eindhoven, which makes use of the high-speed line between Rotterdam and Breda, which is run by modified carriages with TRAXX and the newly built high-speed ICNG. When a line is not served by Sprinters, Intercity trains stop at all stations. This takes place on the lines between Alkmaar – Den Helder, Hoorn – Enkhuizen, Zwolle - Deventer and Deurne – Venlo. Between Vlissingen and Roosendaal, one Intercity does only stop on Intercity stations, while the other stops on all stations. See also Intercity services in the Netherlands and . Keolis also runs one Intercity service an hour, between Zwolle and Enschede, the two largest cities in the province of Overijssel.
# The Intercity Direct service, which offers faster service between Amsterdam Centraal and Breda as it makes use of the high-speed line HSL-Zuid and calls at only two intermediate stations (Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal). Unlike other Intercity trains, the Intercity Direct requires payment of a supplement on top of the regular fare (€2.90 during peak hours and €1.74 during off-peak hours) if a passenger&#x27;s journey involves the high-speed line between Schiphol Airport and Rotterdam Centraal. A regular Intercity service that is free of supplements is still offered. Trains are operated by modified carriages and ICNG.

There are also two former train categories, which are now used only by private operators:
# (Stopping train): This is the original name for &quot;Sprinter&quot; trains. Between 2003 and 2013 NS discharged the &quot;Stoptrein&quot; formula in favour of &quot;Sprinter&quot;. Private operators do not use &quot;Sprinter&quot; so this name is still used by NS for private operators, although private operators often use &quot;RS,&quot; standing for &quot;Regionaalsprinter (Regional Sprinter).&quot;
# (Fast train): &quot;Sneltrein&quot; (in the English section of the old paper time tables, they were translated as &quot;semi fast train&quot; and were a class between Stoptrein and Intercity) was abandoned by NS in 2008. The NS Sneltrein services were not abandoned, but were called &#x27;Intercity&#x27;. Over the years, some became Sprinters (like the services between Leiden and Utrecht), while most services were integrated in the Intercity network (like the service between Lelystad and Dordrecht). As of 2024, private operators use the term, along with the from Germany imported term &quot;RE,&quot; standing for &quot;Regionaalexpress (Regional Express).&quot;

==Fares and tickets==

You can travel using contactless payments on all Dutch public transport: on all domestic trains, metros, trams and busses, nationwide. Using contactless payments, you travel 2nd class, regular full price. The price is the same as using the anonymous ov-chipcard (see below). You do not need an app or ticket, nor do you have to register or signup to use this. Apple Pay, Google Pay and many contactless debit and credit cards can directly be used.

Travelling using contactless works as following: At the start of your journey, place your smartphone or bank card in front of the reader to check-in. At the end of your journey, or if you transfer, check-out at the same way. If you use a bank card, be sure to remove it from your wallet, to ensure that the system uses the right card. The costs will be shown in your bank transfer statement the next day, along with a website link and code to get your travel itinerary.

The OV-chipkaart is another common form of fare payment. Single or return tickets, used by incidental travellers and tourists, are available at ticket machines and service counters at a surcharge of €1. They are a disposable use-once only. It is possible to buy e-tickets online on the Dutch Railways website. E-tickets can also be purchased on the Belgian NMBS/SNCB B-Europe website. For long-term use, season tickets are available.

Travelling with these cards and tickets, one has to register starting a journey (&quot;check-in&quot;) and ending it (&quot;check out&quot;) at the destination. One always has to travel away from the point of one&#x27;s latest check-in. Thus, in the case of a voluntary detour, one has to check out and check in to register starting a new journey.

Travellers need to be aware of the various companies other than the . One needs to check out with one company and check in with another on some stations. There is common tariff system with four smaller passenger train operating companies: Keolis Nederland and Connexxion in the centre and the east, Veolia on the &#x27;Maaslijn&#x27; and &#x27;Heuvellandlijn&#x27; in the southeast, Arriva in the north and most of the east of the country and on the &#x27;Merwede-Lingelijn&#x27; (from Dordrecht to Geldermalsen).

The OV-chipkaart is also used on buses and trams, where hourly tickets are for sale for those who have too little credit to travel but enough cash.

===Off-peak discount passes===
NS defines off-peak hours as weekdays from 09:00–16:00 and 18:30–06:30, and on Saturdays and Sundays the whole day. Therefore, the full fare is required on weekdays 06:30–09:00 and 16:00–18:30. With an OV-chipkaart that allows for a discount or free travel, one is automatically granted the discount or free travel at the time of checking in. There are several season tickets available that suit individual preferences.
==Logo==

The NS corporate logo was designed in 1968 by Gert Dumbar and Gert-Jan Leuvelink, both of the graphic design company Tel Design. Introduced in that same year, it replaced an earlier design which had been used since 1946. The logo, pervasive within trains and railway stations in the Netherlands, plays a significant part in &#x27;s signage, promotions, advertising, and graphic design.

The logo usually appears in blue or black on a dark yellow or white background. Since its introduction, NS livery has also had this same distinct dark yellow or white colour. The logo is a widened letter &#x27;N&#x27; and a sideways (reversed) &#x27;S&#x27;-shape. The two arrows in the logo represent the train&#x27;s movement, and the two lines in the middle represent the track.

==Divisions of NS==

*Abellio – the subsidiary for operations outside the Netherlands. Abellio has operated franchises in the United Kingdom and Germany.

:In 2003, Abellio commenced operating its first rail franchise in the United Kingdom, through its 50% shareholding in Serco-Abellio. From 2004 until 2016, Serco-Abellio also operated the Northern Rail franchise. In May 2009, the Travel London and Travel Surrey bus businesses were purchased from National Express and rebranded as Abellio London and Abellio Surrey.

:In February 2012, Abellio Greater Anglia commenced operating the Greater Anglia franchise, and in April 2015, Abellio ScotRail commenced operating the ScotRail franchise. In 2016, Abellio successfully bid to retain the renamed East Anglia franchise until 2025. Abellio partnered with Mitsui for both the East Anglia and the West Midlands franchises, the latter also with JR East. In June 2019 Abellio began operating the East Midlands Railway eight-year franchise.

:In February 2023 Abellio sold its UK operations to Transport UK Group.

*NS Reizigers (NSR) – NS Travellers, responsible for passenger train services and for employing train drivers and conductors.
*NS Stations – the result of merging the former :
**NS Stations – in charge of the operation of all 404 railway stations in the Netherlands, i.e., also those served by other railway companies than NS Reizigers; see also station facilities.
**NS Vastgoed – owns 48 km2 of land, often near stations, and develops and operates these areas as public traffic nodes, offices and apartments.
*NedTrain – train maintenance.
*NS Commercie – product- and customer management (business and product development, marketing, sales and customer service).
*NS International – operator, in conjunction with NS Reizigers and foreign partners, of Thalys (from Amsterdam to Paris), ICE (to Cologne and Frankfurt), Intercities (to Berlin) and Intercity Direct services (to Brussels via the HSL-Zuid) and the Nightjet (to Vienna and Innsbruck).

In dealing with the general public, these distinctions are not made and the terms and NS are used.

NS has contracts with Connexxion and BBA, now Veolia Transport for the provision of bus services to replace train services in the case of planned and unplanned cancellations.

On 23 July 2010 NS sold Strukton to the construction company Oranjewoud N.V.. This concluded a long history of planning, designing and executing track development done by the NS.

==Policy==
There is a delay refund scheme entitling passengers to a partial or full refund of the ticket price if a journey is delayed by half an hour or more. The scheme does not apply on short-distance journeys (tickets less than €2.30) and cases in which the delay is the result of planned cancellations that were announced some days in advance. Refunds are, in general, half the ticket price of a one-way trip after a delay of over 30 minutes, and the full ticket price after a delay of one hour or more. That applies to nearly all kinds of tickets. The refund is not considered monetary compensation for lost time but rather as a reduction in charges where poor service has been provided. The system has been improved for holders of some rail passes. Part of the cost of the scheme is paid by ProRail, since they are responsible for part of the delays.

Tobacco smoking is prohibited both on trains and in stations. Smoking on trains has been prohibited since 2004, with smoking in stations permitted in designated smoking zones, until this too was disallowed in October 2020.

Since June 2003, the sale of coffee, soft drinks, beer, sandwiches, candy, etc., has ceased aboard domestic trains. The increasing number of Servex convenience stores at railway stations and the relatively short duration of most train journeys in the Netherlands have lowered the demand for on-train services. In 2005, a much reduced in-train service of drinks and small snacks has been reintroduced on longer journeys. Now, the RailTender service primarily operates in the intercity trains on the trajectory between Utrecht and Zwolle/Eindhoven, Zwolle and Almere, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Nijmegen, Apeldoorn and Amersfoort, Rotterdam and Breda/Roosendaal/Antwerp.

==Technological assistance for train staff==
Conductors have a smartphone with a timetable, fares information, and a separate card reader to read the OV-chipkaart.
Train drivers use a tablet with an app called &quot;TimTim&quot; to save energy and keep up with the timetable. The train driver can also see other trains in front or behind their train.

==Statistics==
*14.73 billion passenger km per year (2005), which is 30% of the seat km.

In 2018, NS saw its number of passengers increase by nearly 3 percent. On average, 1.3 million people took the train on a weekday, 100.000 more than in 2016 and the over 250 NS train stations are becoming increasingly crowded.

<doc id="169009" wikidata="Q7718480" url="?curid=169009" title="The Black and White Minstrel Show">
<text>The Black and White Minstrel Show is a British light entertainment show on BBC prime-time television that ran from 1958 to 1978. The weekly variety show presented traditional American minstrel and country songs, as well as show tunes and music hall numbers, lavishly costumed and often presented with cast members in blackface. A popular stage show, based on the TV show with the same title, ran from 1962 to 1972 at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London. This was followed by tours of UK seaside resorts until 1989, and tours in Australia and New Zealand. From early in its history, and increasingly throughout its run, the show received criticism for its racist premise and content.

== History ==
Minstrel shows had become a long-established feature of British music halls and seaside entertainment since the success of acts such as the Virginia Minstrels in Liverpool in the 1840s and Christy&#x27;s Minstrels in London in the 1850s. These led directly to many British imitators, such as Hamilton&#x27;s Black and White Minstrels in the 1880s and many others, with Uncle Mac&#x27;s Minstrels becoming such a popular mainstay in Broadstairs, Kent, from the 1890s to the 1940s that a plaque was erected to honour their memory. Though any development in the performance of such acts may have ended before the First World War, the &quot;old-time&quot; minstrel theme remained a consistently popular form of entertainment in the UK well into the 1950s.

&quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; was created by BBC producer George Inns, working with George Mitchell. It began as a one-off special in 1957 called &quot;The 1957 Television Minstrels&quot;, featuring the male Mitchell Minstrels (Mitchell was the musical director) and the female Television Toppers dancers. The show was first broadcast on the BBC on 14 June 1958. It developed into a regular 45-minute show on Saturday evening prime-time television in a sing-along format, with both solo and minstrel pieces (often with extended segueing), some country and western numbers, and music derived from other foreign folk cultures. The male minstrels performed in blackface; the female dancers and other supporting artists did not. The show included comedy interludes performed by Leslie Crowther, George Chisholm and Stan Stennett. It was initially produced by George Inns with George Mitchell. The minstrels&#x27; main soloists were baritone Dai Francis, tenor John Boulter, and bass Tony Mercer. During the nine years that the show was broadcast in black and white, the blackface makeup was actually red, as black did not register as well. 

The series gained considerable international regard and was sold to over thirty countries; in 1961 the show won a Golden Rose at Montreux for best light entertainment programme, and its first three albums of recordings (1960–1962) were all hits, the first two being long-running number 1 albums in the UK Albums Chart. The first of these became the first album in UK album sales history to pass 100,000 sales. By 1964, &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; was achieving audience figures of 21 million.

In the spring of 1962, the BBC musical variety show &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; opened at the Victoria Palace Theatre. The three lead singers of the TV show, Mercer, Boulter and Francis, appeared simultaneouslly in the theatrical version, but the chorus singers and dancers would be different groups in the theatre and on TV. The stage show was produced by Robert Luff, and ran for 6,477 performances from 1962 to 1972; &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; listed it as the stage show seen by the largest number of people. In Melbourne in 1962, a production of the show ran for three years, and set Australian and New Zealand box office records.

While it started off being broadcast in black and white, the TV show was first shown in colour on BBC2 in 1967. Several personalities guested on the show, whilst others started their careers on it. Comedian Lenny Henry, then in his teens, became the first black performer to appear on it in 1975. In July 2009, Henry explained that he was contractually obliged to perform and regretted his part in the show, telling &quot;The Times&quot; in 2015 that his appearance on the show led to a profound &quot;wormhole of depression&quot;, and that he regretted his family not intervening to prevent him from continuing in the show.

== Denunciation as racist ==
Within five years of the show&#x27;s premiere on UK television, its portrayal of blacked-up characters behaving with stereotypical African-American manners was already being observed by some as offensive and racist. After the 1963 murder of 35-year-old white postal worker William Lewis Moore in Alabama, who marched from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, to protest against segregation in the American South, the satirical show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; parodied &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;″s trivialisation of the systemic racism in the Southern American states with a sketch in which Millicent Martin dressed as Uncle Sam and sang a parody of &quot;I Wanna Go Back to Mississippi&quot; (&quot;Where the Mississippi mud / Kind of mingles with the blood / Of the niggers that are hanging from the branches of the trees&quot;). accompanied by minstrel singers in blackface (&quot;Mississippi, it&#x27;s the state you&#x27;ve gotta choose / Where we hate all the darkies and the Catholics and the Jews / Where we welcome any man / Who is strong and white and belongs to the Ku Klux Klan&quot;).
David Hendy, Professor of Media and Cultural History at the University of Sussex, comments that Barrie Thorne, the corporation&#x27;s chief accountant, described the series in an internal memo to Director of Television Kenneth Adam in 1962 as being &quot;a disgrace and an insult to coloured people&quot;. He continued: &quot;If black faces are to be shown, for heaven’s sake let coloured artists be employed and with dignity&quot;. Thorne raised the issue again in 1967 with Oliver Whitley, Chief Assistant to the BBC&#x27;s director general, Sir Hugh Greene. Whitley responded: &quot;The best advice that could be given to coloured people by their friends would be: &#x27;On this issue, we can see your point, but in your own best interests, for heaven&#x27;s sake, shut up.

In 1967, the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination presented a petition to the BBC calling for the show to be cancelled. The following year, the BBC experimented with a version of the show called &quot;Masquerade&quot;, in which the main singers appeared without blackface, and the black singers wore whiteface. In 1969, due to continuing accusations of racism, &quot;Music Music Music&quot;, a spin-off series in which the minstrels appeared without their blackface make-up, replaced &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;. However, after one series, &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; returned.

Since its cancellation in 1978, &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; has come to be regarded with disdain. BBC writer Kate Broome states, &quot;That an innocently-intentioned show could, in just a generation, become such a screen pariah is one of the most extraordinary episodes in television history&quot;.

== Final years ==
The BBC1 television programme was cancelled in 1978 as part of a reduction in variety programming (by this point, the blackface element had been reduced), while the stage show continued. A touring version toured continuously from 1960 until 1987, with a second company touring Australia and New Zealand from 1962 to 1965, 1969 to 1971, and 1978 to 1979. Having left the Victoria Palace Theatre, where the stage show played from 1962 to 1972, a second show toured almost every year to various big city and seaside resort theatres around the UK, including the Futurist in Scarborough, the Winter Gardens in Morecambe, the Festival Theatre in Paignton, the Congress Theatre in Eastbourne and the Pavilion Theatre in Bournemouth. This continued every year until 1989, when a final tour of three Butlins resorts (Minehead, Bognor Regis, and Barry Island) saw the last official &quot;Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; staged.

==Legacy==
In a 1971 episode of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, a musical sketch, &quot;The Short and Fat Minstrel Show&quot;, was performed as a parody of &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;, featuring spoofs of various songs. An episode of the BBC comedy series &quot;The Goodies&quot; (&quot;Alternative Roots&quot;), spoofed the positive reception of &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;, suggesting that any programme could double its viewing figures by being performed in blackface, and mentioning that a series of &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; had been tried without makeup.
The &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; episode &quot;Roots&quot; featured a storyline in which Mr. Grace&#x27;s lineage was traced in order to perform an appropriate song and dance for his 90th birthday. The result was a number that parodied &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; by having the male performers in blackface, while the females (excluding Mrs. Slocombe) were not.

In 2023 the BBC broadcast a documentary presented by the actor David Harewood and the historian David Olusoga about the pernicious influence of blackface minstrelsy in pervading racial stereotypes and anti-black racism in Great Britain. The documentary was framed around, and heavily critical of, the BBC’s own &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;.

<text>Babri Masjid (ISO: Bābarī Masjida; meaning &quot;Mosque of Babur&quot;) was a mosque in Ayodhya, India. It has been claimed to have been built upon the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the legendary birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism. It has been a focus of dispute between the Hindu and Muslim communities since the 19th century. According to the mosque&#x27;s inscriptions, it was built in 1528–29 (935 AH) by Mir Baqi, a commander of the Mughal emperor Babur. Before the 1940s, the masjid was officially known as &quot;Masjid-i-Janmasthan&quot; (&quot;the mosque of the birthplace&quot;). The mosque was attacked and demolished by a Hindu nationalist mob in 1992, which ignited communal violence across the Indian subcontinent.

The mosque was located on a hill known as Ramkot (&quot;Rama&#x27;s fort&quot;). According to Hindu nationalists, Baqi destroyed a pre-existing temple of Rama at the site. The existence of this temple is a matter of controversy. The Archaeological Survey of India conducted an excavation of the disputed site on the orders of the Allahabad High Court. The excavation period was short due to court time constraints, lasting only 15 days. The report of the excavation concluded that there were ruins of &quot;a massive structure&quot; beneath the ruins of the mosque which was &quot;indicative of remains which are distinctive features found associated with the temples of north India&quot;, but found no evidence that the structure was specifically demolished for the construction of the Babri Masjid. The report received both praise and criticism, with some other archaeologists contesting the results of the report.

Starting in the 19th century, there were several conflicts and court disputes between Hindus and Muslims over the mosque. In 1949, idols of Rama and Sita were placed inside the mosque, after which the government locked the building to avoid further disputes. Court cases were filed by both Hindus and Muslims asking for access.

On 6 December 1992, a large group of Hindu activists belonging to the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied organisations demolished the mosque, triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent, resulting in the death of around 2,000–3,000 people.

In September 2010, the Allahabad High Court upheld the claim that the mosque was built on the spot believed to be Rama&#x27;s birthplace and awarded the site of the central dome for the construction of a Rama temple. Muslims were also awarded one-third area of the site for the construction of a mosque. The decision was subsequently appealed by all parties to the Supreme Court, wherein a five judge bench heard a title suit from August to October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court quashed the lower court&#x27;s judgement and ordered the entire site ( land) to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative plot to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to replace the Babri Masjid that was demolished in 1992. The government allotted a site in the village of Dhannipur, in Ayodhya District, from Ayodhya City and by road from the site of the original Babri Masjid. The construction of the mosque started on 26 January 2021.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Babri Masjid&quot; comes from the name of the Mughal emperor Babur, who is said to have ordered its construction. Before the 1940s, it was called &quot;Masjid-i Janmasthan&quot; (&quot;mosque of the birthplace&quot;) including in official documents.

== Architecture ==
=== Background ===
The rulers of the Delhi Sultanate and their successors, the Mughals, were great patrons of art and architecture and constructed many fine tombs, mosques and madrasas. These have a distinctive style which bears influences of &quot;later Tughlaq&quot; architecture. Mosques all over India were built in different styles; the most elegant styles developed in areas where indigenous art traditions were strong and local artisans were highly skilled. Thus regional or provincial styles of mosques grew out of local temple or domestic styles, which were conditioned in their turn by climate, terrain, materials, hence the enormous difference between the mosques of Bengal, Kashmir and Gujarat. The Babri Mosque followed the architectural school of Jaunpur Sultanate. When viewed from the west side, it resembled the Atala Masjid in Jaunpur.

=== Architectural style ===

The architecture of the mosque is completely a replica of the mosques in the Delhi Sultanate. Babri was an important mosque of a distinct style, preserved mainly in architecture, developed after the Delhi Sultanate was established, seen also in the Babari Mosque in the southern suburb of the walled city of Gaur, and the Jamali Kamili Mosque built by Sher Shah Suri. This was the forerunner of the Mughal architecture style adopted by Akbar.

=== Acoustics ===
&quot;A whisper from the Babri Masjid mihrab could be heard clearly at the other end, 200 feet [60 m] away and through the length and breadth of the central court&quot; according to Graham Pickford, architect to Lord William Bentinck (1828–33). The mosque&#x27;s acoustics were mentioned by him in his book &quot;Historic Structures of Oudhe&quot; where he says &quot;for a 16th-century building the deployment and projection of voice from the pulpit is considerably advanced, the unique deployment of sound in this structure will astonish the visitor&quot;.

== History ==
=== Construction ===
The date of construction of the Babri Masjid is uncertain. The inscriptions on the Babri Masjid premises found in the 20th century state that the mosque was built in 935 AH (1528–29) by Mir Baqi in accordance with the wishes of Babur. However, these inscriptions appear to be of a more recent vintage.

There are no records of the mosque from this period. The &quot;Baburnama&quot; (Chronicles of Babur) does not mention either the mosque or the destruction of a temple. The &quot;Ramcharitamanas&quot; of Tulsidas (1574) and &quot;Ain-i Akbari&quot; of Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (1598) made no mention of a mosque either. William Finch, the English traveller who visited Ayodhya around 1611, wrote about the &quot;ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses&quot; where Hindus believed the great God &quot;took flesh upon him to see the &quot;tamasha&quot; of the world.&quot; He found &quot;pandas&quot; (Brahmin priests) in the ruins of the fort, recording the names of pilgrims, but there was no mention of a mosque. Thomas Herbert described in 1634 the &quot;pretty old castle of Ranichand built by a Bannyan Pagod of that name&quot; which he described as an antique monument that was &quot;especially memorable&quot;. He also recorded the fact of Brahmins recording the names of pilgrims.

The earliest record of a mosque at the site traditionally believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of Rama comes from Jai Singh II (or &quot;Sawai Jai Singh&quot;) – a Rajput noble in the Mughal court who purchased land and established a &quot;Jaisinghpura&quot; in the area surrounding the mosque in 1717 (as he had also done in several other Hindu religious places). The documents of Jai Singh preserved in the Kapad-Dwar collection in the City Palace Museum of Jaipur, include a sketch map of the Babri Masjid site. The map shows an open court yard and a built structure with three temple spires (&quot;sikharas&quot;) resembling today&#x27;s Babri Masjid with three domes. The courtyard is labelled &quot;janmasthan&quot; and shows a &quot;Ram chabutra&quot;. The central bay of the built structure is labelled &quot;chhathi&quot;, which also denotes birthplace.

Joseph Tiefenthaler, a European Jesuit missionary who lived and worked in India for 38 years (1743–1785), visited Ayodhya in 1767. He noted one Ramkot fortress — comprising the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus — to have been demolished by Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707); however, &quot;others&quot; said it to have been demolished by Babar. A mosque with three domes was constructed in its place but Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama.

=== Inscriptions ===
&quot;The Disputed Mosque: A Historical Inquiry&quot; by Sushil Srivastava mentions that The Babri Masjid has &quot;three&quot; inscriptions in Persian, in different styles of calligraphy, two outside and one inside the mosque-just above the pulpit. A.S. Beveridge&#x27;s translation of the inscription inside the mosque, mentions that by the order of Babar, Mir Baqi constructed the mosque in the year AH 935 (AD 1529). The summery of the findings of B.B. Lal&#x27;s excavating team by S.P. Gupta is in agreement with this inscription. Only six lines of one of the two external inscriptions are legible. The legible inscription has apparently been written in praise of God, The Prophet and Babar, who has been called a qalandar.

Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (Buchanan) did a survey of the Gorakhpur Division in 1813–14 on behalf of the British East India Company. His report was never published but partly reused by Montgomery Martin later. Kishore Kunal examined the original report in the British Library archives. It states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction &quot;to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe&quot;. Yet, it was ascertained to have been built by Babur by reying upon &quot;an inscription on its walls&quot;. The said inscription in Persian was said to have been copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend of Buchanan. The translation however contained five pieces of text, including &quot;two&quot; inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by Mir Baqi in the year 935 AH or 923 AH. The second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb. In addition to the two inscriptions and their monograms (&quot;tughras&quot;), a fable concerning a dervish called Musha Ashiqan was also included. The translator doubted that the fable was part of the inscription but recorded that the scribe &quot;positively says that the inscription was executed at the erection of this building&quot;. The translator also had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built by Babur.

In 1877, Syed Mohammad Asghar the Mutawalli (guardian) of the &quot;Masjid Baburi at Janmasthan&quot; filed a petition with the Commissioner of Faizabad asking him to restrain the Hindus that raised a chabutara on the spot regarded as the birthplace of Rama. In the petition, he stated that Babur had inscribed one word &quot;Allah&quot; above the door. The district judge and the sub-judge visited the mosque in the presence of all parties and their lawyers and confirmed this fact. No other inscriptions were recorded. In 1889, archaeologist Anton Führer visited the mosque and found three inscriptions. One was a Quranic verse. The inscription XLI was Persian poetry in the metre Ramal, which stated that the mosque was erected by a noble &#x27;Mir Khan&#x27; of Babur. The inscription XLII was also Persian poetry in metre Ramal, and said that the mosque was founded in year 930 AH by a grandee of Babur, who was (comparable to) &quot;another King of Turkey and China&quot;. The year 930 AH corresponds to 1523, three years before Babur&#x27;s conquest of Hindustan. Despite the apparent contradiction, Führer published the date of &quot;A. H. 930 during the reign of Babar&quot;, in his book of 1891.

Writer Kishore Kunal states that all the inscriptions claimed were fake. They were affixed almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528, and repeatedly replaced. His own assessment is that the mosque was built around 1660 by governor Fedai Khan of Aurangzeb, who demolished many temples in Ayodhya. Lal Das, who wrote &quot;Awadh-Vilasa&quot; in 1672 describes the &quot;janmasthan&quot; (Rama&#x27;s birthplace) accurately but does not mention a temple at the site.

These developments were apparently known to local Muslims. In mid-nineteenth century, the Muslim activist Mirza Jan quoted from a book &quot;Sahifa-I-Chihil Nasaih Bahadur Shahi&quot;, which was said to have been written by a daughter of the emperor Bahadur Shah I (and granddaughter of Aurangzeb) in the early 18th century. The text mentions mosques having been constructed after demolishing the &quot;temples of the idolatrous Hindus situated at Mathura, Banaras and Awadh etc.&quot; Hindus are said to have called these demolished temples in Awadh &quot;Sita Rasoi&quot; (Sita&#x27;s kitchen) and &quot;Hanuman&#x27;s abode.&quot; While there was no mention of Babur in this account, the Ayodhya mosque had been juxtaposed with those built by Aurangzeb at Mathura and Banaras. The manuscript, &quot;Sahifa-I-Chihil Nasaih Bahadur Shahi&quot;, has not yet been found, and scholar Stephan Conermann has stated that Mirza Jan book, &quot;Hadiqa-yi shuhada&quot;, is not reliable. Some historians like R.S. Sharma, M. Athar Ali, D.N. Jha and Archeologist Suraj Bhan have concluded in their work, &quot;A Historians&#x27; Report to the Nation,&quot; that It is very likely, that the work (&quot;Sahifa-I-Chihil Nasaih Bahadur Shahi&quot;) or the passage (quoted above in this paragraph) was a figment of Mirza Jan&#x27;s imagination.

=== 1880s temple construction attempts ===
In 1853, a group of armed Hindu ascetics from Hanuman Garhi temple occupied the Babri Masjid. Periodic violence erupted in the next two years, and the civil administration had to step in, refusing permission to build a temple or to use it as a place of worship. Gulam Hussain led a group of Sunni Muslims who asserted that the mosque site was home to the Hanuman temple in 1855. After a Hindu-Muslim clash, a boundary wall was constructed to avoid further disputes. It divided the mosque premises into two courtyards; the Muslims offered prayers in the inner courtyard. In 1857, the &quot;mahant&quot; of the Hanuman Garhi temple erected a raised platform and marked the site of Rama&#x27;s birth. The Hindus offered their prayers on a raised platform, known as &quot;Ram Chabutara&quot;, in the outer courtyard.

In 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. After Muslim protests, the deputy commissioner prohibited any temple construction on 19 January 1885. On 27 January 1885, Raghubar Das, the Hindu mahant (priest) of the Ram Chabutara filed a civil suit before the Faizabad Sub-Judge. In response, the &quot;mutawalli&quot; (Muslim trustee) of the mosque argued that the entire land belonged to the mosque. On 24 December 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the suit. On 18 March 1886, the District Judge F.E.A. Chamier also dismissed an appeal against the lower court judgment. He agreed that the mosque was built on the land considered sacred by the Hindus, but ordered maintenance of status quo, since it was &quot;too late now to remedy the grievance&quot;. A subsequent appeal before the Judicial Commissioner W. Young was also dismissed on 1 November 1886.

On 27 March 1934, a Hindu–Muslim riot occurred in Ayodhya, triggered by cow slaughter in the nearby Shahjahanpur village. The walls around the Masjid and one of the domes of the Masjid were damaged during the riots. These were reconstructed by the British Indian government.

=== Shia–Sunni dispute ===
In 1936, the United Provinces government enacted U.P. Muslim Waqf Act for the better administration of waqf properties in the state. In accordance with this act, the Babri Masjid and its adjacent graveyard (Ganj-e-Saheedan Qabristan) were registered as &quot;Waqf no. 26 Faizabad&quot; with the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs. The Shias disputed the Sunni ownership of the mosque, claiming that the site belonged to them because Mir Baqi was a Shia. The Commissioner of Waqfs initiated an inquiry into the dispute. The inquiry concluded that the mosque belonged to the Sunnis, since it was commissioned by Babur, who was a Sunni. The concluding report was published in an official gazette dated 26 February 1944. In 1945, the Shia Central Board moved to court against this decision. On 23 March 1946, Judge S. A. Ahsan ruled in favour of the UP Sunni Central Board of Waqfs.

=== Placement of Hindu idols ===
In December 1949, the Hindu organisation Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha organised a non-stop nine-day recitation of the &quot;Ramacharitamanas&quot; just outside the mosque. At the end of this event, on the night of 22–23 December 1949, a group of 50–60 people entered the mosque and placed idols of Rama there. On the morning of 23 December, the event organisers asked Hindu devotees to come to the mosque for a &quot;darshan&quot;. As thousands of Hindus started visiting the place, the Government declared the mosque a disputed area and locked its gates.

Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed the state&#x27;s Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant to remove the idols, however Pant was not willing to remove the idols. Pant wrote in response that &quot;there is a reasonable chance of success, but things are still in a fluid state and it will be hazardous to say more at this stage&quot;. By 1950, the state took control of the structure under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.

On 16 January 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a civil suit in the Faizabad Court, asking that Hindus be allowed to worship Rama and Sita at the place. In 1959, the Nirmohi Akhara filed another lawsuit demanding possession of the mosque. On 18 December 1961, the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board also filed a lawsuit, demanding possession of the site and removal of idols from the mosque premises.

== Demolition ==

In April 1984, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) initiated a campaign to gather public support for Hindu access to the Babri Masjid and other structures that had been allegedly built over Hindu shrines. To raise public awareness, VHP planned nationwide &quot;rath yatra&quot;s (chariot processions), the first of which took place in September–October 1984, from Sitamarhi to Ayodhya. The campaign was temporarily suspended after the assassination of Indira Gandhi, but was revived in 25 places on 23 October 1985. On 25 January 1986, a 28-year-old local lawyer named Umesh Chandra Pandey appealed to a court to remove the restrictions on Hindu worship in the Babri Masjid premises. Subsequently, the Rajiv Gandhi government ordered the locks on the Babri Masjid gates to be removed. Earlier, the only Hindu ceremony permitted at the site was a Hindu priest performing an annual puja. After the ruling, all Hindus were given access to the site, and the mosque gained some function as a Hindu temple.

Communal tension in the region worsened when the VHP received permission to perform a &quot;shilanyas&quot; (stone-laying ceremony) at the disputed site before the national election in November 1989. A senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, L K Advani, started a &quot;rath yatra&quot;, embarking on a 10,000 km journey starting from the south and heading towards Ayodhya. On 6 December 1992, BJP, VHP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders gathered at the site to offer prayers and perform a symbolic &quot;kar seva&quot;. At noon, a teenage &quot;Kar Sevak&quot; (volunteer) was &quot;vaulted&quot; on to the dome and that signalled the breaking of the outer cordon. Soon after, a large number of kar sevaks demolished the mosque.

=== Aftermath ===
Communal riots between Hindus and Muslims ensued across India immediately following demolition of the mosque. Rioting in the immediate aftermath resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2,000–3,000 people. Six weeks of riots further erupted in Bombay, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 900 people.

Jihadist outfits like Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba have cited the demolition of Babri Masjid as justification for attacks directed against India. D-Company Crime Boss Dawood Ibrahim, wanted in India for his alleged ties to the 1993 Bombay bombings which killed 257 people, is believed to have been infuriated by Babri Masjid&#x27;s demolition.

The site has since become a magnet for pilgrims. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Among its souvenir stalls, those doing the briskest trade are the ones playing videos on a loop of Hindu fundamentalists demolishing the mosque.&quot;

=== Regional impact ===
Riots in the aftermath of Babri Masjid&#x27;s demolition extended to Bangladesh, where hundreds of shops, homes and temples of Hindus were destroyed. Widespread retaliatory attacks against scores of Hindu and Jain temples also took place across neighbouring Pakistan, with police not intervening. Reprisal attacks against Hindus in both countries, in turn, entered the discourse of right-wing Hindu nationalists – for example, in 1995, the VHP appealed to the United Nations to protect Hindus in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Kashmir. Babri Masjid&#x27;s demolition and its violent repercussions have negatively affected relations between India and Pakistan, and remain strained until the present day.

=== Liberhan Commission ===

The Liberhan Commission set up by the Government to investigate the demolition later blamed 68 people including senior BJP, RSS and VHP leaders for the demolition. Among those criticised in the report were Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party&#x27;s chief LK Advani, and chief minister Kalyan Singh. A 2005 book by the former Intelligence Bureau (IB) Joint Director Maloy Krishna Dhar claimed the senior leaders of RSS, BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal had planned the demolition 10 months in advance. He also suggested that the Indian National Congress leaders, including prime minister P V Narasimha Rao and home minister S B Chavan, had ignored warnings about the demolition for deriving political benefits.

== Archaeological excavations ==
In 2003, by the order of an Indian court, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was asked to conduct a more in-depth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the rubble. The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries. The ASI submitted its report to the Allahabad high court.

The summary of the ASI report indicated what appears to be the presence of a 10th-century shrine under the mosque. According to the ASI team, the human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BC. The next few layers date back to the Shunga period (2nd-1st century BC) and the Kushan period. During the early medieval period (11–12th century), a short-lived structure of nearly 50 metres with north–south orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century.

Muslim groups immediately disputed the ASI findings. The Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) criticised the report saying that it said that &quot;presence of animal bones throughout as well as of the use of &#x27;surkhi&#x27; and lime mortar&quot; that was found by ASI are all characteristic of Muslim presence &quot;that rule out the possibility of a Hindu temple having been there beneath the mosque.&quot; The report claimed otherwise on the basis of &#x27;pillar bases&#x27; was contested since no pillars were found, and the alleged existence of &#x27;pillar bases&#x27; has been debated by archaeologists. Syed Rabe Hasan Nadvi, chairman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) alleged that ASI failed to mention any evidence of a temple in its interim reports and only revealed it in the final report which was submitted during a time of national tension, making the report highly suspect.

The Allahabad High Court, however, upheld the ASI&#x27;s findings.

== Title cases verdict ==
A land title case on the site was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In their verdict, the three judges of The Allahabad High Court ruled that the of Ayodhya land be divided into three parts, with one-third going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Maha Sabha for the construction of the Ram temple, one-third going to the Islamic Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board and the remaining one-third going to Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu religious denomination. While the three-judge bench was not unanimous that the disputed structure was constructed after demolition of a temple, it did agree that a temple or a temple structure predated the mosque at the same site. The excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building.

The five judge Supreme Court bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019. The Court observed that archaeological evidence from ASI shows that the Babri Masjid was constructed on a &quot;structure&quot;, whose architecture was distinctly indigenous and non-Islamic. The court concluded that no evidence was found that the structure was specifically demolished for the construction of the Babri Masjid. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to allot an alternative plot to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque, which the government allotted in Dhannipur, Ayodhya.

<text>In languages with quantitative poetic metres, such as Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit, and classical Persian, an anceps (plural &quot;ancipitia&quot; or &quot;(syllabae) ancipites&quot;) is a position in a metrical pattern which can be filled by either a long or a short syllable.

In general, &quot;anceps&quot; syllables in words, such as the first syllable of the Greek words (the Greek god of war) or &quot;bitter&quot;, which can be treated by poets as either long or short, can be distinguished from &quot;anceps&quot; elements or positions in a metrical pattern, which are positions where either a long syllable or a short syllable can be used.

Another distinction can be made between the ordinary &quot;anceps&quot; positions at the beginning or middle of a line of verse and the phenomenon of &quot;brevis in longo&quot;, which is when a short syllable at the end of a line counts as long because of the pause which follows.

The word &quot;anceps&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;anceps, ancipitis&quot;, meaning &quot;two-headed, uncertain, unfixed&quot;. The usage of the word in a metrical context is, however, relatively modern, and is not found in ancient writers.

==In Ancient Greek==
&quot;Anceps&quot; elements can be found in a variety of metres in Ancient Greek. &quot;Anceps&quot; elements in the middle or beginning of a line are characteristic of the iambic trimeter of Greek drama. A typical iambic trimeter has the following form (&quot;–&quot; = long, &quot;u&quot; = short, and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;anceps&quot;):

:| x – u – | x – u – | x – u – |

Except for the last element, an &quot;anceps&quot; or a &quot;longum&quot; is sometimes replaced by two short syllables (see Resolution (meter) and Prosody (Greek)#Iambic).

In the trochaic metres, on the other hand, the &quot;anceps&quot; comes at the end of each metron, for example the trochaic tetrameter catalectic:

:| – u – x | – u – x || – u – x | – u – |

&quot;Anceps&quot; elements are also found in the Aeolic metres, such as the Sapphic metre, in which the first three lines are as follows, opening with a trochaic metron:

:| – u – x | – u u – | u – – |

In other Aeolic metres, it is possible for a line to begin with two &quot;anceps&quot; syllables in succession, for example in the glyconic metre:
:| x x | – u u – | u – |

In such metres it is not allowed for both &quot;ancipitia&quot; to be short; both in the Aeolic metres and in the eupolidean, the usual form of the base is – – or – u, with u – occurring much less often. Martin West argues that this double &quot;anceps&quot; opening is a relic of an earlier period, also reflected in Sanskrit, when the beginning of a line of poetry had free scansion and only the end was fixed.

West points out that in Ancient Greek, an &quot;anceps&quot; is not found next to a short element. He argues that in most metres, every 2nd or 3rd element is compulsorily long, and can be considered a &quot;locus princeps&quot; (principal position). Either before or after a &quot;princeps&quot; there must be a short element. Between each &quot;princeps&quot; and the next there can be either an &quot;anceps&quot;, a short, or two shorts.

Some metres, such as the dactylic and anapaestic metres, have no &quot;anceps&quot; syllables, although they make liberal use of &quot;biceps&quot;.

==In Latin==
In Latin, in the metres of Roman comedy such as those of Plautus, &quot;anceps&quot; syllables are even more common than in the Greek equivalents. In Plautus the iambic senarius (which is the equivalent of the Greek iambic trimeter) has this form:

:| x – x – | x – x – | x – u – |

The &quot;anceps&quot; elements, however, are not all equal, since the 2nd and 4th &quot;anceps&quot; elements, which are always short in Greek verse, tend to be short more frequently than the other &quot;ancipites&quot;. These two are long in 60% of lines, the 1st and 3rd in 80% of lines, and the 5th in 90% of lines. In the first two metrons, any of the long or &quot;anceps&quot; positions can be resolved into two short syllables, but this happens less frequently in &quot;anceps&quot; positions than in long ones.

Other metres which may have &quot;anceps&quot; positions in Latin are the bacchiac and cretic metres used in &quot;cantica&quot; (songs) in the plays of Plautus. For example, the bacchiac quaternarius is as follows:

:| x – – | x – – | x – – | x – – |

and the cretic as follows:

:| – x – | – u – || – x – | – u – |

The hendecasyllable metre used by Catullus and Martial has the following form, beginning in the same way as a glyconic line (see above):

:| x x | – u u – u – u – – |

The first two syllables are usually long, but occasionally in Catullus u – or – u is found.

However, in other metres of Latin poetry, &quot;anceps&quot; syllables do not occur (except for the usual possibility of brevis in longo at the end of the line). For example, in the dactylic hexameter, much use is made of &quot;biceps&quot; syllables, but there is no &quot;anceps&quot; and no resolution:

:| – uu | – uu | – uu | – uu | – uu | – x |

There is also a pure form of iambic, used in Catullus 4, which also makes no use of &quot;anceps&quot; or resolution:

:| u – u – | u – u – | u – u – |

==In Arabic==

&quot;Anceps&quot; elements are also common in classical Arabic poetry. Unlike Greek metres, in Arabic, an &quot;anceps&quot; can often be found next to a short element, as in the most common Arabic metre, the Ṭawīl, of which the half-verse has the following form:

:| u – x | u – x – | u – x | u – u – |

Another very common metre, the basīṭ, has this form:

:| x – u – | x u – | – – u – | uu – |

The eighth element in the Basīṭ metre is also theoretically &quot;anceps&quot; but in practice (in more than 99% of lines) it is always long.

In the rajaz metre, which is similar to the Greek iambic trimeter, the first two elements of each metron are &quot;anceps&quot;, although it is rare for both elements to be short:
:| x x u – | x x u – | x x u – |

In some metres, such as the popular Kāmil metre, &quot;biceps&quot; elements are used instead of &quot;anceps&quot;:
:| uu – u – | uu – u – | uu – u – |

==In Persian==

In classical Persian poetry, apart from &quot;brevis in longo&quot; (see below), &quot;anceps&quot; elements are for the most part found only at the beginning of a line. In most metres which begin with two short syllables, the first may be replaced by a long. Thus the meter &quot;khafīf&quot; (the most common metre used in Saadi&#x27;s Golestān), has the following form:
:| x u – – | u – u – | u u – |

In such verses, the &quot;anceps&quot; is long in about 80% of cases.

The only other place in Persian metre where there is a choice between long and short is in the &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; metre used in Omar Khayyam&#x27;s quatrains, which goes as follows:
:| – – | – u u – | x x u – | – u u – |

The two &quot;ancipitia&quot; may be either u – or – u, but not two shorts or two longs. (The first is slightly more common.)

==In Sanskrit==

In Sanskrit, the classical language of ancient India, in the early period in some metres the first part of the line was very free. For example, epic poems such as the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; were mostly composed in a type of stanza known as the &quot;śloka&quot;, which developed from the vedic &quot;anuṣṭubh&quot; metre. A &quot;śloka&quot; usually consists of two 16-syllable half-verses of the following pattern:

:| x x x x | u – – x || x x x x | u – u x |

However, this does not quite give the full picture, since the second metron | u – – x | could sometimes be | u u u x | , | – u u x | , | –, – – x | or | – u – x |. These variations are known as &quot;vipulas&quot;. Another restriction is that in the 1st and 3rd metron, the pattern | x u u x | was not permitted (see Śloka). As with Greek, Latin, and Arabic, the last element of every Sanskrit metre is &quot;anceps&quot;, that is, either long or &quot;brevis in longo&quot;.

Another metre, the &quot;triṣṭubh&quot;, which is commonly used in the Rigveda, the earliest form of Sanskrit, has four 11-syllable lines of the following pattern (the symbol &quot;,&quot; represents a caesura or break between words). Thus the 5th element is an &quot;anceps&quot;, which if short must be preceded by a word-break, if long it must be followed by one: 
:| x – x – , u u – – u – x | or
:| x – x – – , u – – u – x |

In the high classical period of Sanskrit literature (5th to 12th century CE), a large number of metres were developed which for the most part had no &quot;anceps&quot; elements. For example, the &quot;mandākrāntā&quot; metre, made popular by Kālidāsa in his poem &quot;Meghadūta&quot;, has the following form without variation:
:| – – – – | u u u u u – | – u – – u – – |

A third type of Indian metre, commonly used in Prakrit literature, but also sometimes in Sanskrit, is typified by the &quot;āryā&quot; metre. In metres of this type, lines of varying length are made up of feet which can be of any combination of long and short syllables, such as | – – |, | u u u u |, | – u u |, | u u – | or | u – u |, that adds up to the equivalent of four short syllables.

==Anceps vs. brevis in longo==
The &quot;anceps&quot; is distinct from &quot;brevis in longo&quot;, which refers to the phenomenon whereby a normally short syllable counts as long when used at the end of a line. The possibility of &quot;brevis in longo&quot; is found universally across all metres, while the &quot;anceps&quot; is found only in particular verse forms. Also, a &quot;brevis in longo&quot; is always felt to be long, while the &quot;anceps&quot; may be short or long freely.

<text>Lazzaro Spallanzani (; 12 January 1729 – 11 February 1799) was an Italian Catholic priest (for which he was nicknamed Abbé Spallanzani), biologist and physiologist who made important contributions to the experimental study of bodily functions, animal reproduction, and animal echolocation. His research on biogenesis paved the way for the downfall of the theory of spontaneous generation, a prevailing idea at the time that organisms develop from inanimate matters, though the final death blow to the idea was dealt by French scientist Louis Pasteur a century later.

His most important works were summed up in his book &quot;Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generación De Animales y Plantas&quot; (&quot;Experiences to Serve to the History of the Generation of Animals and Plants&quot;), published in 1786. Among his contributions were experimental demonstrations of fertilisation between ova and spermatozoa, and &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation&quot;.&quot;

==Biography==

Spallanzani was born in Scandiano in the modern province of Reggio Emilia to Gianniccolo Spallanzani and Lucia Zigliani. His father, a lawyer by profession, was not impressed with young Spallanzani who spent more time with small animals than studies. With financial support from the Vallisnieri Foundation, his father enrolled him in the Jesuit Seminary at age 15. When he was asked to join the order, he declined. Persuaded by his father and with the help of Monsignor Castelvetro, the Bishop of Reggio, he studied law at the University of Bologna, which he gave up soon and turned to science. Here, his famous kinswoman, Laura Bassi, was a professor of physics and it is to her influence that his scientific impulse has been usually attributed. With her, he studied natural philosophy and mathematics, and gave also great attention to languages, both ancient and modern, but soon abandoned them. It took him a good friend Antonio Vallisnieri Jr. to convince his father to drop law as a career and take up academics instead.

In 1754, at the age of 25, soon after he was ordained he became professor of logic, metaphysics and Greek in the University of Reggio. In 1763, he was moved to the University of Modena, where he continued to teach with great assiduity and success, but devoted his whole leisure to natural science. There he also served as a priest of the Congregation Beata Vergine and S. Carlo. He declined many offers from other Italian universities and from St Petersburg until 1768, when he accepted the invitation of Maria Theresa to the chair of natural history in the University of Pavia, which was then being reorganized. He also became director of the museum, which he greatly enriched by the collections of his many journeys along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In June 1768 Spallanzani was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1775 was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 1785 he was invited to University of Padua, but to retain his services his sovereign doubled his salary and allowed him leave of absence for a visit to Turkey, where he remained nearly a year and made many observations, among which may be noted those of a copper mine in Chalki and of an iron mine at Principi. His return home was almost a triumphal progress: at Vienna he was cordially received by Joseph II and on reaching Pavia he was met with acclamations outside the city gates by the students of the university. During the following year, his students exceeded five hundred. While he was travelling in the Balkans and to Constantinople, his integrity in the management of the museum was called in question (he was accused of the theft of specimens from the university&#x27;s collection to add to his own cabinet of curiosities), with letters written across Europe to damage Spallanzani&#x27;s reputation. A judicial investigation speedily cleared his honour to the satisfaction of some of his accusers. But Spallanzani got his revenge on his principal accuser, Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, by preparing a fake specimen of a new &quot;species&quot;. When Scopoli published the remarkable specimen, Spallanzani revealed the joke, resulting in wide ridicule and humiliation.

In 1796, Spallanzani received an offer for professor at the National Museum of Natural History, France in Paris, but declined due to his age. He died from bladder cancer on 12 February 1799, in Pavia. After his death, his bladder was removed for study by his colleagues, after which it was placed on public display in a museum in Pavia, where it remains to this day.

His indefatigable exertions as a traveller, his skill and good fortune as a collector, his brilliance as a teacher and expositor, and his keenness as a controversialist no doubt aid largely in accounting for Spallanzani&#x27;s exceptional fame among his contemporaries; his letters account for his close relationships with many famed scholars and philosophers, like Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Lavoisier, and Voltaire. Yet greater qualities were by no means lacking. His life was one of incessant eager questioning of nature on all sides, and his many and varied works all bear the stamp of a fresh and original genius, capable of stating and solving problems in all departments of science—at one time finding the true explanation of stone skipping (formerly attributed to the elasticity of water) and at another helping to lay the foundations of our modern volcanology and meteorology.

==Scientific contributions==

===Spontaneous generation===
Spallanzani&#x27;s first scientific work was in 1765 &quot;Saggio di osservazioni microscopiche concernenti il sistema della generazione de&#x27; signori di Needham, e Buffon&quot; (&quot;Essay on microscopic observations regarding the generation system of Messrs. Needham and Buffon&quot;) which was the first systematic rebuttal of the theory of the spontaneous generation. At the time, the microscope was already available to researchers, and using it, the proponents of the theory, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, Buffon and John Needham, came to the conclusion that there is a life-generating force inherent to certain kinds of inorganic matter that causes living microbes to create themselves if given sufficient time. Spallanzani&#x27;s experiment showed that it is not an inherent feature of matter and that it can be destroyed by an hour of boiling. As the microbes did not re-appear as long as the material was hermetically sealed, he proposed that microbes move through the air and that they could be killed through boiling. Needham argued that experiments destroyed the &quot;vegetative force&quot; that was required for spontaneous generation to occur. Spallanzani paved the way for research by Louis Pasteur, who defeated the theory of spontaneous generation almost a century later.

===Digestion===
In his work &quot;Dissertationi di fisica animale e vegetale&quot; (&quot;Dissertation on the physiology of animals and vegetables&quot;, in 2 volumes, 1780), Spallanzani was the first to explain the process of digestion in animals. Here he first interpreted the process of digestion, which he proved to be no mere mechanical process of trituration – that is, of grinding up the food – but one of actual chemical solution, taking place primarily in the stomach, by the action of the gastric juice.

===Reproduction===
Spallanzani described animal (mammal) reproduction in his &quot;Experiencias Para Servir a La Historia de La Generación De Animales y Plantas&quot; (1786). He was the first to show that fertilisation requires both spermatozoa and an ovum. He was the first to perform in vitro fertilization, with frogs, and an artificial insemination, using a dog. Spallanzani showed that some animals, especially newts, can regenerate some parts of their body if injured or surgically removed.

In spite of his scientific background, Spallanzani endorsed preformationism, an idea that organisms develop from their own miniature selves; e.g. animals from minute animals, animalcules. In 1784, he performed a filtration experiment in which he successfully separated the seminal fluid of frogs – a liquid portion and a gelatinous animalcule (spermatozoa) portion. But then he assumed that it was the liquid part which could induce fertilisation. A staunch ovist, he believed that animal form was already developed in the eggs and fertilisation by semen was only an activation for growth.

===Echolocation===
Spallanzani is also famous for extensive experiments in 1793 on how bats could fly at night to detect objects (including prey) and avoid obstacles, where he concluded that bats do not use their eyes for navigation, but some other sense. He was originally inspired by his observation that tamed barn owl flew properly at night under a dim-lit candle, but struck against the wall when the candle was put out. He managed to capture three wild bats in Scandiano, and performed a similar experiment, on which he wrote (on 20 August 1793):
A few days later he took two bats and covered their eyes with an opaque disc made of birdlime. To his astonishment, both bats flew completely normally. He went further by surgically removing the eyeballs of one bat, which he observed as:
He concluded that bats do not need vision for navigation; although he failed to find the reason. At the time other scientists were sceptical and ridiculed his findings. A contemporary of Spallanzani, the Swiss physician and naturalist Louis Jurine, learned of Spallanzani&#x27;s experiments, investigated the possible mechanism of bat navigation. He discovered that bat flight was disoriented when their ears were plugged. But Spallanzani did not believe that it was about hearing since bats flew very silently. He repeated his experiments by using improved ear plugs using turpentine, wax, pomatum or tinder mixed with water, to find that blinded bats could not navigate without hearing. He was still suspicious that deafness alone was the cause of disoriented flight and that hearing was vital that he conducted some rather painful experiments such as burning and removing the external ear, and piercing through the inner ear. After these operations, he became convinced that hearing was fundamental to normal bat flight, upon which he noted: 
By then he was too convinced that he suggested the ear was an organ of navigation, writing:
His pupil, Paolo Spadoni (1764-1826), also published observations on the topic.

The exact scientific principle was discovered only in 1938 by two American biologists Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos.

===Fossils===
Spallanzani studied the formation and origin of marine fossils found in distant regions of the sea and over the ridge mountains in some regions of Europe, which resulted in the publication in 1755 of a small dissertation, &quot;Dissertazione sopra i corpi marino-montani then presented at the meeting the Accademia degli Ipocondriaci di Reggio Emilia&quot;. Although aligned to one of the trends of his time, which attributed the occurrence of marine fossils on mountains to the natural movement of the sea, not the universal flood, Spallanzani developed his own hypothesis, based on the dynamics of the forces that changed the state of the Earth after God&#x27;s creation.

A few years later, Spallanzani published reports about trips he made to Portovenere, Cerigo Island, and Two Sicilies, addressing important issues such as the discovery of fossil shells within volcanic rocks, human fossils, and the existence of fossils of extinct species. His concern with fossils witnesses how, in the style of the eighteenth century, Spallanzani integrated studies of the three kingdoms of nature.

===Other works===

Spallanzani studied and made important descriptions on blood circulation and respiration. In 1777, he gave the name Tardigrada (from Latin meaning &quot;slow-moving&quot;) to the phylum of minute extremophile animals also called water bears.

In 1788 he visited Vesuvius and the volcanoes of the Lipari Islands and Mount Etna in Sicily. He visited the latter along with Carlo Gemmellaro. He embodied the results of his research in a large work (&quot;Viaggi alle due Sicilie ed in alcune parti dell&#x27;Appennino&quot;), published four years later.

Much of his collections, which he kept at the end of his life in his house in Scandiano, were purchased by the city of Reggio Emilia in 1799. They are now on display inside the Palazzo dei Musei in two rooms denominated the &quot;Museo Spallanzani&quot;.

<doc id="169023" wikidata="Q93850" url="?curid=169023" title="Klaatu (band)">
<text>Klaatu () was a Canadian rock group formed in 1973 by the duo of John Woloschuk and Dee Long. They named themselves after an ambassador, Klaatu, from an extraterrestrial confederation who visits Earth with his companion robot Gort in the film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. After recording two non-charting singles, the band added drummer Terry Draper to the line-up; this trio constituted Klaatu throughout the rest of the band&#x27;s recording career.

In Canada, the band is remembered for several hits, including &quot;California Jam&quot; (1974), &quot;Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft&quot; (1976) and &quot;Knee Deep in Love&quot; (1980). In the U.S. &quot;Calling Occupants&quot; backed with &quot;Sub-Rosa Subway&quot; was a minor double-sided hit and their only chart entry, peaking at No. 62 in 1977.

Internationally, the group&#x27;s pop-influenced style of progressive rock has led to them being known as the &quot;Canadian Beatles&quot;.

==Musical style==
Klaatu has variously been described by critics and journalists as progressive rock, psychedelic pop, pop rock, space rock and progressive pop.

The band&#x27;s combination of pop and progressive/art rock has often been compared to the Beatles, the guitar-rock of Queen, the electronic music of Wendy Carlos, the light pop sound of 10cc, and the orchestrated ballads of the Moody Blues and Electric Light Orchestra. British music magazine &quot;Shindig!&quot; praised the band&#x27;s &quot;otherworldly brand of progressive pop&quot;. 

==Early releases==
The band, initially a studio-only duo of Woloschuk and Long, released the singles &quot;Anus of Uranus/Sub-Rosa Subway&quot; and &quot;Dr. Marvello/For You Girl&quot; on GRT Records, in 1973, before being taken under the wing of Daffodil Records and its president Frank Davies. With Terry Draper added to the line-up, the singles &quot;California Jam&quot; and &quot;True Life Hero&quot; followed. These early singles credited Dee Long as a writer of several tunes; the others (including &quot;Sub-Rosa Subway&quot;, &quot;Dr. Marvello&quot; and the hit single &quot;California Jam&quot;) were credited to &quot;Chip Dale,&quot; a collective pseudonym for Woloschuk and frequent co-writer Dino Tome. &quot;California Jam&quot; hit the Canadian Top 40, peaking at No. 36, and Klaatu, though they played no live dates, promoted their music by making a television appearance in Canada on the Keith Hampshire-hosted show &quot;Music Machine&quot;. By 1975, Davies, along with producer Terry Brown, landed the band a deal with Capitol Records in the United States.

==First three albums and Beatles rumours==
Their first album, &quot;3:47 EST&quot; (named &quot;Klaatu&quot; in the US as Capitol Records&#x27; executives found the original title too obscure), was released in September 1976, in North America. The band elected to include no photos, no individual musician credits, and no biographical information in the album package; all songs were simply listed as being written and published by &quot;Klaatu.&quot; (Note that this collective writing credit covered songs earlier credited solely to Long or to the team of Woloschuk and Tome – even though Tome was not actually a member of Klaatu.) The album was met with moderately positive reviews but by Christmas of that year, sales had stalled.

But then, in 1977 an article published in the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; written by journalist Steve Smith, speculated that &quot;3:47 EST&quot; could actually be a release by a secretly reunited Beatles recording under a pseudonym, leading to widespread rumours. These rumours were fueled by a number of factors, including the fact that their album was released by Capitol Records (also the Beatles&#x27; label in North America), the lack of artist and producer credits or photographs in the album packaging, Klaatu&#x27;s avoidance of public performances, and the fact that the group&#x27;s vocal and musical style was reminiscent of the Beatles. In addition, Ringo Starr&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; had featured cover art with Starr appearing in place of the character Klaatu from the movie &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The album as a whole had a Beatlesque sound. Subsequent to the Beatles rumour, the songs &quot;Sub-Rosa Subway&quot; and &quot;Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft&quot; became minor hits for Klaatu in 1977. &quot;Calling Occupants&quot; was covered by the Carpenters that same year, becoming a Top 40 hit worldwide.

While all this was happening, Klaatu were in England, recording their second album. They were somewhat aware of the situation with regard to the rumours, but did not take them entirely seriously – possibly because the UK&#x27;s &quot;New Musical Express&quot; famously published an article on the Beatles-as-Klaatu theory under the title &quot;Deaf Idiot Journalist Starts Beatle Rumour.&quot; Meanwhile, Capitol Records tried to make as much of the rumours as possible, by issuing ambiguously worded statements that failed to make the band&#x27;s identity entirely clear. The rumour was disproved when Dwight Douglas, program director at WWDC in Washington, D.C., checked the records at the U.S. Copyright Office and uncovered the band members&#x27; real names.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Hope&quot;, released in 1977, included orchestral contributions by the London Symphony Orchestra. &quot;Sir Army Suit&quot;, their third album, is notable for the track &quot;Silly Boys&quot;, which contains the entire lyrical portion of their single &quot;Hanus of Uranus&quot; – a song later re-recorded as &quot;Anus of Uranus&quot; for their first album – backwards-masked interspersed between the &quot;Silly Boys&quot; lyrics. For both these releases, the band continued their policy of not including any individual names of band members in the credits, nor did they play any live shows or make any public appearances to promote these albums.

==Animated film project==
In 1977, Al Guest and Jean Mathieson of Rainbow Animation were commissioned by Capitol Records to create an animated music video of the song &quot;A Routine Day&quot;. This video ran on &quot;Don Kirshner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; and subsequently played as a short in Los Angeles on the same bill as &quot;Animal House&quot;.

Following that, Guest and Mathieson got permission from Capitol Records to create a vehicle for Klaatu&#x27;s songs. They wrote and directed a half-hour television special they titled &quot;Happy New Year Planet Earth&quot;, hoping that it would get yearly broadcasts as an alternative to Christmas specials. New Year&#x27;s Eve was Mathieson&#x27;s birthday. Again the group Klaatu was photographed and rotoscoped, with an astronaut wraparound created to connect the six Klaatu songs. Although the project was completed, Guest and Mathieson were dropped by their Canadian film investment group and wound up financing it themselves. They never released it.

In 2005, the group permitted the film to be screened in its uncompleted state at the KlaatuKon convention in Toronto. The unfinished animations were later released as part of the 2013 Sir Army Suit bonus disc.

==Later years==
Upon the release of their fourth studio album, &quot;Endangered Species,&quot; in 1980, the band for the first time included their individual names in the album package, and the songs were now credited to their individual writers. (Subsequent re-issues of earlier Klaatu material, as well as newly published Klaatu sheet music, also gave credit to the actual songwriters of each track, rather than a collective credit.)

Although forced by Capitol to record &quot;Endangered Species&quot; in Los Angeles using established studio musicians to shore up the group&#x27;s commercial chances, Klaatu continued to refuse to perform live. The album was a critical and commercial flop. The album&#x27;s poor showing resulted in Capitol Records dropping the group. Now lacking a record label, Long and Draper temporarily formed a classic rock cover band with Freddy Coutts, John Jones, and John Bojicic, called FUNN, who played extensively around Toronto.

Klaatu was eventually signed by Capitol&#x27;s Canadian division, EMI Canada, and released their final album, &quot;Magentalane&quot;, in 1981. This album saw the group returning to their brand of Beatles-influenced pop/rock. As a contractual obligation to Capitol-EMI in Canada, the band was forced to play their first-ever live dates and tour most of Canada to promote &quot;Magentalane&quot;. From November 1981, the group expanded to a sextet, enlisting Gary McCracken (drums), Mike Gingrich (bass) and Gerald O&#x27;Brien (keyboards) for live performances. However, in April 1982 Dee Long – never fond of performing live, by most accounts – quit the group. Although Woloschuk and Draper carried on performing for a few more months - with Terry Watkinson replacing a departing O&#x27;Brien and Marty Morin taking McCracken&#x27;s chair - Klaatu officially disbanded in August of the same year.

==Reunions==
The trio very briefly reunited in 1988 at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios in London with John Jones to record a single, &quot;Woman&quot;, though no one was particularly happy with the results as the song was written by someone outside of the band (Paul Vincent Gunia) for the German TV series &quot;Tatort&quot;. Initially Long had wanted to merely use the Klaatu name, but could not get the rest of the band&#x27;s approval without their involvement. The single was released only in West Germany and did not chart, making it an extremely rare item in the Klaatu catalogue; Draper confirmed that the song was considered for a few rarities compilations, but all three band members had agreed to not include the track.

A second reunion had been attempted in 1991 to tie together with a proposed compilation release, but plans fell through after a disagreement with their distributor, BEI.

The three former members of Klaatu reunited on May 7, 2005, for a brief – and mostly acoustic – performance at Toronto&#x27;s KlaatuKon. The set list consisted of &quot;At the End of the Rainbow,&quot; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Home,&quot; &quot;Cherie,&quot; &quot;Magentalane,&quot; &quot;All Good Things&quot;, and &quot;Little Neutrino&quot;.

== Post-Klaatu ==
Klaatu&#x27;s albums were released on CD format rather late, and until the 2000s several companies, including Capitol Records, released the albums with rearranged track orders. Finally, Bullseye Records, with the help of the band members themselves, released the albums in their original track listings. Bullseye also released a tribute album to Klaatu, &quot;Around the Universe in Eighty Minutes&quot;.

In 2005, Bullseye Records released a two-CD collection entitled &quot;Sun Set&quot;, which compiled a number of rarities, demos, rare early singles, and the original version of &quot;Hope&quot; which had been delivered to Capitol Records, including the complete contributions made by the London Symphony Orchestra, which had largely been removed from the original mix. The set also included a 40-page booklet including interviews with all of the former members of the band.

Bullseye Records of Canada also released &quot;Raarities&quot; in 2005, originally only in a vinyl LP format. Most of the material on the record consists of alternate mixes and single versions. A CD version, titled &quot;Solology,&quot; included the &quot;Raarities&quot; LP as well as concert recordings, and was released in March 2009.

On March 15, 2011, Klaatu announced the creation of their new record label, Klaatunes Records. The band also created an official website to go along with the new label. The label&#x27;s premiere was a re-release of &quot;Solology&quot;. The band remastered their first three albums &quot;3:47 EST&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Sir Army Suit&quot;.

<doc id="169024" wikidata="Q6970589" url="?curid=169024" title="NAACP v. Alabama">
<text>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court. Alabama sought to prevent the NAACP from conducting further business in the state. After the circuit court issued a restraining order, the state issued a subpoena for various records, including the NAACP&#x27;s membership lists. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama&#x27;s demand for the lists had violated the right of due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Facts==
In 1956, the Attorney General of Alabama, John Patterson, brought a suit to the State Circuit Court of Montgomery, Alabama, challenging the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for violation of a state statute requiring foreign corporations to qualify before doing business in the state. The NAACP, a nonprofit membership corporation based in New York, had not complied with the statute, as it believed it was exempt. The state suit sought both to prevent the Association from conducting further business within the state and, indeed, to remove it from the state.

Referring to the Association&#x27;s involvement with the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and its role in funding and providing legal assistance to black students&#x27; seeking admission to the state university, the suit charged that the Association was &quot;...causing irreparable injury to the property and civil rights of the residents and citizens of the State of Alabama for which criminal prosecution and civil actions at law afford no adequate relief...&quot; On the day this suit was filed, the circuit court agreed to issue an &quot;ex parte&quot; order restraining the Association from conducting business in the state or taking steps to qualify it to do so.

The Association, represented throughout by Robert L. Carter of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, responded by moving to dissolve the order on the grounds that its activities within the state did not require its qualification under the statute and that the state&#x27;s suit was intended to violate its rights to freedom of speech and of assembly as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Before a hearing date was set, the state issued a subpoena for much of the Association&#x27;s records, including bank statements and leases, but most notably the names and addresses of the &quot;agents&quot; or &quot;members&quot; of the Association in Alabama.

In its response to the lawsuit, the Association admitted that it was in breach of the statute and offered to obtain qualification to continue business if that part of the &quot;ex parte&quot; order was lifted. Because the Association did not comply with the order to produce its records, that motion was denied and the Association was held in contempt and fined $10,000. The contempt order allowed for the reduction or remission of the fine if the production order was complied with within five days, after which the fine would be raised to $100,000.

Contending that the State could not constitutionally force disclosure of the records, the Association moved to dismiss the contempt judgment once more. According to Alabama case law, however, a petitioner could not seek a hearing or to dissolve an order until it purged itself of contempt.

The United States Supreme Court reversed the first contempt judgment. The Alabama Supreme Court then claimed the U.S. Supreme Court had relied on a &quot;mistaken premise&quot; and reinstated the contempt judgment, which the U.S. Supreme Court reversed again. The NAACP moved to try the case on the merits; this motion was denied and again appealed up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which remanded the case to Alabama, and ordered the Federal district court to try the case on the merits if the Alabama court system continued to refuse to do so.

The Alabama state circuit court finally heard the case on the merits, and decided the NAACP had violated Alabama law and ordered it to stop doing business in the state; the Alabama appeals courts upheld this judgment, refusing to hear the NAACP&#x27;s appeals on Constitutional grounds. Finally, the fourth time the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, it granted &quot;certiorari&quot; and decided the case, itself, on the merits rather than remand the case to the balking Alabama court system, which had taken five years to get this far.

==Judgment==
In an opinion delivered by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, the Supreme Court decided in favor of the petitioners, holding that &quot;Immunity from state scrutiny of petitioner&#x27;s membership lists is here so related to the right of petitioner&#x27;s members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in doing so as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment&quot; and, further, that freedom to associate with organizations dedicated to the &quot;advancement of beliefs and ideas&quot; is an inseparable part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The action of the state&#x27;s obtaining the names of the Association&#x27;s membership would likely interfere with the free association of its members, so the state&#x27;s interest in obtaining the records was superseded by the constitutional rights of the petitioners. Harlan said the following.

<text>Sir Hans Adolf Krebs, FRS (, ; 25 August 1900 – 22 November 1981) was a German-British biologist, physician and biochemist. He was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration, a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life. He is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of nearly all organisms, including humans, other than anaerobic microorganisms, namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. The former, often eponymously known as the &quot;Krebs cycle&quot;, is the sequence of metabolic reactions that allows cells of oxygen-respiring organisms to obtain far more ATP from the food they consume than anaerobic processes such as glycolysis can supply; and its discovery earned Krebs a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953. With Hans Kornberg, he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle, a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants, bacteria, protists, and fungi. 

Krebs died in 1981 in Oxford, where he had spent 13 years of his career from 1954 until his retirement in 1967 at the University of Oxford.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Krebs was born in Hildesheim, Germany, to Georg Krebs, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, and Alma Krebs (née Davidson). He was of Jewish ancestry and was the middle of three children. He had an elder sister, Elisabeth, and a younger brother, Wolfgang.

Krebs attended school at the Gymnasium Andreanum in his home town. Near the end of World War I, in September 1918, six months short of completing his secondary school education, he was conscripted into the Imperial German Army. He was allowed to take an emergency examination for his high school diploma, which he passed with such a high score that he suspected the examiners of being &quot;unduly lenient and sympathetic&quot;. With the end of the war two months later, his conscription ended.

Krebs decided to follow his father&#x27;s profession and entered the University of Göttingen in December 1918 to study medicine. In 1919, he transferred to the University of Freiburg. In 1923, he published his first scientific paper on a tissue staining technique. He did this work under the guidance of Wilhelm von Mollendorf starting it in 1920. He completed his medical course in December 1923. To obtain a Doctor of Medicine degree, and a medical license, he spent one year at the Third Medical Clinic in the University of Berlin. By then he had turned his professional goal from becoming a practising physician to becoming a medical researcher, particularly in biochemistry. In 1924, he studied at the Department of Chemistry at the Pathological Institute of the Charité Hospital, in Berlin, for training in chemistry and biochemistry. He earned his MD degree in 1925 from the University of Hamburg.

=== Career ===
In 1926, Krebs joined Otto Heinrich Warburg as a research assistant at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Dahlem, Berlin. He was paid 4800 marks per year. After four years in 1930, with 16 publications to his credit, his mentor Warburg urged him to move on and he took up the position of Assistant in the Department of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital in Altona (now part of Hamburg). The next year he moved to the Medical Clinic of the University of Freiburg. At Freiburg, he was in charge of about 40 patients, and was at liberty to do his own research. Before a year was over at Freiburg, he, with research student Kurt Henseleit, published their discovery of the ornithine cycle of urea synthesis, which is the metabolic pathway for urea formation. It is now known as the urea cycle, and is sometimes also referred to as the Krebs–Henseleit cycle. Together they also developed a complex aqueous solution (a buffer), or perfusion &quot;ex vivo&quot;, for studying blood flow in arteries, which is now called the Krebs–Henseleit buffer.) In 1932, he published the basic chemical reactions of the urea cycle, which established his scientific reputation.

Krebs&#x27;s life as a respected German scientist came to an abrupt halt in 1933 because of his Jewish ancestry. With the rise of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party to power, Germany decreed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which decreed the removal of all non-Germans, and anti-Nazis, from professional occupations. Krebs received his official dismissal from his job in April 1933, and his service was terminated on 1 July 1933. An admirer, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins at the University of Cambridge, immediately came to his rescue, and persuaded the university to recruit Krebs to work with him in the Department of Biochemistry. By July 1933, he was settled in Cambridge with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. 

Although Germany restricted him to bringing only his personal belongings, he was fortunate that the government agents allowed him to take his equipment and research samples to England. They proved to be pivotal to his later discoveries, especially the manometer developed by Warburg specifically for the measurement of oxygen consumption in thin slices of tissues; it was the basis for his research. 

He was appointed as Demonstrator in biochemistry in 1934, and in 1935 the University of Sheffield offered him a post of Lecturer in Pharmacology, with a more spacious laboratory and double the salary. He worked there for 19 years. The University of Sheffield opened a Department of Biochemistry, now Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, in 1938 and Krebs became its first Head, and eventually a Professor in 1945. During his time it became one of the leading departments of biochemistry in the world. Krebs took over the running of the Sorby Research Institute in 1943. In 1944, the British Medical Research Council established the MRC Unit for Cell Metabolism Research at Sheffield, and Krebs was appointed the Director. With this, his laboratory became so large that the locals jokingly nicknamed it &quot;Krebs&#x27;s Empire&quot;. 

He moved with his MRC unit to the University of Oxford in 1954 as Whitley Professor of Biochemistry, the post he held until his retirement in 1967. The editorial board of &quot;Biochemical Journal&quot; extended their good wishes on his retirement, but in return he promised to keep them busy, by producing scientific papers. He continued his research, and took his MRC unit to the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. From there he published over 100 research papers.

==Personal life==

Krebs met Margaret Cicely Fieldhouse (30 October 1913 – May 1993) when he moved to Sheffield in 1935. They married on 22 March 1938. Krebs later described his life in Sheffield as &quot;19 happy years&quot;. They had two sons, Paul (born 1939) and John (born 1945), and a daughter, Helen (born 1942). John (Sir John Krebs, and later Baron Krebs) became a renowned ornithologist, Professor at the University of Oxford, Principal of Jesus College, Oxford, and Member of the British House of Lords.

==Death==
After a brief illness, Krebs died on 22 November 1981 in Oxford, aged 81.

== Achievements ==

=== Urea cycle (Krebs–Henseleit cycle) ===
In 1932, Krebs worked out the outlines of the urea cycle with a medical student Kurt Henseleit at the University of Freiburg. While working at the Medical Clinic of the University of Freiburg, Krebs met Kurt Henseleit, with whom he investigated the chemical process of urea formation. In 1904, two Germans, A. Kossel and H. D. Dakin, had shown that arginine could be hydrolysed by the enzyme arginase to form ornithine and urea in inorganic reaction. Based on this reaction, Krebs and Henseleit postulated that in living cells, similar reaction could occur, and that ornithine and citrulline could be the intermediate reactions. Krebs started working on the possible method for the synthesis of arginine. Using his Warburg manometer, he mixed a slice of liver with purified ornithine and citrulline. He found that citrulline acted as a catalyst in the metabolic reactions of urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide. He and Henseleit published their discovery in 1932. Thus the urea cycle (or &quot;ornithine cycle&quot;) was established, and it was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered.

=== Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) ===
At the University of Sheffield, Krebs and William Arthur Johnson investigated cellular respiration by which oxygen was consumed to produce energy from the breakdown of glucose. Krebs had earlier suggested to Warburg while they worked together in Germany that by using a manometer it could be possible to detect the oxygen consumption and identify the chemical reaction in glucose metabolism. Warburg had flatly rejected the idea. In Sheffield, Krebs vigorously worked to identify a possible chemical reaction and came up with numerous hypothetical pathways. Using the manometer he tested those hypotheses one by one. One hypothesis involving succinate, fumarate, and malate proved to be useful because all these molecules increased oxygen consumption in the pigeon breast muscle. In 1937, German biochemists Franz Knoop and Carl Martinus had demonstrated a series of reactions using citrate that produced oxaloacetate. Krebs realised that these molecules could be the missing intermediates for such reaction. After four months of experimental works to fill in the gaps, Krebs and Johnson succeeded in establishing the sequence of the chemical cycle, which they called the &quot;citric acid cycle&quot;. It is also known as the &quot;Krebs cycle&quot; or &quot;tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle&quot;.

Krebs sent a short manuscript account of the discovery to &quot;Nature&quot; on 10 June 1937. On 14 June, he received a rejection letter from the editor, saying that the journal had &quot;already sufficient letters to fill correspondence columns for seven or eight weeks&quot;, and encouraging Krebs to &quot;submit it for early publication to another periodical.&quot; 

Krebs immediately prepared a longer version titled &quot;The Role of Citric Acid in Intermediate Metabolism in Animal Tissues&quot;, which he sent to the Dutch journal &quot;Enzymologia&quot; after two weeks and was published in two months. It was followed by a series of papers in different journals.

=== Glyoxylate cycle ===
Krebs continued to add more details to his citric acid cycle. The discovery of acetyl-CoA in 1947 by Fritz Albert Lipmann was another major contribution. However, this new discovery posed a problem in his classic reaction. In 1957, he, with Hans Kornberg, found that there were additional crucial enzymes. One was malate synthase, which condenses acetate with glyoxylate to form malate, and the other was isocitrate lyase, which provides glyoxylate for the reaction by cleaving it from isocitrate. These two reactions did not follow the normal citric acid cycle, and hence the pathway was named the glyoxylate bypass of the citric acid cycle, but is now known as the glyoxylate cycle.

== Honours and awards ==

Krebs became a naturalised British citizen in 1939. He was elected Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, 1954–1967. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1947. In 1953, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his &quot;discovery of the citric acid cycle.&quot; (He shared the Nobel Prize with Fritz Lipmann.) For the same reason he was given the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1953. 

The Royal Society awarded him its Royal Medal in 1954, and Copley Medal in 1961. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. 

In 1958, he received the Gold Medal of the Netherlands Society for Physics, Medical Science and Surgery. He was knighted in 1958 and was elected Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge University, in 1979. He was the Original Member of the Society for General Microbiology, which conferred him Honorary Membership in 1980. He was also an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences. He received an honorary doctorate from 21 universities.

In July 2015, Krebs&#x27;s Nobel Prize medal was auctioned off for £225,000 (around $351,225). The proceeds were used to found the Sir Hans Krebs Trust, which provides funding for doctoral students in the biomedical field and support chemists who had to flee their home countries.

== Legacy ==

The University of Oxford had a building named Hans Krebs Tower, which was occupied by the Department of Biochemistry. In 2008, a new building for the Department of Biochemistry was constructed, on which a plaque was placed on 20 May 2013 by the Association of Jewish Refugees. The plaque was unveiled by John, Lord Krebs, and the inscription reads:

The Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics at Oxford University hosts the Sir Hans Krebs Prize Lecture Series.
The last three recipients have been: Jeffrey Friedman M.D., PhD (2019) Professor Sir Stephen O&#x27;Rahilly MD FRS FMedSci (2022) and in 2023 - Professor Dame Frances Ashcroft FRS FMedSci 

The University of Sheffield has The Krebs Institute, founded in 1988. It is a research centre covering interdisciplinary programmes in biochemical research.

In 1990, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies instituted the Sir Hans Krebs Lecture and Medal, which was endowed by the Lord Rank Centre for Research. It is awarded for outstanding achievements in biochemistry and molecular biology.

The Society of Friends of Hannover Medical School gives the Sir Hans Krebs Prize, which is worth 10,000 euros.

The Biochemical Society offers Krebs Memorial Scholarship to a postgraduate (PhD) student working in biochemistry or an allied biomedical science at any British university. As of 2014, the scholarship is worth £18,500 and is given for a year, but is extendable up to three years.

<doc id="169030" wikidata="Q4741997" url="?curid=169030" title="Ambush!">
<text>Ambush! is a man-to-man wargame developed by Avalon Hill. It was released under Avalon&#x27;s Victory Games label and was developed by Eric Lee Smith and John Butterfield. It has been out of print since Avalon Hill was disbanded in 1998.

&quot;Ambush!&quot; was innovative when it was released in 1983 since it was exclusively designed for single player play. Up to that point, wargames generally required at least two players. This was necessary since a player always had to play and control the opponent. &quot;Ambush!&quot; solved this problem by having the game scenario itself control the opponent. It accomplished this via tables, charts and a &quot;paragraph book&quot; which the player referred to see how the opponent was reacting.

Having the scenario dictate the actions of the opponent had another advantage: perfectly hiding the enemy. In all previous board based wargames, chits or markers had to be placed on the board representing enemy units. Some chits contained question marks or otherwise hid what was actually on the space, but the opposing player knew where likely areas for the enemy were. With &quot;Ambush!&quot;, the enemy had no markers on the board at all until they became visible (usually by attacking the player).

One drawback of &quot;Ambush!&#x27;s&quot; design was that it was difficult for players to create their own scenarios. Since each scenario had its own complex set of charts and tables, each cross-referenced to sections in the paragraph book, creating a scenario for the game from scratch could be a daunting undertaking. Players, then, were usually required to purchase Avalon Hill&#x27;s expansion modules in order to play additional scenarios.

&quot;Ambush!&quot; could also be played with more than one player, with players playing in different squads or controlling different soldiers.

== Expansions ==

&quot;Ambush!&quot; spawned several expansion modules:
* Move Out (1984)
* Purple Heart (1985)
* Silver Star (1987)

There was also a Japanese theatre version of &quot;Ambush!&quot; called &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;, which had one expansion module called &quot;Leatherneck&quot;.

Additionally, a solitaire game based on &quot;Ambush!&quot; called &quot;Open Fire!&quot; was released by Victory Games which put the player in command of US tanks in WW II. It was less successful and had a less elegant design.

There was, finally, a two-player version of &quot;Ambush!&quot; called &quot;Shell Shock&quot; released in 1990.

==Computer versions==

There have been a number of literal translations of &quot;Ambush!&quot; to the computer, including a cyberbox module as well as at least one version for the VASSAL game engine.

==Reception==
In 1984, &quot;Ambush!&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best 20th Century Boardgame of 1983&quot;.

==Reviews==
* &quot;Casus Belli&quot; #22 (Oct 1984)
*1983 Games 100
*1984 Games 100

==Legacy==

While not the first boxed solitaire board wargame to be produced (Avalon Hill&#x27;s &quot;B-17, Queen of the Skies&quot; had preceded it in 1983), &quot;Ambush!&quot; was probably the most successful. While the additional modules are testament to this successful design, the concept also appears to have been validated by &quot;Ambush!&quot;, as a fair number of other purpose-designed solitaire games (as opposed to two player games that &quot;could&quot; be played solitaire) followed it shortly after. These include:

* &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; (Victory Games, 1988)
* &quot;Open Fire&quot; (Victory Games, 1988)
* &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; (Avalon Hill, 1995) - a solitaire game of the Battle of Britain
* &quot;Solitaire Advanced Squad Leader&quot; (Avalon Hill, 1995)

<doc id="169032" wikidata="Q7419323" url="?curid=169032" title="Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.">
<text>Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), is a corporate law case of the United States Supreme Court concerning taxation of railroad properties. The case is most notable for a headnote stating that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants constitutional protections to corporations.

The case arose when several railroads refused to follow a California state law that gave less favorable tax treatment to some assets owned by corporations as compared to assets owned by individuals. The Court&#x27;s opinions in earlier cases such as &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan&#x27;s majority opinion held for the railroads, but his opinion did not address the Equal Protection Clause. However, a headnote written by the Reporter of Decisions and approved by Chief Justice Morrison Waite stated that the Supreme Court justices unanimously believed that the Equal Protection Clause did grant constitutional protections to corporations. The headnote marked the first occasion on which the Supreme Court indicated that the Equal Protection Clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons.

==Facts==
At the California Constitutional Convention of 1878–79, the state legislature drew up a new constitution that denied railroads &quot;the right to deduct the amount of their debts [i.e., mortgages] from the taxable value of their property, a right which was given to individuals.&quot; Southern Pacific Railroad Company refused to pay taxes under these new changes. The taxpaying railroads challenged this law, based on a conflicting federal statute of 1866 which gave them privileges inconsistent with state taxation (14 Stat. 292, §§ 1, 2, 3, 11, 18).

San Mateo County, along with neighboring counties, filed suit against the railroads to recoup the massive losses in tax revenue stemming from Southern Pacific&#x27;s refusal to pay. After hearing arguments in &quot;San Mateo County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company&quot;, the California Supreme Court sided with the county.

The Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion consolidating three separate cases: &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company&quot;, &quot;California v. Central Pacific Railroad Company&quot;, and &quot;California v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company&quot;.

===Headnote===

The headnote, which is &quot;not the work of the Court, but is simply the work of the Reporter, giving his understanding of the decision, prepared for the convenience of the profession&quot;, was written by the Reporter of Decisions, former president of the Newburgh and New York Railway Company J.C. Bancroft Davis. He said the following:

One of the points made and discussed at length in the brief of counsel for defendants in error was that &#x27;corporations are persons within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.&#x27; Before argument, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said: The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.

So the headnote was a reporting by the Reporter of Decisions of the Chief Justice&#x27;s interpretation of the Justices&#x27; opinions. But the issue of applicability of &quot;Equal Protection to any persons&quot; to the railroads was not addressed in the decision of the Court in the case.

Before publication in &quot;United States Reports&quot;, Davis wrote a letter to Chief Justice Morrison Waite, dated May 26, 1886, to make sure his headnote was correct:
Dear Chief Justice,

I have a memorandum in the California Cases Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific &amp;c
As follows. In opening the Court stated that it did not wish to hear argument on the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment applies to such corporations as are parties in these suits. All the Judges were of the opinion that it does.
Waite replied:
I think your mem. in the California Railroad Tax cases expresses with sufficient accuracy what was said before the argument began. I leave it with you to determine whether anything need be said about it in the report inasmuch as we avoided meeting the constitutional question in the decision.
C. Peter Magrath, who discovered the exchange while researching &quot;Morrison R. Waite: The Triumph of Character&quot;, writes &quot;In other words, to the Reporter fell the decision which enshrined the declaration in the &quot;United States Reports&quot;...had Davis left it out, &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pac. R. Co.&quot; would have been lost to history among thousands of uninteresting tax cases.&quot; At the same time, the correspondence makes clear that the headnote does reflect the Court&#x27;s thinking, at least before hearing any arguments to the contrary.

Author Jack Beatty wrote about the lingering questions as to how the reporter&#x27;s note reflected a quotation that was absent from the opinion itself.

Why did the chief justice issue his dictum? Why did he leave it up to Davis to include it in the headnotes? After Waite told him that the Court &#x27;avoided&#x27; the issue of corporate personhood, why &quot;did&quot; Davis include it? Why, indeed, did he begin his headnote with it? The opinion made plain that the Court did not decide the corporate personality issue and the subsidiary equal protection issue.
===Defense argument===
While the decision of the Court did not rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, an argument on this ground had been delivered by the defense:

That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of California in respect to the assessment for taxation of the property of railway corporations operating railroads in more than one county, are in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution insofar as they require the assessment of their property at its full money value without making deduction, as in the case of railroads operated in one county and of other corporations and of natural persons, for the value of the mortgages covering the property assessed, thus imposing upon the defendant unequal burdens, and to that extent denying to it the equal protection of the laws.

==Judgment==
A unanimous decision, written by Justice Harlan, ruled on the matter of fences, holding that the state of California illegally included the fences running beside the tracks in its assessment of the total value of the railroad&#x27;s property. As a result, the county could not collect taxes from Southern Pacific that it was not allowed to collect in the first place. This meant that the more significant question of the Equal Protection Clause was never actually addressed.

==Significance==
Thus the Supreme Court&#x27;s actual decision never hinged on the equal protection claims. Nevertheless, the case has been allowed to have clear constitutional consequences, as it has been subsequently cited as affirming the protection of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment. At the very least, this is an unusual exception to the normal understanding of the workings of the Court&#x27;s rule of &quot;stare decisis&quot; – the reliance on precedent. It is an instance in which a statement which is neither part of the ruling of the Court, nor part of the opinion of a majority or dissenting minority of the Court has been cited as precedent in subsequent decisions of the Court.

In his dissent in the 1938 case of &quot;Connecticut General Life Insurance Company v. Johnson&quot;, Justice Hugo Black wrote 
in 1886, this Court in the case of &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;, decided for the first time that the word &#x27;person&#x27; in the amendment did in some instances include corporations. [...] The history of the amendment proves that the people were told that its purpose was to protect weak and helpless human beings and were not told that it was intended to remove corporations in any fashion from the control of state governments. [...] The language of the amendment itself does not support the theory that it was passed for the benefit of corporations.

Justice William O. Douglas wrote in 1949, 
the &quot;Santa Clara&quot; case becomes one of the most momentous of all our decisions. [...] Corporations were now armed with constitutional prerogatives.

<doc id="169033" wikidata="Q51545" url="?curid=169033" title="Luis Buñuel">
<text>Luis Buñuel Portolés (; 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish and Mexican filmmaker who worked in France, Mexico and Spain. He has been widely considered by many film critics, historians and directors to be one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. Buñuel&#x27;s works were known for their avant-garde surrealism which were also infused with political commentary.

Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel&#x27;s career spanned the 1920s through the 1970s. He collaborated with prolific surrealist painter Salvador Dali on &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929) and &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930). Both films are considered masterpieces of surrealist cinema. From 1947 to 1960, he honed his skills as a director in Mexico, making grounded and human melodramas such as &quot;Gran Casino&quot; (1947), &quot;Los Olvidados&quot; (1950) and &quot;Él&quot; (1953). Here is where he gained the fundamentals of storytelling.

Buñuel then transitioned into making artful, unconventional, surrealist and political satirical films. He earned acclaim with the morally complex arthouse drama film &quot;Viridiana&quot; (1961) which criticized the Francoist dictatorship. The film won the at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. He then criticized political and social conditions in &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (1972), the latter of which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He also directed &quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; (1964) and &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; (1967). His final film, &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot; (1977), earned the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director.

Buñuel earned five Cannes Film Festival prizes, two Berlin International Film Festival prizes, and a BAFTA Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards. Buñuel received numerous honors including National Prize for Arts and Sciences for Fine Arts in 1977, the Moscow International Film Festival Contribution to Cinema Prize in 1979, and the Career Golden Lion in 1982. He was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968 and 1972. Seven of Buñuel&#x27;s films are included in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; 2012 critics&#x27; poll of the top 250 films of all time. Buñuel&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

Buñuel was born on 22 February 1900 in Calanda, a small town in the Aragon region of Spain. His father was Leonardo Buñuel, also a native of Calanda, who had left home at age 14 to start a hardware business in Havana, Cuba, ultimately amassing a fortune and returning home to Calanda at the age of 43, in 1898. He married the 18-year-old daughter of the only innkeeper in Calanda, María Portolés Cerezuela. The oldest of seven children, Luis had two brothers, Alfonso and Leonardo, and four sisters: Alicia, Concepción, Margarita and María. He later described his birthplace by saying that in Calanda, &quot;the Middle Ages lasted until World War I&quot;.

When Buñuel was four months old, the family moved to Zaragoza, where they were one of the wealthiest families in town. In Zaragoza, Buñuel received a strict Jesuit education at the private Colegio del Salvador, starting at the age of seven and continuing for the next seven years. After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, Buñuel refused to return to the school. He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam. Buñuel finished the last two years of his high school education at the local public school, graduating at the age of 16. Even as a child, Buñuel was something of a cinematic showman; friends from that period described productions in which Buñuel projected shadows on a screen using a magic lantern and a bedsheet. He also excelled at boxing and playing the violin.

In his youth, Buñuel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at the age of 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth.

In 1917, he attended the University of Madrid, first studying agronomy then industrial engineering and finally switching to philosophy. He developed very close relationships with painter Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming the nucleus of the Spanish Surrealist avant-garde, and becoming known as members of &quot;La Generación del 27&quot;. Buñuel was especially taken with García Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: We liked each other instantly. Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together...We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world. Buñuel&#x27;s relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí&#x27;s early success as an artist.

Buñuel&#x27;s interest in films was intensified by a viewing of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Der müde Tod&quot;: &quot;I came out of the Vieux Colombier [theater] completely transformed. Images could and did become for me the true means of expression. I decided to devote myself to the cinema&quot;. At the age of 72, Buñuel had not lost his enthusiasm for this film, asking the octogenarian Lang for his autograph.
==Career==
=== 1925–1930 Early French period ===

In 1925 Buñuel moved to Paris, where he began work as a secretary in an organization called the International Society of Intellectual Cooperation. He also became actively involved in cinema and theater, going to the movies as often as three times a day. Through these interests, he met a number of influential people, including the pianist Ricardo Viñes, who was instrumental in securing Buñuel&#x27;s selection as artistic director of the Dutch premiere of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s puppet-opera &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; in 1926.

He decided to enter the film industry and enrolled in a private film school run by Jean Epstein and some associates. At that time, Epstein was one of the most celebrated commercial directors working in France, his films being hailed as &quot;the triumph of impressionism in motion, but also the triumph of the modern spirit&quot;. Before long, Buñuel was working for Epstein as an assistant director on &quot;Mauprat&quot; (1926) and &quot;La chute de la maison Usher&quot; (1928), and also for Mario Nalpas on (&quot;Siren of the Tropics&quot;) (1927), starring Josephine Baker. He appeared on screen in a small part as a smuggler in Jacques Feyder&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1926).

When Buñuel derisively rejected Epstein&#x27;s demand that he assist Epstein&#x27;s mentor, Abel Gance, who was at the time working on the film &quot;Napoléon&quot;, Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying &quot;How can a little asshole like you dare to talk that way about a great director like Gance?&quot; then added &quot;You seem rather surrealist. Beware of surrealists, they are crazy people.&quot;

After parting with Epstein, Buñuel worked as film critic for &quot;La Gaceta Literaria&quot; (1927) and &quot;Les Cahiers d&#x27;Art&quot; (1928). In the periodicals &#x27; and &#x27;, he and Dalí carried on a series of &quot;call and response&quot; essays on cinema and theater, debating such technical issues as segmentation, découpage, the insert shot and rhythmic editing. He also collaborated with the celebrated writer Ramón Gómez de la Serna on the script for what he hoped would be his first film, &quot;a story in six scenes&quot; called &quot;Los caprichos&quot;. Through his involvement with &quot;Gaceta Literaria&quot;, he helped establish Madrid&#x27;s first cine-club and served as its inaugural chairman.

====&quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929)====

After his apprenticeship with Epstein, Buñuel shot and directed a 16-minute short, , with Salvador Dalí. The film, financed by Buñuel&#x27;s mother, consists of a series of startling images of a Freudian nature, starting with a woman&#x27;s eyeball being sliced open with a razor blade. was enthusiastically received by the burgeoning French surrealist movement of the time and continues to be shown regularly in film societies to this day. It has been called &quot;the most famous short film ever made&quot; by critic Roger Ebert.

The script was written in six days at Dalí&#x27;s home in Cadaqués. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, Buñuel described the writing process:

We had to look for the plot line. Dalí said to me, &#x27;I dreamed last night of ants swarming around in my hands&#x27;, and I said, &#x27;Good Lord, and I dreamed that I had sliced somebody or other&#x27;s eye. There&#x27;s the film, let&#x27;s go and make it.&#x27;
In deliberate contrast to the approach taken by Jean Epstein and his peers, which was to never leave anything in their work to chance, with every aesthetic decision having a rational explanation and fitting clearly into the whole, Buñuel and Dalí made a cardinal point of eliminating all logical associations. In Buñuel&#x27;s words: &quot;Our only rule was very simple: no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted. We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us, without trying to explain why&quot;.

It was Buñuel&#x27;s intention to outrage the self-proclaimed artistic vanguard of his youth, later saying: &quot;Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what in those days was called &#x27;avant-garde,&#x27; which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience&#x27;s reason.&quot; Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a popular success with the very audience he had wanted to insult, leading Buñuel to exclaim in exasperation: &quot;What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?&quot;

Although is a silent film, during the original screening (attended by the elite of the Parisian art world), Buñuel played a sequence of phonograph records which he switched manually while keeping his pockets full of stones with which to pelt anticipated hecklers. After the premiere, Buñuel and Dalí were granted formal admittance to the tight-knit community of Surrealists, led by poet André Breton.

====&quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930)====

Late in 1929, on the strength of , Buñuel and Dalí were commissioned to make another short film by Marie-Laurie and Charles de Noailles, owners of a private cinema on the Place des États-Unis and financial supporters of productions by Jacques Manuel, Man Ray and Pierre Chenal. At first, the intent was that the new film be around the same length as &quot;Un Chien&quot;, only this time with sound. But by mid-1930, the film had grown segmentally to an hour&#x27;s duration. Anxious that it was over twice as long as planned and at double the budget, Buñuel offered to trim the film and cease production, but Noailles gave him the go-ahead to continue the project.

The film, entitled &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot;, was begun as a second collaboration with Dalí, but, while working on the scenario, the two had a falling out; Buñuel, who at the time had strong leftist sympathies, desired a deliberate undermining of all bourgeois institutions, while Dalí, who eventually supported the Spanish fascist Francisco Franco and various figures of the European aristocracy, wanted merely to cause a scandal through the use of various scatological and anti-Catholic images. The friction between them was exacerbated when, at a dinner party in Cadaqués, Buñuel tried to throttle Dalí&#x27;s girlfriend, Gala, the wife of Surrealist poet Paul Éluard. In consequence, Dalí had nothing to do with the actual shooting of the film. During the course of production, Buñuel worked around his technical ignorance by filming mostly in sequence and using nearly every foot of film that he shot. Buñuel invited friends and acquaintances to appear, for nothing, in the film; for example, anyone who owned a tuxedo or a party frock got a part in the salon scene.

 &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; was publicly proclaimed by Dalí as a deliberate attack on Catholicism, and this precipitated a much larger scandal than . One early screening was taken over by members of the fascist League of Patriots and the Anti-Jewish Youth Group, who hurled purple ink at the screen and then vandalised the adjacent art gallery, destroying a number of valuable surrealist paintings. The film was banned by the Parisian police &quot;in the name of public order&quot;. The de Noailles, both Catholics, were threatened with excommunication by The Vatican because of the film&#x27;s blasphemous final scene (which visually links Jesus Christ with the writings of the Marquis de Sade), so they made the decision in 1934 to withdraw all prints from circulation, and &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; was not seen again until 1981, after their deaths, although a print was smuggled to England for private viewing. The furor was so great that the premiere of another film financed by the de Noailles, Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;, had to be delayed for over two years until outrage over &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; had died down. To make matters worse, Charles de Noailles was forced to withdraw his membership from the Jockey Club.

Concurrent with the &quot;succès de scandale&quot;, both Buñuel and the film&#x27;s leading lady, Lya Lys, received offers of interest from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and traveled to Hollywood at the studio&#x27;s expense. While in the United States, Buñuel associated with other celebrity expatriates including Sergei Eisenstein, Josef von Sternberg, Jacques Feyder, Charles Chaplin and Bertolt Brecht. All that was required of Buñuel by his loose-ended contract with MGM was that he &quot;learn some good American technical skills&quot;, but, after being ushered off the first set he visited because the star, Greta Garbo, did not welcome intruders, he decided to stay at home most of the time and only show up to collect his paycheck. His only enduring contribution to MGM came when he served as an extra in &quot;La Fruta Amarga&quot;, a Spanish-language remake of &quot;Min and Bill&quot;. When, after a few months at the studio, he was asked to watch rushes of Lili Damita to gauge her Spanish accent, he refused and sent a message to studio boss Irving Thalberg stating that he was there as a Frenchman, not a Spaniard, and he &quot;didn&#x27;t have time to waste listening to one of the whores&quot;. He was back in Spain shortly thereafter.

=== 1931–1937: Spain ===

Spain in the early 1930s was a time of political and social turbulence. Due to both a surge in anti-clerical sentiment and a longrunning desire for retribution for the corruption and malfeasance of the extreme right and their supporters in the church, Anarchists and Radical Socialists sacked monarchist headquarters in Madrid and proceeded to burn down or otherwise wreck more than a dozen churches in the capital. Similar revolutionary acts occurred in many other cities in southern and eastern Spain, in most cases with the acquiescence and occasionally with the assistance of the official Republican authorities.

Buñuel&#x27;s future wife, Jeanne Rucar, recalled that during that period, &quot;he got very excited about politics and the ideas that were everywhere in pre-Civil War Spain&quot;. In the first flush of his enthusiasm, Buñuel joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in 1931, though later in life he denied becoming a Communist.
In 1932, Buñuel was invited to serve as film documentarian for the celebrated &quot;Mission Dakar-Djibouti&quot;, the first large-scale French anthropological field expedition, which, led by Marcel Griaule, unearthed some 3,500 African artifacts for the new Musée de l&#x27;Homme. Although he declined, the project piqued his interest in ethnography. After reading the academic study, &quot;Las Jurdes: étude de géographie humaine&quot; (1927) by , he decided to make a film focused on peasant life in Las Hurdes, perhaps the poorest comarca in Extremadura, one of Spain&#x27;s poorest regions. The film, called &quot;Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan&quot; (1933), was financed on a budget of 20,000 pesetas donated by a working-class anarchist friend named Ramón Acín, who had won the money in a lottery. In the film, Buñuel matches scenes of deplorable social conditions with narration that resembles travelogue commentary delivered by a detached-sounding announcer, while the soundtrack thunders inappropriate music by Brahms.

&quot;Las Hurdes&quot; was banned by the Second Spanish Republic and then by the Francoist dictatorship. It is a film which continues to perplex viewers and resists easy categorization by film historians. &quot;Las Hurdes&quot; has been called one of the first examples of mockumentary, and has been labeled a &quot;surrealist documentary&quot;, a term defined by critic as &quot;A multi-layered and unnerving use of sound, the juxtaposition of narrative forms already learnt from the written press, travelogues and new pedagogic methods, as well as a subversive use of photographed and filmed documents understood as a basis for contemporary propaganda for the masses&quot;. Catherine Russell has stated that in &quot;Las Hurdes&quot;, Buñuel was able to reconcile his political philosophy with his surrealist aesthetic, with surrealism becoming &quot;a means of awakening a marxist materialism in danger of becoming a stale orthodoxy&quot;.

After &quot;Las Hurdes&quot; in 1933, Buñuel worked in Paris in the dubbing department of Paramount Pictures, but following his marriage in 1934, he switched to Warner Brothers because they operated dubbing studios in Madrid. A friend, , who owned the commercial film company , invited Buñuel to produce films for a mass audience. He accepted the offer, viewing it as an &quot;experiment&quot; as he knew the film industry in Spain was still far behind the technical level of Hollywood or Paris. According to film historian Manuel Rotellar&#x27;s interviews with members of the cast and crew of the Filmófono studios, Buñuel&#x27;s only condition was that his involvement with these pictures be completely anonymous, apparently for fear of damaging his reputation as a surrealist. Rotellar insists, however, &quot;the truth is that it was Luis Buñuel who directed the Filmófono productions&quot;. José Luis Sáenz de Heredia, the titular director of two of the films created during Buñuel&#x27;s years as &quot;executive producer&quot; at Filmófono, recounted that it was Buñuel who &quot;explained to me every morning what he wanted...We looked at the takes together and it was Buñuel who chose the shots, and in editing, I wasn&#x27;t even allowed to be present.&quot; Of the 18 films produced by Buñuel during his years at Filmófono, the four that are believed by critical consensus to have been directed by him are:

* &quot;Don Quintín el amargao&quot; (Don Quintin the Sourpuss), 1935 – a musical based on a play by Carlos Arniches, the first &quot;zarzuela&quot; (a type of Spanish opera) filmed in sound. 
* &quot;La hija de Juan Simón&quot; (Juan Simón&#x27;s Daughter), 1935 – another musical and a major commercial success
* (Who Loves Me?), 1936 – a sentimental comedy that Buñuel called &quot;my only commercial failure, and a pretty dismal one at that&quot;.
* &quot;¡Centinela, alerta!&quot;, (Sentry, Keep Watch!), 1937 – a comedy and Filmófono&#x27;s biggest box-office hit.
During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), Buñuel placed himself at the disposal of the Republican government. The minister for foreign affairs sent him first to Geneva (September 1936) and then to Paris for two years (1936–38), with official responsibility for cataloging Republican propaganda films. Besides the cataloguing, Buñuel took left-wing tracts to Spain, did some occasional spying, acted as a bodyguard, and supervised the making of a documentary, entitled &quot;España 1936&quot; in France and in Spain, that covered the elections, the parades, the riots, and the war. In August 1936, Federico García Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia. According to his son, Juan Luis, Buñuel rarely talked about Lorca but mourned the poet&#x27;s untimely death throughout his life.

Buñuel essentially functioned as the coordinator of film propaganda for the Republic, which meant that he was in a position to examine all film shot in the country and decide what sequences could be developed and distributed abroad. The Spanish Ambassador suggested that Buñuel revisit Hollywood where he could give technical advice on films being made there about the Spanish Civil War, so in 1938, he and his family traveled to the United States using funds obtained from his old patrons, the Noailles. Almost immediately upon his arrival in America, however, the war ended and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America discontinued making films on the Spanish conflict. According to Buñuel&#x27;s wife, returning to Spain was impossible since the Fascists had seized power, so Buñuel decided to stay in the U.S. indefinitely, stating that he was &quot;immensely attracted by the American naturalness and sociability&quot;.

=== 1938–1945: United States ===

Returning to Hollywood in 1938, he was befriended by Frank Davis, an MGM producer and member of the Communist Party USA, who placed Buñuel on the payroll of &quot;Cargo of Innocence&quot;, a film about Spanish refugee mothers and children fleeing from Bilbao to the USSR. The project was shelved precipitately when another Hollywood film about the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Blockade&quot;, was met with disfavor by the Catholic League of Decency. In the words of biographer Ruth Brandon, Buñuel and his family &quot;lived from one unsatisfactory crumb of work to another&quot; because he &quot;had none of the arrogance and pushiness essential for survival in Hollywood&quot;. He just was not flamboyant enough to capture the attention of Hollywood decision makers, in the opinion of film composer George Antheil: &quot;Inasmuch as [Buñuel], his wife and his little boy seemed to be such absolutely normal, solid persons, as totally un-Surrealist in the Dalí tradition as one could possibly imagine.&quot; For the most part, he was snubbed by many of the people in the film community whom he met during his first trip to America, although he was able to sell some gags to Chaplin for his film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;.

In desperation, to market himself to independent producers, he composed a 21-page autobiography, a section of which, headed &quot;My Present Plans&quot;, outlined proposals for two documentary films:
* &quot;The Primitive Man&quot;, which would depict &quot;the terrible struggle of primitive man against a hostile universe, how the world appeared, &quot;how they saw it&quot;, what ideas they had on love, on death, on fraternity, how and why religion is born&quot;, [italics in original]
* &quot;Psycho-Pathology&quot;, which would &quot;expose the origin and development of different psychopathic diseases...Such a documental film, apart from its great scientific interest, could depict on screen a &quot;New Form of Terror&quot; or its synonym &quot;Humour&quot;.&quot; [italics in original]

Nobody showed any interest and Buñuel realized that staying in Los Angeles was futile, so he traveled to New York City to see if he could change his fortunes.
In New York City, Antheil introduced Buñuel to Iris Barry, chief curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Barry talked Buñuel into joining a committee formed to help educate those within the U.S. government who might not have appreciated fully the effectiveness of film as a medium of propaganda. Buñuel was hired to produce a shortened version of Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935) as a demonstration project. The finished product was a compilation of scenes from Riefenstahl&#x27;s Nazi epic with Hans Bertram&#x27;s &quot;Feuertaufe&quot;. Buñuel stayed at MoMA to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) as part of a production team that gathered, reviewed and edited films intended as anti-fascist propaganda to be distributed in Latin America by American embassies. While being vetted for the job at the OCIAA, upon being asked if he was a Communist, he replied: &quot;I am a Republican,&quot; and, apparently, the interviewer did not realize that Buñuel was referring to the Spanish socialist coalition government, not the American political party. Describing Buñuel&#x27;s work at MoMA, his friend, composer Gustavo Pittaluga, stated: &quot;Luis created maybe 2,000 remarkable works. We were sent anodyne documentaries, often extremely feeble primary materials, which the Museum team turned into marvellous films. And not just Spanish versions, but also Portuguese, French and English...He would create a good documentary through editing.&quot; [italics in original]

In 1942, Buñuel applied for American citizenship because he anticipated that MoMA would be put under federal control. This same year, Dalí published his autobiography &quot;The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí&quot;, in which he made it clear that he had split with Buñuel because the latter was a Communist and an atheist. News of this reached Archbishop Spellman, who angrily confronted Barry with the question: &quot;Are you aware that you are harbouring in this Museum the Antichrist, the man who made a blasphemous film &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot;?&quot; At the same time, a campaign on the part of Hollywood, through its industry trade paper, the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot;, to undermine the MoMA film unit resulted in a 66% reduction in the department&#x27;s budget and Buñuel felt himself compelled to resign. In 1944, he returned to Hollywood for the third time, this time as Spanish Dubbing Producer for Warner Brothers. Before leaving New York City, he confronted Dalí at his hotel, the Sherry Netherland, to tell the painter about the damage his book had done and then shoot him in the knee. Buñuel did not carry out the violent part of his plan. Dalí explained himself by saying: &quot;I did not write my book to put YOU on a pedestal. I wrote it to put ME on a pedestal&quot;.
Buñuel&#x27;s first dubbing assignment on returning to Hollywood was &quot;My Reputation&quot;, a Barbara Stanwyck picture which became &quot;El Que Diran&quot; in Buñuel&#x27;s hands. In addition to his dubbing work, Buñuel attempted to develop a number of independent projects:
* In collaboration with an old friend from his Surrealist days, Man Ray, he worked on a scenario called &quot;The Sewers of Los Angeles&quot;, which took place on a mountain of excrement close to a highway and a dust basin.
* With his friend, José Rubia Barcia, he co-wrote a screenplay called &quot;La novia de medianoche&quot; (The Midnight Bride), a gothic thriller, which lay dormant until it was filmed by Antonio Simón in 1997.
* He continued working on a screenplay called &quot;Goya and the Duchess of Alba&quot;, a treatment he had started as early as 1927, with the actor/producer Florián Rey and cameraman José María Beltrán, and then resuscitated in 1937 as a project for Paramount.
* In his autobiography &quot;Mon Dernier soupir&quot; (1982, translated in the U.S. as &quot;My Last Sigh&quot;, 1983, and in the UK as &quot;My Last Breath&quot;, 1984), Buñuel wrote that, at the request of director Robert Florey, he submitted a treatment of a scene about a disembodied hand, which was later included in the movie &quot;The Beast with Five Fingers&quot; (1946), starring Peter Lorre, without acknowledgement of Buñuel&#x27;s contribution or payment of any compensation. However, Brian Taves, film scholar and archivist with the Library of Congress, has challenged the truth of this claim.

In 1945, Buñuel&#x27;s contract with Warner Brothers expired, and he decided not to renew it in order, as he put it: &quot;to realize my life&#x27;s ambition for a year: to do nothing&quot;. While his family enjoyed themselves at the beach, Buñuel spent much of his time in Antelope Valley with new acquaintances writer Aldous Huxley and sculptor Alexander Calder, from whom he rented a house.

In his autobiography, in a chapter about his second spell in America, Buñuel states that &quot;[o]n several occasions, both American and European producers have suggested that I tackle a film version of Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;&quot;, but that after reading the book many times as well as eight different screenplays he was unable to come up with a solution for the cinema. The movie was eventually made in 1984 by John Huston.

=== 1946–1953: Mexico ===

In 1946, an old friend, producer Denise Tual, the widow of Pierre Batcheff, the leading man in , proposed that she and Buñuel adapt Lorca&#x27;s play &quot;La casa de Bernarda Alba&quot; for production in Paris. As it turned out, though, before they could both make their way to Europe, they encountered problems in securing the rights from Lorca&#x27;s family. While in Mexico City, on a stopover, they had asked Óscar Dancigers, a Russian émigré producer active in Mexico, for financing. Dancigers ran an independent production company that specialized in assisting U.S. film studios with on-location shooting in Mexico, but following World War II, he had lost his connection with Hollywood due to his being blacklisted as a Communist. Although Dancigers was not enthusiastic about the Lorca project, he did want to work with Buñuel and persuaded the Spanish director to undertake a totally different project.
The Golden Age of Mexican cinema was peaking in the mid-to-late 1940s, at just the time Buñuel was connecting with Dancigers. Movies represented Mexico&#x27;s third largest industry by 1947, employing 32,000 workers, with 72 film producers who invested 66 million pesos (approximately U.S. $13 million) per year, four active studios with 40 million pesos of invested capital, and approximately 1,500 theaters throughout the nation, with about 200 in Mexico City alone. For their first project, the two men selected what seemed like a sure-fire success, &quot;Gran Casino&quot;, a musical period piece set in Tampico during the boom years of oil exploitation, starring two of the most popular entertainers in Latin America: Libertad Lamarque, an Argentine actress and singer, and Jorge Negrete, a Mexican singer and leading man in &quot;charro&quot; films. Buñuel recalled: &quot;I kept them singing all the time—a competition, a championship&quot;.

The film was not successful at the box office, with some even calling it a fiasco. Different reasons have been given for its failure with the public; for some, Buñuel was forced to make concessions to the bad taste of his stars, particularly Negrete, others cite Buñuel&#x27;s rusty technical skills and lack of confidence after so many years out of the director&#x27;s chair, while still others speculate that Mexican audiences were tiring of genre movies, called &quot;churros&quot;, that were perceived as being cheaply and hastily made.

The failure of &quot;Gran Casino&quot; sidelined Buñuel, and it was over two years before he had the chance to direct another picture. According to Buñuel, he spent this time &quot;scratching my nose, watching flies and living off my mother&#x27;s money&quot;, but he was actually somewhat more industrious than that may sound. With the husband/wife team of Janet and Luis Alcoriza, he wrote the scenario for &quot;Si usted no puede, yo sí&quot;, which was filmed in 1950 by Julián Soler. He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called &quot;Ilegible, hijo de flauta&quot;, with the poet Juan Larrea. Dancigers pointed out to him that there was currently public interest in films about street urchins, so Buñuel scoured the back streets and slums of Mexico City in search of material, interviewing social workers about street gang warfare and murdered children.

During this period, Dancigers was busy producing films for the actor/director Fernando Soler, one of the most durable of Mexican film personalities, having been referred to as the &quot;national paterfamilias&quot;. Although Soler typically preferred to direct his own films, for their next collaboration, &quot;El Gran Calavera&quot;, based on a play by Adolfo Torrado, he decided that doing both jobs would be too much trouble, so he asked Dancigers to find someone who could be trusted to handle the technical aspects of the directorial duties. Buñuel welcomed the opportunity, stating that: &quot;I amused myself with the montage, the constructions, the angles...All of that interested me because I was still an apprentice in so-called &#x27;normal&#x27; cinema.&quot; As a result of his work on this film, he developed a technique for making films cheaply and quickly by limiting them to 125 shots. &quot;El Gran Calavera&quot; was completed in 16 days at a cost of 400,000 pesos (approximately $46,000 US at 1948 exchange rates). The picture has been described as &quot;a hilarious screwball send-up of the Mexican nouveau riche...a wild roller coaster of mistaken identity, sham marriages and misfired suicides&quot;, and it was a big hit at the box office in Mexico. In 2013, the picture was re-made by Mexican director Gary Alazraki under the title &quot;The Noble Family&quot;. In 1949, Buñuel renounced his Spanish citizenship to become a naturalized Mexican.

The commercial success of &quot;El Gran Calavera&quot; enabled Buñuel to redeem a promise he had extracted from Dancigers, which was that if Buñuel could deliver a money-maker, Dancigers would guarantee &quot;a degree of freedom&quot; on the next film project. Knowing that Dancigers was uncomfortable with experimentalism, especially when it might affect the bottom line, Buñuel proposed a commercial project titled &quot;¡Mi huerfanito jefe!&quot;, about a juvenile street vendor who can&#x27;t sell his final lottery ticket, which ends up being the winner and making him rich. Dancigers was open to the idea, but instead of a &quot;feuilleton&quot;, he suggested making &quot;something rather more serious&quot;. During his recent researches through the slums of Mexico City, Buñuel had read a newspaper account of a twelve-year-old boy&#x27;s body being found on a garbage dump, and this became the inspiration, and final scene, for the film, eventually called &quot;Los olvidados&quot;.
The film tells the story of a street gang of children who terrorize their impoverished neighborhood, at one point brutalizing a blind man and at another assaulting a legless man who moves around on a dolly, which they toss down a hill. Film historian Carl J. Mora has said of &quot;Los olvidados&quot; that the director &quot;visualized poverty in a radically different way from the traditional forms of Mexican melodrama. Buñuel&#x27;s street children are not &#x27;ennobled&#x27; by their desperate struggle for survival; they are in fact ruthless predators who are not better than their equally unromanticized victims&quot;. The film was made quickly (18 days) and cheaply (450,000 pesos), with Buñuel&#x27;s fee being the equivalent of $2,000. During filming, a number of members of the crew resisted the production in a variety of ways: one technician confronted Buñuel and asked why he didn&#x27;t make a &quot;real&quot; Mexican movie &quot;rather than a miserable picture like this one&quot;; the film&#x27;s hairdresser quit on the spot over a scene in which the protagonist&#x27;s mother refuses to give him food (&quot;In Mexico, no mother would say that to her son.&quot;); another staff member urged Buñuel to abandon shooting on a &quot;garbage heap&quot;, noting that there were many &quot;lovely residential neighborhoods like Las Lomas&quot; that were available; while Pedro de Urdimalas, one of the scriptwriters, refused to allow his name in the credits.
This hostility was also felt by those who attended the movie&#x27;s première in Mexico City on 9 November 1950, when &quot;Los olvidados&quot; was taken by many as an insult to Mexican sensibilities and to the Mexican nation. At one point, the audience shrieked in shock as one of the characters looked straight into the camera and hurled a rotten egg at it, leaving a gelatinous, opaque ooze on the lens for a few moments. In his memoir, Buñuel recalled that after the initial screening, the painter Frida Kahlo refused to speak to him, while poet León Felipe&#x27;s wife had to be restrained physically from attacking him. There were even calls to have Buñuel&#x27;s Mexican citizenship revoked. Dancigers, panicked by what he feared would be a complete debacle, quickly commissioned an alternate &quot;happy&quot; ending to the film, and also tacked on a preface showing stock footage of the skylines of New York City, London and Paris with voice-over commentary to the effect that behind the wealth of all the great cities of the world can be found poverty and malnourished children, and that Mexico City &quot;that large modern city, is no exception&quot;. Regardless, attendance was so poor that Dancigers withdrew the film after only three days in theaters.
Through the determined efforts of future Nobel Prize winner for Literature Octavio Paz, who at the time was in Mexico&#x27;s diplomatic service, &quot;Los olvidados&quot; was chosen to represent Mexico at the Cannes Film Festival of 1951, and Paz promoted the film assiduously by distributing a supportive manifesto and parading outside the cinema with a placard. Opinion in general was enthusiastic, with the Surrealists (Breton and poet Jacques Prévert) and other artistic intellectuals (painter Marc Chagall and poet/dramatist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau) laudatory, but the communist critic Georges Sadoul objected to what he saw as the film&#x27;s &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; because of its positive depictions of a &quot;bourgeois teacher&quot; and a &quot;bourgeois state&quot; in rehabilitating street children, as well as a scene in which the police demonstrate their utility by stopping a pederast from assaulting a child. Buñuel won the Best Director prize that year at Cannes, and also won the FIPRESCI International Critics&#x27; Award. The film was reissued in Mexico where it ran for two months to much greater acceptance and profit. &quot;Los olvidados&quot; and its triumph at Cannes made Buñuel an instant world celebrity and the most important Spanish-speaking film director in the world. In 2003, &quot;Los olvidados&quot; was inscribed by UNESCO in the Memory of the World International Register, calling it: &quot;the most important document in Spanish about the marginal lives of children in contemporary large cities&quot;.
Buñuel remained in Mexico for the rest of his life, although he spent periods of time filming in France and Spain. In Mexico, he filmed 21 films over 18 years. For many critics, although there were occasional widely acknowledged masterpieces like &quot;Los olvidados&quot; and &quot;Él&quot; (1953), the majority of his output consisted of generic fare which was adapted to the norms of the national film industry, frequently adopting melodramatic conventions that appealed to local tastes. Other commentators, however, have written of the deceptive complexity and intensity of many of these films, arguing that, collectively, they, &quot;bring a philosophical depth and power to his cinema, together offering a sustained meditation on ideas of religion, class inequity, violence and desire&quot;. Although Buñuel usually had little choice regarding the selection of these projects, they often deal with themes that were central to his lifelong concerns: 
* sexual pathology: &quot;Él&quot; (1953), &quot;Ensayo de un crimen&quot; (1955), and &quot;Abismos de pasión&quot; (1954)
*the destructive effects of rampant machismo: &quot;El Bruto&quot;, (1953), &quot;El río y la muerte&quot;, (1955); 
*the blurring of fantasy and reality: &quot;Subida al cielo&quot; (1952), &quot;La ilusión viaja en tranvía&quot; (1954); 
*the disruptive status of women in a male-dominated culture: &quot;Susana&quot; (1951), &quot;La hija del engaño&quot; (1951—a remake of the Filmófono production &quot;Don Quintín el amargao&quot; of 16 years earlier), &quot;Una mujer sin amor&quot; (1952); and
*the absurdity of the religious life: &quot;Nazarín&quot; (1959) and &quot;Simón del desierto&quot; (1965).

As busy as he was during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were still many film projects that Buñuel had to abandon due to lack of financing or studio support, including a cherished plan to film Mexican novelist Juan Rulfo&#x27;s &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, of which he said how much he enjoyed &quot;the crossing from the mysterious to the real, almost without transition. I really like this mixture of reality and fantasy, but I don&#x27;t know how to bring it to the screen.&quot; Other unrealized projects during his lifetime included adaptations of André Gide&#x27;s &quot;Les caves du Vatican&quot;; Benito Pérez Galdós&#x27;s &quot;Fortunata y Jacinta&quot;, &quot;Doña Perfecta&quot;, and &quot;Ángel Guerra&quot;; Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot;; William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;; Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;; J. K. Huysmans&#x27; &quot;Là-Bas&quot;; Matthew Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot;; José Donoso&#x27;s &quot;Lugar sin límites&quot;; a film of four stories based on Carlos Fuentes&#x27;s &quot;Aura&quot;; and Julio Cortázar&#x27;s &quot;Las ménades&quot;.

=== 1954–1965: International work ===

As much as he welcomed steady employment in the Mexican film industry, Buñuel was quick to seize opportunities to re-emerge onto the international film scene and to engage with themes that were not necessarily focused on Mexican preoccupations. His first chance came in 1954, when Dancigers partnered with Henry F. Ehrlich, of United Artists, to co-produce a film version of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, using a script developed by the Canadian writer Hugo Butler. The film was produced by George Pepper, the former executive secretary of the Hollywood Democratic Committee. Both Butler and Pepper were emigres from Hollywood who had run afoul of authorities seeking out communists. The result, &quot;Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;, was Buñuel&#x27;s first color film. Buñuel was given much more time than usual for the filming (three months), which was accomplished on location in Manzanillo, a Pacific seaport with a lush jungle interior, and was shot simultaneously in English and Spanish. When the film was released in the United States, its young star Dan O&#x27;Herlihy used his own money to fund a Los Angeles run for the film and gave free admission to all members of the Screen Actors Guild, who in turn rewarded the little-known actor with his only Oscar nomination.

In the mid-1950s, Buñuel got the chance to work again in France on international co-productions. The result was what critic Raymond Durgnat has called the director&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary triptych&quot;, in that each of the three films is &quot;openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship&quot;. The first, &quot;Cela s&#x27;appelle l&#x27;aurore&quot; (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Buñuel and the &quot;pataphysical&quot; writer Jean Ferry to adapt a novel by Emmanuel Roblès after the celebrated writer Jean Genet failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full. The second film was &quot;La Mort en ce jardin&quot; (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Buñuel and his frequent collaborator Luis Alcoriza from a novel by the Belgian writer José-André Lacour. The final part of the &quot;triptych&quot; was &quot;La Fièvre Monte à El Pao&quot; (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star Gérard Philipe, who died in the final stages of the production. At one point during the filming, Buñuel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they did not know. Buñuel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, &quot;took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn&#x27;t humiliating&quot;.

In 1960, Buñuel re-teamed with scenarist Hugo Butler and organizer George Pepper, allegedly his favorite producer, to make his second English-language film, a US/Mexico co-production called &quot;The Young One&quot;, based on a short story by writer and former CIA-agent Peter Matthiessen. This film has been called &quot;a surprisingly uncompromising study of racism and sexual desire, set on a remote island in the Deep South&quot; and has been described by critic Ed Gonzalez as &quot;salacious enough to make Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Baby Doll&quot; and Luis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; blush&quot;. Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination, the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Buñuel was later to say that &quot;a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue...I made this film with love, but it never had a chance.&quot;

At the 1960 Cannes Festival, Buñuel was approached by the young director Carlos Saura, whose film &quot;Los Golfos&quot; had been entered officially to represent Spain. Two years earlier, Saura had partnered with Juan Antonio Bardem and Luis García Berlanga to form a production company called UNINCI, and the group was keen to get Buñuel to make a new film in his native country as part of their overall goal of creating a uniquely Spanish brand of cinema. At the same time, Mexican actress Silvia Pinal was eager to work with Buñuel and talked her producer-husband Gustavo Alatriste into providing additional funding for the project with the understanding that the director, who Pinal described as &quot;a man worshiped and idolized&quot;, would be given &quot;absolute freedom&quot; in carrying out the work. Finally, Buñuel agreed to work again in Spain when further support was provided by producer Pere Portabella&#x27;s company &quot;Film 59&quot;.

Buñuel and his co-scenarist Julio Alejandro drafted a preliminary screenplay for &quot;Viridiana&quot;, which critic Andrew Sarris has described as incorporating &quot;a plot which is almost too lurid to synopsize even in these enlightened times&quot;, dealing with rape, incest, hints of necrophilia, animal cruelty and sacrilege, and submitted it to the Spanish censor, who, to the surprise of nearly everyone, approved it after requesting only minor modifications and one significant change to the ending. Although Buñuel accommodated the censor&#x27;s demands, he came up with a final scene that was even more provocative than the scene it replaced: &quot;even more immoral&quot;, as Buñuel was later to observe. Since Buñuel had more than adequate resources, top-flight technical and artistic crews, and experienced actors, filming of &quot;Viridiana&quot; (which took place on location and at Bardem&#x27;s studios in Madrid) went smoothly and quickly.

Buñuel submitted a cutting copy to the censors and then arranged for his son, Juan Luis, to smuggle the negatives to Paris for the final editing and mixing, ensuring that the authorities would not have an opportunity to view the finished product before its planned submission as Spain&#x27;s official entry to the 1961 Cannes Festival. Spain&#x27;s director general of cinematography José Muñoz-Fontán presented the film on the last day of the festival and then, on the urging of Portabella and Bardem, appeared in person to accept the top prize, the , which the film shared with the French entry &quot;Une aussi longue absence&quot;, directed by Henri Colpi. Within days, &quot;l&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, the Vatican&#x27;s official organ, denounced the film as an insult not only to Catholicism but to Christianity. Muñoz-Fontán was dismissed from his government post, the film was banned in Spain for the next 17 years, all mention of it in the press was prohibited, and the two Spanish production companies UNINCI and &quot;Film 59&quot; were disbanded.
Buñuel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, &quot;El ángel exterminador&quot; (1962) and &quot;Simón del desierto&quot; (1965) and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression.

In 1963, actor Fernando Rey, one of the stars of &quot;Viridiana&quot;, introduced Buñuel to producer Serge Silberman, a Polish entrepreneur who had fled to Paris when his family died in the Holocaust and had worked with several renowned French directors, including Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Becker, Marcel Camus and Christian-Jaque. Silberman proposed that the two make an adaptation of Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s &quot;Journal d&#x27;une femme de chambre&quot;, which Buñuel had read several times. Buñuel wanted to do the filming in Mexico with Pinal, but Silberman insisted it be done in France.

Pinal was so determined to work again with Buñuel that she was ready to move to France, learn the language and even work for nothing in order to get the part of Célestine, the title character. Silberman, however, wanted French actress Jeanne Moreau to play the role, so he put Pinal off by telling her that Moreau, too, was willing to act with no fee. Ultimately, Silberman got his way, leaving Pinal so disappointed that she was later to claim that Alatriste&#x27;s failure to help her secure this part led to the breakup of their marriage. When Buñuel requested a French-speaking writer with whom to collaborate on the screenplay, Silberman suggested the 32-year-old Jean-Claude Carrière, an actor whose previous screenwriting credits included only a few films for the comic star/director Pierre Étaix, but once Buñuel learned that Carrière was the heir to a wine-growing family, the newcomer was hired on the spot. At first, Carrière found it difficult to work with Buñuel, because the young man was so deferential that he never challenged any of Buñuel&#x27;s ideas, until, at Buñuel&#x27;s covert insistence, Silberman told Carrière to stand up to Buñuel now and then; as Carrière was later to say: &quot;In a way, Buñuel needed an opponent. He didn&#x27;t need a secretary – he needed someone to contradict him and oppose him and to make suggestions.&quot; The finished 1964 film, &quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot;, became the first of several to be made by the team of Buñuel, Carrière and Silberman. Carrière later said &quot;Without me and without Serge Silberman, the producer, perhaps Buñuel would not have made so many films after he was 65. We really encouraged him to work. That&#x27;s for sure.&quot; 
This was the second filmed version of Mirbeau&#x27;s novel, the first being a 1946 Hollywood production directed by Jean Renoir, which Buñuel refused to view for fear of being influenced by the famous French director, whom he venerated. Buñuel&#x27;s version, while admired by many, has often been compared unfavorably to Renoir&#x27;s, with a number of critics claiming that Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; fits better in Renoir&#x27;s overall &quot;oeuvre&quot;, while Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; is not sufficiently &quot;Buñuelian&quot;.

After the 1964 release of &quot;Diary&quot;, Buñuel again tried to make a film of Matthew Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Monk&quot;, a project on which he had worked, on and off, since 1938, according to producer Pierre Braunberger. He and Carrière wrote a screenplay, but were unable to obtain funding, which was realized in 1973 under the direction of Buñuel devotee Ado Kyrou, with considerable assistance from both Buñuel and Carrière.

In 1965, Buñuel managed to work again with Silvia Pinal in what was his last Mexican feature, co-starring Claudio Brook, &quot;Simón del desierto&quot;. Pinal was keenly interested in continuing to work with Buñuel, trusting him completely and frequently stating that he brought out the best in her; however, this was their last collaboration.

=== 1966–1983: Acclaim and final films ===
In 1966, Buñuel was contacted by the Hakim brothers, Robert and Raymond, Egyptian-French producers who specialized in sexy films directed by star filmmakers, who offered him the opportunity to direct a film version of Joseph Kessel&#x27;s novel &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;, a book about an affluent young woman who leads a double life as a prostitute, and that had caused a scandal upon its first publication in 1928. Buñuel did not like Kessel&#x27;s novel, considering it &quot;a bit of a soap opera&quot;, but he took on the challenge because: &quot;I found it interesting to try to turn something I didn&#x27;t like into something I did.&quot; So he and Carrière set out enthusiastically to interview women in the brothels of Madrid to learn about their sexual fantasies. Buñuel also was not happy about the choice of the 22-year-old Catherine Deneuve for the title role, feeling that she had been foisted upon him by the Hakim brothers and Deneuve&#x27;s lover at the time, director François Truffaut. As a result, both actress and director found working together difficult, with Deneuve claiming, &quot;I felt they showed more of me than they&#x27;d said they were going to. There were moments when I felt totally used. I was very unhappy,&quot; and Buñuel deriding her prudery on the set. The resulting film has been described by film critic Roger Ebert as &quot;possibly the best-known erotic film of modern times, perhaps the best&quot;, even though, as another critic has written, &quot;in terms of explicit sexual activity, there is little in &quot;Belle de jour&quot; we might not see in a Doris Day comedy from the same year&quot;. It was Buñuel&#x27;s most successful film at the box office.

Critics have noted Buñuel&#x27;s habit of following up a commercial or critical success with a more personal, idiosyncratic film that might have less chance of popular esteem.

After the worldwide success of his 1967 &quot;Belle de jour&quot;, and upon viewing Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;La Chinoise&quot;, Buñuel, who had wanted to make a film about Catholic heresies for years, told Carrière: &quot;If that is what today&#x27;s cinema is like, then we can make a film about heresies.&quot; The two spent months researching Catholic history and created the 1969 film &quot;The Milky Way&quot;, a &quot;picaresque road film&quot; that tells the story of two vagabonds on pilgrimage to the tomb of the Apostle James at Santiago de Compostela, during which they travel through time and space to take part in situations illustrating heresies that arose from the six major Catholic dogmas. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, compared it to George Stevens&#x27; blockbuster &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, in that Buñuel had made a film about Jesus casting nearly all the famous French performers of the time in cameo roles. &quot;The Milky Way&quot; was banned in Italy, only to have the Catholic Church intervene on its behalf.

The 1970 film &quot;Tristana&quot; is a film about a young woman who is seduced and manipulated by her guardian, who attempts to thwart her romance with a young artist and who eventually induces her to marry him after she loses one of her legs due to a tumor. It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Buñuel&#x27;s films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a &quot;consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement&quot;. Buñuel had wanted to make a film of Benito Pérez Galdós&#x27; novel &quot;Tristana&quot; as early as 1952, even though he considered Galdós&#x27; book the author&#x27;s weakest. After finishing &quot;Viridiana&quot; and in the wake of the scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor turned down this project, and Buñuel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Época Films. The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged dueling, so Buñuel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Buñuel&#x27;s choosing: Franco Nero and Catherine Deneuve. On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Buñuel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, &quot;but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot. &quot;Tristana&quot; is one of my favorite films. Personally, as an actress, I prefer &quot;Tristana&quot; to &quot;Belle de Jour&quot;.&quot;

The germ of the idea for their next film together, &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (1972) came from Buñuel and Silberman discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life; Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes. The film tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot;, where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal. For this film, Buñuel, Silberman and Carrière assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, &quot;a veritable rogues&#x27; gallery of French art-house cinema&quot;, according to one critic. For the first time, Buñuel made use of a video-playback monitor, which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots. Filming required only two months and Buñuel claimed that editing took only one day. When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it won, leading Buñuel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of &quot;2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio&quot;.

As was his habit, Buñuel took advantage of the popular success of &quot;Discreet Charm&quot; to make one of the &quot;puzzling, idiosyncratic films he &quot;really&quot; wanted to make&quot;. In 1973, at the Monastery of Paular in the Spanish Somosierra, he wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Phantom of Liberty&quot; (1974) with Carrière for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners. The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay-race manner. Buñuel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet Benjamin Péret, a founding member of French Surrealism, and called it his &quot;most Surrealist film&quot;.

Buñuel&#x27;s final film was &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot; (1977), adapted by Buñuel and Carrière from an 1898 novel by Pierre Louÿs called &quot;La Femme et le pantin&quot;, which had already been used as the basis of films directed by Josef von Sternberg (&quot;The Devil is a Woman&quot;, 1935) and Julien Duvivier (&quot;La Femme et le Pantin&quot;, 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor Fernando Rey, appearing in his fourth Buñuel film. Initially, the part of the young woman was to be played by Maria Schneider, who had achieved international fame for her roles in &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; and &quot;The Passenger&quot;, but once shooting started, according to Carrière, her drug usage resulted in a &quot;lackluster and dull&quot; performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Buñuel on the set and her eventual dismissal. Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Buñuel to continue shooting with two different actresses, Ángela Molina and Carole Bouquet playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Buñuel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: &quot;If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless&quot;. Others have reported that Carrière had first broached the idea while developing the film&#x27;s scenario, but had been brushed off by Buñuel as &quot;the whim of a rainy day&quot;.

After the release of &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot;, Buñuel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carrière) his autobiography, &quot;Mon Dernier Soupir&quot; (translated into English as &quot;My Last Sigh&quot; in the U.S., &quot;My Last Breath&quot; in the UK), which provides an account of his life, friends, and family as well as a representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as Pablo Picasso and Charlie Chaplin as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town.

==Personal life==
Starting at the age of 17, Buñuel steadily dated the future poet and dramatist Concha Méndez, with whom he vacationed every summer at San Sebastián. He introduced her to his friends at the Residencia as his fiancée. After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;insufferable character&quot;.

During his student years, Buñuel became an accomplished hypnotist. He claimed that once, while calming a hysterical prostitute through hypnotic suggestion, he inadvertently put one of the several bystanders into a trance as well. He was often to insist that watching movies was a form of hypnosis: &quot;This kind of cinematographic hypnosis is no doubt due to the darkness of the theatre and to the rapidly changing scenes, lights, and camera movements, which weaken the spectator&#x27;s critical intelligence and exercise over him a kind of fascination.&quot; Referring to Buñuel&#x27;s interest in hypnosis, Anthony Lane wrote, &quot;You can easily picture yourself being hypnotized by this man; sit through a sample of his movies, and you will think you have been.&quot;

=== Marriage ===
In 1926 he met his future wife, Jeanne Rucar Lefebvre, a gymnastics teacher who had won a bronze medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Buñuel courted her in a formal Aragonese manner, complete with a chaperone, and they married in 1934 despite a warning by Jean Epstein when Buñuel first proposed in 1930: &quot;Jeanne, you are making a mistake...It&#x27;s not right for you, don&#x27;t marry him.&quot; The two remained married throughout his life and had two sons, Juan Luis and Rafael. Diego Buñuel, filmmaker and host of the National Geographic Channel&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell My Mother&quot; series, is their grandson.

=== Illness and death ===
In his seventies, Buñuel once told his friend, novelist Carlos Fuentes: &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid of death. I&#x27;m afraid of dying alone in a hotel room, with my bags open and a shooting script on the night table. I must know whose fingers will close my eyes.&quot; According to his wife, Jeanne, Buñuel died in Mexico City in 1983 from diabetes complications. Fuentes has recounted that Buñuel spent his last week in hospital discussing theology with the Jesuit brother Julián Pablo Fernández, a long time friend. His funeral was very private, involving only family and close friends, among them poets Octavio Paz and Homero Aridjis.

==Technique and influences==

Buñuel&#x27;s technique of filmmaking was strongly influenced by mise-en-scène, sound editing and use of music. The influences on his filmmaking have included a positive relationship to surrealism and a critical approach to atheism and religion. Buñuel&#x27;s style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in &quot;Tristana&quot; where Catherine Deneuve exposes her breasts to Saturno – but not the audience – being a noted exception) and shooting as much as possible in order to minimize editing time. He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928: &quot;The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time—in a word, the film—was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker&quot;. In this, Buñuel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, because each man knew, in Buñuel&#x27;s words, &quot;exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be&quot;. According to actress Jeanne Moreau: &quot;He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said &#x27;action&#x27; and &#x27;cut,&#x27; you knew that what was in between the two would be printed.&quot;

Buñuel is often cited as an auteur; Ingmar Bergman once wrote &quot;Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films&quot;. Despite his variety, John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel&#x27;s work &quot;the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive&quot;. David Thomson names him as one of the greatest directors, adding &quot;He is as intent on comedy as Kafka was, as little intent on showing off style, and as much a victim as the joke he tells.&quot;

== Retrospectives ==

* In 1994, a retrospective of Buñuel&#x27;s works was organized by the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle in Bonn, as homage to one of the most internationally revered figures in world cinema. This was followed in the summer of 1996 by a commemoration of the centenary of the birth of cinema held by the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, which included a unique retrospective, jointly sponsored by the King of Spain and the President of Mexico, called &quot;¿Buñuel!. La mirada del siglo&quot;, honoring his special status as Spanish cinema&#x27;s most emblematic figure.

<doc id="169036" wikidata="Q7539010" url="?curid=169036" title="Slaughter-House Cases">
<text>The Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision which ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution only protects the legal rights that are associated with federal U.S. citizenship, not those that pertain to state citizenship. Though the decision in the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; minimized the impact of the Privileges or Immunities Clause on state law, the Supreme Court would later incorporate the Bill of Rights to strike down state laws on the basis of other clauses. In 2010, the Court rejected arguments in &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot; to overrule the established precedent of &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; and decided instead to incorporate the Second Amendment via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Seeking to improve sanitary conditions, the Louisiana legislature and the city of New Orleans had established a corporation charged with regulating the slaughterhouse industry. Members of the Butchers&#x27; Benevolent Association challenged the constitutionality of the corporation, claiming that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment had been ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War with the primary intention of protecting civil rights of millions of newly emancipated freedmen in the Southern United States, but the butchers argued that the amendment protected their right to &quot;sustain their lives through labor&quot;.

In the majority opinion written by Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller, the Court held to a narrower interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment than the plaintiffs urged, ruling that it did not restrict the police powers exercised by Louisiana because the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only those rights guaranteed by the United States, not individual states. In effect, the clause was interpreted to convey limited protection pertinent to a small minority of rights, such as the right to seek federal office.

In a dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Stephen J. Field wrote that Miller&#x27;s opinion effectively rendered the Fourteenth Amendment a &quot;vain and idle enactment&quot;.

==Background==

One writer described New Orleans in the mid-nineteenth century as plagued by &quot;intestines and portions of putrefied animal matter lodged [around the drinking pipes]&quot; whenever the tide from the Mississippi River was low; the offal came from the city&#x27;s slaughterhouses. A mile and a half upstream from the city, 1,000 butchers gutted more than 300,000 animals per year. Animal entrails (known as offal), dung, blood, and urine contaminated New Orleans&#x27;s drinking water, which was implicated in cholera and yellow fever outbreaks among the population.

To try to control the problem, a New Orleans grand jury recommended that the slaughterhouses be moved south, but since many of the slaughterhouses were outside city limits, the grand jury&#x27;s recommendations carried no weight. The city appealed to the state legislature. As a result, in 1869, the Louisiana legislature passed &quot;An Act to Protect the Health of the City of New Orleans, to Locate the Stock Landings and Slaughter Houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughter-House Company&quot;, which allowed the city of New Orleans to create a corporation that centralized all slaughterhouse operations in the city. At the time, New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia had similar provisions to confine butchers&#x27; establishments to particular areas in order to keep offal from contaminating the water supply.

The legislature chartered a private corporation, the Crescent City Live-Stock Landing and Slaughter-House Company, to run a Grand Slaughterhouse at the southern part of the city, opposite the Mississippi River. Crescent City would not slaughter beef itself but act as a franchise corporation, by renting out space to other butchers in the city for a fee, under a designated maximum.

The statute also granted &quot;sole and exclusive privilege of conducting and carrying on the livestock landing and slaughterhouse business within the limits and privilege granted by the act, and that all such animals shall be landed at the stock landings and slaughtered at the slaughterhouses of the company, and nowhere else. Penalties are enacted for infractions of this provision, and prices fixed for the maximum charges of the company for each steamboat and for each animal landed&quot;. The exclusivity would last for a period of 25 years. All other slaughterhouses would be closed up, forcing butchers to slaughter within the operation set up by Crescent City. The statute forbade Crescent City from favoring one butcher over another by promising harsh penalties for refusal to sell space to any butcher. All animals on the premises would be inspected by an officer appointed by the governor of the state.

Over 400 members of the Butchers&#x27; Benevolent Association joined to sue to stop Crescent City&#x27;s takeover of the slaughterhouse industry. In the background of his majority opinion, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Freeman Miller reiterated the concerns of the butchers:

The lower courts had found in favor of Crescent City in all cases.

Six cases were appealed to the Supreme Court. The butchers based their claims on the due process, privileges or immunities, and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had been ratified by the states five years earlier. It had been passed with the intention of protecting the civil rights of the millions of newly emancipated freedmen in the South, who had been granted citizenship in the United States.

The butchers&#x27; attorney, former Supreme Court Justice John Archibald Campbell, who had retired from the federal bench because of his Confederate loyalties, represented persons in a number of cases in New Orleans to obstruct Radical Reconstruction. Although the Fourteenth Amendment was passed mainly to protect the freedmen in the South, the language of Section 1 is not racially limited. Campbell used it to argue for a new, broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, in order to allow butchers of any race to &quot;sustain their lives through labor&quot;.

==Decision==
On April 14, 1873, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision in favor of the slaughterhouse company upholding the constitutionality of Louisiana&#x27;s use of its police powers to regulate butchers.

===Opinion of the Court===

Five justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by justice Samuel Freeman Miller. Miller framed the Court&#x27;s opinion around the notion that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments were primarily meant to protect former black slaves.
With this view of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments&#x27; purposes, the Court interpreted their protections very narrowly. First, the Court rejected the butchers&#x27; Equal Protection Clause arguments, saying that it &quot;doubt[ed] very much&quot; that the clause would ever prohibit anything other than state laws discriminating against black people as a class. Next, the Court rejected the butchers&#x27; Due Process Clause arguments, saying that &quot;under no construction of [the Due Process Clause] that we have ever seen, or any that we deem admissible&quot;, could the state&#x27;s restrictions on the butchers&#x27; work constitute a &quot;deprivation of property&quot; under the Due Process Clause.

The Court then turned to the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which it viewed just as narrowly as it had the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Court held that protecting people from state government actions was not the Privileges or Immunities Clause&#x27;s purpose, and that the clause was never meant to be a basis on which courts could strike down state laws. 

Having adopted this narrow interpretation, the Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause only protects rights that pertain to federal U.S. citizenship, not state citizenship. This interpretation meant that the Privileges or Immunities Clause did not protect Americans&#x27; broad rights as citizens of their individual states, which Miller said &quot;embrace[d] nearly every civil right for the establishment and protection of which organized government is instituted&quot;.

The Court derived this state-federal citizenship distinction from Miller&#x27;s reading of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Citizenship Clause, which had conferred national U.S. citizenship upon freed black slaves and superseded the Court&#x27;s 1857 decision &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Miller accepted that Article IV of the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s original Privileges and Immunities Clause, on which the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Privileges or Immunities Clause had been modeled, protected Americans&#x27; broad state rights. But Miller said the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s language was distinguishable from the Article IV clause. Miller wrote—misquoting the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s text—that the Privileges or Immunities Clause &quot;speaks only of privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and does not speak of those of citizens of the several states&quot;. He concluded that &quot;the entire domain of the privileges and immunities of the states ... lay within the constitutional and legislative power of the states, and without that of the Federal government&quot;.

Miller wrote that the Court was not required to define all the &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; of federal citizenship, but listed ones such as the right to petition the U.S. Congress, the right to vote in federal elections, the right to engage in interstate travel and commerce, the right to enter federal lands, and several others such as &quot;the right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances&quot; and &quot;the privilege of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;&quot;. Miller dispensed with any further listing of U.S. federal citizenship rights, saying that the Court was &quot;of the opinion that the rights claimed by [the New Orleans butchers], if they have any existence, are not privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States within the meaning of the [Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]&quot;.

===Dissents===

Four justices dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision, and three of them wrote dissenting opinions.

Justice Stephen J. Field protested that Miller&#x27;s narrow reading of the Fourteenth Amendment rendered it &quot;a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage&quot;. Field accepted Campbell&#x27;s reading of the amendment as not confined to protection of freed slaves but embracing the common law presumption in favor of an individual right to pursue a legitimate occupation. Field&#x27;s reading of the due process clause of the amendment would prevail in future cases in which the court read the amendment broadly to protect personal interests against hostile state laws.

Justice Joseph P. Bradley&#x27;s dissent disagreed with the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the rights protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause. He listed many rights found in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights amendments, such as the rights to trial by jury, free exercise of religion, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Bradley concluded: &quot;These, and still others are specified in the Constitution or in early amendments of it, as among the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or, what is still stronger for the force of the argument, the rights of all persons, whether citizens or not.&quot;

Justice Noah H. Swayne&#x27;s dissent criticized the Court&#x27;s rejection of the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment and its Privileges or Immunities Clause had been intended to transform American government. Speaking of the Court&#x27;s objection that a broad reading of the Clause would make it a &quot;perpetual censor&quot; on state governments, Swayne said that Congress and the states had been aware of that when they adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. 
==Subsequent developments==
The victory of the Crescent City Company survived for only 11 years. By 1879, the State of Louisiana had adopted a new constitution prohibiting the state&#x27;s ability to grant slaughterhouse monopolies, devolving regulation of cattle slaughter to parishes and municipalities, and banning the subordinate governmental units from granting monopoly rights over such activities. Having essentially lost its monopoly protection, the Crescent City Co. sued. That case ended in &quot;Butchers&#x27; Union Co. v. Crescent City Co.&quot; (1884), with the Supreme Court holding that Crescent City Co. did not have a contract with the state and so that revocation of the monopoly privilege was not a violation of the Contract Clause.

==Analysis==
The &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; essentially &quot;gutted&quot; the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The American scholar Edward Samuel Corwin remarked: &quot;Unique among constitutional provisions, the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment enjoys the distinction of having been rendered a practical nullity by a single decision of the Supreme Court rendered within five years after its ratification.&quot;

In 2001, the American legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar wrote of the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot;: &quot;Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and center—thinks that the decision is a plausible reading of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.&quot; This view was echoed by historian Eric Foner, who wrote &quot;[T]he Court&#x27;s ... studied distinction between the privileges deriving from state and national citizenship should have been seriously doubted by anyone who read the Congressional debates of the 1860s&quot;.

Kevin Gutzman, an American constitutional scholar and historian, argues that the Fourteenth Amendment was originally meant to protect only &quot;specifically federal rights&quot; and describes the later, broader interpretation of the Amendment as &quot;the Court&#x27;s [use of] the Fourteenth Amendment to claim a capacious national judicial authority&quot;. Gutzman believes that &quot;legal academics despise the &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; decision because they &quot;do&quot; think the federal courts should be &#x27;a perpetual censor upon all legislation in the States.

<doc id="169038" wikidata="Q1776475" url="?curid=169038" title="John Deere (inventor)">
<text>John Deere (February 7, 1804 – May 17, 1886) was an American blacksmith, businessman, inventor and politician. He founded Deere &amp; Company, one of the largest and leading agricultural and construction-equipment manufacturers in the world. Born in Rutland, Vermont, Deere moved to Illinois and invented the first commercially successful steel plow in 1837.

==Early life==
John Deere was born on February 7, 1804, in Rutland, Vermont, the third son of William Rinold Deere, a merchant tailor, and Sarah Yeats. After a brief educational period at Middlebury College, at age 17 in 1821, he began an apprenticeship with Captain Benjamin Lawrence, a successful Middlebury blacksmith, and entered the trade for himself in 1826. He married Demarius Lamb in 1827 and fathered nine children.

Their daughter Alice Maria married Merton Yale Cady, grandson of Linus Yale Sr. of the Yale Lock Company, and was the proprietor of Alderney Hill Farm, formerly Mr. John Deere&#x27;s blooded-stock farm. They were the grandparents of Jane Mabel Skinner, wife of Warren Crandall Giles, president of the National League and Cincinnati Reds, and parents of William Yale Giles, co-proprietor of the Philadelphia Phillies.

Deere worked in Burlington before opening his own shops, first in Vergennes, and then in Leicester. In 1836, Deere left Vermont due to hard times and followed Leonard Andrus, a business associate, to Illinois.

==Steel plow==
John Deere settled in Grand Detour, Illinois. At the time, Deere had no difficulty finding work due to a lack of blacksmiths working in the area. Deere found that cast-iron plows were not working very well in the tough prairie soil of Illinois and remembered the needles he had previously polished by running them through sand as he grew up in his father&#x27;s tailor shop in Rutland. Deere came to the conclusion that a plow made out of highly polished steel and a correctly shaped moldboard (the self-scouring steel plow) would be better able to handle the soil conditions of the prairie, especially its sticky clay.

Varying versions serve as the inspiration for Deere&#x27;s famous steel plow. In one version, he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that same effect could be obtained for a plow. Another version is that he used an old sawblade that had been polished from years of use.

In 1837, Deere developed and manufactured the first commercially successful cast-steel plow. The wrought-iron framed plow had a polished steel share. This made it ideal for the tough soil of the Midwest and worked better than other plows. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall, who quickly spread word of his success with Deere&#x27;s plow. Subsequently, two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841, Deere was manufacturing 75–100 plows per year.

In 1843, Deere partnered with Leonard Andrus to produce more plows to keep up with demand, but the partnership became strained due to the two men&#x27;s stubbornness. While Deere wished to sell to customers outside Grand Detour, Andrus opposed a proposed railroad through Grand Detour. Also, there was Deere&#x27;s distrust of Andrus&#x27; accounting practices. In 1848, Deere dissolved the partnership with Andrus and moved to Moline, Illinois, because the city was a transportation hub on the Mississippi River. By 1855, Deere&#x27;s factory sold more than 10,000 such plows. It became known as &quot;The Plow that Broke the Plains&quot; and is commemorated as such in a historic place marker in Vermont.

Deere insisted on making high-quality equipment. He once said, &quot;I will never put my name on a product that does not have in it the best that is in me.&quot; Following the Panic of 1857, as business improved, Deere left the day-to-day operations to his son Charles. In 1868, Deere incorporated his business as Deere &amp; Company.

==Later life==
Later in life, Deere focused most of his attention on civil and political affairs. He served as president of the National Bank of Moline, as a director of the Moline Free Public Library, and was a trustee of the First Congregational Church. Deere also served as Moline&#x27;s mayor for two years but due to chest pains and dysentery Deere refused to run for a second term. In 1875, he acquired, expanded and modernized the house now known as John Deere House. He died at home, named by him Red Cliff, on May 17, 1886, at the age of 82.

<doc id="169042" wikidata="Q17112919" url="?curid=169042" title="Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander">
<text>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which two out-of-state corporations objected to &quot;ad valorem&quot; taxes imposed upon accounts receivable derived from goods manufactured in Ohio, though these accounts were not used in conducting business in Ohio. The court ruled that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

==Background==
Wheeling Steel Corp., incorporated in Delaware was authorized to do business in Ohio, and maintained four of its eight manufacturing plants in Ohio. Wheeling&#x27;s general offices were/are in Wheeling, West Virginia and had sales offices in twelve other states, including Ohio. All accounts were billed and collected from the corporation&#x27;s main office in Wheeling, West Virginia.

National Distillers Products Corporation was incorporated in Virginia and maintained its principal place of business in New York. National Distillers was admitted to do business in Ohio and maintained both a distillery and a warehouse in Ohio, as well as maintaining distilleries and warehouses in six other states. National Distillers operated its payroll through the local offices and conducted all other fiscal affairs from its office in New York. National Distillers did not maintain a sales office in Ohio; orders from Ohio were forwarded to the office in New York for approval.

Both appellants paid all taxes required to do business in Ohio, all taxes on real and personal property in Ohio, and all franchise taxes. Additionally, Wheeling paid &quot;ad valorem&quot; taxes to West Virginia on all accounts receivable, including on those accounts receivable taxed by Ohio, pursuant to &quot;Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox&quot;, 298 US 193. National Distillers&#x27; accounts receivable were taxed by neither Virginia nor New York.

The Ohio Tax Commissioner assessed &quot;ad valorem&quot; taxes on accounts receivable derived from shipments originating from Ohio manufacturing plants belonging to Wheeling Steel Corporation and National Distillers Products Corporation on the grounds that such accounts &quot;result from the sale of property from a stock of goods maintained within the state.&quot; The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed both assessments.

Both appellants appealed the Tax Board&#x27;s decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the tax in both cases, which were then brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Opinion of the Court==
The court held that the &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax assessed against the accounts receivable of these corporations violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The court declined to address the issue of whether Ohio violated the Due Process Clause in assessing this tax. The court pointed out that Ohio was not required to admit these foreign corporations to do business within Ohio, and could have limited the terms that these corporations could conduct business within Ohio, so long as any limits did not violate rights derived from the Constitution. Instead, Ohio chose to admit these corporations to conduct business in Ohio, a privilege that these corporations paid taxes to secure and maintain. Because Ohio chose to domesticate these foreign corporations, these corporations became entitled to equal protection with all other domestic corporations established under Ohio law. Ohio&#x27;s &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax impermissibly discriminates between domestic and foreign corporations, denying appellants equal protection under Ohio law.

==Dissent==
Mr. Justice Douglas is troubled by the notion that corporations are to be classified as people for the purpose of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause. The dissent points out that other clauses in the Constitution that refer to people or persons do not apply to corporations. To read that a reference to persons in the Equal Protection Clause includes corporations as persons is inconsistent and should not be presumed.

<text>Proailurus is an extinct felid genus that lived in Europe and Asia approximately 25–30.8 million years ago in the Late Oligocene and Miocene. Fossils have been found in Mongolia, Germany, and Spain.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Proailurus&quot; comes from the Greek , meaning &#x27;before&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;cat&#x27;. The specific name of &quot;P. bourbonnensis&quot; simply means &quot;from the Bourbonnais&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Proailurus lemanensis&quot; was a compact and small animal, just a little larger than the domestic cat, weighing about 20 lb (9 kg). It had a long tail, large eyes and sharp claws and teeth, with similar proportions to the modern viverrids. Its claws would have been retractable to some extent. Like the viverrids, &quot;Proailurus&quot; was at least partially arboreal.

&quot;Proailurus major&quot; is estimated to have been significantly larger, about 23 kg. The p4 tooth is stronger and the m1 is less elongated than in &quot;P. lemanensis&quot;.

&quot;Proailurus bourbonnensis&quot; was a smaller species, estimated to have been 7–10 kg. Of the teeth, the p1 is wholly missing, and the m1 was slightly less elongated and the m2 less reduced than in &quot;P. lemanensis&quot;.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Proailurus&quot; was first described by Henri Filhol in 1879 for fossils found in the Saint-Gerand site in France. He named two species, &quot;Proailurus lemanensis&quot;, based on a mandible, and &quot;Proailurus julieni&quot;. However, &quot;P. julieni&quot; was later placed in the genus &quot;Stenogale&quot;.

In 1882, Filhol described a third species, &quot;Proailurus medius&quot;. In 1888, Schlosser made &quot;&quot;P.&quot; medius&quot; the type species of the genus &quot;Haplogale&quot;. &quot;Haplogale media&quot;&#x27;s placement was later confirmed by Robert Hunt&#x27;s 1998 studies of aeluroid skulls.

In 1999, Peigné carried out a systematic review of the genus, naming another two species, &quot;P. bourbonnensis&quot; and &quot;P. major&quot;, in the process. &quot;P. major&quot; was based on a single specimen, a left mandible from Quercy and Mainz, while &quot;P. bourbonnensis&quot; was based on a number of lower mandibles and teeth, as well as a left maxilla.

==Distribution and species==
Fossils of &quot;Proailurus lemanensis&quot; were first found in Saint-Gerand and later in Quercy. Robert Hunt, while measuring fragmentary fossils from Hasanda-Gol in Mongolia, placed a lower jaw fragment as &quot;Proailurus&quot; sp., but Peigne placed the fragment in nimravid genus &quot;Eofelis&quot; instead, which later authors supported, although at least one suggested the fragment could be assigned to &quot;Pseudaelurus cuspidatus&quot; instead.

&quot;P. major&quot; and &quot;P. bourbonnensis&quot; are both known from a single locality each: &quot;P. major&quot; from Saint-Gérand-le-Puy and &quot;P. bourbonnensis&quot; from Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, Weisbaden-Amoneburg, and Budenheim (where it is the only &quot;Proailurus&quot; species known from the Mainz Basin).

Several fossils believed to be &quot;Proailurus&quot;-grade material have been found in North America, including the Ginn Quarry cat, known from a complete skull, which has dentition similar to &quot;Proailurus lemanensis&quot; but with a slightly larger skull. Robert Hunt also noted several specimens that he believed belonged to &quot;Proailurus&quot;-grade felids, including a pair from the Sheep Creek site in Nebraska, one a lynx-sized felid, the other closer in size to a leopard; another individual from an East Cuyumungue locality, possibly the same species as the larger Sheep Creek specimen; and another specimen from Echo Quarry. However, the larger Sheep Creek specimen, the East Cuyumungue individual, and the Echo Quarry specimen were all described and assigned to the species &quot;Hyperailurictis validus&quot; in 2001, and the smaller Sheep Creek material to &quot;Pseudaelurus skinneri&quot; in 2003. The Ginn Quarry cat was described, but not assigned to any taxa, in 2019; though the authors did state that &quot;it should not be dismissed as a &#x27;proailurine-grade&#x27; felid&quot; and suggested placing it in &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot; (despite being considerably older than any known &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot;) or a new genus.

==Evolution==
&quot;Proailurus&quot; is believed to have evolved from earlier ailuroid carnivorans such as &quot;Stenogale&quot; and &quot;Haplogale&quot;. It is a likely ancestor of &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;, which lived 20–10 million years ago, and probably gave rise to the major felid lines, including the extinct machairodontines and the extant felines and pantherines, although the phylogeny of the cats is still not precisely known.

&quot;Proailurus&quot; is largely considered to be the first &quot;true&quot; cat and the ancestor of the entire cat family. Most studies support this, placing &quot;Proailurus&quot; as the basal member of the Felidae. One 2005 phylogeny placed it as a basal member of the Feliformia, but later studies do not support this.

<text>Pseudaelurus is a prehistoric cat that lived in Europe, Asia and North America in the Miocene between approximately twenty and eight million years ago. It is considered to be a paraphyletic grade ancestral to living felines and pantherines as well as the extinct machairodonts (saber-tooths), and is a successor to &quot;Proailurus&quot;. It originated from Eurasia and was the first cat to reach North America, when it entered the continent at about 18.5 Ma ending a &#x27;cat-gap&#x27; of 7 million years. The slender proportions of the animal, together with its short, viverrid-like legs, suggest that it may have been an agile climber of trees.

==Species and distribution==
&quot;Pseudaelurus quadridentatus&quot; weighed about and was approximately the size of a cougar. 

&quot;Pseudaelurus guangheensis&quot; from the middle Miocene of Gansu (China) and &quot;Pseudaelurus cuspidatus&quot; from the middle Miocene of Xinjiang (China) are reported.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
Traditionally, all the &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;-grade species from Europe, Asia, and North America have been assigned to a single genus, even though the paraphyletic nature of the group has often been noted. Several authorities have split &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; into separate genera or subgenera, including &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot;, &quot;Styriofelis&quot;, &quot;Miopanthera&quot; and &quot;Schizailurus&quot;. These different groups of &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;-grade felids are often considered to have given rise to later felid lineages.

The genus &quot;Styriofelis&quot; was originally proposed in 1929 by Kretzoi for the species &quot;Pseudaelurus turnaeunsis&quot;. Kretzoi also proposed the genus &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot; for the North American species &quot;Pseudaelurus intrepidus&quot;, and &quot;Miopanthera&quot; for &quot;Ps. lorteti&quot;. In 1964, Beaumont elaborated on Kretzoi&#x27;s proposal and split &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; into three separate genera: &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; for the European &quot;Ps. quadridentatus&quot;, &quot;Schizailurus&quot; for &quot;Ps. lorteti&quot;, and &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot; for &quot;Ps. intrepidus&quot;.

===Taxonomic history===
In 1843, the paleontologist H.M. de Blainville published a description of a felid cranium and lower jaw fragment from Sansan, France. He assigned these fossils to a new species, &quot;Felis quadridentata&quot;. The cranium was later reassigned to another species, but in 1850 the lower jaw fragment was assigned to a new genus by Paul Gervais as &quot;Pseudaelurus quadridentatus&quot;, due to having certain primitive features.

In 1858, Joseph Leidy described the species &quot;Felis intrepidus&quot;, from North America, and reassigned the species as &quot;Pseudaelurus intrepidus&quot; in 1869. After that discovery, another eight species of &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; would be described in North America, but only five are still considered valid.

In 1872, Henri Filhol described the species &quot;Pseudaelurus edwardsi&quot; from France, but the species was reassigned to the nimravid genus &quot;Eofelis&quot; in 2000.

In 1882, a second species from Europe was described as &quot;Pseudaelurus turauensis&quot;, and a third species, &quot;Pseudaelurus lorteti&quot;, in 1899. The fourth European species, &quot;Pseudaelurus romieviensis&quot;, was described in 1934. In addition, the species &quot;Pseudaelurus transitorius&quot; was described in 1892, but most later authors considered it a synonym of &quot;P. turnaeunsis&quot;.

In 1914, fossils from Africa were described and assigned to the species &quot;Pseudaelurus africanus&quot;. However, the species was later reassigned, first to the genus &quot;Metailurus&quot;, and then finally to &quot;Afrosmilus&quot;.

In Asia, the first description of &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; was in 1910, when a fragmentary fossil was assigned to &quot;Pseudaelurus chinjiensis&quot;; however, it was reassigned in 1915 to the new genus &quot;Sivaelurus&quot;. The next appearance of &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;-grade felids in Asia wasn&#x27;t until 1986, when a lower jaw fragment and some dental fragments were assigned to the species &quot;Pseudaelurus lorteti&quot;. In 1990, the species &quot;Pseudaelurus guangheensis&quot; was described. In 1998, a second Asian species, &quot;Pseudaelurus cuspidatus&quot;, was also described. Both of the Asian species are known only from fragmentary fossils.

In 1998, while measuring fragmentary fossils from the Hsanda-Gol locality in Mongolia, Robert Hunt referred a lower jaw fragment to &quot;Proailurus&quot; sp.; while this was reassigned to the nimravid genus &quot;Eofelis&quot; in 1999 instead, a 2004 review of felid material from other localities in Mongolia suggested that it could belong to &quot;Pseudaelurus cuspidatus&quot; instead, on basis of having similar features. However, the Hsanda-Gol specimen is dated back to the Oligocene, while &quot;Pseudaelurus cuspidatus&quot; is found solely in Miocene-aged localities. The same paper also described a pair of fragments (a lower jaw fragment and a metapodial) and attributed them to &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; sp.

In 2010, a review of the Felidae as a whole suggested that &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; be split into three genera: &quot;Hyperailurictis&quot; for the five North American species, &quot;Styriofelis&quot; for two of the European species (&quot;P. lorteti&quot; and &quot;P. turnaunensis&quot;), and &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; for &quot;P. quadridentatus&quot;. The status of &quot;P. romieviensis&quot;, &quot;P. guangheensis&quot;, and &quot;P. cuspidatus&quot; was given as uncertain. In addition, &quot;Miopanthera&quot; and &quot;Schizailurus&quot; were recognized as junior synonyms of &quot;Styriofelis&quot;.

In 2012, a new species &quot;Styriofelis vallesiensis&quot; was described based on a specimen found in Spain. However, a review of the species in 2017 concluded that it was sufficiently different from other &quot;Styriofelis&quot; species as to require a separate genus. It was thus reassigned to the new genus &quot;Leptofelis&quot; as &quot;Leptofelis vallesiensis&quot;.

In 2017, a review of the species &quot;Felis pamiri&quot;, which was named based on a snout fragment from Turkey and dated to the late Miocene, concluded that &quot;Felis pamiri&quot; and &quot;Pseudaelurus lorteti&quot; were likely closely related to each other, and ancestral to the &quot;Panthera&quot; lineage. Both species were reassigned to the genus &quot;Miopanthera&quot; as &quot;Miopanthera lorteti&quot; and &quot;Miopanthera pamiri&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
The following cladogram is based on Piras et al. (2013) and illustrates the three more derived lineages that evolved from &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; species.

<text>Apache POI, a project run by the Apache Software Foundation, and previously a sub-project of the Jakarta Project, provides pure Java libraries for reading and writing files in Microsoft Office formats, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel.

==History and roadmap==
The name was originally an acronym for &quot;Poor Obfuscation Implementation&quot;, referring humorously to the fact that the file formats seemed to be deliberately obfuscated, but poorly, since they were successfully reverse-engineered. This explanation – and those of the similar names for the various sub-projects – were removed from the official web pages in order to better market the tools to businesses who would not consider such humor appropriate. The original authors (Andrew C. Oliver and Marc Johnson) also noted the existence of the Hawaiian poi dish, made of mashed taro root, which had similarly derogatory connotations.

===Office Open XML support===
POI supports the ISO/IEC 29500:2008 Office Open XML file formats since version 3.5. A significant contribution for OOXML support came from Sourcesense, an open source company which was commissioned by Microsoft to develop this contribution. This link spurred controversy, some POI contributors questioning POI OOXML patent protection regarding Microsoft&#x27;s Open Specification Promise patent license.

==Architecture==
The Apache POI project contains the following subcomponents (meaning of acronyms is taken from old documentation):

* POIFS (Poor Obfuscation Implementation File System) – This component reads and writes Microsoft&#x27;s OLE 2 Compound document format. Since all Microsoft Office files are OLE 2 files, this component is the basic building block of all the other POI elements. POIFS can therefore be used to read a wider variety of files, beyond those whose explicit decoders are already written in POI.
* HSSF (Horrible SpreadSheet Format) – reads and writes Microsoft Excel (XLS) format files. It can read files written by Excel 97 onwards; this file format is known as the &quot;BIFF 8&quot; format. As the Excel file format is complex and contains a number of tricky characteristics, some of the more advanced features cannot be read.
* XSSF (XML SpreadSheet Format) – reads and writes Office Open XML (XLSX) format files. Similar feature set to HSSF, but for Office Open XML files.
* HPSF (Horrible Property Set Format) – reads &quot;Document Summary&quot; information from Microsoft Office files. This is essentially the information that one can see by using the &quot;File|Properties&quot; menu item within an Office application.
* HWPF (Horrible Word Processor Format) – aims to read and write Microsoft Word 97 (DOC) format files. This component is in initial stages of development.
* XWPF (XML Word Processor Format) – similar feature set to HWPF, but for Office Open XML files.
* HSLF (Horrible Slide Layout Format) – a pure Java implementation for Microsoft PowerPoint files. This provides the ability to read, create and edit presentations (though some things are easier to do than others)
* XSLF (Open Office XML Slideshow Format)
* HDGF (Horrible DiaGram Format) – an initial pure Java implementation for Microsoft Visio binary files. It provides an ability to read the low level contents of the files.
* HPBF (Horrible PuBlisher Format) – a pure Java implementation for Microsoft Publisher files.
* HSMF (Horrible Stupid Mail Format) – a pure Java implementation for Microsoft Outlook MSG files.
* DDF (Dreadful Drawing Format) – a package for decoding the Microsoft Office Drawing format.
* XDDF (XML Dreadful Drawing Format)

The HSSF component is the most advanced feature of the library. Other components (HPSF, HWPF, and HSLF) are usable, but less full-featured.

The POI library is also provided as a Ruby or ColdFusion extension.

There are modules for Big Data platforms (e.g. Apache Hive/Apache Flink/Apache Spark), which provide certain functionality of Apache POI, such as the processing of Excel files.

<text>Martinus Willem Beijerinck (, 16 March 1851 – 1 January 1931) was a Dutch microbiologist and botanist who was one of the founders of virology and environmental microbiology. He is credited with the co-discovery of viruses (1898), which he called &quot;contagium vivum fluidum&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Born in Amsterdam, Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of biology in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden in 1877.

At the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University) and later at the &quot;Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft&quot; (Delft Polytechnic, currently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.

In 1877, he wrote his first notable research paper, discussing plant galls. The paper later became the basis for his doctoral dissertation.

In 1885 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Scientific career===

He is considered one of the founders of virology. In 1898, he published results on the filtration experiments demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium.

His results were in accordance with the similar observation made by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. Like Ivanovsky before him and Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent; however, he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen &quot;virus&quot; to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it &quot;contagium vivum fluidum&quot; (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) obtained by Wendell Stanley in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.

Nitrogen fixation, the process by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and becomes available to plants, was also investigated by Beijerinck. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside root nodules of certain plants (legumes). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to soil fertility and agriculture, Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of symbiosis between plants and bacteria.

Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. &quot;Spirillum desulfuricans&quot;, now known as &quot;Desulfovibrio desulfuricans&quot;, the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.

Beijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that &quot;everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects&quot;, which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking.

==Personal life==
Beijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his ascetic lifestyle and his view of science and marriage being incompatible. His low popularity with his students and their parents periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom. After his retirement at the Delft School of Microbiology in 1921, at age 70, he moved to Gorssel where he lived for the rest of his life, together with his two sisters.

==Recognition==
Beijerinckia (a genus of bacteria), Beijerinckiaceae (a family of Hyphomicrobiales), and Beijerinck crater are named after him.

The M.W. Beijerinck Virology Prize (&quot;M.W. Beijerinck Virologie Prijs&quot;) is awarded in his honor.

<text>Machairodus (from , &#x27;knife&#x27; and &#x27;tooth&#x27;) is a genus of large machairodont or &quot;saber-toothed cat&quot; that lived in Africa, Eurasia and North America during the Late Miocene, from 12.5 million to 5.5 million years ago. It is the animal from which the subfamily Machairodontinae gets its name. Some species of the genus reached sizes comparable to tigers, making them apex predators of the ecosystems they inhabited. It is currently usually placed as one of the most primtive members of the tribe Homotherini, and the ancestor of later members of the tribe.

==History of research and taxonomy==

&quot;Machairodus&quot; was first named in 1832, by German Naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Though its remains had been known since 1824, it was believed by Georges Cuvier that the fossils had come from a species of bear, which he called &quot;Ursus cultridens&quot; (known today as &quot;Megantereon&quot;) based on composite sample of teeth from different countries, species and geologic ages, leading to what would become a long series of complications. Kaup however, recognized the teeth as those of felids and promptly reclassified the existing specimens as &quot;Machairodus&quot;, including &quot;M. cultridens&quot; in it. The name quickly gained acceptance and by the end of the 19th century, many species of felid or related feliform (such as nimravids) were lumped into the genus &quot;Machairodus&quot;, including but not limited to &quot;Sansanosmilus&quot;, &quot;Megantereon&quot;, &quot;Paramachairodus&quot;, &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;, &quot;Nimravides&quot;, and &quot;Homotherium&quot; among others. This would eventually turn &quot;Machairodus&quot; into something of a wastebasket taxon, which would be rectified with the discoveries of more complete skeletons of other machairodonts.

*&quot;Machairodus irtyschensis&quot; and &quot;Machairodus ischimicus&quot; were described in 1936.
*&quot;Machairodus robinsoni&quot; was described in 1976. It was at one point referred to the genus &quot;Miomachairodus&quot;.
*&quot;Machairodus laskarevi&quot; was described in 1978.
*&quot;Machairodus alberdiae&quot; was first described in 1981, and extensively compared and retained as valid in 2019.
*&quot;Machairodus kurteni&quot; was described in 1991. It was later referred to the genus &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;.
Some of the most important fossils of &quot;Machairodus&quot; have come from the Cerro de los Batallones fossil site in Spain, which are filled caverns which predominantly carnivores became trapped within after entering probably looking for food or water, with the remains of the species &quot;Machairodus aphanistus&quot; representing roughtly 1/4 of all bones found at the Batallones-1 cavern at the site.

The fossil species assigned to the genus &quot;Machairodus&quot; were divided by Turner into two grades of evolutionary development, with &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; and the North American &quot;Nimravides&quot; &quot;catacopis&quot; representing the more primitive grade and &quot;M. coloradensis&quot; and &quot;M. giganteus&quot; representing the more derived grade. The characteristics of the more advanced grade include a relative elongation of the forearm and a shortening of the lumbar region of the spine to resemble that in living pantherine cats. Subsequently, the more derived forms were assigned a new genus, &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;, which includes &quot;M. coloradensis&quot;, &quot;M. kurteni&quot;, &quot;M. kabir&quot; and &quot;M. giganteus&quot;. In addition, &quot;M. catacopsis&quot; was reclassified as &quot;N. catacopsis&quot;.

Modern scholarship generally classifies &quot;Machairodus&quot; as one of the most primitive members of the tribe Homotherini (with some authors retaining the name &quot;Machairodontini&quot; for the group). &quot;Machairodus&quot; is thought to be a paraphyletic evolutionary grade that is ancestral to &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot; (which is in turn ancestral to other homotheriines like &quot;Homotherium&quot;).

==Description==
&quot;M. aphanistus&quot; from the Mediterranean late Miocene was tiger-like in size and skeletal proportions, with a mass of to . It was similar to the related &quot;Nimravides&quot; of North America. The skeleton also indicates that this species would have possessed good jumping abilities.

&quot;M. alberdiae&quot; was contemporary with &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; in Cerro de los Batallones fossil deposits and was smaller and more primitive in anatomical features and would not have exceeded .

The species &quot;M. lahayishupup&quot; of North America was also quite large; fossil humerus bones measuring attributed to the species suggest that this cat was far larger than a modern lion, which has a humerus. It is estimated to have weighed between 241 and 348 kg, with a mean weight of 277 kg; one particularly large specimen was estimated to weigh 410 kg. Until its discovery, no true species representative of the genus &quot;Machairodus&quot; had been described from North America, as they had been reassigned to other genera, such as &quot;Nimravides&quot; and &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;. Its presence in North America suggests that either there was a widespread population of this genus of cat throughout Africa, Eurasia and North America or simultaneous instances of independent evolution in machairodonts on multiple continents during the Miocene.

Overall, the skull of &quot;Machairodus&quot; was noticeably narrow compared with the skulls of extant pantherine cats, and the orbits were relatively small. The canines were long, thin and flattened from side to side but broad from front to back like the blade of a knife, as in &quot;Homotherium&quot;. The front and back edges of the canines were serrated when they first grew, but these serrations were worn down in the first few years of the animal&#x27;s life. 
==Paleobiology==
=== Predatory behavior === 
&quot;Machairodus&quot; probably hunted as an ambush predator. Its legs were too short to sustain a long chase, so it most likely was a good jumper. Its teeth were rooted to its mouth and were as delicate as those in some related genera, unlike most saber-toothed cats and nimravids of the time, which often had extremely long canines which hung out of their mouths. The fangs of &quot;Machairodus&quot;, however, were able to more easily fit in its mouth comfortably while being long and effective for hunting. Studies of &quot;Machairodus&quot; indicate that the cat relied predominantly on its neck muscles to make the killing bite applied to its victims. The cervical vertebrae show clear adaptations to making vertical motions in the neck and skull. There are also clear adaptations for precise movements, strength, and flexibility in the neck that show compatibility with the canine-shearing bite technique that machairodontine cats are believed to have performed. These adaptations are believed to have also been partial compensation in this primitive machairodont against the high percentage of canine breakages seen in the genus.

According to Orcutt and Calede 2021, &quot;M. lahayishupup&quot; may have preferred prey that typically weigh 413-1,386.3 kg with the maximum prey size being 1.6 tonnes, although it may not have been a large prey specialist. It is estimated that a &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; has a bite force of 1,077.4 newtons at the canines. 

=== Pathology ===
&quot;M. aphanistus&quot; fossils recovered from Batallones reveal a high percentage of tooth breakages, indicating that unlike later machairodonts, due to a lack of protruding incisors &quot;Machairodus&quot; often used its sabers to subdue prey in a manner similar to modern cats; this was a more risky strategy that virtually ensured that damage to their saber teeth often occurred. &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; fossils from Batallones displaying palaeopathologies also include a calcaneus displaying evidence of either a tumour or osteomyelitis, a third metacarpal displaying signs of osteosclerosis, and a mandible with an abscess in the mandibular body.

=== Social behavior ===
&quot;M. aphanistus&quot; shows high degree of sexual dimorphism similar to lions and leopards, with males being larger than females, suggesting an increase form of competition and low tolerance among males. Their high levels of sexual dimorphism would also suggest territories of males would never overlap with each other. The authors concluded that due to solitary behavior being common among modern felids, it’s reasonable to assuming &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; was a solitary animal as well. A 2024 paper on pathological analysis of &quot;M. aphanistus&quot;, suggests survival of severe injuries, such as broken mandible, may be evidence of some social structure. This further supported in modern day felids, solitary felids with high levels of sexual dimorphic such as leopards, tend to die before their severe injuries heal as they’re not tolerated in the same territories as other leopards, even if they can rely on carrion, it wasn’t an abundant resource in modern ecosystems. Lions, however, have a greater chance of survival, due to living in prides. Considering the high levels of sexual dimorphism in this species of &quot;Machairodus&quot;, this would likely indicate high levels of intolerance to other individuals within territory. Unlike lions, they wouldn’t have formed prides as they lived in wooded environments contrary to open landscapes, instead &quot;M. aphanistus&quot; would’ve form coalitions of two or more individuals that protected a large area, including territories of multiple females. It’s unknown if this applies to other species within the genus.

==Paleoecology==
&quot;M. aphanistus&quot; seemed to prefer open woodland habitat, as evidenced by finds at Cerro de los Batallones, which is of Vallesian age. As a top predator at Batallones, it would have hunted large herbivores of the time. Large herbivores found at the Batallones site included horses like &quot;Hipparion&quot; (consumpution of &quot;Hipparion&quot; by &quot;Machairodus aphanistus&quot; is strongly supported by isotopic analysis of remains from Batallones), the hornless rhinoceros &quot;Aceratherium&quot;, the giraffes &quot;Decennatherium&quot; and &quot;Birgerbohlinia&quot;, the deer &quot;Euprox&quot; and &quot;Lucentia&quot;, the antelopes &quot;Paleoreas&quot;, &quot;Tragoportax&quot;, &quot;Miotragocerus&quot; and &quot;Dorcatherium&quot;, the “gomphotherid” elephantoid &quot;Tetralophodon&quot;, the porcupine &quot;Hystrix&quot;, and the suid &quot;Microstonyx&quot;. &quot;Machairodus&quot; would have competed for such prey with the Amphicyonid &quot;Magericyon&quot;, fellow machairodonts &quot;Promegantereon&quot; and &quot;Paramachairodus&quot;, bears such as &quot;Agriotherium&quot; and &quot;Indarctos&quot;, and the small hyaenid &quot;Protictitherium&quot;. While &quot;Agriotherium&quot; and &quot;Magericyon&quot; would likely have been strongly competitive with &quot;Machairodus&quot; for food, &quot;Promegantereon&quot;, &quot;Paramachairodus&quot; and &quot;Protictitherium&quot; likely were less potential rivals. Evidence also exists indicating that &quot;Machairodus&quot; may have been prone to niche partitioning with &quot;Magericyon&quot;, possibly living in slightly different habitats, with the machairodont preferring more heavily vegetated habitats while the bear-dog hunted in the more open areas. Dietary preferences may also have played a role in the coexistence between these two large predators at Batallones.

This species was also found in Linxia Basin, which suggests they were represent in East Asia during the Late Miocene. They would’ve coexisted with a number of other large carnivores including two unnamed species of agriotherine bears, the barbourofelid &quot;Albanosmilus&quot;, fellow Machairodont &quot;Amphimachairodus&quot;, and the huge hyena &quot;Dinocrocuta.&quot; Given their different skull morphology, they likely practiced niche partitioning, with &quot;Machairodus&quot; was more adapted for forested areas compared to &quot;Amphimachairodous&quot;, which was more adapted for open environments.

&quot;M. lahayishupup&quot; is found is Hemphillian rocks from Chalk Hills Formation, Rattlesnake Formation, McKay Formation, and Ogallala Formation. It coexisted with other Miocene animals such as &quot;Teleoceras fossiger&quot;, &quot;Indarctos oregonensis&quot;, and &quot;Hemiauchenia vera&quot;. This species would&#x27;ve would have most likely preyed on the large animals that it lived alongside, which included rhinoceroses, and &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot;.

<doc id="169060" wikidata="Q133364" url="?curid=169060" title="Dinofelis">
<text>Dinofelis is an extinct genus of machairodontine (sabre-toothed cat), usually classified in the tribe Metailurini. It was widespread in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America from 5 million to about 1.2 million years ago (early Pliocene to early Pleistocene). Fossils very similar to &quot;Dinofelis&quot; from Lothagam range back to around 8 million years ago, in the Late Miocene.

==Discovery and naming==
The genus &quot;Dinofelis&quot; was originally named by Otto Zdansky in 1924 for the species &quot;Dinofelis abeli&quot;.

Further fossil species were named, including &quot;Felis diastemata&quot; and &quot;Meganthereon barlowi&quot;, which were later transferred to the genus &quot;Therailurus&quot;, which was in turn later considered a junior synonym of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;.

A comprehensive review of the genus was published in 2001 by paleontologists Lars Werdelin and Margaret E. Lewis, including mention of the then-unnamed Langebaanweg and Lothagam species, as well as naming a new species &quot;Dinofelis aronoki&quot;; the species epithet came from the phrase &quot;arono ki&quot; which, in the language of the people of eastern Turkana, means &quot;it was terrible&quot;. The review also noted six different sets of remains that were referable to &quot;Dinofelis&quot; but were too fragmentary to assign to any one species.

Another unnamed (again due to fragmentary material) species was described in 2021 based on fossils from a Plio-Pleistocene site in Northern Africa.

In 2023 the Langebaanweg species was described as &quot;Dinofelis werdelini&quot;; the specific epithet honored Lars Werdelin. It assigned a holotype, paratype, and nine other specimens of fragmentary cranial material (some of which had previously been referred to other species) to the newly-named species.

==Description==
This genus varied in size, with a similar range of sizes to &quot;Panthera&quot;. In one study, the body mass of &quot;Dinofelis&quot; was estimated at , though species with similar dimensions to large lynx or small pumas also existed.

The canine teeth of &quot;Dinofelis&quot; are longer and more flattened than those of modern cats but less than those of other saber-tooths. While the lower canines are robust, the cheek teeth are not as robust as those of most modern big cats.

&quot;Dinofelis werdelini&quot; was a medium-sized machairodontine, about the size of a large jaguar, with robust upper canines and relatively small cheek teeth.

==Classification==
The phylogenetic status of &quot;Dinofelis&quot; within Machairodontinae has been difficult to ascertain historically, and various positions within Felidae have been proposed for the genus. It has commonly been recovered as belonging to the tribe Metailurini, although one recent analysis contested the monophyly of Metailurini, placing &quot;Dinofelis&quot; as a sister taxon to &quot;Rhizosmilodon&quot;.

A number of species are currently accepted in the genus:
* &quot;Dinofelis aronoki&quot;: It lived in the Villafranchian and Biharian stage in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recently split from &quot;D. barlowi&quot;, it is the largest known species of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;.
* &quot;Dinofelis barlowi&quot;: It lived from the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene. Geographically, found in Europe, North America and Asia but mainly in Africa. It was 70 cm high, probably the smallest species of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;.
* &quot;Dinofelis cristata&quot;: Known from China, this species is especially convergent with the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; in its skull and particularly canine morphology, suggesting more pantherine-like hunting behaviour than other machairodonts. (Includes &quot;D. abeli&quot;.)
* &quot;Dinofelis darti&quot;: It lived in South Africa during the Villafranchian stage.
* &quot;Dinofelis diastemata&quot;: This species is known from the early Pliocene of Europe.
* &quot;Dinofelis paleoonca&quot;: Its type locality is Meade&#x27;s Quarry 11, which is in a Blancan terrestrial horizon in the Blanco Formation of Texas. It was recombined as &quot;Dinofelis palaeoonca&quot; by Kurten (1972), Hemmer (1973), Dalquest (1975), Kurten and Anderson (1980), Schultz (1990) and Werdelin and Lewis (2001).
* &quot;Dinofelis petteri&quot;: Known from the Pliocene of East Africa
* &quot;Dinofelis piveteaui&quot;: The latest known species of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;, lived in South Africa during the early Pleistocene. This species has the most pronounced sabertoothed adaptations of the genus.
* &quot;Dinofelis werdelini&quot;: Known from Langebaanweg in Africa, from the Pliocene.

Additional fossils from Lothagam (specifically the Nawata Formation and the Apak Member of the Nachukui Formation) are considered to represent another, unnamed species; one smaller and more primitive than other known species.

A major review of &quot;Dinofelis&quot; by Werdelin &quot;et al.&quot; in 2001 produced a cladogram of its species:

The 2023 paper that named &quot;D. werdelini&quot; found it to be a sister to a clade formed by &quot;D. cristatus&quot;, &quot;D. petteri&quot;, &quot;D. piveteaui&quot;, and &quot;D. barlowi&quot;, but did not test it against the rest of the genus.

&quot;Dinofelis&quot;″ position amongst the Metailurini per a 2018 phylogenetic analysis:

==Paleobiology==
Morphometric analysis of &quot;Dinofelis&quot; specimens from Olduvai Gorge suggests that the felid was best suited for mixed habitats rather than open grasslands or closed woodlands.

Analysis of carbon isotope ratios in specimens from Swartkrans indicates that &quot;Dinofelis&quot; preferentially hunted grazing animals. The main predators of hominids in the environment at that time were most likely leopards and fellow machairodont &quot;Megantereon&quot;, whose carbon isotope ratios showed more indication of preying on hominids.

Several sites from South Africa seem to show &quot;Dinofelis&quot; may have hunted and killed &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, since the finds mingle fossilized remains of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;, hominids, and other large contemporary animals. In South Africa, &quot;Dinofelis&quot; remains have been found near &quot;Paranthropus&quot; fossil skulls, a few with precisely spaced canine holes in their crania, so it is possible &quot;Dinofelis&quot; preyed on robust hominids as well. This may have been rare, however, as carbon isotope ratios contradict this.

It is thought that the gradual disappearance of its forest environment may have contributed to &quot;Dinofelis&quot;″ extinction at the start of the ice age.

<text>Roquefort () is a sheep milk blue cheese from southern France. Though similar cheeses are produced elsewhere, EU law dictates that only those cheeses aged in the natural Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon may bear the name Roquefort, as it is a recognised geographical indication, and has a protected designation of origin.

Roquefort is white, tangy, creamy and slightly moist, with veins of blue mold. It has a characteristic fragrance and flavor with a taste of butyric acid; the blue veins provide a sharp tang. It has no rind; the exterior is edible and slightly salty. A typical wheel weighs between 2.5 and 3kg (5.5 to 6.6lbs), and is about thick. Each kilogram of finished cheese requires about 4.5 liters of milk to produce. In France, Roquefort is often called the &quot;king of cheeses&quot; or the &quot;cheese of kings&quot;, although those names are also used for other cheeses.

==History==
According to legend, Roquefort cheese was discovered when a youth, eating his lunch of bread and ewes&#x27; milk cheese, saw a beautiful girl in the distance. Abandoning his meal in a nearby cave, he ran to meet her. When he returned a few months later, the mold (&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;) had transformed his plain cheese into Roquefort.

In 79 AD, Pliny the Elder praised the cheeses of Lozère and Gévaudan and reported their popularity in ancient Rome; in 1737, Jean Astruc suggested that this was a reference to an ancestor of Roquefort. The theory was widely taken up, and by the 1860s was being promoted by the &quot;Société des Caves&quot;. Others have dismissed the idea, on the grounds that Pliny does not clearly identify a blue cheese. There is no clear consensus on the meaning of Pliny&#x27;s description—it has been variously interpreted as a reference to fromage frais, cheese pickled in grape-juice, and even fondue, as well as a reference to Roquefort.

By the middle ages, Roquefort had become a recognized cheese. On 4 June 1411, Charles VI granted a monopoly for the ripening of the cheese to the people of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon as they had been doing for centuries.

By 1820, Roquefort was producing 300 tonnes a year, a figure that steadily increased throughout the next century so that by 1914 it was 9,250.

In 1925, the cheese was the recipient of France&#x27;s first &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; when regulations controlling its production and naming were first defined. In 1961, in a landmark ruling that removed imitation, the &quot;Tribunal de Grande Instance&quot; at Millau decreed that, although the method for the manufacture of the cheese could be followed across the south of France, only those cheeses whose ripening occurred in the natural caves of Mont Combalou in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon were permitted to bear the name Roquefort.

==Production==

Roquefort is made entirely from the milk of the Lacaune breed of sheep. Prior to the Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée (AOC) regulations of 1925, a small amount of cow&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk was sometimes added. Around of milk is required to make one kilogram of Roquefort.

Roquefort is produced throughout the &quot;département&quot; of Aveyron and part of the nearby &quot;départements&quot; of Aude, Lozère, Gard, Hérault and Tarn. , there are seven Roquefort producers. The largest-volume brand by far is made by the &quot;Société des Caves de Roquefort&quot;, since 1990 a subsidiary of Lactalis. Other producers are Papillon, Carles, , , Vernières and Le Vieux Berger.

Around three million cheeses were made in 2005 (18,830 tons) making it, after Comté, France&#x27;s second-most-popular cheese. Roquefort has a high content of free glutamate, 1,280 mg per 100 g of cheese.

The regional cuisine in and around Aveyron includes many Roquefort-based recipes for main-course meat sauces, savory tarts and quiches, pies, and fillings.

===AOC regulations===
The regulations that govern the production of Roquefort have been laid down over a number of decrees by the INAO. These include:
#All milk used must be delivered at least 20 days after lambing has taken place.
#The sheep must be on pasture, whenever possible, in an area that includes most of Aveyron and parts of neighboring departments. At least 75% of any grain or fodder fed must come from the area.
#The milk must be whole, raw (not heated above ), and unfiltered except to remove macroscopic particles.
#The addition of rennet must occur within 48 hours of milking.
#The &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; used in the production must be produced in France from the natural caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon.
#The salting process must be performed using dry salt.
#The whole process of maturation, cutting, packaging and refrigeration of the cheese must take place in the commune of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon.

==Health benefits==
&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; does not produce penicillin. However, due to the presence of other anti-inflammatory proteins, it was common in country districts for shepherds to apply this cheese to wounds to avoid gangrene.

The presence of anti-inflammatory compounds was confirmed by a 2012 study. A study from 2013 found that proteins from Roquefort cheese inhibit chlamydia propagation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leukocyte migration.
