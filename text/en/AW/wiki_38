<text>Edward Joseph McGuire (born 29 October 1964) is an Australian television and radio presenter, journalist, Australian Football League commentator and former TV executive. He is also an occasional &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper columnist. He hosts Channel Nine&#x27;s Millionaire Hot Seat (until the end of 2023), Wednesday night episodes of Footy Classified, and Network 10&#x27;s coverage of the Melbourne Cup Carnival (since 2022).

McGuire is the former president of the Collingwood Football Club; he stood down in 2021 after criticism of his handling of a report outlining systemic racism and involvement in racism at the club. He has worked in sports journalism, sports broadcasting and as a game show host. McGuire previously hosted Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;The Footy Show&quot; from its first airing in March 1994 until his departure in 2006. He returned for two years in 2017, leaving upon the show&#x27;s termination in 2018, prior to its short-lived reformat.

He hosted Australia&#x27;s edition of the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; and, previously, &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;. He is a former Nine Network CEO, resigning on 30 June 2007. He returned to commentating Friday night football in August 2007 contractually with Melbourne radio station SEN 1116, commentating one match a round. He is a director at the Victorian Major Events Company. He formerly hosted Triple M Melbourne&#x27;s breakfast show &quot;The Hot Breakfast&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
McGuire was born one of four to parents Edward McGuire Snr. and Bridie Brennan, who had emigrated in 1958 from Scotland and Ireland respectively his father worked in the coal mines before serving in World War II, before the family settled and in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. He and his older brother Frank McGuire both won scholarships to Christian Brothers&#x27; College, St Kilda.

==Media Career==
McGuire&#x27;s brother Frank who worked as a newspaper sports reporter, helped him to get his first job in the media as an Australian Rules Football statistician and cricket reporter for &quot;The Herald&quot; (1978–1982). Later he became a cadet sports reporter for Network Ten and then transferred, in 1993, to the Nine Network, where he became the host of a sports variety program.

In 1994, McGuire became one of the hosts of the AFL version of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;. He was initially on the show until 2005, later returning several times.

McGuire&#x27;s role at Nine was further expanded in 1999 when he became the host of the Australian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, a franchise of the globally exported television quiz show. In the same year he also hosted the Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999–2000 telecast. He hosted &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; from its première on 18 April 1999 until 3 April 2006. He briefly returned to the show after an 18-month hiatus in 2007 and has occasionally hosted a number of special episodes since then.

McGuire hosted the annual Australian Logie Awards show in 2003 and 2004 and co-hosted in 2005.

In January 2007, McGuire returned to regular hosting on the Australian version of the &quot;1 vs. 100&quot; quiz show.

On 9 June 2008, McGuire temporarily hosted &quot;A Current Affair&quot; while regular host Tracy Grimshaw was on leave. This saw the ratings of the show increase, with 1.42 million viewers tuning in to watch on his first night of hosting. Rival program &quot;Today Tonight&quot; still eclipsed &quot;ACA&quot; with 1.470 million viewers. However, the ratings for &quot;ACA&quot; slumped to 1.217 million viewers the following Tuesday, while &quot;Today Tonight&quot; achieved 1.549 million viewers. In February 2009, McGuire hosted a telethon for the victims of the Victorian bushfires. Since April 2009, McGuire has hosted the teatime game show &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; program, which airs at 5:00 pm. He also hosted a fundraising telethon from Brisbane on 9 January 2011 for victims of the 2010–2011 Queensland floods alongside Leila McKinnon and Karl Stefanovic at Suncorp Piazza.

In early 2011, McGuire hosted another prime time quiz show, &quot;The Million Dollar Drop&quot;, lasting for only six episodes. He then became the host of the sports-themed quiz show &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. His return was short-lived when the show quickly failed in the ratings, being axed by Nine after only three episodes had been aired. The fourth and final episode was broadcast on 2 June 2011. During 2011, he hosted &quot;This is Your Life&quot;; however, the show did not return in 2012.

in 2012, McGuire joined Fox Footy in an AFL commentary and program panellist role, while still remaining at the Nine Network to host &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; and the station&#x27;s Olympic coverage.

In July 2017, amid poor ratings, McGuire returned to &quot;The Footy Show&quot;, replacing Craig Hutchison, alongside long-time co-host Sam Newman and Rebecca Maddern. His company, JAM TV, produced the show. In 2018, he co-hosted the show with Newman. In December 2018, McGuire announced that &quot;The Footy Show&quot; was to be replaced by a new format of the show in 2019. The show was cancelled in 2019 after a number of episodes.

In June 2020, McGuire debuted an AFL radio show for American audiences called &quot;Aussie Football Rules America with Eddie McGuire&quot; accompanied by an AFL match of the week on Sirius XM satellite radio (specifically, Dan Patrick Radio, the channel hosted by the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor and radio host).

On radio, McGuire has been a football radio caller at Triple M, a station which had previously concentrated on rock music. Rejoining the station in 2009, he co-hosted a breakfast radio show with former AFL footballer Luke Darcy. The show became known as &quot;Triple M&#x27;s Hot Breakfast&quot;, however, Triple M announced in November 2020, after 11 years, that the show would end at the end of the month.

==Journalism==

McGuire has written football reviews for the Melbourne-based newspaper &quot;The Herald Sun&quot;.

==CEO of the Nine Network==

On 9 February 2006, it was announced that McGuire would become the new CEO of the Nine Network, filling a vacancy created by the departure of David Gyngell in May 2005. McGuire had to sacrifice his on-air commitments including hosting &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, as well as AFL commentary, for what turned out to be a very short term tenure. According to &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; McGuire&#x27;s on-air salary was $3.5 million a year. Gyngell had earned $1.1 million a year by comparison. According to the 2006 PBL annual report, McGuire was reported to be on a $4 million fixed remuneration contract. By May 2006, McGuire had travelled to Beaconsfield, Tasmania, to rally Nine News reporters covering the mine collapse. McGuire came out of on-air retirement to host the event, which was broadcast as part of &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; (both versions).

Before leaving for the Munich edition of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;, he announced the elimination of 100 jobs, most in news and current affairs. Despite a vigorous publicity campaign by the CEO these cost-cutting measures severely damaged morale at the network. On one program, McGuire&#x27;s required job-cuts exceeded the actual number of employees. This raised questions in both the media and within Channel 9 itself about the competence of Nine&#x27;s executives.

The troubles worsened when an affidavit written by a Channel 9 executive affected by the purges was leaked to the press and Nine failed in its attempts to suppress it. It contained allegations regarding McGuire&#x27;s treatment of employees. The document&#x27;s author, Mark Llewellyn (previous head of news and current affairs who has since found work at Channel 7), claimed that McGuire and his staff had told him that he would be forced to &quot;eat a shit sandwich&quot; (accept a dramatic pay-cut). He also recalled conversations with McGuire where the CEO had spoken of wanting to &quot;bone&quot; (reported to mean &quot;fire&quot;) Jessica Rowe, co-host of the network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. Following these allegations McGuire guaranteed Rowe her position on the program. McGuire has never denied the allegations. On 6 May 2007, Llewellyn&#x27;s position was vindicated when it was announced that Jessica Rowe would not be returning to Channel 9.

McGuire&#x27;s decision to force Jana Wendt off the &quot;Sunday&quot; program backfired with the relaunch of the show on 3 September 2006. The Nine Network&#x27;s switchboard was flooded with an unprecedented number of calls complaining about the new format and hosts. This episode was considered by many in the media as a failure by the &#x27;P-plated CEO&#x27; (a term coined by Sydney tabloids) to manage the network in a professional and ethical manner. It also fuelled speculation as to his longevity in his position as CEO of Nine. On 30 June 2007, McGuire resigned as CEO of the Nine Network and took on a new position in programming services as well as more on-screen roles.

==Collingwood Football Club==
On 29 October 1998, McGuire was elected by the vote of the members as president of the Collingwood Football Club, an Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

In the on-field areas of McGuire&#x27;s tenure as president of the club, Collingwood played in back-to-back grand-finals (2002–03) within three years of his appointment. In 2010, Collingwood defeated St Kilda in the AFL grand final replay. The first match resulted in a draw, prompting McGuire to say before the replay that &quot;he had seen more drawn Collingwood Grand Finals (1977 and 2010) than he had seen premierships&quot;.

In other on-field areas during McGuire&#x27;s tenure as president, McGuire oversaw the replacements of three senior coaches at Collingwood. The first was the recruitment of Mick Malthouse as senior coach at the end of the 1999 season to replace Tony Shaw, who resigned due to the club receiving the wooden spoon in the 1999 season. In July 2009, McGuire produced a coaching succession plan in which he oversaw a deal that would see the recently retired player Nathan Buckley join the club as an assistant coach under Malthouse for the 2010 and 2011 seasons before Malthouse would hand over the senior coach position to Buckley at the end of the 2011 season. McGuire called it &quot;a humbling experience as a Collingwood person&quot;.

In off-field areas during McGuire&#x27;s tenure as president, he oversaw the redevelopment and construction of Collingwood&#x27;s new training and administrative facilities, relocated from Victoria Park to the Olympic Park complex with the indoor training and administrative facilities at the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre and the outdoor training ground being firstly moved to the Olympic Park stadium in 2004. In the later years in McGuire&#x27;s presidency the club moved its outdoor training ground to the newly developed Olympic Park Oval in 2013 which replaced the outdoor space of the previous Olympic Park stadium which had been demolished in 2012.

In December 2020, McGuire announced he would step down as president at the end of the 2021 season, ending a 23-year stint at the helm of the Magpies. However, McGuire stood down earlier than expected in February 2021 due to ongoing pressure after the release of the Do Better report raised allegations of a racist culture at the Collingwood Football Club.

McGuire was replaced by Mark Korda as president.

==Political views==
In politics, McGuire was a prominent campaigner for Australian republicanism (the movement for replacing the King of Australia as Australia&#x27;s head of state). He was elected as a delegate to represent Victoria at the 1998 Constitutional Convention, which led to the ultimately unsuccessful 1999 referendum. He is the brother of the Australian Labor politician Frank McGuire. Although being the brother of Frank McGuire, and having ties to Labor party members, ultimately Eddie McGuire stated in 1999 that he would be conflicted representing either the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party of Australia. He noted the confounding differences between the economic and social policies of each party and the irreconcilable dissonance in wanting to represent a Liberal Party–styled economy with a Labor Party conscience. In 2002, McGuire stated he would not seek sanctum in politics but that he would not say no to any future thoughts about the matter. McGuire was given the opportunity to represent the seat of Scullin by the Australian Labor Party in 2005; however, his business ventures were prioritised alongside McGuire becoming the then CEO of the Nine Network by 2006.

==Honours==
In 2001, McGuire was awarded the Australian Sports Medal (2001) &quot;for service to Australian Football&quot;.

In 2005, McGuire was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) (2005) &quot;for service to the community, particularly through support for healthcare and welfare organisations, and to broadcasting&quot;.

On 17 May 2013, RMIT University awarded McGuire an honorary doctorate, making him a Doctor of Communications &quot;honoris causa&quot;. The honour recognises McGuire&#x27;s achievements in media-, entertainment-, sport- and community-based activities.

McGuire spent a period as a member of the Australian Government&#x27;s Social Inclusion Board.

==In popular culture==
McGuire&#x27;s one-time near-ubiquity in Channel Nine programming led to him being nicknamed &quot;Eddie Everywhere&quot;. In 2003, the ABC comedy television program &quot;CNNNN&quot; featured a satirical skit about his permeation of Australian media called the &quot;Eddie McGuire Virus&quot;.

On 8 January 2005, McGuire was on Australia&#x27;s three commercial TV networks (Seven, Nine, Ten) at the same time, with Andrew O&#x27;Keefe and Rove McManus, hosting a show simulcast on the networks to raise money for the 2004 Asian tsunami victims. Additionally, due to the contract between Fox Footy and the Seven Network which requires interstate teams to be televised on free-to-air in their respective markets (for example, matches involving the Brisbane Lions must be televised live into Queensland), McGuire can sometimes be heard on Seven calling these matches, though via the Fox Footy feed and never on free-to-air in Melbourne. In February 2020, however, McGuire partnered with Seven commentator Bruce McAvaney on Fox and Seven&#x27;s co-coverage of the one-off 2020 AFL State of Origin Bushfire Relief match, with the match televised on the Seven Network nationally.

==Controversies==
===Bigotry and racism===
On 24 May 2013, during a match at the MCG, a 13-year-old Collingwood fan racially vilified Sydney Swans player Adam Goodes by referring to him as an &quot;ape&quot;, following which McGuire apologised to Goodes &quot;on behalf of the Collingwood Football Club and on behalf of football&quot;. McGuire said that Collingwood had a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, but also said that the girl did not know that what she had said was a racist slur. That same week, on 29 May 2013, McGuire himself made an on-air joke that Adam Goodes should promote the then-soon-to-premiere musical &quot;King Kong&quot;. He apologised on air after making the reference, but prefaced his apology by stating &quot;I wasn&#x27;t racially vilifying anyone.&quot; McGuire&#x27;s comment was widely criticised. He also held a press conference in which he apologised again. In a later interview that day, he admitted he was guilty of racial vilification. He also offered his resignation as Collingwood president, but the club&#x27;s board expressed their support for him. Three years later, McGuire claimed he was on &quot;heavy-duty painkillers&quot; during the radio show where he made the King Kong reference.

In June 2015, McGuire was labelled a &quot;continual boofhead&quot; in a motion passed by the Upper house of the Parliament of New South Wales for comments he made about an Indigenous dance performed by Goodes, who was praised as a &quot;role model to all&quot;.

In June 2016, McGuire, Sam Newman, North Melbourne president James Brayshaw and former player Danny Frawley made jokes about drowning Fairfax journalist Caroline Wilson during the Big Freeze at the &#x27;G event, with McGuire and Newman saying: &quot;We&#x27;ll put in 10 grand straight away, and if she stays under (the water), 50, even if we have to hold her head under.&quot; Frawley later apologised for the comments, but maintained it was a poor attempt at good humour, given the occasion.

On 29 March 2019, McGuire came under more controversy when he mocked double amputee Cynthia Banham for a pre-game coin toss prior to a match between the Sydney Swans and . Banham lost both her legs and broke her back in a plane crash in 2007. She appeared to struggle as she tossed the coin before the match while holding her walking stick. McGuire joke that people who could not toss the coin properly should be fined. McGuire apologised and stepped down from calling the Essendon vs St Kilda game for Fox Footy the following day.

===Summer Olympics (London)===
During the 2012 London Olympics, McGuire presented his Triple M radio program from London each weekday. In addition, he called events for the Nine Network and Foxtel and co-hosted the opening and closing ceremonies with Leila McKinnon. McGuire and McKinnon&#x27;s commentary of the Olympic opening ceremony was widely criticised in newspapers and on Twitter. Errors including spoilers before surprise appearances, ill-timed remarks, reference to the Peter Pan character Captain Hook as Captain Cook, and Abraham Lincoln as a prime minister of the United Kingdom. The McGuire and McKinnon commentary was not used for Foxtel&#x27;s coverage of the opening ceremony.

===&quot;Do Better&quot; Report===
On 1 February 2021, McGuire held a 50-minute press conference to discuss allegations of systemic racism at the Collingwood Football Club after an independent report, called the &quot;Do Better&quot; Report (which Collingwood says it instigated as a matter of self-reflection and to improve race relations), had been leaked. McGuire courted widespread controversy after introducing his speech by saying: &quot;This is an historic and proud day for the Collingwood Football Club.&quot;

The opening remark, as well as the general tone of the entire press conference, was widely criticised as spin in order to present Collingwood as being progressive while simultaneously deflecting from the systemic racism for which, as president, McGuire has ultimate responsibility. McGuire was further criticised for not standing down immediately as president, instead insisting that he intended to stay until the end of 2021, saying that he wanted to ensure the changes were implemented correctly; however, this move was challenged even from within Collingwood&#x27;s own supporter base. Former Magpie player Héritier Lumumba, himself a victim of racial abuse when he played at Collingwood, said the press conference was &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;painful to watch&quot;. This incident was at least the third widespread call for McGuire&#x27;s resignation as president during his 22-year period as Collingwood president.

In addition to Lumumba&#x27;s vocal appeal for McGuire to be stood down, calls for his immediate resignation or dismissal were also made by people such as Adam Bandt, the leader of the Australian Greens and federal MP for Melbourne; a Collingwood-born Victorian Greens senator and the first Victorian Aboriginal senator, Lidia Thorpe; the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;&#x27;s lead football writer, Mark Robinson; indigenous former Collingwood player Tony Armstrong; former St Kilda player and anti-racism advocate Nicky Winmar; and Toby Hemingway, a member of the Collingwood fan club who led a supporter call for McGuire&#x27;s resignation.

Lidia Thorpe said that &quot;The club has a long way to go to restore the community&#x27;s faith in their leadership. As a start, the board should grow a spine and get Eddie to resign.&quot;

After being accused of spinning the press conference into a positive situation for the club, McGuire later remarked that he was sorry &quot;that my error has acted as a distraction from the importance of the findings on racism&quot;. On 9 February 2021, after eight days of heavy media scrutiny following the press conference, McGuire resigned as president of Collingwood Football Club, with immediate effect.

<doc id="170019" wikidata="Q2739669" url="?curid=170019" title="Culture of Peru">
<text>Peruvian culture is the gradual blending of Amerindian cultures with European and Asian ethnic groups. The ethnic diversity and rugged geography of Peru allowed diverse traditions and customs to co-exist. Peruvian culture has been deeply influenced by Native culture, Spanish culture, and Asian culture. Other minor influences on their culture are Chinese, Japanese, and other European peoples.

==Literature==
Peruvian literature has been shaped by the convergence of indigenous oral tradition and the technical resources of writing introduced by the Spanish. This fusion, from the very beginning, enabled the collection and expression of the diverse and complex cultural realities that came into conflict after the conquest.

Quechua and Aymara literature, transmitted orally, was deeply linked to religious, agricultural, romantic, festive, and funerary rituals. These characteristics are reflected in certain forms of poetry and prose, as seen in the early historical chronicles, including the &quot;Comentarios Reales&quot; by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and &quot;Nueva Crónica y Buen Gobierno&quot; by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. Also notable is the connection between the yaravíes and patriotic and romantic poetry, represented in the work of Mariano Melgar.

During the colonial and republican periods, the dominance of the criollo oligarchy in Peruvian society favored the adoption of European literary forms at the expense of indigenous ones. In this context, neoclassical authors such as Manuel Ascensio Segura and Felipe Pardo y Aliaga emerged, dominating the literary scene until the late 19th century when romanticism took hold through figures like Carlos Augusto Salaverry and José Arnaldo Márquez. The crisis resulting from the War of the Pacific paved the way for modernism, with exponents such as José Santos Chocano and José María Eguren.

In the 20th century, avant-garde movements gained strength, driven by magazines like &quot;Colónida&quot; and &quot;Amauta&quot;, the latter founded in 1926 by José Carlos Mariátegui, with notable collaborators such as César Vallejo. Meanwhile, indigenism resurfaced in the poetry of Luis Fabio Xammar. The avant-garde movements fragmented into various lyrical proposals, such as those of Xavier Abril, Alberto Hidalgo, Sebastián Salazar Bondy, Carlos Germán Belli, among others, opening new and diverse expressive fields.

In 19th-century Peruvian prose, the costumbrismo of Manuel Ascensio Segura and Ricardo Palma, along with the modernism of Manuel González Prada and José Santos Chocano, set the literary course. By the 20th century, indigenist prose reached some of its peak moments with Ciro Alegría and José María Arguedas, whose influences extended to authors such as Sebastián Salazar Bondy, Manuel Scorza, and Julio Ramón Ribeyro. Mario Vargas Llosa and Alfredo Bryce Echenique, while maintaining a realist approach, incorporated new narrative techniques.

In poetry, prominent figures include Emilio Adolfo Westphalen, Jorge Eduardo Eielson, Carlos Germán Belli, Arturo Corcuera, Antonio Cisneros, Wáshington Delgado, Marco Martos, and Carmen Ollé. In contemporary narrative, notable authors include Miguel Gutiérrez, Gregorio Martínez, Alonso Cueto, and Gustavo Rodríguez, among others.

==Art==
Peru&#x27;s cultural heritage originates from the ancient Andean civilizations that emerged in its territory before the arrival of the Spanish. The archaeological treasures of Peru testify to a significant cultural development that occurred without contact with other extracontinental cultures.

The earliest artistic expressions with a high degree of intellectual and technological evolution are found in the sites of Chavín de Huántar and Cupisnique, dated between the 9th and 4th centuries BCE. These expressions include silver and gold jewelry, ceramics, architecture, and stone sculpture, reflecting symbolic and religious art.

Between the 8th century BCE and the 1st century CE, the Paracas Cavernas and Paracas Necrópolis cultures developed. The former produced polychrome ceramics with religious representations, while the latter is known for its monochrome ceramics and complex, delicate textiles.

In the period between the 3rd century BCE and the 7th century CE, the urban cultures of the Moche in Lambayeque and the Nazca in the Río Grande valley in Ica emerged. Both cultures are notable for their advanced terrace agriculture, hydraulic engineering, and ceramic, textile, pictorial, and sculptural productions.

The Wari civilization, between the 7th and 12th centuries, established in Ayacucho, pioneered rational urban design, a concept that spread to other areas such as Pachacámac, Cajamarquilla, and Wari Willka. The Tiahuanaco culture, which developed on the shores of Lake Titicaca between the 9th and 13th centuries, is known for its monumental stone architecture and sculpture, facilitated by the use of bronze.

The Chimú people, between the 14th and 15th centuries, built the city of Chan Chan in the Moche River valley in La Libertad, and they excelled in jewelry-making and hydraulic engineering.

The Inca civilization, which absorbed much of the cultural legacy of its predecessors, left significant evidence such as the cities of Cuzco, the architectural remains of Sacsahuamán and Machu Picchu, and a network of roads connecting Cuzco with other regions of the empire. The arrival of the Spanish led to a cultural blending reflected in Peruvian architecture, combining European styles with indigenous influences. After the Renaissance period, the Baroque reached a rich expression in buildings such as the Convent of San Francisco in Lima and the Iglesia de la Compañia in Cuzco.

The War of Independence created a creative void that French-inspired Neoclassicism attempted to fill. During the 20th century, architectural eclecticism was observed, with constructive functionalism emerging as a response, exemplified by the Plaza San Martín in Lima.

Peruvian sculpture and painting developed from workshops founded by religious figures, influenced by the Sevillian Baroque school. This artistic movement can be seen in works such as the choir stalls of the cathedral and the fountain in the Plaza Mayor.

Artistic mestizaje was more evident in painting, which incorporated elements of native heritage. Examples include the portrait of the imprisoned Atahualpa by Damián de la Bastida y Mora and the works of artists such as Mateo Pérez de Alesio, Angelino Medoro, Francisco Bejarano, Jesús de Illescas, and Joaquín Rodríguez.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Baroque dominated the visual arts, while in the 19th century, French Neoclassical and Romantic currents found their best representatives in Luis Montero, Ignacio Merino, and Francisco Masías.

In the 20th century, the foundation of the School of Fine Arts of Lima in 1919 marked a milestone in Peruvian sculpture and painting. Notable sculptors include Luis Agurto, Luis Valdettaro, Joaquín Roca Rey, Jorge Piqueras, Alberto Guzmán, Víctor Delfín, and Francisco Sánchez, and painters such as Daniel Hernández Morillo, Ricardo Grau, César Quispez Asín, and José Sabogal. The latter led the indigenist movement, a pillar of contemporary Peruvian painting, with representatives such as Fernando de Szyszlo, Alberto Dávila, Armando Villegas, Sabino Springett, Víctor Humareda, Mario Alejandro Cuadros, Ángel Chávez, Milner Cajahuaringa, Arturo Kubotta, Venancio Shinki, Alberto Quintanilla, Germán Chávez, Tilsa Tsuchiya, David Herskowitz, Óscar Allain, and Carlos Revilla.

Among the most widespread crafts in Peru are ceramics, both artistic and utilitarian, carving, silverwork, leather embossing, straw weaving, and textile work, with colorful alpaca wool fabrics standing out.

==Architecture==

Peruvian architecture is a conjunction of European styles exposed to the influence of indigenous imagery. Two of the most well-known examples of the Early Colonial period are the Cathedral of Cusco and the Church of Santa Clara of Cuzco. After this period, the mestization reached its richer expression in the Baroque. Some examples of this Baroque period are the Convento de San Francisco, the Iglesia de la Compañía, and the facade of the University of Cuzco and, overall, the churches of San Agustín and Santa Rosa of Arequipa.

Although these later examples are rarer; the Independence War left a creative emptiness that was filled by the Neoclassicism. The 20th century was characterized by the eclectic architecture, which has been in stark opposition to constructive functionalism. Its considerable example is San Martin Plaza in Lima.

==Music==

The pre-Hispanic Andean cultures of Peru were distinguished by their rich tradition in artistic expressions, especially in music. Most communal agricultural activities were accompanied by music and songs, known in Quechua as &quot;taqui&quot;. The ethnic diversity of ancient Peru resulted in the coexistence of various traditions and customs, which have persisted over time and have been fundamental to the development of post-Hispanic Peruvian folklore.

Today, various musical expressions, such as dance and song, popular festivals (both religious and non-religious), handicrafts, gastronomy, and other regionally varied activities, are significant aspects of Peruvian and Latin American cultural heritage.

Pre-Hispanic Andean musicians primarily used wind instruments, such as the &quot;quena&quot;, &quot;pinkillo&quot;, &quot;erke&quot;, &quot;antara&quot; or &quot;siku&quot; (also known as &quot;zampoña&quot;), and the &quot;pututo&quot;. They also employed percussion instruments like the &quot;tinya&quot; (hand drum), &quot;pomatinyas&quot; (made from puma skin), and &quot;runatinyas&quot; (made from human skin), used in battles, as well as the &quot;wankar&quot;, a large drum.

With the arrival of the Spanish, European instruments like harps, guitars, vihuelas, bandurrias, and lutes were introduced. The combination of these instruments with indigenous ones led to the creation of mestizo instruments, such as the Andean harp and the &quot;charango&quot;, which is made from the shell of the armadillo.
== Dances ==

Cultural blending was not limited to the interaction between indigenous and European cultures; African influence is also evident in the rhythms and percussion instruments. This influence is reflected in musical forms such as &quot;festejo&quot; and &quot;zamacueca.&quot;

Among the native dances, those related to agricultural work, hunting, and warfare are prominent. Some of these choreographies show Christian influence. Two of the most representative Andean dances are the &quot;kashua&quot;, communal in nature, performed in groups in open spaces, and the &quot;wayño&quot; or &quot;huayno&quot;, a &quot;salon dance&quot; performed in pairs in enclosed spaces. Other Andean-origin dances include the &quot;yaraví&quot; and &quot;triste&quot;, which are songs with typically very sentimental lyrics.

Ritual dances include the &quot;achocallo&quot;, &quot;pinkillada&quot;, &quot;llamerada&quot; (imitating the movement of llamas), and &quot;kullawada&quot; (of the spinners). Hunting-related dances include &quot;llipi-puli&quot; and &quot;choq&#x27;elas&quot;, colorful highland dances associated with vicuña hunting.

Warfare dances include the &quot;chiriguano&quot;, of Aymara origin; &quot;chatripuli&quot;, which satirizes Spanish royalist soldiers; and &quot;kena-kenas&quot;, referring to the Chilean soldiers who occupied Peru during the War of the Pacific (1879). Carnival dances are also significant, a Western festival that in the Peruvian Andes coincides with the harvest season; many rural communities celebrate with ancestral rites and mestizo dances, marking the initiation of youth and, in many cases, the formation of new couples.

The most internationally recognized Peruvian dance is the &quot;marinera norteña&quot;, which represents the courtship of a man towards a young woman. There are local variations of this dance in Lima and other regions of the country.
==Celebrations==
Popular festivals, which result from the traditions and legends of each town, bring together music, dance, typical foods, and drinks. In addition to religious festivals, such as Christmas, Corpus Christi, or Holy Week, there are others that express the syncretism between indigenous and Christian beliefs, such as the &quot;alasitas&quot; fairs (an Aymara word that some scholars interpret as &quot;buy me&quot;), which combine a craft and miniature fair with dances, foods, and a mass. Another important festival is the pilgrimage of Q&#x27;oyllor-riti (Cusco), which integrates the ancient worship of the &quot;apus&quot; (tutelary deities of the mountains) with a pilgrimage to a Christian sanctuary, in a walk up to a snow-capped peak over 5,000 meters above sea level.

==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport in Peru. Football in Peru is governed by the Peruvian Football Federation (PFF), which organizes the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams. Football legends from Peru include Alejandro Villanueva, Teodoro Fernández, Valeriano López, Alberto Terry, Hugo Sotil, César Cueto, Roberto Challe, Héctor Chumpitaz and Teófilo Cubillas, Peru&#x27;s most successful striker in the World Cup finals with ten goals, Nolberto Solano.

Current renowned players include defender Carlos Zambrano (Rubin Kazan), midfielder Juan Manuel Vargas (Universitario) and strikers Claudio Pizarro (Werder Bremen), Paolo Guerrero (Flamengo) and Jefferson Farfán (Lokomotiv Moscow). Alianza Lima, Sporting Cristal and Universitario de Deportes are the biggest teams in Peru. In 2003, Cienciano won the Copa Sudamericana after defeating Argentinian club River Plate, and then proceeded to beat Latin American powerhouse Boca Juniors (also from Argentina) in the Recopa Sudamericana played in Miami. Sporting Cristal was finalist in the Copa Libertadores de América 1997, South America&#x27;s most important football tournament. Also Universitario de Deportes, but in 1972.

Achievements from the Peru national football team include competing at the FIFA World Cup, in 1930, 1970 (quarterfinalists), 1978, and 1982, being Teófilo Cubillas, among the top 10 goal scorers in the history of the World Cup and having a record as the only player to score 5 goals in 2 different World Cups. The national team won two Copa América&#x27;s in 1939 and 1975.

Claudio Pizarro holds the record as the top scorer from a foreign country in the history of Bundesliga. Paolo Guerrero holds the record as the current all-time top scorer in the history of the Copa América still active, finishing as the top scorer in all three of these tournaments (2011, 2015 and 2019), which is also a record.
Achievements from the Peru women&#x27;s national football team include finishing third place at the 1998 Sudamericano Femenino, and finishing fourth place at the 2003 Sudamericano Femenino.

Women&#x27;s volleyball is a popular and also successful sport in Peru (silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics, runners-up in the Volleyball World Championship, and 12 times South American champion).

Tennis, surfing and rugby in Peru are minor but growing sports.

Alejandro &quot;Alex&quot; Olmedo Rodríguez (March 24, 1936 – December 9, 2020) was a tennis player from Peru with American citizenship. He was listed by the USTA as a &quot;foreign&quot; player for 1958, but as a U.S. player for 1959.[3] He helped win the Davis Cup for the United States in 1958 and was the No. 2 ranked amateur in 1959. Olmedo won two Majors in 1959 (Australia and Wimbledon) and the U.S. Pro Championships in 1960, and was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.

Sofía Mulánovich is the first South American ever to win the Surfing World Title, which she did in 2004. She is also the first Peruvian surfer ever to win a World Surf League World Championship Tour event. In 2004, she won three out of the six World Championship Tour events, and finished the season as World Champion. Felipe Pomar was also a world champion.

==Cuisine==
Due to the rich variety and the harmony of its flavor and the food used, Peruvian food is constantly winning internationally and the chefs often have international recognition and distinction. One notable element is the constant new innovations and new dishes, especially those that incorporate the food found by experimentation. Each region maintains its rich cuisine by its food having a mix of colors and ingredients.

The great variety of native foods, such as corn, tomatoes, potatoes, &quot;uchu&quot; or chili pepper, &quot;oca&quot;, &quot;olluco&quot;, avocado, and fruits like cherimoya, &quot;lúcuma&quot;, and pineapple (&quot;ananás&quot;), along with animals such as &quot;tarucas&quot; (deer), llamas, and guinea pigs, led to the creation of new dishes and methods of preparation when combined with European and Moorish culinary traditions. The successive arrivals of Africans and Chinese also influenced the development of &quot;criollo&quot; cuisine, which is now varied and rich.

Among the most representative dishes of Peruvian cuisine are &quot;ceviche&quot; (fish and seafood marinated in lime juice), &quot;chupe&quot; (soup) of shrimp, &quot;anticuchos&quot; (grilled beef heart skewers), &quot;olluco con charqui&quot;, the Andean &quot;pachamanca&quot; (meats, tubers, and beans cooked in a stone oven), &quot;lomo saltado&quot; (stir-fried beef with tomatoes and onions, served with fried potatoes and rice) of Chinese influence, and &quot;picante de cuy&quot;. These dishes are often accompanied by typical drinks such as &quot;chicha de jora&quot; (corn fermented and sun-dried), with very low alcohol content, as well as non-alcoholic &quot;chicha&quot; made from purple corn or peanuts.

<doc id="170020" wikidata="Q318475" url="?curid=170020" title="Randy Newman">
<text>Randall Stuart Newman (born November 28, 1943) is an American singer, songwriter, arranger, pianist, composer, conductor and orchestrator. He is known for his non-rhotic Southern-accented singing style, early Americana-influenced songs (often with mordant or satirical lyrics), and various film scores. His hits as a recording artist include &quot;Short People&quot; (1977), &quot;I Love L.A.&quot; (1983), and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot; (1995) with Lyle Lovett, while other artists have enjoyed success with cover versions of his &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot; (1966), &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot; (1968), and &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; (1972).

Born in Los Angeles to an extended family of Hollywood film composers, Newman began his songwriting career at the age of 17, penning hits for acts such as the Fleetwoods, Cilla Black, Gene Pitney, and the Alan Price Set. In 1968, he made his formal debut as a solo artist with the album &quot;Randy Newman&quot;, produced by Lenny Waronker and Van Dyke Parks. Four of Newman&#x27;s non-soundtrack albums have charted in the US top 40: &quot;Sail Away&quot; (1972), &quot;Good Old Boys&quot; (1974), &quot;Little Criminals&quot; (1977), and &quot;Harps and Angels&quot; (2008).

Since the 1980s, Newman has worked mostly as a film composer. He has scored nine Disney-Pixar animated films, including all &quot;Toy Story&quot; films (1995–present), &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), both &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; films (2001, 2013), and the first and third &quot;Cars&quot; films (2006, 2017), as well as Disney&#x27;s &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; (2009). His other film scores include &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1971), &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997), &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998), &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; (2000), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (2003), and &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (2019).

Newman has received twenty-two Academy Award nominations in the Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories and has won twice in the latter category, contributing to the Newmans being the most nominated Academy Award extended family, with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories. He has also won three Emmys, seven Grammy Awards and the Governor&#x27;s Award from the Recording Academy. In 2007, he was recognized by the Walt Disney Company as a Disney Legend. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002 and to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Newman was born to a Jewish family on November 28, 1943, his father&#x27;s 30th birthday, in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of Adele &quot;Dixie&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Fuchs/Fox; August 30, 1916 – October 4, 1988), a secretary, and Irving George Newman (November 28, 1913 – February 1, 1990), an internist. He lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, as a young child and spent summers there until he was 11 years old, when his family returned to Los Angeles. The paternal side of his family includes grandparents Luba (&quot;née&quot; Koskoff) (July 21, 1883 – March 3, 1954) and Michael Newman (Nemorofsky) (1874–1948), and three uncles who were Hollywood film-score composers: Alfred Newman, Lionel Newman, and Emil Newman. Newman&#x27;s cousins, Thomas, Maria, David, and Joey, are also composers for motion pictures. He graduated from University High School in Los Angeles. He studied music at the University of California, Los Angeles, but dropped out one semester shy of a B.A. In June 2021, he finally completed his degree at UCLA.

Newman&#x27;s parents were non-observant Jews: Newman himself is an atheist. He has said that religion or any sense of religious identity was completely absent in his childhood. To illustrate this, he has often recounted in interviews an antisemitic incident that occurred when he was young: he was invited by a classmate to be her date to a cotillion at her Los Angeles country club, the Riviera Country Club. He accepted the invitation but was subsequently disinvited by the girl&#x27;s father, who told Newman that his daughter should never have invited him because Jews were not allowed at the club. Newman hung up the phone, then went to ask his own father what a &quot;Jew&quot; was.

==Career==
===Songwriter===
Newman has been a professional songwriter since he was 17. He cites Ray Charles as his greatest influence growing up, stating, &quot;I loved Charles&#x27; music to excess.&quot; His first single as a performer was 1962&#x27;s &quot;Golden Gridiron Boy&quot;, released when he was 18. The single flopped and Newman chose to concentrate on songwriting and arranging for the next several years.

An early writing credit was &quot;They Tell Me It&#x27;s Summer&quot;, used as the b-side of the Fleetwoods 1962 single, &quot;Lovers by Night, Strangers by Day&quot;, which led to further commissions from the Fleetwoods and also Pat Boone. Other early songs were recorded by Gene Pitney, Jerry Butler, Petula Clark, Dusty Springfield, Jackie DeShannon, the O&#x27;Jays, and Irma Thomas, among others. His work as a songwriter met with particular success in the UK: top 40 UK hits written by Newman included Cilla Black&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Wrong Before&quot; (No. 17, 1965), Gene Pitney&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Needs Your Love&quot; (No. 2, 1966) and &quot;Just One Smile&quot; (No. 8, 1966); and the Alan Price Set&#x27;s &quot;Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear&quot; (No. 4, 1967). Price, an English keyboardist who was enjoying great success at the time, championed Newman by featuring seven Randy Newman songs on his 1967 &quot;A Price on His Head&quot; album.

In the mid-1960s, Newman kept a close musical relationship with the band Harpers Bizarre, best known for their 1967 hit version of the Paul Simon composition &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&#x27; Groovy)&quot;. The band recorded six Newman compositions, including &quot;Simon Smith&quot; and &quot;Happyland,&quot; during their short initial career (1967–1969).

In this period, Newman began a long professional association with childhood friend Lenny Waronker. Waronker had been hired to produce the Tikis, the Beau Brummels and the Mojo Men, who were all contracted to the Los Angeles independent label Autumn Records. He in turn brought in Newman, Leon Russell and another friend, pianist/arranger Van Dyke Parks, to play on recording sessions. Later in 1966, Waronker was hired as an A&amp;R manager by Warner Bros. Records and his friendship with Newman, Russell and Parks began a creative circle around Waronker at Warner Bros. that became one of the keys to Warner Bros.&#x27; subsequent success as a rock music label.

In the 1970s, Newman co-wrote with Jake Holmes the &quot;Most Original Soft Drink Ever&quot; jingle for Dr Pepper.

In 2011, Newman endorsed jazz singer Roseanna Vitro&#x27;s album, &quot;The Randy Newman Project&quot; (Motéma Music, 2011).

In 2020, Newman wrote a song called “Stay Away” to support people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song can be downloaded and proceeds go to the Ellis Marsalis Center to support underserved children in New Orleans’ 9th Ward.

Newman&#x27;s song compositions are represented by Downtown Music Publishing.

===Recording artist===

His 1968 debut album, &quot;Randy Newman&quot;, was a critical success but never entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. Many artists, including Barbra Streisand, Helen Reddy, Bette Midler, Alan Price, Van Dyke Parks, Dave Van Ronk, Judy Collins, Glen Campbell, Cass Elliot, Art Garfunkel, the Everly Brothers, Claudine Longet, Bonnie Raitt, Dusty Springfield, Tom Odell, Nina Simone, Lynn Anderson, Wilson Pickett, Pat Boone, Neil Diamond and Peggy Lee, covered his songs and &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot; became an early standard.

In 1969, he did the orchestral arrangements for the songs &quot;Minstrel of the Dawn&quot; and &quot;Approaching Lavender&quot; on Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Sit Down Young Stranger&quot; (later renamed &quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;) (1970), and for Peggy Lee&#x27;s single &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;, as well as her album with the same title (which also contained her cover versions of two of his songs: &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;Linda&quot;). Also in 1969 he recorded &quot;Gone Dead Train&quot; for the 1970 movie and soundtrack album to &quot;Performance&quot;, starring Mick Jagger.

In 1970, Harry Nilsson recorded an entire album of Newman compositions (Newman played piano) called &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman.&quot; The album was not a commercial success, but critics liked it (it won a &quot;Record of the Year&quot; award from &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine), and it paved the way for Newman&#x27;s 1970 release, &quot;12 Songs&quot;, a more stripped-down sound that showcased Newman&#x27;s piano. Ry Cooder&#x27;s slide guitar and contributions from Byrds members Gene Parsons and Clarence White helped to give the album a much rootsier feel. &quot;12 Songs&quot; was also critically acclaimed (6th best album of the seventies according to &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau), but again found little commercial success, though Three Dog Night made a huge hit of his &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;. The following year, &quot;Randy Newman Live&quot; cemented his cult following and became his first LP to appear in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, at No. 191. Newman also made his first foray into music for films at this time, writing and performing the theme song &quot;He Gives Us All His Love&quot; for Norman Lear&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Cold Turkey.&quot;

1972&#x27;s &quot;Sail Away&quot; reached No. 163 on &quot;Billboard&quot;, with the title track making its way into the repertoire of Ray Charles and Linda Ronstadt. &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; which was covered by Three Dog Night, then Joe Cocker, and later by Keb Mo, Etta James, Tom Jones (whose version was later used for the final striptease to the 1997 film &quot;The Full Monty&quot;), and the Québécois singer Garou. The album also featured &quot;Burn On&quot;, an ode to an infamous incident in which the heavily polluted Cuyahoga River literally caught fire. In 1989, &quot;Burn On&quot; was used as the opening theme to the film &quot;Major League&quot;, whose focus was the hapless Cleveland Indians.

His 1974 release &quot;Good Old Boys&quot; was a set of songs about the American South. &quot;Rednecks&quot; began with a description of segregationist Lester Maddox pitted against a &quot;smart-ass New York Jew&quot; on a TV show (this was a joke, because the &quot;Jew&quot; was Dick Cavett), in a song that criticizes both southern racism and the complacent bigotry of Americans outside of the south who stereotype all southerners as racist yet ignore racism in northern and midwestern states and large cities. This ambiguity was also apparent on &quot;Kingfish&quot; and &quot;Every Man a King&quot;, the former a paean to Huey Long (the assassinated former Governor and United States Senator from Louisiana), the other a campaign song written by Long himself. An album that received lavish critical praise, &quot;Good Old Boys&quot; also became a commercial breakthrough for Newman, peaking at No. 36 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, spending 21 weeks there.

&quot;Little Criminals&quot; (1977) contained the surprise hit &quot;Short People&quot;, which also became a subject of controversy. In September 1977, the English music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported the following interview with Newman talking about his then-new release. &quot;There&#x27;s one song about a child murderer,&quot; Newman deadpans. &quot;That&#x27;s fairly optimistic. Maybe. There&#x27;s one called &#x27;Jolly Coppers on Parade&#x27; which isn&#x27;t an absolutely anti-police song. Maybe it&#x27;s even a fascist song. I didn&#x27;t notice at the time. There&#x27;s also one about me as a cowboy called &#x27;Rider in the Rain.&#x27; I think it&#x27;s ridiculous. The Eagles are on there. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about it. There&#x27;s also this song &#x27;Short People.&#x27; It&#x27;s purely a joke. I like other ones on the album better but the audiences go for that one.&quot; The album proved Newman&#x27;s most popular to date, reaching No. 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Another somewhat controversial Randy Newman number, recorded by both Harpers Bizarre and The Nashville Teens, was &quot;The Biggest Night of Her Life&quot;, a song about a schoolgirl who is &quot;too excited to sleep&quot; because she has promised to lose her virginity on her sixteenth birthday to a boy whom her parents like &quot;because his hair is always neat&quot;.

1979&#x27;s &quot;Born Again&quot; was relatively commercially and critically unsuccessful, with reviews criticizing its cynicism and bad taste and Rolling Stone comparing it unfavorably to &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; in a double review. 

His 1983 album &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; included the single &quot;I Love L.A.&quot;, a song that has been interpreted as both praising and criticizing the city of Los Angeles. This ambivalence is borne out by Newman&#x27;s own comments on the song. As he explained in a 2001 interview, &quot;There&#x27;s some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I&#x27;m proud of. The open car and the redhead, the Beach Boys ... I can&#x27;t think of anything a hell of a lot better than that.&quot; The ABC network and Frank Gari Productions transformed &quot;I Love L.A.&quot; into a popular 1980s TV promotional campaign, retooling the lyrics and title to &quot;You&#x27;ll Love It!&quot; (on ABC) The song is played at home games for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers as well as the Los Angeles Kings who use the song along with their goal horn. In spite of its prominence, however, it failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1985 Newman performed a set at the first Farm Aid concert that included a duet with Billy Joel on facing grand pianos. Newman performed &quot;Sail Away&quot;.

In 2003 Newman&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot; was used for season 2 of the USA Network&#x27;s show &quot;Monk&quot;; it won him the 2004 Emmy Award for Best Main Title Music.

In the years following &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, Newman focused more on film work, but his personal life entered a difficult period. He separated from his wife of nearly 20 years, Roswitha. He released four albums of new material as a singer-songwriter since that time: &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; (1988), &quot;Bad Love&quot; (1999), &quot;Harps and Angels&quot; (2008), and &quot;Dark Matter&quot; (2017). &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; included one of his best-known songs, &quot;It&#x27;s Money That Matters&quot; (featuring Mark Knopfler on guitar), and featured Newman&#x27;s first stab at autobiography with &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; and &quot;Four Eyes&quot;, while &quot;Bad Love&quot; included &quot;I Miss You&quot;, a moving tribute to his ex-wife He has also rerecorded a number of songs that span his career, accompanying himself on piano, with &quot;The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 1 (2003)&quot;, &quot;The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 2 (2011)&quot; and &quot;The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 3 (2016)&quot;. He continues to perform his songs before live audiences as a touring concert artist.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Newman&#x27;s &quot;Louisiana 1927&quot; became an anthem and was played heavily on a wide range of American radio and television stations, in both Newman&#x27;s 1974 original and Aaron Neville&#x27;s cover version of the song. The song addresses the deceitful manner in which New Orleans&#x27;s municipal government managed a flood in 1927, during which, as Newman asserts, &quot;The guys who ran the Mardi Gras, the bosses in New Orleans decided the course of that flood. You know, they cut a hole in the levee and it flooded the cotton fields.&quot; In a related performance, Newman contributed to the 2007 release of &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard), contributing his version of Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. Domino had been rescued from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Katrina, initially having been feared dead.

In October 2016, Newman released the song &quot;Putin&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;inspired by the Russian leader&#x27;s penchant for bare-chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that&#x27;s somewhat short of soft and cuddly, Newman has crafted a song that tells Putin&#x27;s story from multiple perspectives.&quot; Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in 2017, but he was putting out this song early because &quot;I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after the election... I&#x27;ve got the thing done. I just want to see what happens. I&#x27;m curious to see how the thing is received.&quot; The song earned Newman a Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.

Newman released his much anticipated new album, &quot;Dark Matter&quot; in August 2017. It received positive reviews, many citing its musical ambition as well as its lyrical bite.

===Film composer===
Newman&#x27;s earliest scoring work was for television, creating background music for a 1962 episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, and later working briefly on the 1960s TV shows &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, and &quot;Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea&quot; and more extensively on &quot;Judd For The Defense&quot;. In 1966, an album of Newman&#x27;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot; music appeared, credited to The Randy Newman Orchestra. The music was not a score from any episode, but incidental library music designed to be heard in contexts where characters turned on a radio station, or were watching TV. Newman claims to have been unaware of the album&#x27;s existence at the time of release and does not include it in the official &quot;complete discography&quot; on his website. He also co-wrote the title song for the 1970 drama &quot;Cover Me Babe&quot;. The recording was performed by Bread.

Newman also co-wrote pop songs for films as early as 1964, co-penning &quot;Look At Me&quot; with Bobby Darin for &quot;The Lively Set&quot; (1964), and &quot;Galaxy-a-Go-Go, or Leave It To Flint&quot; with Jerry Goldsmith for &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; (1966). However, Newman&#x27;s work as a composer of actual film scores began with Norman Lear&#x27;s 1971 satire &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;. He returned to film work with 1981&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot;, for which he was nominated for two Academy Awards. Newman co-wrote the 1986 film &quot;Three Amigos&quot; with Steve Martin and Lorne Michaels, wrote three songs for the film, and provided the voice for the singing bush.

Newman has scored nine Disney/Pixar feature films; &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, &quot;Monsters University&quot;, &quot;Cars 3&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;. He has earned at least one Academy Award nomination for seven of the nine films he has scored for Pixar, winning the award for &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, both times in the category of Best Original Song. Additional scores by Newman include &quot;Avalon&quot;, &quot;Parenthood&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, &quot;Awakenings&quot;, &quot;The Paper&quot;, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;. His score for &quot;Pleasantville&quot; was an Academy Award nominee. He also wrote the songs for Turner&#x27;s &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;.

In 1997, Randy was hired by director Wolfgang Petersen to do the soundtrack of the movie Air Force One, however he was rejected because Petersen thought that the score sounded like a parody. So Newman was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith and Joel McNeely who wrote the final score in 12 days. After the film’s premiere, several bootlegs of Newman’s rejected score were distributed. Composer Hans Zimmer once indicated that he considered these cues superior to any he had written at the time.

Newman had the dubious distinction of receiving the most Oscar nominations (15) without a single win. His losing streak was broken when he received the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2002, for the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; song &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot;, beating Sting, Enya and Paul McCartney. After receiving a standing ovation, a bemused but emotional Newman began his acceptance speech with &quot;I don&#x27;t want your pity!&quot; When the orchestra began playing the underscore signifying that the speaker&#x27;s time on stage is concluding, Newman ordered them to stop before thanking &quot;all these musicians, many of whom have worked for me several times and may not again.&quot;

Besides writing songs for films, he also writes songs for television series such as the Emmy Award-winning theme song of &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Jungle Out There&quot;. Newman also composed the Emmy Award-winning song &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; for the final episode.

Newman wrote the music for Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. During Disney&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting in March 2007, Newman performed a new song written for the movie. He was accompanied by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. The New Orleans setting of the film played to Newman&#x27;s musical strengths, and his songs contained elements of Cajun music, zydeco, blues and Dixieland jazz. Two of the songs, &quot;Almost There&quot; and &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;, were nominated for Oscars.

In total, Newman has received 22 Academy Award nominations with two wins, both for Best Original Song. While accepting the award for &quot;We Belong Together&quot; in 2011, he joked &quot;my percentages aren&#x27;t great.&quot;

===Musical theater===
A revue of Newman&#x27;s songs, titled &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Doing It Wrong&quot;, was performed at the Astor Place Theatre in New York City in 1982, and later at other theaters around the country. The New York cast featured Mark Linn-Baker and Deborah Rush, and at one point included Treat Williams.

In the 1990s, Newman adapted Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; into a concept album and musical, &quot;Randy Newman&#x27;s Faust&quot;. After a 1995 staging at the La Jolla Playhouse, he retained David Mamet to help rework the book before its relaunch on the Chicago Goodman Theatre mainstage in 1996. Newman&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; had a one-time Off-Broadway performance at the City Center in New York City on 1 July 2014, where Newman starred as the Devil.

In 2000, South Coast Repertory (SCR) produced &quot;The Education of Randy Newman&quot;, a musical theater piece that recreates the life of a songwriter who bears some resemblance to the actual Newman. Set in New Orleans and Los Angeles, it was modeled on the American autobiography, &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;.

In 2010, the Center Theatre Group staged &quot;Harps and Angels&quot;, a musical revue of the Randy Newman songbook, interspersed with narratives reflecting on Newman&#x27;s inspirations. The revue premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and included among other songs &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot;, &quot;Sail Away&quot;, &quot;Marie&quot;, &quot;Louisiana 1927&quot;, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend in Me&quot; and &quot;I Love L.A&quot;. The revue was directed by Jerry Zaks and featured Ryder Bach, Storm Large, Adriane Lenox, Michael McKean, Katey Sagal and Matthew Saldivar.

==Personal life==
Newman was married to German-born Roswitha Schmale from 1967 to 1985 and they had three sons: Eric, Amos and John. He has been married to Gretchen Preece since 1990, with whom he has two children, Patrick and Alice. Gretchen&#x27;s father is director Michael Preece.

Newman endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012 and wrote a satirical song about voting for white candidates.

==Accolades==

Newman has been nominated for 22 Academy Awards, winning two times – Best Original Song in 2002 for &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; from &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and again in 2011 for &quot;We Belong Together&quot; from &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. He has received three Emmys, seven Grammy Awards, and the Governor&#x27;s Award from the Recording Academy. Newman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2007, he was inducted as a Disney Legend. In 2010, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Newman was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. In September 2014, Newman received a Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award and performed at the annual film music gala Hollywood in Vienna for the first time together with his cousin David Newman.

<text>John Cameron Fogerty (born May 28, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. Together with Doug Clifford, Stu Cook, and his brother Tom Fogerty, he founded the swamp rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), for which he was the lead singer, lead guitarist, and principal songwriter. CCR had nine top-10 singles and eight gold albums between 1968 and 1972, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

Since CCR parted ways in 1972, Fogerty has had a successful solo career, which continues. He was listed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest Songwriters (at No. 40) and the list of 100 Greatest Singers (at No. 72). His songs include &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, &quot;Green River&quot;, &quot;Down on the Corner&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&quot;, &quot;Centerfield&quot;, &quot;The Old Man Down the Road&quot;, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;.

==Early life==
Fogerty was born in Berkeley, California, and grew up in El Cerrito, California, the third of five boys born to Galen Robert and Edith Lucile (Lytle) Fogerty. He is of Irish descent. His father was born in Iowa, and worked as a Linotype operator for the &quot;Berkeley Gazette&quot; in California. Lucile Fogerty taught second grade and was from Great Falls, Montana. John first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley, California. In his memoir, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing.

After one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. In his book, he stated that his parents were alcoholics and that they divorced when he was in the third or fourth grade. He later attended St. Mary&#x27;s High School, then transferred to El Cerrito High School, where he met the other future members of CCR and took guitar lessons from Berkeley Folk Festival creator/producer Barry Olivier. Fogerty&#x27;s older brother Tom was a guitarist and bandmate in the group that eventually became CCR. Fogerty spent summer vacations at Putah Creek, near Winters, California, which became the subject of the CCR song &quot;Green River&quot;.

While in junior high school in 1959, Fogerty formed a cover band with bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford called the Blue Velvets. The band was inspired by rock and roll pioneers, especially Little Richard and Bo Diddley. Later, Fogerty&#x27;s brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with Fantasy Records, which, without the band&#x27;s knowledge or approval, changed the band&#x27;s name from the Blue Velvets to The Golliwogs. This group recorded seven singles that were not commercially successful.

==Military service==
Fogerty received his draft notice for military service during the Vietnam War in 1966. The same day he received the notice, he went to a local United States Army Reserve recruiter, who signed him up immediately for training as a supply clerk. Fogerty believes the recruiter dated the paperwork to take effect before the draft letter arrived. During his time in the Army Reserve, Fogerty attended training at Fort Bragg, Fort Knox, and Fort Lee (now Fort Gregg-Adams). He completed his active duty for training in July 1967, then served as a part-time reservist until being discharged in 1968.

==Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968–1972)==
After Fogerty&#x27;s military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother&#x27;s place as lead singer. The band released their eponymous debut album and also had their first hit single, &quot;Susie Q&quot;. Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and the album &quot;Bayou Country&quot;.

Fogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band. These internal rifts, and Tom&#x27;s feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band&#x27;s future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;, released in April 1972, which included the band&#x27;s last two singles, the 1971 hit &quot;Sweet Hitch-Hiker&quot;, and &quot;Someday Never Comes&quot;, which made it into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 20.

Cook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, &quot;My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs.&quot; According to the two bandmates, Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or 
Fogerty would quit immediately. They accepted Fogerty&#x27;s ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status, though it generated weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.

The only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty&#x27;s wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion.

Even early in his career, “Fogerty&#x27;s attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. ...[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me... When you&#x27;re working, you&#x27;re supposed to be working.”

== Solo career ==
=== 1972–1985 ===
As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of country and western covers, on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.

The eponymous &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers&quot; was released in 1973; it spun off the top-20 hit &quot;Jambalaya&quot;, as well as a lesser hit in &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;. Fogerty, still using &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers&quot; name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: &quot;You Don&#x27;t Owe Me&quot; b/w &quot;Back in the Hills&quot; (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, failing to make the US Billboard Hot 100, though &quot;You Don&#x27;t Owe Me&quot; was a minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 79. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the &quot;Blue Ridge Rangers&quot; identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name. In early 1974, Fogerty released &quot;Comin&#x27; Down The Road&quot;—backed with the instrumental &quot;Ricochet&quot;.

His first official solo album, &quot;John Fogerty&quot;, was released in 1975. Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;, a No. 27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, the British rock band Status Quo recorded their version of &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;, which hit #3 in the UK and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries (although it did not make the Top 100 in the US). Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 Live Aid concert.

In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called &quot;Hoodoo&quot;. A single, &quot;You Got the Magic&quot; backed with &quot;Evil Thing&quot;, preceded the album&#x27;s release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by Asylum Records a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for &quot;Hoodoo&quot; sometime in the 1980s.

===1985–1997===

After a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty&#x27;s solo career re-emerged with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Centerfield&quot;, his first album for Warner Bros. Records, which had taken co-ownership of Asylum&#x27;s contract with Fogerty. &quot;Centerfield&quot; went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in &quot;The Old Man Down the Road&quot;. The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty.

Two songs on the album, &quot;Zanz Kant Danz&quot; and &quot;Mr. Greed&quot;, were believed to be attacks on Fogerty&#x27;s former boss at Fantasy Records, Saul Zaentz. &quot;Zanz Kant Danz&quot; was about a pig that cannot dance, but would &quot;steal your money&quot;. When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: &quot;Vanz Kant Danz&quot; (changing the lead character&#x27;s name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (&quot;Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty&quot;) claimed that &quot;The Old Man Down the Road&quot; shared the same chorus as &quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot;, a song from Fogerty&#x27;s days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights. Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions and also that sounding like himself was not plagiarizing. Fogerty then countersued for attorney fees (&quot;Fogerty v. Fantasy&quot;). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs.

On May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called &quot;John Fogerty&#x27;s All-Stars&quot;. The setlist consisted of rhythm and blues tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the &quot;Centerfield&quot; LP and the song &quot;No Love in You&quot; written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the Textones&#x27; debut album &quot;Midnight Mission&quot; and he later recorded with Textones&#x27; band leader Carla Olson. &quot;John Fogerty&#x27;s All-Stars&quot; was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&amp;M Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included Albert Lee, Booker T. Jones, Duck Dunn, Steve Douglas, and Prairie Prince.

The follow-up album to &quot;Centerfield&quot; was &quot;Eye of the Zombie&quot; in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor. Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. &quot;Eye of the Zombie&quot; took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the &quot;Eye of the Zombie&quot; tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, &quot;Change in the Weather&quot; was included in the setlist for his 2009 tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year&#x27;s solo release, &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again&quot;.

Fogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on HBO. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at Oakland Coliseum for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir on guitars, Randy Jackson on bass, and Steve Jordan on drums.

In 1990, his brother Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, survived by his second wife and six children. Tom contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. Specifically, he died from a tuberculosis infection. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company&#x27;s side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were barely speaking to each other. In fact, even in the brothers&#x27; very last conversation with each other, Tom at one point referred to Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s former manager Saul Zaentz as his &quot;best friend&quot;. Given that Zaentz had swindled the band out of millions of dollars and had just recently attempted to sue John, this revelation made it painfully difficult for John to reconcile with Tom. In the eulogy he delivered at Tom&#x27;s funeral, he said: &quot;We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock &#x27;n roll stars. We didn&#x27;t necessarily grow up.&quot;

Fogerty traveled to Mississippi in 1990 for inspiration, and visited the gravesite of blues legend Robert Johnson. According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert. At this time, visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation, the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for Charlie Patton, James “Son” Thomas, Mississippi Joe Callicott, Eugene Powell, and Lonnie Pitchford, and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.

Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony, citing the Zaentz lawsuit as a reason. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, and &quot;Green River&quot;. The other two surviving members were believed to have laughed it off in disappointment. During the induction speech, Springsteen said, &quot;As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. Funny, too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there.&quot;

===1997–present===

Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with &quot;Blue Moon Swamp&quot;. The layoff between &quot;Zombie&quot; and &quot;Swamp&quot; had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than &quot;Zombie&quot; and won the Grammy for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named &quot;Premonition&quot;, of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from &quot;Blue Moon Swamp&quot; titled &quot;Blue Moon Nights,&quot; was used in the 2002 film &quot;The Rookie&quot;.

On October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.

In 2004, Fogerty released &quot;Deja Vu All Over Again&quot; through DreamWorks Records, which had taken over distribution of Fogerty&#x27;s Warner catalog. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;The title track is Fogerty&#x27;s indictment of the Iraq War as another Vietnam, a senseless squandering of American lives and power&quot;. On the album, Fogerty squeezed ten songs into only 34 minutes.

The sale of Fantasy Records to Concord Records in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore royalty rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records&#x27; noncountry-music unit was absorbed by Geffen Records, which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was &quot;The Long Road Home&quot; (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert DVD were released the following year.

Fogerty&#x27;s touring schedule increased in the period after &quot;Deja Vu All Over Again&quot;. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the Vote for Change tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. swing states. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children&#x27;s group The Wiggles. Fogerty toured with John Mellencamp in the summer of 2005 and with Willie Nelson in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006, he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the Hammersmith Apollo theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During that leg, he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty performed at halftime at the Miami Dolphins/Detroit Lions game and at the Denver Broncos/Kansas City Chiefs halftime later that evening.

Fogerty was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005.

In 2005, Fogerty received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member B.B. King.

On June 23, 2007, Fogerty appeared at Glastonbury Festival, playing an hour-long set of 17 songs, mainly CCR classics. Introducing &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, Fogerty said he did not perform it at Woodstock as rumored, but wrote the song inspired by the event.

&quot;Revival&quot; was released October 2, 2007. Heavily promoted by the label, &quot;Revival&quot; debuted at No. 14 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with sales about 65,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Revival&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of 2008, but lost to the Foo Fighters.

On February 10, 2008, Fogerty appeared with Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard on the Grammy Awards show. Along with these rock icons and his regular touring band, he played his 1973 single &quot;Comin&#x27; Down The Road&quot;, leading into Lewis and Richard&#x27;s performances of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; and &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot;, respectively.

On March 16, 2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour. On March 22 in Point Nepean, Australia, surprise guest Keith Urban joined Fogerty on stage, performing two songs: &quot;Broken Down Cowboy&quot;, off Fogerty&#x27;s newest album &quot;Revival&quot;, and &quot;Cotton Fields&quot;, from CCR&#x27;s album &quot;Willy &amp; the Poor Boys.&quot;

On June 24, 2008, Fogerty made a return to the Royal Albert Hall, a venue he last played with CCR in 1971. It was the last concert on his 2008 European tour. This concert was filmed (causing staging problems that annoyed some fans) and was released in 2009.

On April 16, 2009, Fogerty performed his hit &quot;Centerfield&quot; from center field of the new Yankee Stadium, at its opening-day festivities.

On July 2, 3, and 4, 2009, Fogerty performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, which was sold out for these shows. Though billed as Fogerty with the L.A. Philharmonic, the orchestra began the night with music by U.S. composers, and Fogerty and his band came on after intermission, playing only three songs with the orchestra.

On August 31, 2009, Fogerty released &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again&quot;, a sequel to his 1973 solo debut &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers&quot;. The album includes a duet with Bruce Springsteen on the 1960 Everly Brothers classic &quot;When Will I Be Loved?&quot; In addition, Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit of Eagles sang with Fogerty on a cover of Rick Nelson&#x27;s 1972 classic &quot;Garden Party&quot;. The album was the first issued on Fogerty&#x27;s own label Fortunate Son Records, which is distributed by the Verve Forecast Records unit of Universal Music Group and also handles the Fogerty/CCR Fantasy catalogue.

On October 29, 2009, Fogerty appeared at Madison Square Garden for the first night of the celebratory 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts. Bruce Springsteen, with the E Street Band, called Fogerty out to play three songs with them. &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; was their first song, followed by &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, and finally the duo tried their take on Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. The show aired as a four-hour special on HBO on November 29, 2009.

On November 3, 2009, Fogerty released the Royal Albert Hall DVD entitled &quot;Comin&#x27; Down The Road&quot;, named after his 1973 single, which he performed at this concert. Fogerty was also nominated for a Grammy Award at the 2010 Grammys. He was nominated for the Best Rock Solo Vocal Performance Grammy for the song &quot;Change in the Weather&quot;, which he recorded for &quot;The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again&quot;.

For his songwriting achievements, Fogerty was honored as a Broadcast Music Incorporated Icon at the 58th annual BMI Pop Awards on May 18, 2010. BMI Icons are selected because of their &quot;unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers.&quot;

Fogerty began recording &quot;Wrote a Song for Everyone&quot; in 2011, which was released on Vanguard Records on May 28, 2013, his 68th birthday. The album is a collection of classics and tracks from his canon of hits performed with other artists. The album includes two new Fogerty-penned songs. On November 17, 2011, Fogerty performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. On November 17 and 18, Fogerty performed two CCR albums, &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; and &quot;Green River&quot;, respectively, in their entirety at the Beacon Theatre in New York City (he also played &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Factory&quot; in Atlantic City on November 20). He was also featured on the CBS coverage of the Thanksgiving Day Parade, performing several prerecorded songs.

In January 2012, Fogerty&#x27;s new song &quot;Swamp Water&quot; debuted over the opening credits of the new Fox TV series &quot;The Finder&quot;. Fogerty wrote the song for the show and guest-starred in its debut episode. On November 12, 2012, Fogerty announced that he was writing his memoirs, and that the book was expected to be released in 2015.

During the 2014 Veterans Days celebration, &quot;Salute to the Troops&quot; at the White House, Fogerty performed for many veterans.

On February 21, 2015, he was a featured artist for the National Hockey League stadium series game between the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose Sharks at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

In October 2015, Fogerty published his autobiography, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; (Little, Brown &amp; Co.).

In September 2017, Fogerty signed a new recording contract with BMG Rights Management, which will cover an upcoming album and his solo catalogue.

In November 2019, Fogerty appeared on Public Broadcasting Station pledge week with &quot;John Fogerty: My 50 Year Trip&quot;, a taped performance from Red Rocks Amphitheater, Colorado. His most recent performance was at the Winstar in Thackerville, Oklahoma, on December 31, 2019. The remaining performances of his current tour &quot;My 50 Year Trip&quot; have been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While on lockdown during the pandemic in early 2020, Fogerty, accompanied by sons Shane and Tyler and daughter Kelsy, began releasing performance videos of previously released originals and covers. Under the brand &quot;Fogerty&#x27;s Factory,&quot; the group performed remotely on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts, and SiriusXM&#x27;s Classic Vinyl station. Collecting seven songs from the remote performances, the &quot;Fogerty&#x27;s Factory&quot; EP was released on May 28, 2020, coinciding with Fogerty&#x27;s 75th birthday. A 12-track album edition featuring additional lockdown performances followed on November 20.

Fogerty performed backing vocals on &quot;Scream and Shout,&quot; a single by his sons&#x27; band Hearty Har, released October 19, 2020.

On January 6, 2021, Fogerty released &quot;Weeping in the Promised Land,&quot; a gospel-styled single, featuring sociopolitical commentary on Black Lives Matter, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Donald Trump.

<text>Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, or the Feast of Saint Patrick (), is a religious and cultural holiday held on 17 March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick (), the foremost patron saint of Ireland.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day was made an official Christian feast day in the early 17th century and is observed by the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion (especially the Church of Ireland), the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Lutheran Church. The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and, by extension, celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, céilithe, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. Christians who belong to liturgical denominations also attend church services. Historically, the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday&#x27;s tradition of mass alcohol consumption.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (for provincial government employees), and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Argentina, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, especially amongst Irish diaspora. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is celebrated in more countries than any other national festival. Modern celebrations have been greatly influenced by those of the Irish diaspora, particularly those that developed in North America. However, there has been criticism of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations for having become too commercialised and for fostering negative stereotypes of the Irish people.

==Saint Patrick==
Saint Patrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and Bishop in Ireland. Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the &quot;Declaration&quot;, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the &quot;Declaration&quot;, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland. It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he found God. The &quot;Declaration&quot; says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest.

According to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity. The &quot;Declaration&quot; says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted thousands.

Patrick&#x27;s efforts were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove &quot;snakes&quot;, heathen practices, out of Ireland, despite the fact that actual snakes were not known to inhabit the region.

Tradition holds that he died on 17 March and was buried at Downpatrick. Over the following centuries, many legends grew up around Patrick and he became Ireland&#x27;s foremost saint.

==Celebration and traditions==


Present day Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland.

Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, Irish traditional music sessions (céilithe), and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. There are also formal gatherings such as banquets and dances, although these were more common in the past. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades began in North America in the 18th century but did not spread to Ireland until the 20th century. The participants generally include marching bands, the military, fire brigades, cultural organisations, charitable organisations, voluntary associations, youth groups, fraternities, and so on. However, over time, many of the parades have become more akin to a carnival. More effort is made to use the Irish language, especially in Ireland, where 1 March to St Patrick&#x27;s Day on 17 March is Seachtain na Gaeilge (&quot;Irish language week&quot;).

Since 2010, famous landmarks have been lit up in green on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day as part of Tourism Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Global Greening Initiative&quot; or &quot;Going Green for St Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot;. The Sydney Opera House and the Sky Tower in Auckland were the first landmarks to participate and since then over 300 landmarks in fifty countries across the globe have gone green for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

Christians may also attend church services, and the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol are lifted for the day. Perhaps because of this, drinking alcohol – particularly Irish whiskey, beer, or cider – has become an integral part of the celebrations. In Ireland, this relaxation of fasting rules is notably marked by the consumption of stout, a dark ale beer that is a key part of the celebration, with breweries preparing months in advance for the demand. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day custom of &quot;drowning the shamrock&quot; or &quot;wetting the shamrock&quot; was historically popular. At the end of the celebrations, especially in Ireland, a shamrock is put into the bottom of a cup, which is then filled with whiskey, beer, or cider. It is then drunk as a toast to Saint Patrick, Ireland, or those present. The shamrock would either be swallowed with the drink or taken out and tossed over the shoulder for good luck.

Irish Government ministers travel abroad on official visits to various countries around Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day to promote Ireland.

===Wearing green and shamrocks===

On Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, it is customary to wear shamrocks, green clothing or green accessories. Saint Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish. This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, which may have aided St Patrick in his evangelisation efforts. Roger Homan writes, &quot;We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the &quot;triskele&quot; when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity&quot;. Patricia Monaghan says there is no evidence the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish. Jack Santino speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian contexticons of Saint Patrick often depict the saint &quot;with a cross in one hand and a sprig of shamrocks in the other&quot;.

The first association of the colour green with Ireland is from a legend in the 11th century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (The Book of the Taking of Ireland). It tells of Goídel Glas (Goídel the green), the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels and creator of the Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx). Goídel is bitten by a venomous snake but saved from death by Moses placing his staff on the snakebite, leaving him with a green mark. His descendants settle in Ireland, a land free of snakes. One of the first, Íth, visits Ireland after climbing the Tower of Hercules and being captivated by the sight of a beautiful green island in the distance.

The colour green was further associated with Ireland from the 1640s, when the green harp flag was used by the Irish Catholic Confederation. Later, James Connolly described this flag as representing &quot;the sacred emblem of Ireland&#x27;s unconquered soul&quot;. Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day since at least the 1680s. Since then, the colour green and its association with St Patrick&#x27;s Day have grown. The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, an Irish fraternity founded in about 1750, adopted green as its colour. The Order of St Patrick, an Anglo-Irish chivalric order founded in 1783, instead adopted blue as its colour, which led to blue being associated with Saint Patrick. In the 1790s, the colour green was adopted by the United Irishmen. This was a republican organisation—founded mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic members—who launched a rebellion in 1798 against British rule. Ireland was first called &quot;the Emerald Isle&quot; in &quot;When Erin First Rose&quot; (1795), a poem by a co-founder of the United Irishmen, William Drennan, which stresses the historical importance of green to the Irish. The phrase &quot;wearing of the green&quot; comes from a song of the same name about United Irishmen being persecuted for wearing green. The flags of the 1916 Easter Rising featured green, such as the Starry Plough banner and the Proclamation Flag of the Irish Republic. When the Irish Free State was founded in 1922, the government ordered all post boxes be painted green, with the slogan &quot;green paint for a green people&quot;; in 1924, the government introduced a green Irish passport.

The wearing of the &#x27;St Patrick&#x27;s Day Cross&#x27; was also a popular custom in Ireland until the early 20th century. These were a Celtic Christian cross made of paper that was &quot;covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre&quot;.

=== History ===
Saint Patrick&#x27;s feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. Saint Patrick&#x27;s feast day was finally placed on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in the early 1600s, due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, part of the Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints&#x27; feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint&#x27;s day to a time outside those periods. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day was officially observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s was perceived as the middle day of spring in the Irish calendar. People expected that weather would be improved following the festival, and farmers would begin planting potato.

== Modern era ==
In 1903, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day became an official public holiday in Ireland due to the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom parliament introduced by Irish MP James O&#x27;Mara.

The first Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Ireland was held in Waterford in 1903, hundreds of years after the first parade in North America. The week of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 1903 had been declared Irish Language Week by the Gaelic League and in Waterford they opted to have a procession on Sunday 15 March. The procession comprised the Mayor and members of Waterford Corporation, the Trades Hall, the various trade unions and bands who included the &#x27;Barrack St Band&#x27; and the &#x27;Thomas Francis Meagher Band&#x27;. The parade began at the premises of the Gaelic League in George&#x27;s St and finished in the Peoples Park, where the public were addressed by the Mayor and other dignitaries. On Tuesday 17 March, most Waterford businesses—including public houses—were closed and marching bands paraded as they had two days previously.

On Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 1916, the Irish Volunteers—an Irish nationalist paramilitary organisation—held parades throughout Ireland. The authorities recorded 38 St Patrick&#x27;s Day parades, involving 6,000 marchers, almost half of whom were reported to be armed. The following month, the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising against British rule. This marked the beginning of the Irish revolutionary period and led to the Irish War of Independence and Civil War. During this time, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in Ireland were muted, although the day was sometimes chosen to hold large political rallies.

The celebrations remained low-key after the creation of the Irish Free State; the only state-organized observance was a military procession and trooping of the colours, and an Irish-language mass attended by government ministers. In 1927, the Irish Free State government banned the selling of alcohol on St Patrick&#x27;s Day, although it remained legal in Northern Ireland. The ban was not repealed until 1961.

The first official, state-sponsored Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Dublin took place in 1931. Public St Patrick&#x27;s Day festivities in Ireland have been cancelled three times, all for public health reasons. In 2001, celebrations were postponed to May due to the foot-and-mouth outbreak, while in 2020 and 2021 they were cancelled outright due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Northern Ireland, the celebration of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day was affected by sectarian divisions. A majority of the population were Protestant Ulster unionists who saw themselves primarily as British, while a substantial minority were Catholic Irish nationalists who saw themselves primarily as Irish. Although it was a public holiday, Northern Ireland&#x27;s unionist government did not officially observe St Patrick&#x27;s Day. During the conflict known as the Troubles (late 1960s–late 1990s), public St Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations were rare and tended to be associated with the Catholic community. In 1976, loyalists detonated a car bomb outside a pub crowded with Catholics celebrating St Patrick&#x27;s Day in Dungannon; four civilians were killed and many injured. However, some Protestant unionists attempted to &#x27;re-claim&#x27; the festival, and in 1985 the Orange Order held its own Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade. Since the end of the conflict in 1998 there have been cross-community St Patrick&#x27;s Day parades in towns throughout Northern Ireland, which have attracted thousands of spectators.

In the mid-1990s the government of the Republic of Ireland began a campaign to use Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day to showcase Ireland and its culture. The government set up a group called St. Patrick&#x27;s Festival, with the aims of creating a world-class national festival and &quot;to project, internationally, an accurate image of Ireland as a creative, professional and sophisticated country with wide appeal&quot;. The first Saint Patrick&#x27;s Festival was held on 17 March 1996. In 1997, it became a three-day event, and by 2006, the festival was five days long. More than 675,000 people attended the 2009 parade, and that year&#x27;s festival saw almost 1 million visitors, who took part in festivities that included concerts, outdoor theatre performances, and fireworks. From 2006 to 2012 the Skyfest formed the centrepiece of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Festival.

The week around Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is &quot;Seachtain na Gaeilge&quot; (&quot;Irish Language Week&quot;), when more Irish language events are held and there is more effort to use the language.

Christian leaders in Ireland have expressed concern about the secularisation of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. In &quot;The Word&quot; magazine&#x27;s March 2007 issue, Fr Vincent Twomey wrote, &quot;It is time to reclaim St Patrick&#x27;s Day as a church festival&quot;. He questioned the need for &quot;mindless alcohol-fuelled revelry&quot; and concluded that &quot;it is time to bring the piety and the fun together&quot;.

One of the biggest celebrations outside the cities is in Downpatrick, County Down, where Saint Patrick is said to be buried. The shortest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in the world formerly took place in Dripsey, County Cork. The parade lasted just 23.4 metres and traveled between the village&#x27;s two pubs. The tradition began in 1999, but ended after five years when one of the pubs closed. The current shortest Saint Paddy&#x27;s Day parade has been held in Little Compton, Rhode Island since 2022. The parade lasts only 89 feet. The title is disputed by Hot Springs, Arkansas which has hosted the shortest St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade since 2004, measuring at 98 feet.

==Celebrations elsewhere==
===Europe===

====England==== 

In England, the Royal Colonel or Colonel-in-chief traditionally present bowls of shamrock to members of the Irish Guards, a regiment in the British Army, following Queen Alexandra introducing the tradition in 1901. Since 2012, the Duchess of Cambridge has presented the bowls of shamrock to the Irish Guards. While female royals are often tasked with presenting the bowls of shamrock, male royals have also undertaken the role, such as King George VI in 1950 to mark the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Irish Guards, and in 2016 the Duke of Cambridge in place of his wife. Fresh Shamrocks are presented to the Irish Guards, regardless of where they are stationed, and are flown in from Ireland.

While some Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations could be conducted openly in Britain pre 1960s, this would change following the commencement by the IRA&#x27;s bombing campaign on mainland Britain and as a consequence this resulted in a suspicion of all things Irish and those who supported them which led to people of Irish descent wearing a sprig of shamrock on Saint Patrick&#x27;s day in private or attending specific events. Today after many years following the Good Friday Agreement, people of Irish descent openly wear a sprig of shamrock to celebrate their Irishness.

Christian denominations in Great Britain observing his feast day include The Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.

Birmingham holds the largest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Britain with a city centre parade over a two-mile (3 km) route through the city centre. The organisers describe it as the third biggest parade in the world after Dublin and New York.

London, since 2002, has had an annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade which takes place on weekends around the 17th, usually in Trafalgar Square. In 2008, the water in the Trafalgar Square fountains was dyed green. In 2020, the parade was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Liverpool has the highest proportion of residents with Irish ancestry of any English city. This has led to a long-standing celebration on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in terms of music, cultural events and the parade.

Manchester hosts a two-week Irish festival in the weeks prior to Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. The festival includes an Irish Market based at the city&#x27;s town hall which flies the Irish tricolour opposite the Union Flag, a large parade as well as a large number of cultural and learning events throughout the two-week period.

====Malta====
The first Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in Malta took place in the early 20th century by soldiers of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who were stationed in Floriana. Celebrations were held in the Balzunetta area of the town, which contained a number of bars and was located close to the barracks. The Irish diaspora in Malta continued to celebrate the feast annually.

Today, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is mainly celebrated in Spinola Bay and Paceville areas of St Julian&#x27;s, although other celebrations still occur at Floriana and other locations. Thousands of Maltese attend the celebrations, &quot;which are more associated with drinking beer than traditional Irish culture.&quot;

====Norway====
Norway has had a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Oslo since 2000, first organized by Irish expatriates living in Norway, and partially coordinated with the Irish embassy in Oslo.

====Russia====

The first Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Russia took place in 1992. Since 1999, there has been a yearly &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; festival in Moscow and other Russian cities. The official part of the Moscow parade is a military-style parade and is held in collaboration with the Moscow government and the Irish embassy in Moscow. The unofficial parade is held by volunteers and resembles a carnival. In 2014, Moscow Irish Week was celebrated from 12 to 23 March, which includes Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day on 17 March. Over 70 events celebrating Irish culture in Moscow, St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Voronezh, and Volgograd were sponsored by the Irish Embassy, the Moscow City Government, and other organisations.

In 2017, the Russian Orthodox Church added the feast day of Saint Patrick to its liturgical calendar, to be celebrated on .

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a large Irish expatriate community. The community established the Sarajevo Irish Festival in 2015, which is held for three days around and including Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. The festival organizes an annual a parade, hosts Irish theatre companies, screens Irish films and organizes concerts of Irish folk musicians. The festival has hosted numerous Irish artists, filmmakers, theatre directors and musicians such as Conor Horgan, Ailis Ni Riain, Dermot Dunne, Mick Moloney, Chloë Agnew and others.

====Scotland====

The Scottish town of Coatbridge, where the majority of the town&#x27;s population are of Irish descent, also has a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Festival which includes celebrations and parades in the town centre.

Glasgow has a considerably large Irish population; due, for the most part, to the Irish immigration during the 19th century. This immigration was the main cause in raising the population of Glasgow by over 100,000 people. Due to this large Irish population, there are many Irish-themed pubs and Irish interest groups who hold yearly celebrations on Saint Patrick&#x27;s day in Glasgow. Glasgow has held a yearly Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade and festival since 2007.

====Spain====
Madrid, Barcelona, A Coruña and Benidorm are the biggest cities where great celebrations take place in Spain, but some other smaller cities have started to host Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in recent years, such as El Espinar, Caldas de Reyes, Pontevedra, Salamanca, Elda, Valladolid and Maspalomas.

====Switzerland====
While Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in Switzerland is commonly celebrated on 17 March with festivities similar to those in neighbouring central European countries, it is not unusual for Swiss students to organise celebrations in their own living spaces on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Eve. Most popular are usually those in Zurich&#x27;s Kreis 4. Traditionally, guests also contribute with beverages and dress in green.

====Lithuania====
Although it is not a national holiday in Lithuania, the Vilnia River is dyed green every year on the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in the capital Vilnius.

===Americas===
====Canada====

One of the longest-running and largest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day () parades in North America occurs each year in Montreal, whose city flag includes a shamrock in its lower-right quadrant. The yearly celebration has been organised by the United Irish Societies of Montreal since 1929. The parade has been held yearly without interruption since 1824. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day itself, however, has been celebrated in Montreal since as far back as 1759 by Irish soldiers in the Montreal Garrison following the British conquest of New France.

In Saint John, New Brunswick Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is celebrated as a week-long celebration. Shortly after the JP Collins Celtic Festival is an Irish festival celebrating Saint John&#x27;s Irish heritage. The festival is named for a young Irish doctor James Patrick Collins who worked on Partridge Island (Saint John County) quarantine station tending to sick Irish immigrants before he died there himself.

In Manitoba, the Irish Association of Manitoba runs a yearly three-day festival of music and culture based around Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

In 2004, the CelticFest Vancouver Society organised its first yearly festival in downtown Vancouver to celebrate the Celtic Nations and their cultures. This event, which includes a parade, occurs each year during the weekend nearest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

In Quebec City, there was a parade from 1837 to 1926. The Quebec City St-Patrick Parade returned in 2010 after more than 84 years. For the occasion, a portion of the New York Police Department Pipes and Drums were present as special guests.

There has been a parade held in Toronto since at least 1863.

The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team was known as the Toronto St. Patricks from 1919 to 1927, and wore green jerseys. In 1999, when the Maple Leafs played on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, they wore green St Patrick&#x27;s retro uniforms.

Some groups, notably Guinness, have lobbied to make Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day a national holiday.

In March 2009, the Calgary Tower changed its top exterior lights to new green CFL bulbs just in time for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Part of an environmental non-profit organisation&#x27;s campaign (Project Porchlight), the green represented environmental concerns. Approximately 210 lights were changed in time for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, and resembled a Leprechaun&#x27;s hat. After a week, white CFLs took their place. The change was estimated to save the Calgary Tower some $12,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 104 tonnes.

Since 2019, the City of Waterloo, Ontario has had to contend with an ever-growing massive street party that has coincided with the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations. In 2023, police could be seen putting fences up on Ezra Avenue to discourage partiers to participate in the unauthorized event that has cost the city as much as $750,000 a year for police, paramedics, and municipal services.

====United States====
Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, while not a legal holiday in the United States, is nonetheless widely recognised and observed throughout the country as a celebration of Irish and Irish-American culture. Celebrations include prominent displays of the colour green, religious observances, numerous parades, and copious consumption of alcohol. The holiday has been celebrated in what is now the U.S. since 1600, with the first parade occurring in 1601.

It is customary for the Irish Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) to meet with the President of the United States on or around Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Traditionally the Taoiseach presents the US president a Waterford Crystal bowl filled with shamrocks. This tradition began in 1952 when the Irish Ambassador to the US, John Hearne, sent a box of shamrocks to President Harry S. Truman. From then it became a yearly custom for the Irish ambassador to send Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day shamrocks to an official in the US President&#x27;s administration, although on some occasions the shamrocks were given personally by the Irish Taoiseach or Irish President to the US president in Washington. After the meeting between Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and President Bill Clinton in 1994, the presenting of the shamrocks became a yearly custom.

====Mexico====
The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion is honored in Mexico on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

====Argentina====

In Buenos Aires, a party is held in the downtown street of Reconquista, where there are several Irish pubs; in 2006, there were 50,000 people in this street and the pubs nearby. Neither the Catholic Church nor the Irish community, the fifth largest in the world outside Ireland, take part in the organisation of the parties.

====Montserrat====
The island of Montserrat is known as the &quot;Emerald Island of the Caribbean&quot; because of its founding by Irish refugees from Saint Kitts and Nevis. Montserrat is one of three places where Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is a public holiday, along with Ireland and the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The holiday in Montserrat also commemorates a failed slave uprising that occurred on 17 March 1768.

=== Oceania ===
====Australia====

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is not a public holiday in Australia, although it is celebrated each year across the country&#x27;s states and territories. Festivals and parades are often held on weekends around 17 March in cities such as Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Melbourne. On occasion, festivals and parades are cancelled. For instance, Melbourne&#x27;s 2006 and 2007 Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day festivals and parades were cancelled due to sporting events (Commonwealth Games and Australian Grand Prix) being booked on and around the planned Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day festivals and parades in the city. In Sydney the parade and family day was cancelled in 2016 due to financial problems. However, Brisbane&#x27;s Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, which was cancelled at the outbreak of World War II and wasn&#x27;t revived until 1990, was not called off in 2020 as precaution for the COVID-19 pandemic, in contrast to many other Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades around the world.

The first mention of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day being celebrated in Australia was in 1795, when Irish convicts and administrators, Catholic and Protestant, in the penal colony came together to celebrate the day as a national holiday, despite a ban against assemblies being in place at the time. This unified day of Irish nationalist observance would soon dissipate over time, with celebrations on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day becoming divisive between religions and social classes, representative more of Australianness than of Irishness and held intermittingly throughout the years. Historian Patrick O&#x27;Farrell credits the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and Archbishop Daniel Mannix of Melbourne for re-igniting St Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in Australia and reviving the sense of Irishness amongst those with Irish heritage. The organisers of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s festivities in the past were, more often than not, the Catholic clergy which often courted controversy. Bishop Patrick Phelan of Sale described in 1921 how the authorities in Victoria had ordered that a Union Jack be flown at the front of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade and following the refusal by Irishmen and Irish-Australians to do so, the authorities paid for an individual to carry the flag at the head of the parade. This individual was later assaulted by two men who were later fined in court.

====New Zealand====
From 1878 to 1955, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day was recognised as a public holiday in New Zealand, together with St George&#x27;s Day (England) and St Andrew&#x27;s Day (Scotland). Auckland attracted many Irish migrants in the 1850s and 1860s, and it was here where some of the earliest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations took place, which often entailed the hosting of community picnics. However, this rapidly evolved from the late 1860s onwards to include holding parades with pipe bands and marching children wearing green, sporting events, concerts, balls and other social events, where people displayed their Irishness with pride. While Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day is no longer recognised as a public holiday, it continues to be celebrated across New Zealand with festivals and parades at weekends on or around 17 March.

===Asia===

Saint Patrick&#x27;s parades are now held in many locations across Japan. The first parade, in Tokyo, was organised by The Irish Network Japan (INJ) in 1992.

The Irish Association of Korea has celebrated Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day since 1976 in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. The place of the parade and festival has been moved from Itaewon and Daehangno to Cheonggyecheon.

In Malaysia, the St Patrick&#x27;s Society of Selangor, founded in 1925, organises a yearly St Patrick&#x27;s Ball, described as the biggest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration in Asia. Guinness Anchor Berhad also organises 36 parties across the country in places like the Klang Valley, Penang, Johor Bahru, Malacca, Ipoh, Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu, Miri and Kuching.

===UN Peacekeeping Missions===
Irish United Nations (UN) peacekeepers also celebrating Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day outside Ireland during their participation in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-raged countries.

===International Space Station===

Astronauts on board the International Space Station have celebrated the festival in different ways. Irish-American Catherine Coleman played a hundred-year-old flute belonging to Matt Molloy and a tin whistle belonging to Paddy Moloney, both members of the Irish music group The Chieftains, while floating weightless in the space station on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in 2011. Her performance was later included in a track called &quot;The Chieftains in Orbit&quot; on the group&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;Voice of Ages&quot;.

Chris Hadfield took photographs of Ireland from Earth orbit, and a picture of himself wearing green clothing in the space station, and posted them online on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in 2013. He also posted online a recording of himself singing &quot;Danny Boy&quot; in space.

==Criticism==
Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations have been criticised, particularly for their association with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Some argue that the festivities have become too commercialised and tacky, and have strayed from their original purpose of honouring Saint Patrick and Irish heritage. Irish American journalist Niall O&#x27;Dowd has criticised attempts to recast Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day as a celebration of multiculturalism rather than a celebration of Irishness.
Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations have also been criticised for fostering demeaning stereotypes of Ireland and Irish people. An example is the wearing of &#x27;leprechaun outfits&#x27;, which are based on derogatory 19th century caricatures of the Irish. In the run up to Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 2014, the Ancient Order of Hibernians successfully campaigned to stop major American retailers from selling novelty merchandise that promoted negative Irish stereotypes.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations outside Ireland have been described by critics as displays of &quot;Plastic Paddyness&quot;; where foreigners appropriate and misrepresent Irish culture, claim Irish identity, and enact Irish stereotypes.

LGBT groups in the US were long banned from marching in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades in New York City and Boston, resulting in the landmark Supreme Court decision of &quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot;. In New York City, the ban was lifted in 2014, but LGBT groups still find that barriers to participation exist. In Boston, the ban on LGBT group participation was lifted in 2015.

<text>John J. Mellencamp (born October 7, 1951), previously known as Johnny Cougar, John Cougar, and John Cougar Mellencamp, is an American singer-songwriter. He is known for his brand of heartland rock, which emphasizes traditional instrumentation. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, followed by an induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.

Mellencamp found success in the 1980s starting in 1982, with a string of Top 10 singles, including &quot;Hurts So Good,&quot; &quot;Jack &amp; Diane,&quot; &quot;Crumblin&#x27; Down,&quot; &quot;Pink Houses,&quot; &quot;Lonely Ol&#x27; Night,&quot; &quot;Small Town,&quot; &quot;R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,&quot; &quot;Paper in Fire&quot;, and &quot;Cherry Bomb.&quot; He has scored fourteen Top 20 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most songs by a solo artist to hit number one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with seven. Mellencamp has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning one. He has sold over 60 million albums worldwide, with 30 million in the US. His latest album of original songs, &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, was released in June 2023.

Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of Farm Aid, an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in Champaign, Illinois to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 39 years, and the organization has raised nearly $80 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture.

==Early life==
Mellencamp was born in Seymour, Indiana on October 7, 1951. He is of German and Dutch ancestry. He was born with spina bifida, for which he had corrective surgery as an infant. Mellencamp formed his first band, Crepe Soul, when he was 14.

Mellencamp attended Vincennes University in Vincennes, Indiana, starting in 1972. 

During his college years, Mellencamp played in several local bands, including the glam rock band Trash, which was named for a New York Dolls song, and he later got a job in Seymour installing telephones. During this period, Mellencamp decided to pursue a career in music and traveled to New York City in an attempt to land a record contract.

==Music career==
===1976–1982: Performing as Johnny Cougar and John Cougar===
After 18 months of traveling between Indiana and New York City in 1974 and 1975, Mellencamp met Tony DeFries of MainMan Management, who was receptive to his music and image. DeFries insisted that Mellencamp&#x27;s first album, &quot;Chestnut Street Incident&quot;, a collection of cover versions and some original songs, be released under the stage name &quot;Johnny Cougar&quot;, claiming that the name &quot;Mellencamp&quot; was too hard to market. Mellencamp reluctantly agreed, but the album was a commercial failure, selling only 12,000 copies.

Mellencamp recorded &quot;The Kid Inside&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Chestnut Street Incident&quot;, in 1977. However, DeFries eventually decided against releasing the album, and Mellencamp was dropped from MCA records (DeFries finally released &quot;The Kid Inside&quot; in early 1983, after Mellencamp achieved stardom). Mellencamp drew interest from Rod Stewart&#x27;s manager, Billy Gaff, after parting ways with DeFries and was signed onto the small Riva Records label. At Gaff&#x27;s request, Mellencamp moved to London, England, for nearly a year to record, promote, and tour behind 1978&#x27;s &quot;A Biography&quot;. The record wasn&#x27;t released in the United States, but it yielded a top-five hit in Australia with &quot;I Need a Lover.&quot; Riva Records added &quot;I Need a Lover&quot; to Mellencamp&#x27;s next album released in the United States, 1979&#x27;s &quot;John Cougar&quot;, where the song became a No. 28 single in late 1979. Pat Benatar recorded &quot;I Need a Lover&quot; on her debut album &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

In 1980, Mellencamp returned with the Steve Cropper-produced &quot;Nothin&#x27; Matters and What If It Did&quot;, which yielded two Top 40 singles – &quot;This Time&quot; (No. 27) and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Even Done With the Night&quot; (No. 17). &quot;The singles were stupid little pop songs,&quot; he told &quot;Record Magazine&quot; in 1983.

In 1982, Mellencamp released his breakthrough album, &quot;American Fool&quot;, which contained the singles &quot;Hurts So Good,&quot; an uptempo rock tune that spent four weeks at No. 2 and 16 weeks in the top 10, and &quot;Jack &amp; Diane,&quot; which was a No. 1 hit for four weeks. A third single, &quot;Hand to Hold on To,&quot; made it to No. 19. &quot;Hurts So Good&quot; went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 25th Grammys.

===1983–1990: Performing as John Cougar Mellencamp===
With some commercial success under his belt, Mellencamp had enough influence to force the record company to add his real surname, Mellencamp, to his stage moniker. The first album recorded under his new name John Cougar Mellencamp was 1983&#x27;s &quot;Uh-Huh&quot;, a Top-10 album that spawned the Top 10 singles &quot;Pink Houses&quot; and &quot;Crumblin&#x27; Down&quot; as well as the No. 15 hit &quot;Authority Song,&quot; which he said is &quot;our version of &#x27;I Fought the Law.&#x27;&quot; During the recording of &quot;Uh-Huh&quot;, Mellencamp&#x27;s backing band settled on the lineup it retained for the next several albums: Kenny Aronoff on drums and percussion, Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic on guitars, Toby Myers on bass and John Cascella on keyboards. In 1988, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called this version of Mellencamp&#x27;s band &quot;one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled.&quot; On the 1984 Uh-Huh Tour, Mellencamp opened his shows with cover versions of songs he admired growing up, including Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; the Animals&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; Lee Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Ya Ya,&quot; and the Left Banke&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Ballerina.&quot;

In 1985, Mellencamp released &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in the fall of 1985 and spawned five Top 40 singles: &quot;Lonely Ol&#x27; Night&quot; and &quot;Small Town&quot; (both No. 6), &quot;R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.&quot; (No. 2), &quot;Rain on the Scarecrow&quot; (No. 21) and &quot;Rumble Seat&quot; (No. 28). According to the February 1986 edition of &quot;Creem Magazine&quot;, Mellencamp wanted to incorporate the sound of classic &#x27;60s rock into &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, and he gave his band close to a hundred old singles to learn &quot;almost mathematically verbatim&quot; prior to recording the album.

&quot;Scarecrow&quot; was the first album Mellencamp recorded at his own recording studio, jokingly dubbed &quot;Belmont Mall,&quot; located in Belmont, Indiana, and constructed in 1984. Mellencamp sees &quot;Scarecrow&quot; as the start of the alternative country genre: &quot;I think I invented that whole &#x27;No Depression&#x27; thing with the &quot;Scarecrow&quot; album, though I don&#x27;t get the credit.&quot;

In the liner notes to Mellencamp&#x27;s 2010 box set &quot;On the Rural Route 7609&quot;, Anthony DeCurtis wrote of Mellencamp&#x27;s influence on the No Depression movement:

Shortly after finishing &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, Mellencamp helped organize the first Farm Aid benefit concert with Willie Nelson and Neil Young in Champaign, Illinois on September 22, 1985. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 39 years, and the organization has raised nearly $80 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture.

Prior to the 1985–86 Scarecrow Tour, during which he covered some of the same 1960s rock and soul songs he and his band rehearsed prior to the recording of &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, Mellencamp added fiddle player Lisa Germano to his band. Germano would remain in Mellencamp&#x27;s band until 1994 when she left to pursue a solo career.

Mellencamp&#x27;s next studio album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Lonesome Jubilee&quot;, included the singles &quot;Paper in Fire&quot; (No. 9), &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; (No. 8), &quot;Check It Out&quot; (No. 14), and &quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; (No. 61) along with the popular album tracks &quot;Hard Times for an Honest Man&quot; and &quot;The Real Life&quot;, both of which cracked the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. As Frank DiGiacomo of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote in 2007, &quot;&quot;The Lonesome Jubilee&quot; was the album in which Mellencamp defined his now signature sound: a rousing, crystalline mix of acoustic and electric guitars, Appalachian fiddle, and gospel-style backing vocals, anchored by a crisp, bare-knuckle drumbeat and completed by his own velveteen rasp.&quot;

During the 1987–88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour, Mellencamp was joined onstage by surprise guest Bruce Springsteen at the end of his May 26, 1988, gig in Irvine, California, for a duet of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; which Mellencamp performed as the penultimate song during each show on that tour.

In 1989, Mellencamp released the personal album &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, with the key tracks &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, &quot;Big Daddy of Them All&quot;, and &quot;Void in My Heart&quot; accompanying the Top 15 single &quot;Pop Singer&quot;. The album, which Mellencamp called at the time the most &quot;earthy&quot; record he&#x27;d ever made, is also the last to feature the &quot;Cougar&quot; moniker. In 1991, Mellencamp said: &quot;&#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; was the best record I ever made. Out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs. You can&#x27;t be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that album.&quot;

Mellencamp was heavily involved in painting at this time in his life and decided not to tour behind &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. In his second painting exhibition, at the Churchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery in Indianapolis in 1990, Mellencamp&#x27;s portraits were described as always having sad facial expressions and conveying &quot;the same disillusionment found in his musical anthems about the nation&#x27;s heartland and farm crisis.&quot;

===1991–1997: Performing as John Mellencamp===
Mellencamp&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Whenever We Wanted&quot;, was the first with a cover billed to John Mellencamp; the &quot;Cougar&quot; was finally dropped for good. &quot;Whenever We Wanted&quot; yielded the Top 40 hits &quot;Get a Leg Up&quot; and &quot;Again Tonight,&quot; but &quot;Last Chance,&quot; &quot;Love and Happiness,&quot; and &quot;Now More Than Ever&quot; all garnered significant airplay on rock radio.

In 1993, he released &quot;Human Wheels&quot;, and the title track peaked at No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart. &quot;To me, this record is very urban,&quot; Mellencamp told Billboard magazine of &quot;Human Wheels&quot; in the summer of 1993.

Mellencamp&#x27;s 1994 &quot;Dance Naked&quot; album included a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Wild Night&quot; as a duet with Meshell Ndegeocello. &quot;Wild Night&quot; became Mellencamp&#x27;s biggest hit in years, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album also contained two protest songs in, &quot;L.U.V.&quot; and &quot;Another Sunny Day 12/25&quot;, in addition to the title track, which hit No. 41 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1994.

With guitarist Andy York now on board as Larry Crane&#x27;s full-time replacement, Mellencamp launched his Dance Naked Tour in the summer of 1994 but had a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8 of that year. That heart attack eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of the tour. He returned to the concert stage in early 1995 by playing a series of dates in small Midwestern clubs under the pseudonym Pearl Doggy.

In September 1996, the experimental album &quot;Mr. Happy Go Lucky&quot;, which was produced by Junior Vasquez, was released to critical acclaim. &quot;Mr. Happy Go Lucky&quot; spawned the No. 14 single &quot;Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)&quot; (Mellencamp&#x27;s last Top 40 hit) and &quot;Just Another Day,&quot; which peaked at No. 46.

===1998–2003: Recording for Columbia===
After the release of &quot;Mr. Happy Go Lucky&quot; and a subsequent four-month tour from March to July 1997 to promote it, Mellencamp signed a four-album deal with Columbia Records, although he wound up making only three albums for the label.

Issued a day before his 47th birthday in 1998, his self-titled debut for Columbia Records included the singles &quot;Your Life Is Now&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Running Anymore,&quot; along with standout album tracks such as &quot;Eden Is Burning,&quot; &quot;Miss Missy,&quot; &quot;It All Comes True&quot; and &quot;Chance Meeting at the Tarantula&quot;. The switch in labels coincided with Dane Clark replacing Aronoff on drums.

In 1999, Mellencamp covered his own songs as well as those by Bob Dylan and the Drifters for his album &quot;Rough Harvest&quot; (recorded in 1997), one of two albums he owed Mercury Records to fulfill his contract (the other was &quot;The Best That I Could Do&quot;, a best-of collection). In May 2000, he gave the Indiana University commencement address, in which he advised graduates to &quot;play it as you feel it!&quot; and that &quot;you&#x27;ll be all right.&quot; Following the delivery of his address, Indiana University bestowed upon him an honorary Doctorate of Musical Arts.

In August 2000, Mellencamp played a series of unannounced free concerts in major cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest as a way of giving back to fans who had supported him the previous 24 years. With a lo-fi setup that included portable amps and a battery-powered P.A. system, Mellencamp, armed with an acoustic guitar and accompanied only by an accordionist and a violist, dubbed the jaunt &quot;Live in the Streets: The Good Samaritan Tour.&quot; At these dozen shows, which ranged from 45 to 60 minutes, Mellencamp covered several rock and folk classics and sprinkled in a few of his own songs.

In the early 21st century, Mellencamp teamed up with artists such as Chuck D and India.Arie to deliver his second Columbia album, &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads&quot; and the single &quot;Peaceful World&quot;. &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads&quot; also included a duet with Trisha Yearwood on a love song called &quot;Deep Blue Heart&quot;.

Mellencamp embarked on the Cuttin&#x27; Heads Tour in the summer of 2001, before the album was even released. He opened each show on this tour with a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and also played a solo acoustic version of the &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads&quot; track &quot;Women Seem&quot; at each show.

In October 2002, Mellencamp performed the Robert Johnson song &quot;Stones in My Passway&quot; at two benefit concerts for his friend, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine editor-in-chief Timothy White, who died from a heart attack in 2002.

Columbia Records executives, who were in attendance at the benefit shows, were so impressed with Mellencamp&#x27;s live renditions of &quot;Stones in My Passway&quot; that they convinced him to record an album of vintage American songs, which ultimately became &quot;Trouble No More&quot;. The album was a quickly recorded collection of folk and blues covers originally done by artists such as Robert Johnson, Son House, Lucinda Williams and Hoagy Carmichael. &quot;Trouble No More&quot; was released in 2003, dedicated to Mellencamp&#x27;s friend Timothy White, and spent several weeks at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Blues Album charts. Mellencamp sang the gospel song &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken&quot; at White&#x27;s funeral on July 2, 2002.

===2004–2007: &quot;Words and Music&quot; and &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;===
Mellencamp participated in the Vote for Change tour in October 2004 leading up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election. That same month he released the two-disc career hits retrospective &quot;Words &amp; Music: John Mellencamp&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, which contained 35 of his radio singles (including all 22 of his Top 40 hits) along with two new tunes, &quot;Walk Tall&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot; – both produced by Babyface but written by Mellencamp.

In 2005, Mellencamp toured with Donovan and John Fogerty. The first leg of what was called the Words and Music Tour in the spring of 2005 featured Donovan playing in the middle of Mellencamp&#x27;s set. Mellencamp would play a handful of songs before introducing Donovan and then duetting with him on the 1966 hit &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;. Mellencamp would leave the stage as Donovan played seven or eight of his songs (backed by Mellencamp&#x27;s band) and then return to finish off his own set after Donovan departed. On the second leg of the tour in the summer of 2005, Fogerty co-headlined with Mellencamp at outdoor amphitheaters across the United States. Fogerty would join Mellencamp for duets on Fogerty&#x27;s Creedence Clearwater Revival hit &quot;Green River&quot; and Mellencamp&#x27;s &quot;Rain on the Scarecrow&quot;.

Mellencamp released &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;, his first album of original material in over five years, on January 23, 2007. He intended for &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot; to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary. &quot;Our Country,&quot; the first single from &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;, was played as the opening song on Mellencamp&#x27;s 2006 spring tour, and the band that opened for him on that tour, Little Big Town, was called on to record harmonies on the studio version of &quot;Our Country&quot;, as well as seven other songs on &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;.

Although Mellencamp had always been outspoken and adamant about not selling any of his songs to corporations for commercial use, he changed his stance and let Chevrolet use &quot;Our Country&quot; in Chevy Silverado TV commercials that began airing in late September 2006. 

Mellencamp sang &quot;Our Country&quot; to open Game 2 of the 2006 World Series, and the song was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance category but lost to Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Radio Nowhere.&quot; &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot; peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart by selling 56,000 copies in its first week on the market.

===2008–2013: The T Bone Burnett Era===
On August 13, 2007, Mellencamp began recording his 18th album of original material, titled &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot;. The album, released on July 15, 2008, was produced by T Bone Burnett. The first song with video, &quot;Jena,&quot; was introduced on Mellencamp&#x27;s website in October 2007. In an interview with the &quot;Bloomington Herald-Times&quot; in March 2008, Mellencamp dubbed &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot; The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;My Sweet Love&quot;. A video for the song was filmed in Savannah, Georgia, on June 9, 2008. Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town is featured in the video. She harmonizes with Mellencamp on &quot;My Sweet Love&quot;. She also provides background vocals to three other songs on &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot;, which became the ninth Top 10 album of Mellencamp&#x27;s career when it debuted at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week of August 2, 2008. Like &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;, &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot; sold 56,000 copies in its first week. In its list of the 50 best albums of 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot; No. 5 overall and also dubbed &quot;Troubled Land&quot; No. 48 among the 100 best singles of the year.

On September 23, 2008, Mellencamp filmed a concert at the Crump Theatre in Columbus, Indiana, for a new A&amp;E Biography series called &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;. The show featured performers returning to small venues where they performed early in their careers. The program aired on December 11, 2008, and featured an in-depth documentary tracing Mellencamp&#x27;s roots.

Mellencamp participated in a tribute concert for Pete Seeger&#x27;s 90th birthday on May 3, 2009, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which raised funds for an environmental organization founded by Seeger to preserve and protect the Hudson River. Mellencamp performed solo acoustic renditions of Seeger and Lee Hays&#x27; &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; and his own &quot;A Ride Back Home.&quot;

While he was on tour, Mellencamp recorded a new album titled &quot;No Better Than This&quot; that was again produced by T Bone Burnett. The tracks for the album were recorded at historic locations, such as the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia as well as at the Sun Studio in Memphis and the Sheraton Gunter Hotel in San Antonio where blues pioneer Robert Johnson recorded &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; and &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot;. Mellencamp recorded the album using a 1955 Ampex portable recording machine and only one microphone, requiring all the musicians to gather together around the mic. The album was recorded in mono. Mellencamp wrote over 30 songs for the record (only 13 made the final cut), and he wrote one song specifically for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel.

&quot;No Better Than This&quot; was released on August 17, 2010, and peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the 10th top 10 album of his career. &quot;No Better Than This&quot; is the first mono-only release to make the top 10 since James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 in April 1964.

On December 6, 2009, Mellencamp performed &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; as a tribute to Bruce Springsteen, who was one of the honorees at the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors. &quot;I was very proud and humbled to have been able to play &#x27;Born in the U.S.A.&#x27; in a different fashion that I think was true to the feelings that Bruce had when he wrote it, &quot;Mellencamp said. He performed &quot;Down by the River&quot; on January 29, 2010, in Los Angeles in tribute to Neil Young, who was honored at the 20th annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala. Mellencamp sang the hymn &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize&quot; at &quot;In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement&quot; on February 9, 2010.

Mellencamp, who co-headlined 11 shows in the summer of 2010 with Bob Dylan, launched the &quot;No Better Than This&quot; theater tour on October 29, 2010, in Bloomington, Indiana. On this tour, which ran through the summer of 2012 and covered the entire United States, Canada, and much of Europe, Mellencamp opened each concert with a showing of a Kurt Markus documentary about the making of &quot;No Better Than This&quot; called &quot;It&#x27;s About You&quot; before hitting the stage to play three different sets: a stripped-down acoustic set with his band, a solo acoustic set, and a fully electrified rock set. &quot;It&#x27;ll be like Alan Freed, like the old Moondog shows,&quot; Mellencamp told Billboard magazine prior to the tour: Mellencamp played for over two hours and included 24 songs on his tour&#x27;s setlist. He brought the &quot;No Better Than This&quot; tour to Europe in the summer of 2011, opening in Copenhagen on June 24. One reviewer called the opening gig of the European leg of the tour &quot;maybe the best rock performance ever in Denmark.&quot; The &quot;No Better Than This&quot; Tour returned to the U.S. for one final round of shows from October 25 to November 19, 2011. The tour finally concluded with a tour of Canada in the summer of 2012.

Mellencamp took part in two Woody Guthrie tribute concerts in 2012 as part of a year-long celebration surrounding the 100th anniversary of the folk icon&#x27;s birth.

On July 8, 2014, Mellencamp released a new live album called &quot;Performs Trouble No More Live at Town Hall&quot; without any advance notice. The album captures his live performance at Town Hall in New York City on July 31, 2003, in which he performed every track from his 2003 &quot;Trouble No More&quot; covers album in addition to a rendition of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; by Bob Dylan and reworked versions of three of his own songs. Two songs performed at the 2003 Town Hall concert, the 1962 Skeeter Davis hit &quot;The End of the World&quot; and the traditional folk song &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, did not make the final track list despite the album&#x27;s official press release stating that the CD and digital versions &quot;feature the complete 15-song concert.&quot;

===2014–2018: &quot;Plain Spoken&quot;, &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Other People&#x27;s Stuff&quot;===
In October 2013, Mellencamp revealed that he was working on a new album. In January 2014, Mellencamp began recording the project, which would ultimately be titled &quot;Plain Spoken&quot; and would become his 20th album of original material and 22nd studio album overall. The album was released on September 23, 2014. Although Mellencamp said that Burnett would serve as the producer of &quot;Plain Spoken&quot;, Burnett was only credited as the &quot;executive producer&quot; of the album.

Outside of the Plain Spoken Tour, Mellencamp&#x27;s most noteworthy live performance in 2015 came on February 6, when he paid tribute to Bob Dylan at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year event by performing a piano-and-vocal rendition of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (Troye Kinnett from Mellencamp&#x27;s band played the piano).

&quot;USA Today&quot; wrote:&quot;The musical high point in a night of many highlights was probably John Mellencamp&#x27;s interpretation of &#x27;Highway 61 Revisited;&#x27; with a vocal tone and timbre that channeled Tom Waits,&#x27; he made this usually scorching rocker into a blues dirge. Never has Mellencamp sounded so artful.&quot;

After a star-studded lineup paid tribute to Dylan with cover versions of some of his greatest songs, Dylan closed the evening with a 30-minute speech that included a reference to Mellencamp&#x27;s 2008 song &quot;Longest Days&quot;.

Dylan said: &quot;And like my friend John Mellencamp would singbecause John sang some truth today&#x27;one day you get sick and you don&#x27;t get better.&#x27; That&#x27;s from a song of his called &#x27;Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.&#x27; It&#x27;s one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain&#x27;t lying.&quot; Mellencamp said Dylan&#x27;s endorsement was worth more than 10 Grammys.

On November 19, 2014, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Mellencamp performed an acoustic cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Allentown&quot; at a tribute event to Billy Joel.

In December 2015, Mellencamp began recording a duets album with Carlene Carter, who was his opening act for all shows on the Plain Spoken Tour and would join Mellencamp for two songs during his set. Mellencamp and Carter&#x27;s duets album, titled &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;, was released on April 28, 2017. &quot;We wrote a couple of songs together, and she wrote some, and I wrote some,&quot; Mellencamp told &quot;USA Today&quot; of the material on &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;. Mellencamp and Carter debuted two songs from the album, &quot;Indigo Sunset&quot; and &quot;My Soul&#x27;s Got Wings,&quot; during Mellencamp&#x27;s concert in Tulsa on April 1, 2016 (Carter served as the opening act for the show). &quot;Indigo Sunset&quot; was written by both Mellencamp and Carter. In contrast, Mellencamp wrote the music to &quot;My Soul&#x27;s Got Wings,&quot; giving life to a previously unheard lyric written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie. Carter was featured on only five of &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;″ 13 tracks and contributed to the writing of just two songs.

Mellencamp released &quot;Easy Target&quot;the first single from &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot; and a &quot;reflection on the state of our country&quot; on January 19, 2017, which was the eve of the 2017 Presidential Inauguration.

In addition to his work on &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;, Mellencamp wrote the title song to the 2017 American war movie &quot;The Yellow Birds&quot;, which was released on June 15, 2018, by Saban Films.

On February 1, 2018, Netflix began streaming a concert that took place on October 25, 2016, at the Chicago Theatre as part of Mellencamp&#x27;s Plain Spoken Tour. The 80-minute film is more of a documentary than a true concert film, as Mellencamp narrates the entire presentation with stories about his childhood, his early days in music, his relationship with his family, the music business and many more topics.

Mellencamp released a compilation album of cover songs titled &quot;Other People&#x27;s Stuff&quot; on December 7, 2018. He began a 39-date theater tour in February 2019, dubbed &quot;The John Mellencamp Show,&quot; that concluded April 30, 2019, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

===2019–present: &quot;Small Town&quot; musical, &quot;Strictly a One-Eyed Jack&quot; and &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;===
In two separate 2018 television interviews, Mellencamp teased a musical he is working on based on his 1982 No. 1 hit &quot;Jack &amp; Diane.&quot; On June 12, 2019, Republic Records, Federal Films, and Universal Music Theatricals announced that the musical is officially in development. Mellencamp (music/lyrics) will team with Naomi Wallace (book) to form the creative team behind the still-untitled musical, with Kathleen Marshall, winner of three Tonys out of nine nominations, signed on to direct and choreograph. Mellencamp confirmed in 2021 that it will be a jukebox musical titled &quot;Small Town&quot; and the story will involve two kids named Jack and Diane. Mellencamp said that he had not written any new material for the project. &quot;I told them, I have 600 songs published. Surely you can find 12-to-15 songs that will work.&quot;

Mellencamp told iHeart Radio in January 2022 that &quot;Small Town&quot; was scheduled to debut in Louisville in September 2022, but that didn&#x27;t happen. The musical&#x27;s future is unknown at this time.

On February 27, 2020, Mellencamp&#x27;s official social media accounts confirmed that he was currently recording an album at his Belmont Mall recording studio. In a September 2020 interview, Mellencamp guitarist Andy York said that ten songs have already been recorded and mixed for the album. However, a planned final session in April 2020 to complete the project was scuttled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Mellencamp wrote at least 15 songs. The album was scheduled for release in 2020, but the pandemic pushed its release time frame back indefinitely.

In an extensive update on his website, Mellencamp said one of the songs he wrote for the record is called &quot;I Always Lie to Strangers&quot;, and he shared a one-minute snippet of it on February 3, 2021. He also revealed that the album had the working title of &quot;Strictly a One-Eyed Jack&quot;. He resumed recording on the project in March 2021, with plans to cut at least some of the 17 songs he wrote while in quarantine in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2021, Mellencamp revealed that he recently finished the album and that Bruce Springsteen would make a guest appearance on the project. &quot;Bruce is singing on the new record and is playing guitar,&quot; Mellencamp said. Springsteen himself provided additional details on his collaboration with Mellencamp on his Sirius XM radio station on June 10, 2021, saying: &quot;I worked on three songs on John&#x27;s album, and I spent some time in Indiana with him. I love John a lot. He&#x27;s a great songwriter, and I have become very close [with him] and had a lot of fun with him. I sang a little bit on his record.&quot;

Mellencamp released a CD and documentary of his 2000 Good Samaritan Tour, which consisted of free lunchtime concerts in city parks, on August 27, 2021. The documentary is narrated by Academy Award winning actor Matthew McConaughey, who is an avowed Mellencamp fan.

On September 29, 2021, Mellencamp released the audio and music video for &quot;Wasted Days,&quot; a duet with Springsteen, as the lead single from &quot;Strictly a One-Eyed Jack&quot;. Written and produced solely by Mellencamp, &quot;Wasted Days&quot; is a song about aging and making the most of the time one has left. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Chasing Rainbows,&quot; was released on December 10, 2021. &quot;Strictly a One-Eyed Jack&quot; was released on January 21, 2022.

Mellencamp stated in 2021 that he had booked 80 shows for 2022, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic ultimately caused him to cancel his 2022 Strictly a One-Eyed Jack tour and push it until 2023.

In the summer of 2022, Mellencamp confirmed through his social media channels that he was, indeed, working on the follow-up to &quot;Strictly a One-Eyed Jack&quot;. On August 24, 2022, he shared the lyrics to a brand new song called &quot;The Eyes of Portland&quot; – a diatribe against homelessness that will be on the new record.

During a performance in his hometown of Seymour, Indiana, on September 17, 2022, to benefit the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts, Mellencamp revealed the new record&#x27;s title to be &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;. &quot;The name of the new record is &quot;Orpheus Descending,&quot;&quot; Mellencamp told the audience. &quot;Do you guys know who Orpheus was? He was a Greek god that came down, and he was the best singer, the best songwriter, and men wanted to be like him and girls wanted to be with him. What happened was the girl he fell in love with got sent to Hades, he went down and met with the devil, and bad things happened...You can read about Orpheus in Greek mythology.&quot;

&quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, Mellencamp&#x27;s twenty-fifth album, was released on June 16, 2023. Mellencamp launched a 78-date tour called &quot;Live and in Person&quot; on February 5, 2023, in Bloomington, Indiana. The tour wrapped up on June 27 in Milwaukee. Mellencamp debuted &quot;Hey God&quot; and &quot;The Eyes of Portland,&quot; two songs from &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, in his 2023 live set. &quot;Hey God&quot; is the album&#x27;s first single and was released on April 21, 2023, followed by &quot;The Eyes of Portland&quot; as the second single on May 12, 2023.

The Live and In Person tour marked the return of violinist Lisa Germano to Mellencamp&#x27;s band. Germano played with Mellencamp from 1985 to 1993 before leaving in 1994 to pursue a solo career. Germano also played violin on &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, marking the first Mellencamp studio album she has played on since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Human Wheels&quot;.

===Collaboration with George Green===
Mellencamp co-wrote several of his best-known songs with his childhood friend George Green, who, like Mellencamp, was born and raised in Seymour, Indiana. Green contributed lyrics to numerous Mellencamp radio hits and classic album tracks, including &quot;Human Wheels,&quot; &quot;Minutes to Memories,&quot; &quot;Hurts So Good,&quot; &quot;Crumblin&#x27; Down,&quot; &quot;Rain on the Scarecrow,&quot; &quot;Your Life is Now,&quot;, and &quot;Key West Intermezzo,&quot; in addition to songs recorded by Barbra Streisand, Hall &amp; Oates, Jude Cole, Ricky Skaggs, Sue Medley, The Oak Ridge Boys, Percy Sledge, and Carla Olson.

Mellencamp and Green&#x27;s final collaboration was &quot;Yours Forever,&quot; a song that was included on the soundtrack to the 2000 movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;. Mellencamp and Green had a falling out in the early 2000s, and Green ultimately moved from Bloomington, Indiana to Taos, New Mexico in 2001. &quot;Like when you&#x27;re married, when you&#x27;re friends with somebody for a long time, the more things build up, the more things can go wrong,&quot; Mellencamp said in the liner notes to his 2010 box set, &quot;On the Rural Route 7609&quot;. &quot;There were personal problems, cross-pollinated with professional issues. George has written some great lyrics and we&#x27;ve written some great songs together, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it any more.&quot;

On August 28, 2011, Green died in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 59 after losing a battle with a rapid-forming small-cell lung cancer. &quot;I&#x27;ve known George since we were in the same Sunday school class. We had a lot of fun together when we were kids. Later on, we wrote some really good songs together,&quot; Mellencamp told the &quot;Bloomington Herald Times&quot; shortly after Green&#x27;s death. &quot;George was a dreamer, and I was sorry to hear of his passing.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contributor Anthony DeCurtis said:
In 2001, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine editor-in-chief Timothy White said:
Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty said of Mellencamp:

Johnny Cash called Mellencamp &quot;one of the ten best songwriters&quot; in music.

===Musical style and influence===
Mellencamp&#x27;s musical style has been described as rock, heartland rock, roots rock, folk rock, country rock and alternative country. AllMusic describes Mellencamp&#x27;s sound as a &quot;heartland blend of Stonesy hard rock and folk.&quot;

Country music star Keith Urban has consistently cited Mellencamp&#x27;s influence on his music. It originated when Mellencamp&#x27;s Lonesome Jubilee tour went to Australia in 1988 - Urban was in attendance at one of the concerts and described the experience as an &quot;epiphany.&quot;

Urban told the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 2016: &quot;For me, &quot;The Lonesome Jubilee&quot; was the defining record and tour. I&#x27;ve since gotten to know John a little bit, and it was one of the greatest opportunities I&#x27;ve ever had to meet a hero and tell him about a concert you went to when you were a nobody and how much of an effect that concert had on me... I was hit by lightning by that concert. I said to John, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t walk away thinking: I want to do that. I walked away feeling: I get it — just put all the things you love into what you do.&#x27; It was singularly the most important concert I&#x27;ve ever been to in my life because it showed me the way.&quot;

Urban has covered numerous Mellencamp songs in his concerts over the years, including &quot;Hurts So Good,&quot; &quot;Jack and Diane,&quot; &quot;Authority Song,&quot; and &quot;Rumble Seat.&quot; In 2015, Urban and Mellencamp performed &quot;Pink Houses&quot; together twice during nationally televised events. Urban&#x27;s 2015 hit single &quot;John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16&quot; further illustrated Mellencamp&#x27;s influence on his music.

===Honors and awards===
Mellencamp has won one Grammy Award (Best Male Rock Performer for &quot;Hurts So Good&quot; in 1983) and has been nominated for 12 others. He has also been awarded the Nordoff-Robbins Silver Clef Special Music Industry Humanitarian Award (1991), the Billboard Century Award (2001), the Woody Guthrie Award (2003), and the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award (2007). On October 6, 2008, Mellencamp won the prestigious Classic Songwriter Award at the 2008 Q Awards in London, England. Mellencamp was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 14, 2018. On August 30, 2018, Mellencamp was given the Woody Guthrie Prize in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

On September 9, 2010, Mellencamp received the Americana Lifetime Achievement Award in Nashville. On July 30, 2012, at San Jose State University, Mellencamp was honored with the John Steinbeck Award, given to those individuals who exemplify the spirit of &quot;Steinbeck&#x27;s empathy, commitment to democratic values, and belief in the dignity of the common man.&quot;

On April 27, 2016, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) presented Mellencamp with its prestigious Founders Award at the 33rd annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards in Los Angeles. The ASCAP Founders Award goes to pioneering ASCAP songwriters who have made exceptional contributions to music by inspiring and influencing their fellow music creators. &quot;For the last four decades, John Mellencamp has captured the American experience in his songs,&quot; said ASCAP President Paul Williams. &quot;His infectious melodies and compassionate lyrics, wrapped in workingman&#x27;s rock, crystallize life&#x27;s joys and struggles and illuminate the human condition. A national treasure, he&#x27;s also one of the truly great music creators that can make us care, move, clap, and sing along.&quot;

In June 2019, WhyHunger awarded Mellencamp the ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award, which shines a spotlight on artists who have proven their commitment to striving for social justice and creating real change in combating hunger worldwide.

Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2008. The induction ceremony took place in New York City on March 10, 2008. He was inducted by his good friend Billy Joel, who asked Mellencamp to induct him into the Rock Hall back in 1999 (he had to opt out because of another commitment, so Ray Charles inducted Joel). During his induction speech for Mellencamp, Joel said:

On October 18, 2024, a statue of Mellencamp was unveiled on the campus of Indiana University Bloomington.

==Other work==
===Acting===
Mellencamp has made several forays into acting over the years, appearing in four films: &quot;Falling from Grace&quot; (which he also directed) (1992), &quot;Madison&quot; (2005, narration only), &quot;After Image&quot; (2001), and &quot;Lone Star State of Mind&quot; (2002). His older brother, Joe Mellencamp, appears in &quot;Falling from Grace&quot; as the bandleader during the country club scene along with his band Pure Jam.

In 1980, Mellencamp turned down the lead role in the movie &quot;The Idolmaker&quot; because, as he told the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; in 1983, &quot;I was afraid that if I made too much money, I&#x27;d have no motivation to make records anymore.&quot;

Mellencamp told VH1 that he was originally offered the Brad Pitt role in &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;: &quot;You know they used to want me to be an actor all the time, and I used to get more movie role offers. That&#x27;s when I was – believe it or not, I used to not be as ugly as I am now. And they gave me this script called &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; and they said, &#x27;The guy wrote the part with you in mind, John; you really gotta do this part.&#x27; And I read the script and I thought, &#x27;Yeah, I get it but I don&#x27;t want to take my shirt off.&#x27; So Brad Pitt took his shirt off and look what happened to Brad Pitt. I was that close.&quot;

===Film music composition===
Mellencamp wrote the score for the Meg Ryan movie &quot;Ithaca&quot;, which premiered on October 23, 2015, at the Middleburg Film Festival in Virginia and was released in theaters and on-demand by Momentum Pictures on September 9, 2016. &quot;Not one note [in &quot;Ithaca&quot;] is anything other than Mellencamp. He did everything,&quot; said Ryan, Mellencamp&#x27;s on-again, off-again girlfriend.

In a May 6, 2016, Q&amp;A after a screening of the movie at Geena Davis&#x27; Bentonville Film Festival, Ryan said: &quot;The music is so beautiful. John Mellencamp wrote every note – everything – the tiny little needle drops you hear in the back. He wrote about half of it after I read him the script, and then the next half after he saw the movie. He&#x27;s just incredible.&quot;

In addition to the score, Mellencamp wrote two original songs for &quot;Ithaca&quot;: &quot;Sugar Hill Mountain&quot; (sung by Carlene Carter) and &quot;Seeing You Around&quot; (sung by Leon Redbone). &quot;Sugar Hill Mountain&quot; is a fiddle-driven folk song that describes an idyllic location where there are &quot;bubble gum and cigarette trees,&quot; no clocks, every day is spring, and anything you need is &quot;gratis.&quot; (The song would later be included, in a re-recorded version, on Mellencamp&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;.) Meanwhile, the piano-heavy &quot;Seeing You Around&quot; has the sound of a 1940s standard (the movie takes place during World War II) and is made all the more authentically &#x27;40s-sounding by Redbone&#x27;s gruff baritone vocals. Mellencamp&#x27;s band provided the backing on both tracks and performed all the music in the movie.

Said Carter in 2015:

&quot;The way John Mellencamp and I met was he invited me to come and sing this song he had written for the movie that Meg Ryan has coming out called &quot;Ithaca&quot;. That was when we became friends, when I went to Indiana and recorded with him and the guys this really cool song called &#x27;Sugar Hill Mountain&#x27; that&#x27;s in the movie. And the movie is wonderful. We got to see a rough cut of it and I was very impressed.&quot;

The film &quot;The Legend of Jack and Diane&quot; began production in Los Angeles in January 2022; according to film news website Deadline Hollywood, the makers were inspired by Mellencamp&#x27;s song &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; and are in talks with Mellencamp&#x27;s team about music for the film.

===Musical theater===
Mellencamp began working on a musical with horror author Stephen King, titled &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot;, in 2000. The musical debuted in the spring of 2012 at Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where it ran from April 4 through May 13. A CD/DVD deluxe edition featuring the dialog, soundtrack, handwritten lyrics, and a mini-documentary about the making of the musical was released on June 4, 2013. Production on the musical&#x27;s recorded soundtrack began on June 15, 2009, when T Bone Burnett, who served as the project&#x27;s musical producer, began laying down tracks in Los Angeles for the songs Mellencamp wrote for the project. The soundtrack includes Rosanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Taj Mahal, Ryan Bingham, Will Dailey and Neko Case among others singing the songs Mellencamp wrote.

Ryan D&#x27;Agostino of &quot;Esquire&quot; stated in a review of a New York rehearsal of &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot; in the fall of 2007, &quot;Musicals aren&#x27;t usually a guy thing. This one, though, is not only tolerable, it&#x27;s good. It may be the first-ever musical written by men for men. There&#x27;s no orchestra, just two twangy acoustic guitars, an accordion, and a fiddle. The songs are both haunting and all-American.&quot;

The Alliance Theatre described the show as a &quot;Southern Gothic musical fraught with mystery, tragedy, and ghosts of the past.&quot;

The official description of &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot; from the Alliance Theatre website:

&quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot; received mixed reviews upon its initial run in Atlanta. The musical toured 20 U.S. cities as a &quot;radio play&quot; in the fall of 2013 and toured 18 more cities across the U.S. in the fall of 2014. In 2015, the show was further developed in London, although King and Mellencamp are no longer as actively involved: &quot;Steve and I are taking a step back ... but if they called and said they needed a song, I would write one,&quot; Mellencamp told &quot;USA Today&quot;.

In October 2018, it was announced that Broadway Licensing has redeveloped &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot; and made it available for worldwide licensing beginning in 2019.

==Politics and activism==
Mellencamp holds liberal views and is a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2003, Mellencamp became one of the first entertainers, along with Sheryl Crow and the Dixie Chicks, to publicly oppose the Iraq War, a stance that was unpopular at the time. Mellencamp revealed in a 2017 &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; interview that some of his conservative fans booed him at concerts for criticizing President George W. Bush. He also expressed annoyance that the lyrics of his 1983 song &quot;Pink Houses&quot; were taken out of context and used as a patriotic anthem. Mellencamp released the song &quot;To Washington&quot; in 2003 amidst the impending U.S. invasion of Iraq, which was critical of the war and the 2000 U.S. Presidential elections. He noted, &quot;When the song first came out, I was in the car one day, and we were driving to the airport, and I had my kids with me, and a radio station was playing &#x27;To Washington&#x27; and having callers call in&quot;, Mellencamp said. &quot;Some guy comes on and says, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know who I hate the most, John Mellencamp or Osama bin Laden.&#x27;&quot;

In an &quot;Open Letter to America&quot; on his website, Mellencamp stated:
On his 2007 album, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot;, Mellencamp included a hidden track called &quot;Rodeo Clown,&quot; which was a direct reference to George W. Bush (&quot;The bloody red eyes of the rodeo clown&quot;).

In April 2007, Mellencamp performed for wounded troops at the Walter Reed Medical Center. His original intent was to duet on the &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Road&quot; track &quot;Jim Crow&quot; with singer and activist Joan Baez. Army officials barred Baez from performing, however. Mellencamp told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine: 

According to a February 8, 2008, Associated Press report, Mellencamp&#x27;s camp asked that the campaign for presidential candidate Sen. John McCain stop using his songs, including &quot;Our Country&quot; and &quot;Pink Houses,&quot; during their campaign events. McCain&#x27;s campaign responded by pulling the songs from their playlist. Mellencamp&#x27;s publicist, Bob Merlis, noted to the Associated Press: Merlis also noted that the same songs had been used, with Mellencamp&#x27;s approval, by John Edwards&#x27;s campaign; in response, the McCain campaign ceased using the songs.

Mellencamp performed &quot;Small Town&quot; at a Barack Obama rally in Evansville, Indiana on April 22, the night of the 2008 Pennsylvania Democratic presidential primary. Mellencamp also performed &quot;Our Country&quot; at a rally for Hillary Clinton in Indianapolis, Indiana, on May 3, 2008. However, he never came out in support of either Obama or Clinton during the primaries. &quot;Neither candidate is as liberal as he would prefer, but he&#x27;s happy to contribute what he can,&quot; Merlis said.

On January 18, 2009, Mellencamp performed &quot;Pink Houses&quot; at We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.

Mellencamp supports same-sex marriage. In 2010, Mellencamp&#x27;s music was used by the National Organization for Marriage at events opposing same-sex marriage. In response, Mellencamp instructed Merlis to pen a letter to NOM stating &quot;that Mr. Mellencamp&#x27;s views on same-sex marriage and equal rights for people of all sexual orientations are at odds with NOM&#x27;s stated agenda&quot; and requesting that NOM &quot;find music from a source more in harmony with your views than Mr. Mellencamp in the future.&quot;

Mellencamp supported the Michael Bloomberg 2020 presidential campaign by taping a Michael Bloomberg 2020 campaign ad that featured Mellencamp singing &quot;Small Town.&quot;

In August 2020, Mellencamp released &quot;A Pawn in the White Man&#x27;s Game&quot; to his website along with a video to YouTube. The song was a re-working of the 1964 Bob Dylan song &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot; that reflected on the killing of Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers. Mellencamp&#x27;s version featured new lyrics that reflected the racial conflicts in the U.S. in the wake of the murder of George Floyd while in custody of Minneapolis police officers. The video, which included a warning that it might be seen as &quot;inappropriate for some viewers,&quot; featured footage of protesters and police clashing violently in 2020 and 1968. YouTube eventually removed the video, claiming it violated their community guidelines. Along with the song and video, Mellencamp released the statement, &quot;For my entire life I have seen the mistreatment of minorities in our country. We have gone too far with the shameful killing and genocide…from the Native Americans to where we find ourselves today. In my own way, I have tried to address these issues in song.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mellencamp lives five miles outside Bloomington, Indiana, on the shores of Lake Monroe, and has a vacation home on Daufuskie Island, South Carolina. In January 2018, Mellencamp purchased an loft in the Soho district of New York City for $2.3 million that he is using as an art studio.

Mellencamp is a supporter of Indiana University Bloomington and the Indiana Hoosiers and received an honorary doctorate from the university in 2000. He donated $1.5 million to the school to build an indoor athletics training facility, which was named John Mellencamp Pavilion.

Mellencamp was married to Priscilla Esterline from 1970 until 1981 and to Victoria Granucci from 1981 until 1989. He married fashion model Elaine Irwin on September 5, 1992. On December 30, 2010, Mellencamp announced that he and Irwin had separated after 18 years of marriage. Their divorce became official on August 12, 2011, with the couple negotiating &quot;an amicable settlement of all issues involving property and maintenance rights, the custody and support of their children, and all other issues&quot;, according to the settlement agreement.

Mellencamp has five children from his three marriages: daughter Michelle from his marriage to Esterline; daughters Teddi Jo and Justice from his marriage to Granucci; and sons Hud and Speck from his marriage to Irwin. Daughter Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave was a cast member on &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot; for three seasons. His son Hud was the runner-up on season three of &quot;Claim to Fame&quot; in 2024. After his divorce from Irwin, Mellencamp began dating actress Meg Ryan. It was reported that Mellencamp and Ryan broke up in the middle of 2014 after dating for over three years.

In September 2015, Mellencamp reportedly started dating former supermodel Christie Brinkley. In August 2016, the couple&#x27;s publicist confirmed they had broken up.

In July 2017, it was reported that Mellencamp and Ryan had reunited and were dating again. In November 2018, the couple became engaged. On October 30, 2019, it was reported Ryan had ended their engagement.

In April 2020, it was reported that Mellencamp had been dating skincare expert Jamie Sherrill since the beginning of the year. &quot;People&quot; magazine confirmed in January 2021 that Mellencamp and Sherrill had broken up.

Since college, Mellencamp, with the exception of a continuing addiction to nicotine, has lived a drug- and alcohol-free lifestyle. In 1984, when asked about his views on drugs, he told Bill Holdship of &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, &quot;If you want to stick needles in your arms, go ahead and fucking do it. You&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s going to pay the consequences. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea, and I sure don&#x27;t advocate it, but I&#x27;m not going to judge people. Hell, if that was the case, you wouldn&#x27;t like anyone in the music business because everyone&#x27;s blowing cocaine.&quot;

Mellencamp had a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8, 1994, which eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of his Dance Naked tour.

&quot;I was up to 80 cigarettes a day. We&#x27;d finish a show and I&#x27;d go out and have steak and french fries and eggs at 4 in the morning and then go to sleep with all that in my gut. It was just a terrible lifestyle.&quot;

<text>A-ha (often stylised as a&quot;-h&quot;a; ) is a Norwegian synth-pop band formed in Oslo in 1982. Founded by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars and vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards, guitars and vocals), and Morten Harket (lead vocals), the band rose to fame during the mid-1980s.

A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; in 1985. The album peaked at number one in their native Norway, number two in the UK, and number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart; yielded the international number-one single &quot;Take On Me&quot;, as well as &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot;; and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist. In the UK, &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. The band released studio albums in 1986, 1988, and 1990, with single hits including &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot;, and &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot;. In 1994, after their fifth studio album, &quot;Memorial Beach&quot; (1993), failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on hiatus. Following a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, A-ha recorded their sixth album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, which was another number-one album in Norway and Germany. This album was followed by &quot;Lifelines&quot; (2002); &quot;Analogue&quot; (2005), which was certified Silver in the UK; and &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot; (2009), which was certified Silver in the UK and reached the top five in many European countries.

The band split after their 2010 worldwide Ending on a High Note Tour, but reunited in 2015 to release their tenth studio album, &quot;Cast in Steel&quot;. They toured in support of the album and participated at Rock in Rio, which celebrated 30 years for both the band and the event.

The band has released eleven studio albums, several compilations and four live albums, with their most recent album, &quot;True North&quot;, released on 21 October 2022. In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian kroner from concert tickets, merchandise and the release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40–50 highest-grossing bands in the world. The band were listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book for having the biggest-paying rock concert attendance; they drew an audience of 198,000 at Maracanã Stadium during the Rock in Rio festival. They have sold more than 100 million units, albums and singles combined.

==History==

===Formation===

The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket; guitarist Paul Waaktaar (then known as Pål Waaktaar); and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982, and left Norway for London in order to make a career in music. &quot;We were trying to think of what to call themselves, focusing on Norwegian words people could say in English.&quot; They jettisoned that idea when Morten spotted a song called &quot;A-ha&quot; in Waaktaar&#x27;s songbook. &quot;It was a terrible song but a great name,&quot; said Morten.

They chose the studio of musician, producer, and soon-to-be-manager John Ratcliff because it had a &quot;Space Invaders&quot; machine. Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, Terry Slater, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group&#x27;s international business manager and as liaison to Warner Bros. head office in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; (1984–1986)===
An early version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; was the first song that Harket had heard Furuholmen and Waaktaar play in Asker. At that time, the song was called &quot;Miss Eerie&quot; and the two men were still known as Bridges. Harket said it sounded more like a &quot;Juicy Fruit song&quot; (meaning a gum advertisement). A-ha&#x27;s first recorded version was called &quot;Lesson One&quot;. The song was then re-recorded, re-named &quot;Take on Me&quot;, and released in 1984, when it was promoted with a video of the band performing in front of a blue background. After it failed to chart, the song was re-recorded with production by Alan Tarney; it again failed to chart. Finally, the song was re-released in 1985 with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number two on the UK Singles Chart.

a-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number-one hit in the U.S. The popularity of &quot;Take on Me&quot; earned the band a spot on the American television series &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show. (Earlier &quot;Soul Train&quot; appearances by white artists included Gino Vanelli, Elton John, David Bowie, Hall &amp; Oates, Sheena Easton, Pet Shop Boys, Michael McDonald, and Teena Marie.)

The video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called rotoscoping, in which individual frames of film are drawn over or coloured. It became one of the most instantly recognizable and most enduringly popular music videos in the US, where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual MTV Video Awards in 1986, winning six, including Best New Artist in a Video, Best Concept Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, Viewer&#x27;s Choice and Best Video of the Year. Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined.

The band&#x27;s second single worldwide was &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot;, even though &quot;Love Is Reason&quot; was the second single in Norway. In the US, the song peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached number 17 on &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number five on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in three categories and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha&#x27;s total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, Peter Gabriel would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached—and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel.

a-ha&#x27;s American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category, which was eventually won by Sade. &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot; turned out to be A-ha&#x27;s last Hot 100 Top 40 single and to this day – in the United States – A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of &quot;Take On Me&quot;. As such, the band is frequently considered a one-hit wonder there, despite their two Top 40 hits. In the UK, where &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot; has been their only number one, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album, &quot;Train of Thought&quot; and &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; (with another innovative video), and remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The band&#x27;s first album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 album chart. The album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for A-ha. &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; earned triple platinum status in the UK and reached platinum status in the US and Germany, while earning gold in Brazil and the Netherlands. &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; has sold 11 million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number 15 on the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and at number two on the UK Albums Chart; it spent 38 weeks in the top 10 in Norway, including eight weeks at number one.

===Golden age (1987–1994)===

a-ha&#x27;s second album, &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;, was released in the midst of the 1986 world tour and represented a move towards alternative rock, as synthpop began to fall out of style. Although the album received favourable reviews and had three singles become international hits, sales (6.4 million copies) did not match those of its predecessor (except for in Switzerland, where it remains A-ha&#x27;s best-selling album). &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; would be the last A-ha single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. After the release of the album, A-ha toured in the US, its last appearance there for 20 years. The album has been certified platinum in the UK, Switzerland and Brazil, and has earned gold certification in Germany.

Ned Raggett of AllMusic Guide would later write of the album, &quot;The opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around: the tense edge of the title track, featuring one of Morten Harket&#x27;s soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp, pristine punch in the music, and &#x27;The Swing of Things,&#x27; a moody, elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement (plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro Michael Sturgis) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over...The &#x27;80s may be long gone, but &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; makes clear that not everything was bad back then.&quot;

In May 1988, A-ha released their third studio album, titled &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot;, which matched the number-two chart peak of its two predecessors on the British album charts. &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot; has been certified platinum in Brazil and France, and gold in Switzerland, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.

The album includes the title-track theme song to the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. The version that appears on their album is the original version of the song. The band has said that they are particularly proud of the title track, and all three members contributed to its writing. &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; would remain part of their live set throughout the rest of the band&#x27;s history. After the release of the album, the band went on a 74-city world tour. The album has sold more than 4.2 million copies worldwide.

&quot;East of the Sun, West of the Moon&quot; contained a cover version of The Everly Brothers&#x27; 1963 single &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot;. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, A-ha were very popular in South America, especially in Brazil, where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world. At the January 1991 Rock in Rio II festival, A-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at Maracanã stadium for their top-billed evening concert—a Guinness World Record for biggest rock concert attendance. In contrast, the other performers (George Michael, Prince and Guns N&#x27; Roses) each drew less than a third of that audience (60,000 each). In a 2009 interview from Cody Eide in &quot;Music Week&quot;, celebrating A-ha&#x27;s up-and-coming 25-year anniversary, the members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band. The festival, which should have been the band&#x27;s crowning achievement, was instead a moment of crushing disappointment. &quot;MTV interviewed everybody except us&quot;, remembers Waaktaar-Savoy. &quot;They were all calling their bosses and saying, &#x27;We must cover A-ha; it&#x27;s the only night that has sold out.&#x27; But they weren&#x27;t allowed to.&quot; &quot;I felt very alienated,&quot; says Furuholmen. &quot;It made us feel hopeless. We played to the biggest crowd in the world and they ignored it.&quot;

&quot;East of the Sun, West of the Moon&quot; was certified gold in Switzerland, Brazil, and Germany and silver in the UK. Steven McDonald of AllMusic said of their fourth album, &quot;This is a nicely crafted collection of songs, performed and sung beautifully, with lots of echoes and suggestions tucked into the music. While not an album one can discuss at length, it&#x27;s an album that&#x27;s a pleasure to listen to.&quot; The album sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.

Their last album before their hiatus was &quot;Memorial Beach&quot;, in 1993. Relative to previous releases, the album was a commercial disappointment. The only single from the album to chart officially outside of Norway was &quot;Dark Is the Night&quot;, which peaked at number 19 in the United Kingdom. Despite the commercial reception, &quot;Q&quot; magazine listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993. The following February, A-ha performed two concerts during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, followed by tours in South Africa and Norway. A-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the Winter Paralympic Games in Lillehammer, which they entitled &quot;Shapes That Go Together&quot;.

In 1994, the band unofficially entered a hiatus, during which band members focused on solo projects.

===First comeback (1998–2007)===

The band was invited to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998. Waaktaar-Savoy wrote &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; especially for this performance. They also performed &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot; This performance was A-ha&#x27;s comeback into the world of music, yet the band&#x27;s set was controversially omitted from a programme of concert highlights that was televised in the UK, and even more controversially in the US by FOX. Nevertheless, the band returned to the studio. Those recording sessions resulted in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, an international tour, and a webcast performance of the band opening the new Vallhall Arena in Oslo on 24 and 25 March 2001. A-ha&#x27;s video for &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot; was one of the first fully web-based animated Macromedia Flash music videos to be made available. (The first was Duran Duran&#x27;s 2000 video for &quot;Someone Else Not Me&quot;.) The album reached platinum status, with sales of 1.5 million copies, and spawned four singles: &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;, &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, &quot;Velvet&quot; and &quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot;. &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; went to number one in 17 countries.

a-ha made a return appearance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 2001, performing a new song, &quot;Differences&quot;, and &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;. The subsequent album, &quot;Lifelines&quot;, was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top-five hits there, &quot;Forever Not Yours&quot; and &quot;Lifelines&quot;. Jesper Hiro directed the video for &quot;Lifelines&quot;, based on the short film &quot;A Year Along the Abandoned Road&quot;, which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year elapsing in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed.

A live album from their 2002 tour, titled &quot;How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head&quot;, was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot; In 2004, a book entitled &quot;The Swing of Things&quot; was published, which also included a CD of early demo material titled &quot;The Demo Tapes&quot;. That year, A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, &quot;The Definitive Singles Collection 1984–2004&quot;. This compilation brought them back into the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart, where they reached number 13 and earned a gold album.

On 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of Live 8 in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, followed by &quot;Take On Me&quot;, during which Morten Harket had difficulties hearing himself when his in-ear monitor failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;, became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band&#x27;s time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage.
On 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at Irving Plaza in New York City, the band&#x27;s first concert in North America since 1986, despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frogner Park in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.

On 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, &quot;Analogue&quot;. The UK release of the single &quot;Analogue&quot; gave A-ha their first top-ten hit in the UK since 1988. The album includes a guest appearance by Graham Nash of Crosby Stills &amp; Nash performing backup vocals on the songs &quot;Over the Treetops&quot; and &quot;Cosy Prisons&quot;. The song &quot;Celice&quot; became the band&#x27;s ninth to reach number one on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The tour for the album included a gig at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa.

In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;No. 9 Dream&quot; for Amnesty International. It was released in June 2007 on the album &quot;Make Some Noise&quot;. On 30 October 2006 in London, A-ha received the prestigious &quot;Q&quot; Magazine Inspiration Award for their long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business. On 15 September 2007, A-ha played a free outdoor concert in Kiel, Germany, performing on a floating stage in the harbour. The concert was streamed live on the internet via MSN.

On 24 January 2009, 25 years after its first release and the 50th anniversary of the official hit list in Norway, A-ha won the Spellemannprisen (Spellemann Award) for Hit of All Time for &quot;Take On Me&quot;.

===New direction and farewell (2008–2010)===
On 20–22 May 2008, Harket, Furuholmen and Waaktaar performed concerts in Oslo to promote their respective solo material before coming together as A-ha to play &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, &quot;Take On Me&quot;, and two new songs, &quot;Riding the Crest&quot; and &quot;Shadowside&quot;, which previewed the new A-ha album, &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot;. These events led up to their performance at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 24 May.

On 24 April 2009, A-ha surprised their fan base by releasing their new single, &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot;, premiering that day on Norwegian radio. The single had been completed only the night before. The song is based upon the track &quot;The Longest Night&quot; by Furuholmen, which was released on his album &quot;A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss&quot;. The band promoted the German release of the song by playing it during the final of &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot; on 21 May at Cologne&#x27;s Lanxess Arena.

&quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot;, A-ha&#x27;s ninth studio album, was released in Europe on 19 June 2009. The album&#x27;s material marked a return to synth pop, similar to the band&#x27;s earliest work, although the first single (and title track) was not wholly indicative of this. The band collaborated with successful producer Steve Osborne, who has produced albums for such artists as Suede, New Order, Starsailor, Doves, Elbow, and U2. &quot;What There Is&quot;, an earlier solo track by Furuholmen, was re-recorded for the album.
&quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot; entered the German album chart at number one, the UK album chart at number five and debuted on European Album Sales Chart at number eight. In January 2010, &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot; was certified platinum in Germany.

&quot;I feel more connected to Depeche Mode (compared with other acts of the &#x27;80s),&quot; claimed Furuholmen. A-ha performed a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; during a live performance for BBC Radio 2 – &quot;The Dermot O&#x27;Leary Show&quot; on 25 July 2009.

On 24 July 2009, A-ha headlined the iTunes Live festival, the performance of which was made available for download on iTunes. In the Norwegian iTunes Store A-ha&#x27;s release has yet to see the light of day.

On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would disband after the 2010 worldwide Ending on a High Note Tour. The concert sold out on the first day of ticket sales as thousands of fans from at least 40 countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last leg of the tour. Due to the large demand, a second farewell show was held for 3 December 2010.

To coincide with their disbandment, A-ha released &quot;The Singles: 1984–2004&quot; in the US and re-released deluxe versions of their first two albums, as well as a third and final compilation album, a new live DVD and a re-release of the book &quot;The Swing of Things&quot; by Jan Omdahl. A new single titled &quot;Butterfly, Butterfly&quot; was revealed on 14 June 2010 and released as a single on 5 July to promote the double CD compilation &quot;25&quot;.

On 6 July 2010, the albums &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; and &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; were released as deluxe editions in the US through Rhino Records, containing remixes, B-sides, demo versions, and extensive liner notes. Available in two-disc CD and digital versions (with additional material), both albums debuted in the Top 40 Billboard Top Internet Sales Chart, &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; at number 34 and &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; at number 36.

Furuholmen revealed in an interview published in &quot;Magasinet&quot; (the magazine section of Norway&#x27;s third largest newspaper, &quot;Dagbladet&quot;) that he suffers from atrial fibrillation. The news was picked up the same day by electronic music magazine &quot;Side-Line&quot;.

At the Spellemannprisen award show on 5 March 2011 in Oslo, Norwegian artists from various music genres including Kaizers Orchestra, Ida Maria and Bertine Zetlitz performed a cover of one of A-ha&#x27;s biggest hits, &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot;, in honour of the band. After the performance, A-ha received the Spellemannprisen honorary award with the words &quot;Our Heroes – Once upon a time, now – still and forever&quot;.

a-ha&#x27;s final concerts in Oslo were recorded by ten HD cameras with digital, surround sound audio. &quot;Ending on a High Note Live&quot;, mixed by Toby Alington, is available in several formats, including the band&#x27;s first Blu-ray release. A single-disc live album comprised sixteen tracks, while the Blu-ray, DVD, and deluxe-edition double-CD set comprised twenty tracks. A bonus documentary appears in the deluxe set and Blu-ray versions. An NTSC version was released in the US and Japan.

On 1 April 2011, A-ha released the DVD as well as the box-set containing both the DVD and the CD of their last concert, &quot;Ending on a High Note – The Final Concert&quot;. The Blu-ray of the concert was released on 11 April 2011.

a-ha played at Oslo Spektrum on 21 August 2011, performing the song &quot;Stay on These Roads&quot; for a national memorial service dedicated to the victims of the 2011 Norway attacks.

===Post-a-ha activities and anniversary releases (2011–2014)===
After A-ha&#x27;s break-up, Harket released two studio albums, &quot;Out of My Hands&quot; (2012) and &quot;Brother&quot; (2014).

Waaktaar released two songs. With New Jersey–based vocalist Jimmy Gnecco, he presented Weathervane as a new project in June 2011. Their self-titled single was included on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Headhunters&quot; (based on the book &quot;Hodejegerne&quot; by Jo Nesbø). A second song, &quot;Manmade Lake&quot;, had originally been planned for &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot; but was released to Soundcloud in 2013.

In 2012, Furuholmen became a mentor on the show &quot;The Voice – Norges beste stemme&quot;. His mentee, Martin Halla, won the contest and had his first album produced by Furuholmen himself who is also an esteemed songwriter/producer for other artists. In 2014, Furuholmen agreed to compose the songs and supervise the recordings for the Norwegian film &quot;Beatles&quot;.

===Second comeback (2015–2016)===
During an A-ha fan convention in Oslo in October 2014, manager Harald Wilk announced plans to re-release A-ha&#x27;s first five albums on vinyl and albums three through five as deluxe editions.

In 2015, the band reunited to perform in Rock in Rio. A-ha in fact reunited for a two-year period and was writing new material. A-ha&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Cast in Steel&quot;, was released on 4 September 2015. The album was promoted with a European tour from March through May 2016. In March, they played a live concert that was broadcast on BBC Red Button and BBC Radio 2 as part of its &quot;In Concert&quot; series.

a-ha also performed at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.

In Oslo Spektrum on 3 May 2016, A-ha collaborated with Void, a Norwegian computational computational design studio. The project resulted in a concert with advanced scenography using 360 virtual reality technology. The stereoscopic VR experience was made available for Android users directly through a YouTube app and for iPhone users and other platforms. The concept involved several motion detectors that reacted to the band&#x27;s movements, voices and instruments. 3D cameras, 20,000 lines of code, 1,000 square meters of projection film and massive projectors were set up as a visual show that turned the Spektrum arena in Oslo into a light installation and visual experience that unfolded live for the audience instead of a pre-programmed sequence.

===&quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; and &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; tours (2017–2021) ===
An album and film from a series of acoustic performances, slated for June 2017, was scheduled for November 2017.

In mid-June 2017, they recorded an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special in the remote Norwegian island of Giske under close secrecy, with no phones or recording equipment allowed in the studio. In October 2017, an acoustic album titled &quot;Summer Solstice&quot; was released. It and included two new songs, &quot;This Is Our Home&quot; and &quot;A Break in the Clouds&quot;. The video for &quot;This Is Our Home&quot; was released in September 2017, followed by the &quot;Unplugged&quot; versions of &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V&quot;, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and &quot;Take On Me&quot;, the last of which received widespread acclaim for re-imagining the pop classic.

In early 2018, A-ha went on a European acoustic tour, which was first titled &quot;An Acoustic Evening with A-ha&quot; but then renamed &quot;&quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; Tour 2018&quot;.

The acoustic version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; was included in the movie &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, released in May 2018, and in episode 13, season 4 of the American TV series &quot;The Magicians&quot;.

On 29 October 2019, A-ha started their Hunting High and Low tour in Dublin, Ireland, in which they played the whole of their debut album, in addition to other songs. The tour, scheduled to run through 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerts were scheduled for many European countries, South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and the United States. On the tour, the band presented the new song &quot;Digital River&quot;.

On 13 June 2021, the documentary &quot;a-ha: The Movie&quot; premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. The movie tells the story of the band and deals with both their success and the problems, such as personal rifts between members. Director Thomas Robsahm followed the band for four years. It was released in countries worldwide.

The acoustic studio version of &quot;Take On Me&quot; was included in the American TV sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; on episode 16, season 8.

=== Return of tour after the COVID-19 pandemic and &quot;True North&quot; (since 2022) ===
In March 2022, A-ha resumed the Hunting High and Low tour after postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new film and an album, both called &quot;True North&quot;, were released on 21 October 2022 on the Sony Music/RCA Records label. The recording was completed in November 2021 with the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra in Bodø, Norway. It is a filmed live performance and will also include scenic clips from Norway&#x27;s nature, set in landscapes of northern Norway. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I&#x27;m In&quot;, was released on 8 July 2022.

a-ha performed two of the album&#x27;s songs on their 2022 tour: &quot;Forest for the Trees&quot; and &quot;You Have What It Takes&quot;. A demo of &quot;I&#x27;m In&quot; and &quot;You Have What It Takes&quot; was previously posted on social media by Magne.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;You Have What It Takes&quot;, was released on 16 September 2022.

In 2023, in celebration of 65 years of the Hot 100, &quot;Billboard&quot; staff listed the 500 Best Pop Songs of All Time that graced the chart since 1958, with &quot;Take On Me&quot; at No. 26.

==Legacy==
To date, the band is the most successful global pop-music act to have emerged from Norway. At its peak in the mid-1980s, the band achieved chart-topping success in Britain and the United States and was commercially successful in non-English-speaking areas of the world such as Germany, France and South America. In 1986, A-ha received eight MTV Video Music Awards during one award show.

The music video for &quot;Take On Me&quot; is considered to be one of the most distinctive music videos from the 1980s. On 17 February 2020, the video became the fifth video from the 1980s and 1990s to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, following &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

Songs by A-ha, either in original form or in the form of cover versions, have been included as background music and performances in episodes of popular television series, such as &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot; and &quot;The Leftovers&quot;.

The band recorded a James Bond theme song, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, for the film of the same name. A-ha&#x27;s music has also appeared in movies such as &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Exorcism&quot;, &quot;One Night at McCool&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; and &quot;Corky Romano&quot;.

a-ha holds a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; from 1991 for drawing the largest paying audience at a pop concert, with 198,000 people at the Estádio do Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro. In 2006, the band was awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award.

Ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, a poll made it clear that A-ha&#x27;s 1991 appearance and their record audience number that year was what people remembered best and the highlight of the festival&#x27;s 30-year history. As a result, A-ha were invited to reunite for a performance at the festival, celebrating 30 years since their debut album&#x27;s release.

Several bands and artists have mentioned that they like A-ha, including Chris Martin of Coldplay, Sarah Brightman, Adam Clayton of U2, Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and Pitbull.

Pitbull and Christina Aguilera performed the song &quot;Feel This Moment&quot;, which interpolates &quot;Take On Me&quot;, live at the MGM Grand during the 2013 Billboard Music Awards, with a surprise appearance from Harket.

Harket and Furuholmen used their celebrity status to pioneer plug-in electric vehicles in Norway when, together with the environmental NGO Bellona, they imported a converted Fiat Panda and managed to get it registered. Their driving around in this car became local folklore and Robbie Andrew, a senior scientist working at Oslo’s CICERO Centre for International Climate Research, has argued that the Norwegian enthusiasm for electric cars and their favourable fiscal status can be traced back to this period.

== Musical style and influences ==
&quot;A-ha&quot;&#x27;s music has been described as synth-pop, new wave, pop rock, alternative rock, pop and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.

The band has been influenced by Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, INXS, AC/DC, Rush and Yes.

==Awards==

Following the success of their debut, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986 but did not win. A-ha did win eight MTV Video Music Awards, six for &quot;Take On Me&quot; and two for &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot;. &quot;Take On Me&quot; was also nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Video at the American Music Awards of 1986. A-ha have won 10 Spellemannprisen awards, the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Awards.

In November 2012, all three bandmates were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music.

<doc id="170034" wikidata="Q844250" url="?curid=170034" title="Lordship of Ireland">
<text>The Lordship of Ireland (), sometimes referred to retrospectively as Anglo-Norman Ireland, was the part of Ireland ruled by the King of England (styled as &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot;) and controlled by loyal Anglo-Norman Lords between 1177 and 1542. The lordship was created following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169–1171. It was a papal fief, granted to the Plantagenet kings of England by the Holy See, via . As the Lord of Ireland was also the King of England, he was represented locally by a governor, variously known as the Justiciar, Lieutenant, Lord Lieutenant or Lord Deputy.

The kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island, but in reality the king&#x27;s rule only ever extended to parts of the island. The rest of the island – referred to subsequently as Gaelic Ireland – remained under the control of various Gaelic Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms, who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans.

The area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time, and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The lordship then went into decline, brought on by its invasion by Scotland in 1315–1318, the Great Famine of 1315–1317, and the Black Death of the 1340s. The fluid political situation and Norman feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland, who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings. Some Anglo-Normans became Gaelicised and rebelled against the English administration. The English attempted to curb this by passing the Statutes of Kilkenny (1366), which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law, language, custom and dress. The period ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542.

==History==

===Arrival of the Normans in Ireland===
The authority of the Lordship of Ireland&#x27;s government was seldom extended throughout the island of Ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the Pale around Dublin, and some provincial towns, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and their hinterlands. It owed its origins to the decision of a Leinster dynast, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Diarmuid MacMorrough), to bring in a Norman knight based in Wales, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (alias &#x27;Strongbow&#x27;), to aid him in his battle to regain his throne, after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new Irish High King (the previous incumbent had protected MacMurrough). Henry II of England invaded Ireland to control Strongbow, who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes (there had been earlier fears that Saxon refugees might use either Ireland or Flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066); much of the later Plantagenet consolidation of South Wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to Ireland.

===Henry Plantagenet and ===

From 1155 Henry claimed that Pope Adrian IV had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland. Religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in Ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of Europe influenced more directly by the Holy See, although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155. Further, the former Irish church had never sent its dues (&quot;tithes&quot;) to Rome. Henry&#x27;s primary motivation for invading Ireland in 1171 was to control Strongbow and other Norman lords. In the process he accepted the fealty of the Gaelic kings at Dublin in November 1171 and summoned the Synod of Cashel in 1172, this bringing the Irish Church into conformity with English and European norms.

In 1175 the Treaty of Windsor was agreed by Henry and Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, High King of Ireland.

The popes asserted the right to grant sovereignty over islands to different monarchs on the basis of the Donation of Constantine (now known to be a forgery). Doubts were cast by eminent scholars on itself in the 19th century, but it had been confirmed by the letters of Pope Alexander III. The Papal power to grant also fell within the remit of (1075–1087). While had referred to the &quot;kingdom&quot; of Ireland, the Papacy was ambiguous about continuing to describe it as a kingdom as early as 1185.

===John Lackland as Lord of Ireland===

Having captured a small part of Ireland on the east coast, Henry used the land to solve a dispute dividing his family. For he had divided his territories between his sons, with the youngest being nicknamed (in English, &quot;John Lackland&quot;) as he was left without lands to rule. At the Oxford parliament in May 1177, Henry replaced William FitzAldelm and granted John his Irish lands, so becoming Lord of Ireland () in 1177 when he was 10 years old, with the territory being known in English as the Lordship of Ireland.

Henry had wanted John to be crowned King of Ireland on his first visit in 1185, but Pope Lucius III specifically refused permission, citing the dubious nature of a claim supposedly provided by Pope Adrian IV years earlier. (usually translated &#x27;lord&#x27;) was the usual title of a king who had not yet been crowned, suggesting that it was Henry&#x27;s intention. Lucius then died while John was in Ireland, and Henry obtained consent from Pope Urban III and ordered a crown of gold and peacock feathers for John. In late 1185 the crown was ready, but John&#x27;s visit had by then proved a complete failure, so Henry cancelled the coronation.

Following the deaths of John&#x27;s older brothers he became King of England in 1199, and so the Lordship of Ireland, instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior Norman prince, came under the direct rule of the Angevin crown. In the legal terminology of John&#x27;s successors, the &quot;lordship of Ireland&quot; referred to the sovereignty vested in the Crown of England; the corresponding territory was referred to as the &quot;land of Ireland&quot;.

===Perennial struggle with Gaeldom===

The Lordship thrived in the 13th century during the Medieval Warm Period, a time of warm climate and better harvests. The feudal system was introduced, and the Parliament of Ireland first sat in 1297. Some counties were created by shiring, while walled towns and castles became a feature of the landscape. But little of this engagement with mainstream European life was of benefit to those the Normans called the &quot;mere Irish&quot;. &quot;Mere&quot; derived from the Latin , meaning &quot;pure&quot;. Environmental decay and deforestation continued unabated throughout this period, being greatly exacerbated by the English newcomers and an increase in population.

The Norman élite and churchmen spoke Norman French and Latin. Many poorer settlers spoke English, Welsh, and Flemish. The Gaelic areas spoke Irish dialects. The Yola language of County Wexford was a survivor of the early English dialects. The Kildare Poems of c. 1350 are a rare example of humorous local culture written in Middle English.

The Lordship suffered invasion from Scotland by Edward Bruce in 1315–1318, which destroyed much of the economy and coincided with the great famine of 1315–1317. The earldom of Ulster ended in 1333, and the Black Death of 1348–1350 impacted more on the town-dwelling Normans than on the remaining Gaelic clans. The Norman and English colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language, becoming &quot;Gaelicized&quot; or in the words of some &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot;. In 1366 the Statute of Kilkenny tried to keep aspects of Gaelic culture out of the Norman-controlled areas albeit in vain. As the Norman lordships became increasingly Gaelicized and made alliances with native chiefs, whose power steadily increased, crown control slowly eroded.

Additionally, the Plantagenet government increasingly alienated the Irish chiefs and people on whom they often relied for their military strength. It had been a common practice for the Norman lordships as well as government forces to recruit the native Irish who were allied to them or living in English controlled areas (i.e. Leinster including Meath and Ossory, Munster and some parts of Connacht). This was easy to do as the native Irish had no great sense of national identity at that time and were prone to mercenarism and shifting alliances. But the Irish chiefs became increasingly alienated by the oppressive measures of the English government and began openly rebelling against the crown. Some of the more notable among those clans who had formerly cooperated with the English but became increasingly alienated until turning openly anti-Norman and a thorn in the side of the Dublin administration were the O&#x27;Connor Falys, the MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty (Kingdom of Leinster), the Byrnes and the O&#x27;Mores of Leix. These clans were able to successfully defend their territories against English attack for a very long time through the use of asymmetrical guerrilla warfare and devastating raids into the lands held by the colonists. Additionally, the power of native chiefs who had never come under English domination such as the O&#x27;Neills and the O&#x27;Donnells increased steadily until these became once again major power players on the scene of Irish politics. Historians refer to a Gaelic revival or resurgence as occurring between 1350 and 1500, by which time the area ruled for the Crown – &quot;the Pale&quot; – had shrunk to a small area around Dublin.

Between 1500 and 1542 a mixed situation arose. Most clans remained loyal to the Crown most of the time, at least in theory, but using a Gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours, centered on the Lord Deputy who was usually the current Earl of Kildare. The Battle of Knockdoe in 1504 saw such a coalition army fight the Burkes in Galway. However, a rebellion by the 9th Earl&#x27;s heir Silken Thomas in 1535 led on to a less sympathetic system of rule by mainly English-born administrators. The end of this rebellion and Henry VIII&#x27;s seizure of the Irish monasteries around 1540 led on to his plan to create a new kingdom based on the existing parliament.

===Transformation into a Kingdom===
English monarchs continued to use the title &quot;Lord of Ireland&quot; to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of Ireland. The title was changed by the Crown of Ireland Act passed by the Irish Parliament in 1542 when, on Henry VIII&#x27;s demand, he was granted a new title, King of Ireland, with the state renamed the Kingdom of Ireland. Henry VIII changed his title because the Lordship of Ireland had been granted to the Norman monarchy by the Papacy; Henry had been excommunicated by the Catholic Church and worried that his title could be withdrawn by the Holy See. Henry VIII also wanted Ireland to become a full kingdom to encourage a greater sense of loyalty amongst his Irish subjects, some of whom took part in his policy of surrender and regrant. To provide for greater security, a Royal Irish Army was established.

Queen Mary I, one of Henry VIII&#x27;s daughters, would take the English throne in 1553. As a Catholic, she sought to smooth relations with the Pope. Pope Paul IV would grant Philip II of Spain (Mary&#x27;s husband) and Mary the title of King and Queen of Ireland in 1555, endorsing the position that the Tudors were indeed the rightful Irish monarchy. This grant would not work as Paul IV had expected, as Mary died in 1558 and was succeeded as Queen of England and Ireland by her half-sister Elizabeth I, a Protestant.

<text>A four-stroke (also four-cycle) engine is an internal combustion (IC) engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:
#Intake: Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing a partial vacuum (negative pressure) in the cylinder through its downward motion. 
#Compression: This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C. In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.
#Combustion: Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.
#Exhaust: Also known as outlet. During the &quot;exhaust&quot; stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust port.

Four-stroke engines are the most common internal combustion engine design for motorized land transport, being used in automobiles, trucks, diesel trains, light aircraft and motorcycles. The major alternative design is the two-stroke cycle.

== History ==

=== Otto cycle ===


Nikolaus August Otto was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir. In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18 litre Lenoir Engine produced only 2 horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by Philip Lebon.

In testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success.

In 1864, Otto and Eugen Langen founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year.
The factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of Deutz, Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company). In 1872, Gottlieb Daimler was technical director and Wilhelm Maybach was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine.
By 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time.

Daimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The Daimler &quot;Reitwagen&quot; used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world&#x27;s first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto&#x27;s design. The following year, Karl Benz produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.

In 1884, Otto&#x27;s company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft. Today, that company is Daimler-Benz.

=== Atkinson cycle ===


The Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by James Atkinson in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of power density, and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications.

The original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines.

Due to the unique crankshaft design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson&#x27;s original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the fuel economy improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide.

===Diesel cycle===

The diesel engine is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto-cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, Rudolf Diesel wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The Lenoir, Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on Illuminating Gas (coal gas). With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self-ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine.

During initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design.

The four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto-cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency.

==Thermodynamic analysis==
The thermodynamic analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.

During normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non-compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%.

==Fuel considerations==
A problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.

The tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self-ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher compression ratios also mean that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the expansion ratio).

The octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel&#x27;s resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.

Many modern four-stroke engines employ gasoline direct injection or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top.

Diesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold. Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a glow plug.

==Design and engineering principles==

=== Power output limitations ===
The maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a two-stroke engine or four-stroke design, volumetric efficiency, losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed (RPM). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication. Valves, pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as &#x27;valve float&#x27;, and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10 m/s.

==== Intake/exhaust port flow ====
The output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air–fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the cylinder head. To increase an engine&#x27;s output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an air flow bench, the radii of valve port turns and valve seat configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called porting, and it can be done by hand or with a CNC machine.

=== Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine ===
An internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If somehow waste heat could be captured and turned to mechanical energy, the engine&#x27;s performance and/or fuel efficiency could be improved by improving the overall efficiency of the cycle. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly.

Many methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the Rankine Cycle, turbocharging and thermoelectric generation can be very useful as a waste heat recovery system.

==== Supercharging ====
One way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a supercharger, which can be powered by the engine crankshaft.

Supercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.

==== Turbocharging ====
A turbocharger is a supercharger that is driven by the engine&#x27;s exhaust gases, by means of a turbine. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow.

When idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to &#x27;spool up&#x27; the turbocharger&#x27;s turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine.

Turbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.

=== Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio ===
The rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the connecting rod to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight.

A &quot;square engine&quot; is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an oversquare engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.

=== Valve train ===
The valves are typically operated by a camshaft rotating at half the speed of the crankshaft. It has a series of cams along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A tappet between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts &quot;above&quot; a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase, in which case each cam usually contacts a push rod, which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve, or in case of a flathead engine a push rod is not necessary. The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.

==== Valve clearance ====
Valve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too-small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly. This results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each with a feeler gauge.

Most modern production engines use hydraulic lifters to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure.

===Energy balance===
Otto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being lost due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories. There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a turbocharger in diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed back into the engine&#x27;s transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the turbosteamer, a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%. By contrast, a six-stroke engine may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.

Modern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for emission controls such as exhaust gas recirculation and catalytic converters that reduce smog and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an engine control unit using lean burn techniques.

In the United States, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of compared to the current standard of . As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) have to be considered. Some potential solutions to increase fuel efficiency to meet new mandates include firing after the piston is farthest from the crankshaft, known as top dead centre, and applying the Miller cycle. Together, this redesign could significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

<text>This is a list of heavy metal artists from the formative years of the movement (formed between 1963 and 1981). For bands formed after 1981, please consult the lists for each heavy metal subgenre. 

In the late 1960s, a number of bands began pushing the limits of blues rock into a new genre which would be called heavy metal.

In 1981, three of the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash metal bands emerged (Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax), to be joined on the scene in 1983 by Megadeth.

<text>Valerie Anand (born 1937, died 2023) was a British author of historical fiction.

==Fiction==
Under the pen name Fiona Buckley she wrote the series of historical mysteries, set in the reign of Elizabeth I of England, featuring &quot;Ursula Blanchard&quot; (whose full name is Ursula Faldene Blanchard de la Roche Stannard). Under her own name, she wrote historical fiction based on the royalty of England and the &quot;Bridges over Time&quot; series which follows a family from the eleventh century through the twentieth century. She has also written &quot;To a Native Shore&quot;, a contemporary novel that explores British prejudice toward Indian Sikhs.

Anand also held the copyrights to &quot;The Fallen Pinnacle&quot;, a 1997 novel about Atlantis written under the pseudonym Valerie M. Irwin.

==Innocence of King Richard III==
Valerie Anand was a believer in the innocence of King Richard III in the matter of the Princes in the Tower, i.e. a Ricardian. She presented this view in &quot;Crown of Roses&quot;, making the point that the former tutor of Edward V, John Alcock, remained on good terms with the king, which he presumably would not have done had he suspected him of being responsible for the death of his former student.

<doc id="170081" wikidata="Q271878" url="?curid=170081" title="George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston">
<text>George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (11 January 1859 – 20 March 1925), known as Lord Curzon, was a British statesman, Conservative politician, explorer and writer who served as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905 and Foreign Secretary from 1919 to 1924.

Curzon was born in Derbyshire into an aristocratic family and educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, before entering Parliament in 1886. In the following years, he travelled extensively in Russia, Central Asia and the Far East, and published several books on the region in which he detailed his geopolitical outlook and underlined the perceived Russian threat to British control of India. In 1891, Curzon was named Under-Secretary of State for India, and in 1899 he was appointed Viceroy of India. During his tenure, he pursued a number of reforms of the British administration, attempted to address the British maltreatment of Indians, undertook the restoration of the Taj Mahal, and sent a British expedition to Tibet to counter Russian ambitions. In 1905, he presided over the partition of Bengal and came into conflict with Lord Kitchener over issues of military organisation. Unable to secure the backing of the government in London, he resigned later that year and returned to England.

In 1907, Curzon became Chancellor of Oxford University, and the following year he was elected to the House of Lords. During the First World War, he served in H. H. Asquith&#x27;s coalition cabinet as Lord Privy Seal, and from late 1916 he was Leader of the House of Lords and served in the war cabinet of Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the War Policy Committee. He was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in October 1919 and lent his name to Britain&#x27;s proposed Soviet-Polish boundary, the Curzon Line. He also oversaw the division of the British Mandate of Palestine and the creation of the Emirate of Transjordan, and was the chief Allied negotiator of the 1922 Treaty of Lausanne which defined the borders of modern Turkey. In 1921, he was created a marquess. On Bonar Law&#x27;s retirement as Prime Minister in 1923, Curzon was a contender for the office but was passed over in favour of Stanley Baldwin. He remained as Foreign Secretary until 1924 when the Baldwin government fell, and died a year later at the age of 66.

== Early life ==
Curzon was the eldest son and the second of the eleven children of Alfred Curzon, 4th Baron Scarsdale (1831–1916), who was the Rector of Kedleston in Derbyshire. George&#x27;s mother was Blanche (1837–1875), the daughter of Joseph Pocklington-Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumberland. He was born at Kedleston Hall, built on the site where his family, who were clergymen and priests, had lived since the 12th century. His mother, exhausted by childbirth, died when George was 16; her husband survived her by 41 years. Neither parent exerted a major influence on Curzon&#x27;s life. Scarsdale was an austere and unindulgent father who believed that landowners should stay on their land and not indefinitely tour the world for pleasure. He disapproved of the journeys across Asia between 1887 and 1895 which made his son one of the most travelled men to be a member of any British cabinet. An influential presence in Curzon&#x27;s childhood was that of his brutal, sadistic governess, Ellen Mary Paraman, whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged the obsessional side of his nature. Paraman used to beat him and periodically forced him to parade through the village wearing a conical hat bearing the words &quot;liar&quot;, &quot;sneak&quot;, and &quot;coward&quot;. Curzon later noted, &quot;No children well born and well-placed ever cried so much and so justly.&quot;

He was educated at Wixenford School, Eton College, and Balliol College, Oxford. His over-intimate relationship at Eton College with Oscar Browning led to the latter&#x27;s dismissal. A spinal injury incurred while riding during his adolescence was a lifelong impediment to Curzon that required him to wear a metal corset for the remainder of his life.

Curzon was President of the Union and Secretary of the Oxford Canning Club (a Tory political club named after George Canning), but as a consequence of the extent of his time-expenditure on political and social societies, he failed to achieve a first class degree in Greats, although he subsequently won both the Lothian Prize Essay and the Arnold Prize, the latter for an essay on Sir Thomas More, about whom he knew little. In 1883, Curzon received the most prestigious fellowship at the university, a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College. While at Eton and at Oxford, Curzon was a contemporary and close friend of Cecil Spring Rice and Edward Grey. Spring Rice contributed, alongside John William Mackail, to the composition of a famous sardonic doggerel about Curzon that was published as part of &quot;The Balliol Masque&quot;, about which Curzon wrote in later life &quot;never has more harm been done to one single individual than that accursed doggerel has done to me.&quot; It read:
:My name is George Nathaniel Curzon,
:I am a most superior person.
:My cheek is pink, my hair is sleek,
:I dine at Blenheim once a week.

When Spring-Rice was assigned to the British Embassy to the United States in 1894–1895, he was suspected by Curzon of trying to prevent Curzon&#x27;s engagement to the American Mary Leiter, whom Curzon nevertheless married. Spring Rice assumed for a certainty, like many of Curzon&#x27;s other friends, that Curzon would inevitably become Foreign Secretary: he wrote to Curzon in 1891, &#x27;When you are Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs I hope you will restore the vanished glory of England, lead the European concert, decide the fate of nations, and give me three months&#x27; leave instead of two&#x27;.

Old texts state that he spent few months in a cottage in Dehradun, India. Though exact records are not available there is a road named after him there (probably near his erstwhile cottage).

== Early political career ==
During his youth years, Curzon regularly attended debates at the House of Commons. Curzon became Assistant Private Secretary to the Marquess of Salisbury in 1885, and in 1886 entered Parliament as Member for Southport in south-west Lancashire. His maiden speech, which was chiefly an attack on home rule and Irish nationalism, was regarded in much the same way as his oratory at the Oxford Union: brilliant and eloquent but also presumptuous and rather too self-assured. Subsequent performances in the Commons, often dealing with Ireland or reform of the House of Lords (which he supported), received similar verdicts. He was Under-Secretary of State for India in 1891–1892 and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1895–1898.

==Asian travels and writings==
In the meantime Curzon had travelled around the world: Russia and Central Asia (1888–1889); Persia (September 1889 – January 1890); Siam, French Indochina, China, Korea and Japan (1892); and a daring foray into Afghanistan and the Pamirs (1894–1895). He published several books describing central and eastern Asia and related foreign policy issues. A bold and compulsive traveller, driven by orientalism, he was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his exploration of the source of the Amu Darya (Oxus). His journeys allowed him to study the problems of Asia and their implications for British India, while reinforcing his pride in his nation and her imperial mission.

Curzon believed Russia to be the most likely threat to British India, Britain&#x27;s most valuable possession, from the 19th century through the early 20th century. In 1879 Russia had begun construction of the Transcaspian Railway along the Silk Road, officially solely to enforce local control. The line starts from the city of Kyzyl-Su, formerly Krasnovodsk (nowadays Turkmenbashi) (on the Caspian Sea), travels southeast along the Karakum Desert, through Ashgabat, continues along the Kopet Dagh Mountains until it reaches Tejen. Curzon dedicated an entire chapter in his book &quot;Russia in Central Asia&quot; to discussing the perceived threat to British control of India. This railway connected Russia with the most wealthy and influential cities in Central Asia at the time, including the Persian Khorasan Province, and would allow the rapid deployment of Russian supplies and troops into the area. Curzon also believed that the resulting greater economic interdependence between Russia and Central Asia would be damaging to British interests.

&quot;Persia and the Persian Question&quot;, written in 1892, has been considered Curzon&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and can be seen as a sequel to &quot;Russia in Central Asia.&quot; Curzon was commissioned by &quot;The Times&quot; to write several articles on the Persian political environment, but while there he decided to write a book on the country as whole. This two-volume work covers Persia&#x27;s history and governmental structure, as well as graphics, maps and pictures (some taken by Curzon himself). Curzon was aided by General Albert Houtum-Schindler and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), both of which helped him gain access to material to which as a foreigner he would not have been entitled to have access. General Schindler provided Curzon with information regarding Persia&#x27;s geography and resources, as well as serving as an unofficial editor.

Curzon was appalled by his government&#x27;s apathy towards Persia as a valuable defensive buffer to India from Russian encroachment. Years later Curzon would lament that &quot;Persia has alternatively advanced and receded in the estimation of British statesmen, occupying now a position of extravagant prominence, anon one of unmerited obscurity.&quot;

== First marriage (1895–1906) ==

On 22 April 1895, Curzon married Mary Victoria Leiter, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Levi Leiter, an American millionaire of Swiss descent, who co-founded the Chicago department store Field &amp; Leiter (later Marshall Field). While he married Mary for her wealth so he could save his estate, he later developed feelings for her. Mary had a long and nearly fatal illness near the end of summer 1904, from which she never really recovered. Falling ill again in July 1906, she died on the 18th of that month in her husband&#x27;s arms, at the age of 36. It was the greatest personal loss of his life.

She was buried in the church at Kedleston, where Curzon designed his memorial for her, a Gothic chapel added to the north side of the nave. Although he was neither a devout nor a conventional churchman, Curzon retained a simple religious faith; in later years he sometimes said that he was not afraid of death because it would enable him to join Mary in heaven.

They had three daughters during a firm and happy marriage: Mary Irene (known as Irene), who inherited her father&#x27;s Barony of Ravensdale and was created a life peer in her own right; Cynthia Blanche, who became the first wife of the fascist politician Sir Oswald Mosley; and Alexandra Naldera (&quot;Baba&quot;), Curzon&#x27;s youngest daughter; she married Edward &quot;Fruity&quot; Metcalfe, the best friend, best man and equerry of Edward VIII. Mosley exercised a strange fascination for the Curzon women: Irene had a brief romance with him before either were married; Baba became his mistress; and Curzon&#x27;s second wife, Grace, had a long affair with him.

== Viceroy of India (1899–1905) ==


In January 1899 Curzon was appointed as Viceroy of India. He was created a baron in the peerage of Ireland as Baron Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, on his appointment. (The title was &quot;Curzon of Kedleston&quot; rather than simply &quot;Curzon&quot; because his kinsmen the Earls Howe were already Viscounts and Barons Curzon.) As Viceroy, he was &quot;ex officio&quot; Grand Master of the Order of the Indian Empire and Order of the Star of India. This peerage was created in the Peerage of Ireland (the last so created) so that he would be free, until his father&#x27;s death, to re-enter the House of Commons on his return to Britain.

Reaching India shortly after the suppression of the frontier risings of 1897–98, he paid special attention to the independent tribes of the north-west frontier, inaugurated a new province called the North West Frontier Province, and pursued a policy of forceful control mingled with conciliation. In response to what he called &quot;a number of murderous attacks upon Englishmen and Europeans&quot;, Curzon advocated at the Quetta Durbar extremely draconian punishments which he believed would stop what he viewed as such especially abominable crimes. In his own private correspondence, Curzon pondered &quot;Is it possible, under the law, to flog these horrible scoundrels before we execute them? Supposing we remove them for execution to another and distant jail, could we flog them in the first jail before removal? I believe that if we could postpone the execution for a few weeks and give the criminal a few good public floggings – or even one, were more not possible – it would act as a real deterrent. But I have a suspicion that British law does not smile upon anything so eminently practical.&quot; The only major armed outbreak on this frontier during the period of his administration was the Mahsud-Waziri campaign of 1901.

In the context of the Great Game between the British and Russian Empires for control of Central Asia, he held deep mistrust of Russian intentions. This led him to encourage British trade in Persia, and he paid a visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903. Curzon argued for an exclusive British presence in the Gulf, a policy originally proposed by John Malcolm. The British government was already making agreements with local sheiks/tribal leaders along the Persian Gulf coast to this end. Curzon had convinced his government to establish Britain as the unofficial protector of Kuwait with the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899. The Lansdowne Declaration in 1903 stated that the British would counter any other European power&#x27;s attempt to establish a military presence in the Gulf. Only four years later this position was abandoned and the Persian Gulf declared a neutral zone in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, prompted in part by the high economic cost of defending India from Russian advances.

At the end of 1903, Curzon sent a British expedition to Tibet under Francis Younghusband, ostensibly to forestall a Russian advance. After bloody conflicts with Tibet&#x27;s poorly armed defenders, the mission penetrated to Lhasa, where the Treaty of Lhasa was signed in September 1904.

During his tenure, Curzon undertook the restoration of the Taj Mahal and expressed satisfaction that he had done so. Curzon was influenced by Hindu philosophy and quoted: 

Within India, Curzon appointed a number of commissions to inquire into education, irrigation, police and other branches of administration, on whose reports legislation was based during his second term of office as viceroy. Reappointed Governor-General in August 1904, he presided over the 1905 partition of Bengal.
 Curzon was determined to address the British maltreatment of Indians. In particular, he incurred the displeasure of many in the European community in India by pressing for severe punishment for Europeans who had attacked Indians. On two occasions, he imposed collective punishment on British Army units which had attacked Indians: when soldiers of the West Kent Regiment raped a Burmese woman, he had the whole regiment exiled to Aden without leave. He later imposed similar punishment on the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers for the murder of an Indian cook.

Mahatma Gandhi lauded Curzon as the first viceroy to express sympathy for indentured Indian labourers and question why the system should continue. Curzon was especially concerned with the treatment of Indian emigrants to the Transvaal and Natal. After learning about the realities of labour conditions for indentured Indians, he deemed it impossible to defend the system in its current state, and committed to a stance of reform. In 1900, Curzon wrote an appeal to the Permanent Under-Secretary for India calling for indentured labourers to be treated better given their contribution to colonial defences, although this did not prompt immediate change. On 14 May 1903, he wrote a lengthy despatch to the India Office demanding full discretion to withdraw from the system of indentured labour if they would not concede to the proper treatment of Indian workers. He continued to champion this cause throughout his time as viceroy.

Curzon proposed the Partition of Bengal and put it into effect on 16 October 1905 creating the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. Behind this incident, his excuse was that the area of Bengal was too large and it was difficult for the British to administer efficiently but actually his intention was to divide Bengalis into religious and territorial grounds to weaken the growing nationalism in Bengal. He said, &quot;Partition of Bengal is a settled fact and what is settled cannot be unsettled.&quot; Huge protest (Swadeshi movement) was seen from every corner of Bengal and on 1911 this so-called &quot;settled fact&quot; became &quot;unsettled&quot; by Lord Hardinge. It was done in response to the Swadeshi movement&#x27;s riots in protest against the policy but the partition animated the Muslims to form their own national organization along communal lines.

=== Indian Army ===
Curzon took an active interest in military matters and in 1901 he founded the Imperial Cadet Corps, or ICC. The ICC was a corps d&#x27;elite, designed to give Indian princes and aristocrats military training, after which a few would be given officer commissions in the Indian Army but these commissions were &quot;special commissions&quot; which did not empower their holders to command any troops. Predictably, this was a major stumbling block to the ICC&#x27;s success, as it caused much resentment among former cadets. Though the ICC closed in 1914, it was a crucial stage in the drive to Indianise the Indian Army&#x27;s officer corps, which was haltingly begun in 1917.

Military organisation proved to be the final issue faced by Curzon in India. It often involved petty issues that had much to do with clashes of personality: Curzon once wrote on a document &quot;I rise from the perusal of these papers filled with the sense of the ineptitude of my military advisers&quot;, and once wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, India, Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, advising him that signing himself &quot;Kitchener of Khartoum&quot; took up too much time and space, which Kitchener thought petty (Curzon simply signed himself &quot;Curzon&quot; as if he were a hereditary peer, although he later took to signing himself &quot;Curzon of Kedleston&quot;). A difference of opinion with Kitchener regarding the status of the military member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council (who controlled army supply and logistics, which Kitchener wanted under his own control), led to a controversy in which Curzon failed to obtain the support of the home government. He resigned in August 1905 and returned to England.

=== Indian famine ===
A major famine coincided with Curzon&#x27;s time as viceroy in which 1 to 4.5 million people died. Curzon implemented a variety of measures, including opening up famine relief works that fed between 3 and 5 million, reducing taxes and spending vast amounts of money on irrigation works. In &quot;Late Victorian Holocausts&quot;, the historian Mike Davis criticised Curzon for cutting back rations and raising relief eligibility. At the time, Curzon stated that &quot;any government which imperiled the financial position of India in the interests of prodigal philanthropy would be open to serious criticism; but any government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralized the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime.&quot;

== Return to Britain ==
Arthur Balfour&#x27;s refusal to recommend an earldom for Curzon in 1905 was repeated by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal prime minister, who formed his government the day after Curzon returned to England. In deference to the wishes of the King and the advice of his doctors, Curzon did not stand in the general election of 1906 and thus found himself excluded from public life for the first time in twenty years. It was at this time, the nadir of his career, that Mary died.

After the death of Lord Goschen in 1907, the post of Chancellor of Oxford University fell vacant. Curzon was elected as Chancellor of Oxford after by 1,001 votes to 440 against Lord Rosebery. He proved to be an active chancellor – &quot;[he] threw himself so energetically into the cause of university reform that critics complained he was ruling Oxford like an Indian province.&quot;

==House of Lords==

In 1908, Curzon was elected an Irish representative peer, and thus relinquished any idea of returning to the House of Commons. In 1909–1910 he took an active part in opposing the Liberal government&#x27;s proposal to abolish the legislative veto of the House of Lords, and in 1911 was created Baron Ravensdale, of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to his daughters, Viscount Scarsdale, of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to the heirs male of his father, and Earl Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, with the normal remainder, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He became involved with saving Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, from destruction. This experience strengthened his resolve for heritage protection. He was one of the sponsors of the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913. He served as President of the Committee commissioning the Survey of London which documented the capital&#x27;s principal buildings and public art.

On 5 May 1914, he spoke out against a bill in the House of Lords that would have permitted women who already had the right to vote in local elections the right to vote for members of Parliament.

== First World War ==

Curzon joined the Cabinet, as Lord Privy Seal, when Asquith formed his coalition in May 1915. Like other politicians (e.g. Austen Chamberlain, Arthur Balfour) Curzon favoured British Empire efforts in Mesopotamia, believing that the increase in British prestige would discourage a German-inspired Muslim revolt in India. Curzon was a member of the Dardanelles Committee and told that body (October 1915) that the recent Salonika expedition was &quot;quixotic chivalry&quot;. Early in 1916 Curzon visited Sir Douglas Haig (newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of British forces in France) at his headquarters in France. Haig was impressed by Curzon&#x27;s brains and decisiveness, and considered that he had mellowed since his days as viceroy (Major-General Haig had been Inspector-General of Cavalry, India, at the time) and had lost &quot;his old pompous ways&quot;. Curzon served in Lloyd George&#x27;s small War cabinet as Leader of the House of Lords from December 1916, and he also served on the War Policy Committee. With Allied victory over Germany far from certain, Curzon wrote a paper (12 May 1917) for the War Cabinet urging that Britain seize Palestine and possibly Syria. Like other members of the War Cabinet, Curzon supported further Western Front offensives lest, with Russian commitment to the war wavering, France and Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.
At the War Policy Committee (3 October 1917) Curzon objected in vain to plans to redeploy two divisions to Palestine, with a view to advancing into Syria and knocking the Ottoman Empire out of the war altogether. Curzon&#x27;s commitment wavered somewhat as the losses of the Third Battle of Ypres mounted. In the summer of 1917 the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) General William Robertson sent Haig a biting description of the members of the War Cabinet, who he said were all frightened of Lloyd George; he described Curzon as &quot;a gasbag&quot;. During the crisis of February 1918, Curzon was one of the few members of the government to support Robertson, threatening in vain to resign if he were removed. Despite his opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage (he had been co-president of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage), the House of Lords voted conclusively in its favour.

== Second marriage (1917) ==

After a long affair with the romantic novelist Elinor Glyn, Curzon married the former Grace Elvina Hinds in January 1917. She was the wealthy Alabama-born widow of Alfredo Huberto Duggan (died 1915), a first-generation Irish Argentinian appointed to the Argentine Legation in London in 1905. Elinor Glyn was staying with Curzon at the time of the engagement and read about it in the morning newspapers.

Grace had three children from her first marriage, two sons, Alfred and Hubert, and a daughter, Grace Lucille. Alfred and Hubert, as Curzon&#x27;s step-sons, grew up within his influential circle. Curzon had three daughters from his first marriage, but he and Grace (despite fertility-related operations and several miscarriages) did not have any children together, which put a strain on their marriage. Letters written between them in the early 1920s imply that they still lived together, and remained devoted to each other. In 1923, Curzon was passed over for the office of Prime Minister partly on the advice of Arthur Balfour, who joked that Curzon &quot;has lost the hope of glory but he still possesses the means of Grace&quot; (a humorous allusion to the well known &quot;General Thanksgiving&quot; prayer of the Church of England, which thanks God for &quot;the means of grace, and for the hope of glory&quot;).

In 1917, Curzon bought Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, a 14th-century building that had been gutted during the English Civil War. He restored it extensively, and then bequeathed it to the National Trust. From 1915 he also rented Montacute House as a residence for himself and Elinor Glyn.

== Foreign Secretary (1919–1924) ==
===Relations with Lloyd George===
Curzon did not have David Lloyd George&#x27;s support. Curzon and Lloyd George had disliked one another since the 1911 Parliament Crisis. The Prime Minister thought him overly pompous and self-important, and it was said that he used him as if he were using a Rolls-Royce to deliver a parcel to the station; Lloyd George said much later that Winston Churchill treated his ministers in a way that Lloyd George would never have treated his: &quot;They were all men of substance — well, except Curzon.&quot; Multiple drafts of resignation letters written at this time were found upon Curzon&#x27;s death. Despite their antagonism, the two were often in agreement on government policy. Lloyd George needed the wealth of knowledge Curzon possessed so was both his biggest critic and, simultaneously, his largest supporter. Likewise, Curzon was grateful for the leeway he was allowed by Lloyd George when it came to handling affairs in the Middle East.

Other cabinet ministers also respected his vast knowledge of Central Asia but disliked his arrogance and often blunt criticism. Believing that the Foreign Secretary should be non-partisan, he would objectively present all the information on a subject to the Cabinet, as if placing faith in his colleagues to reach the appropriate decision. Conversely, Curzon would take personally and respond aggressively to any criticism.

It has been suggested that Curzon&#x27;s defensiveness reflected institutional insecurity by the Foreign Office as a whole. During the 1920s the Foreign Office was often a passive participant in decisions which were mainly reactive and dominated by the prime minister. The creation of the job of Colonial Secretary, the Cabinet Office and the League of Nations added to the Foreign Office&#x27;s insecurity.

===Policy under Lloyd George===

After nine months as acting Secretary while Balfour was at the Paris Peace Conference, Curzon was appointed Foreign Secretary in October 1919. He gave his name to the British government&#x27;s proposed Soviet-Polish boundary, the Curzon Line of December 1919. Although during the subsequent Polish-Soviet War, Poland conquered territory in the east, after World War II, Poland was shifted westwards, leaving the border between Poland and its eastern neighbours today approximately at the Curzon Line.

Curzon was largely responsible for the Peace Day ceremonies on 19 July 1919. These included the plaster Cenotaph, designed by the noted architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, for the Allied Victory parade in London. It was so successful that it was reproduced in stone, and still stands.

In 1918, during World War I, as Britain occupied Mesopotamia, Curzon tried to convince the Indian government to reconsider his scheme for Persia to be a buffer against Russian advances. British and Indian troops were in Persia protecting the oilfields at Abadan and watching the Afghan frontier – Curzon believed that British economic and military aid, sent via India, could prop up the Persian government and make her a British client state. The Anglo-Persian Agreement of August 1919 was never ratified and the British government rejected the plan as Russia had the geographical advantage and the defensive benefits would not justify the high economic cost.

Small British forces had twice occupied Baku on the Caspian in 1918, while an entire British division had occupied Batum on the Black Sea, supervising German and Turkish withdrawal. Against Curzon&#x27;s wishes, but on the advice of Sir George Milne, the commander on the spot, the CIGS Sir Henry Wilson, who wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India, and Egypt, and of Churchill (Secretary of State for War), the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), at the end of August 1919 leaving only three battalions at Batum.

In January 1920 Curzon insisted that British troops remain in Batum, against the wishes of Wilson and the Prime Minister. In February, while Curzon was on holiday, Wilson persuaded the Cabinet to allow withdrawal, but Curzon had the decision reversed on his return, although to Curzon&#x27;s fury (he thought it &quot;abuse of authority&quot;) Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. At Cabinet on 5 May 1920 Curzon &quot;by a long-winded jaw&quot; (in Wilson&#x27;s description) argued for a stay in Batum. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. For the rest of 1920 Curzon, supported by Milner (Colonial Secretary), argued that Britain should retain control of Persia. When Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull troops out of Persia to put down the rebellions in Iraq and Ireland, Lloyd George blocked the move, saying that Curzon &quot;would not stand it&quot;. In the end, financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.

Curzon worked on several Middle Eastern problems. He designed the Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920) between the victorious Allies and the Ottoman Empire. The treaty obliged Turkey to renounce all rights over Arab Asia and North Africa, but a new government in Turkey under Kemal Atatürk rejected the treaty. The Greeks invaded Turkey. Curzon tried and failed to induce the Greeks to accept a compromise on the status of Smyrna and failed to force the Turks to renounce their nationalist program. Lloyd George tried to use force at Chanak but lost support and was forced to step down as prime minister. Curzon remained as foreign secretary and helped tie down loose ends in the Middle East at the peace conference at Lausanne.

Curzon helped to negotiate Egyptian independence (agreed in 1922) and the division of the British Mandate of Palestine, despite the strong disagreement he held with the policy of his predecessor Arthur Balfour, and helped create the Emirate of Transjordan for Faisal&#x27;s brother, which may also have delayed the problems there. According to Sir David Gilmour, Curzon &quot;was the only senior figure in the British government at the time who foresaw that its policy would lead to decades of Arab–Jewish hostility&quot;.

During the Irish War of Independence, but before the introduction of martial law in December 1920, Curzon suggested the &quot;Indian&quot; solution of blockading villages and imposing collective fines for attacks on the police and army.

In 1921 Curzon was granted the titles Earl of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, and Marquess Curzon of Kedleston.

In 1922, he was the chief negotiator for the Allies of the Treaty of Lausanne, which officially ended the war with the Ottoman Empire and defined the borders of Turkey.

Curzon defended the geopolitical talent of Eyre Crowe, who served as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office from 1920 until his death in 1925.

===Under Bonar Law===
Unlike many leading Conservative members of Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition Cabinet, Curzon ceased to support Lloyd George over the Chanak Crisis and had just resigned when Conservative backbenchers voted at the Carlton Club meeting to end the Coalition in October 1922. Curzon was thus able to remain Foreign Secretary when Bonar Law formed a purely Conservative ministry.

In 1922–23 Curzon had to negotiate with France after French troops occupied the Ruhr to enforce the payment of German reparations; he described the French Prime Minister (and former president) Raymond Poincaré as a &quot;horrid little man&quot;. Curzon had expansive ambitions and was not much happier with Bonar Law, whose foreign policy was based on &quot;retrenchment and withdrawal&quot;, than he had been with Lloyd George. Curzon provided invaluable insight into the Middle East and was instrumental in shaping British foreign policy in that region.

==Passed over for the premiership, 1923==

On Bonar Law&#x27;s retirement as prime minister in May 1923, Curzon was passed over in favour of Stanley Baldwin, despite his eagerness for the job.

This decision was taken on the private advice of leading members of the party including former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. Balfour advised the monarch that in a democratic age it was inappropriate for the prime minister to be a member of the House of Lords, especially when the Labour Party, which had few peers, had become the main opposition party in the Commons. In private Balfour admitted that he was prejudiced against Curzon, whose character was objectionable to some. George V shared this prejudice. A letter purporting to detail the opinions of Bonar Law but actually written by Baldwin sympathisers was delivered to the King&#x27;s Private Secretary Lord Stamfordham, though it is unclear how much impact this had in the outcome. Curzon felt he was cheated because J. C. C. Davidson—to whom Baldwin was loyal—and Sir Charles Waterhouse falsely claimed to Stamfordham that Law had recommended that George V appoint Stanley Baldwin, not Curzon, as his successor. Harry Bennett says Curzon&#x27;s arrogance and unpopularity probably prevented him from becoming prime minister despite his brilliance, great capacity for work and accomplishments.

Winston Churchill, one of Curzon&#x27;s main rivals, accurately contended that Curzon &quot;sow[ed] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands&quot;. Even contemporaries who envied Curzon, such as Baldwin, conceded that Curzon was, in the words of his biographer Leonard Mosley, &quot;a devoted and indefatigable public servant, dedicated to the idea of Empire&quot;.

Curzon, summoned by Stamfordham, rushed to London assuming he was to be appointed. He burst into tears when told the truth. He later ridiculed Baldwin as &quot;a man of the utmost insignificance&quot;, although he served under Baldwin and proposed him for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Curzon remained foreign secretary under Baldwin until the government fell in January 1924. When Baldwin formed a new government in November 1924 he appointed Curzon Lord President of the Council.

Curzon&#x27;s rejection was a turning point in the nation&#x27;s political history. Henceforth, by convention peers were deemed to be barred from being leaders of major political parties and from becoming prime minister. In an age of democracy, it was no longer acceptable for the prime minister to be based in an unelected and largely powerless chamber.

==Death==

In March 1925 Curzon suffered a severe haemorrhage of the bladder. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died in London on 20 March 1925 at the age of 66. His coffin, made from the same tree at Kedleston that had encased his first wife, Mary, was taken to Westminster Abbey and from there to his ancestral home in Derbyshire, where he was interred beside Mary in the family vault at All Saints Church on 26 March. In his will, proven on 22 July, Curzon bequeathed his estate to his wife and his brother Francis; his estate was valued for probate at £343,279 10s. 4d. (roughly equivalent to £ million in ).

Upon his death the barony, earldom and marquessate of Curzon of Kedleston and the earldom of Kedleston became extinct, while the viscountcy and barony of Scarsdale were inherited by a nephew. The barony of Ravensdale was inherited by his eldest daughter Mary and is today held by his second daughter Cynthia&#x27;s great-grandson, Daniel Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale.

There is a blue plaque on the house in London where Curzon lived and died, No. 1 Carlton House Terrace, Westminster.

== Titles ==
On his appointment as Viceroy of India in 1898, he was created Baron Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby. This title was created in the Peerage of Ireland to enable him to potentially return to the House of Commons, as Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords. His was the last title to be created in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1908, he was elected a representative of the Irish peerage in the British House of Lords, from which it followed that he would be a member of the House of Lords until death; indeed, his Irish representative peerage would continue even if (as proved to be the case) he later received a United Kingdom peerage entitling him to a seat in the House of Lords in his own right.

In 1911 he was created Earl Curzon of Kedleston, Viscount Scarsdale, and Baron Ravensdale. All of these titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1916, he also became 5th Baron Scarsdale, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The title had been created in 1761.

In the 1921 Birthday Honours, he was created Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. The title became extinct upon his death in 1925, as he was survived by three daughters and no sons.

== Assessment ==
Few statesmen have experienced such changes in fortune in both their public and their personal lives. 
David Gilmour concludes:

Curzon&#x27;s career was an almost unparalleled blend of triumph and disappointment. Although he was the last and in many ways the greatest of Victorian viceroys, his term of office ended in resignation, empty of recognition and barren of reward... he was unable to assert himself fully as Foreign Secretary until the last weeks of Lloyd George&#x27;s premiership. And finally, after he had restored his reputation at Lausanne, his last ambition was thwarted by George V.

Critics generally agreed that Curzon never reached the heights that his youthful talents had seemed destined to reach. This sense of opportunities missed was summed up by Winston Churchill in his book &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot; (1937):The morning had been golden; the noontide was bronze; and the evening lead. But all were polished until it shone after its fashion.

Churchill also wrote there was certainly something lacking in Curzon:it was certainly not information nor application, nor power of speech nor attractiveness of manner and appearance. Everything was in his equipment. You could unpack his knapsack and take an inventory item by item. Nothing on the list was missing, yet somehow or other the total was incomplete.

His Cabinet colleague David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford provided a withering personal judgment in his diary; &quot;I never knew a man less loved by his colleagues and more hated by his subordinates, never a man so bereft of conscience, of charity or of gratitude. On the other hand the combination of power, of industry, and of ambition with a mean personality is almost without parallel. I never attended a funeral ceremony at which the congregation was so dry-eyed!&quot;

The first leader of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, paid Curzon a tribute, referring to that, as viceroy, Curzon as exhibited real love of Indian culture and ordered a restoration project for several historic monuments, including the Taj Mahal:

After every other Viceroy has been forgotten, Curzon will be remembered because he restored all that was beautiful in India.

==Legacy==
By special remainders, although he had no son, two of Curzon&#x27;s peerages survive to the present day. His barony of Ravensdale went first to his eldest daughter, Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale, and then to his grandson Nicholas Mosley, both of whom sat in the House of Lords, while his Viscount Scarsdale title went to a nephew. His great-great-grandson Daniel Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale, is a current member of the House of Lords, having been elected as a representative hereditary peer.

Curzon Hall, the home of the faculty of science at the University of Dhaka, is named after him. Curzon had inaugurated the building in 1904.

Curzon Gate, a ceremonial gate, was erected by Maharaja Bijay Chand Mahatab in the heart of Burdwan town and was renamed to commemorate Lord Curzon&#x27;s visit to the town in 1904, which was renamed as Bijay Toran after the independence of India in 1947.

Curzon Road, the road connecting India Gate, the memorial dedicated to the Indian fallen during the Great War of 1914–18, and Connaught Place, in New Delhi was named after him. It has since been renamed Kasturba Gandhi Marg. The apartment buildings on the same road are named after him.

The George Nathaniel Curzon Foundation was established in 2025 to commemorate the centenary of Curzon&#x27;s death.

<text>In analysis, numerical integration comprises a broad family of algorithms for calculating the numerical value of a definite integral.
The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more or less a synonym for &quot;numerical integration&quot;, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as cubature; others take &quot;quadrature&quot; to include higher-dimensional integration.

The basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral

:formula_1

to a given degree of accuracy. If is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, and the domain of integration is bounded, there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.

Numerical integration has roots in the geometrical problem of finding a square with the same area as a given plane figure (&quot;quadrature&quot; or &quot;squaring&quot;), as in the quadrature of the circle.
The term is also sometimes used to describe the numerical solution of differential equations.

== Motivation and need ==
There are several reasons for carrying out numerical integration, as opposed to analytical integration by finding the antiderivative:

# The integrand may be known only at certain points, such as obtained by sampling. Some embedded systems and other computer applications may need numerical integration for this reason.
# A formula for the integrand may be known, but it may be difficult or impossible to find an antiderivative that is an elementary function. An example of such an integrand is , the antiderivative of which (the error function, times a constant) cannot be written in elementary form. 
# It may be possible to find an antiderivative symbolically, but it may be easier to compute a numerical approximation than to compute the antiderivative. That may be the case if the antiderivative is given as an infinite series or product, or if its evaluation requires a special function that is not available.

== History ==

The term &quot;numerical integration&quot; first appears in 1915 in the publication &quot;A Course in Interpolation and Numeric Integration for the Mathematical Laboratory&quot; by David Gibb.

&quot;Quadrature&quot; is a historical mathematical term that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served as one of the main sources of mathematical analysis. Mathematicians of Ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood calculation of area as the process of constructing geometrically a square having the same area (&quot;squaring&quot;). That is why the process was named &quot;quadrature&quot;. For example, a quadrature of the circle, Lune of Hippocrates, The Quadrature of the Parabola. This construction must be performed only by means of compass and straightedge.

The ancient Babylonians used the trapezoidal rule to integrate the motion of Jupiter along the ecliptic.
For a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; it is necessary to construct a square with the side formula_2 (the Geometric mean of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;). For this purpose it is possible to use the following fact: if we draw the circle with the sum of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; as the diameter, then the height BH (from a point of their connection to crossing with a circle) equals their geometric mean. The similar geometrical construction solves a problem of a quadrature for a parallelogram and a triangle.
Problems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the Lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and a parabola segment done by Archimedes became the highest achievement of the antique analysis.
* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to quadruple the area of a great circle of this sphere.
* The area of a segment of the parabola cut from it by a straight line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment.
For the proof of the results Archimedes used the Method of exhaustion of Eudoxus.

In medieval Europe the quadrature meant calculation of area by any method. More often the Method of indivisibles was used; it was less rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help Galileo Galilei and Gilles de Roberval found the area of a cycloid arch, Grégoire de Saint-Vincent investigated the area under a hyperbola (&quot;Opus Geometricum&quot;, 1647), and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, de Saint-Vincent&#x27;s pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to logarithms.

John Wallis algebrised this method: he wrote in his &quot;Arithmetica Infinitorum&quot; (1656) series that we now call the definite integral, and he calculated their values. Isaac Barrow and James Gregory made further progress: quadratures for some algebraic curves and spirals. Christiaan Huygens successfully performed a quadrature of some Solids of revolution.

The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new function, the natural logarithm, of critical importance.

With the invention of integral calculus came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term &quot;quadrature&quot; has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase &quot;computation of a univariate definite integral&quot; is more common.

==Methods for one-dimensional integrals==
A quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a function, usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points within the domain of integration.

Numerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral. The integrand is evaluated at a finite set of points called integration points and a weighted sum of these values is used to approximate the integral. The integration points and weights depend on the specific method used and the accuracy required from the approximation.

An important part of the analysis of any numerical integration method is to study the behavior of the approximation error as a function of the number of integrand evaluations. A method that yields a small error for a small number of evaluations is usually considered superior. Reducing the number of evaluations of the integrand reduces the number of arithmetic operations involved, and therefore reduces the total error. Also, each evaluation takes time, and the integrand may be arbitrarily complicated.

===Quadrature rules based on step functions===
A &quot;brute force&quot; kind of numerical integration can be done, if the integrand is reasonably well-behaved (i.e. piecewise continuous and of bounded variation), by evaluating the integrand with very small increments.
This simplest method approximates the function by a step function (a piecewise constant function, or a segmented polynomial of degree zero) that passes through the point formula_3. This is called the &quot;midpoint rule&quot; or &quot;rectangle rule&quot;
formula_4

===Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions===
A large class of quadrature rules can be derived by constructing interpolating functions that are easy to integrate. Typically these interpolating functions are polynomials. In practice, since polynomials of very high degree tend to oscillate wildly, only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic.
The interpolating function may be a straight line (an affine function, i.e. a polynomial of degree 1)
passing through the points formula_5 and formula_6.
This is called the &quot;trapezoidal rule&quot;
formula_7
For either one of these rules, we can make a more accurate approximation by breaking up the interval formula_8 into some number formula_9 of subintervals, computing an approximation for each subinterval, then adding up all the results. This is called a &quot;composite rule&quot;, &quot;extended rule&quot;, or &quot;iterated rule&quot;. For example, the composite trapezoidal rule can be stated as
formula_10

where the subintervals have the form formula_11 with formula_12 and formula_13 Here we used subintervals of the same length formula_14 but one could also use intervals of varying length formula_15.

Interpolation with polynomials evaluated at equally spaced points in formula_8 yields the Newton–Cotes formulas, of which the rectangle rule and the trapezoidal rule are examples. Simpson&#x27;s rule, which is based on a polynomial of order 2, is also a Newton–Cotes formula.

Quadrature rules with equally spaced points have the very convenient property of &quot;nesting&quot;. The corresponding rule with each interval subdivided includes all the current points, so those integrand values can be re-used.

If we allow the intervals between interpolation points to vary, we find another group of quadrature formulas, such as the Gaussian quadrature formulas. A Gaussian quadrature rule is typically more accurate than a Newton–Cotes rule that uses the same number of function evaluations, if the integrand is smooth (i.e., if it is sufficiently differentiable). Other quadrature methods with varying intervals include Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature (also called Fejér quadrature) methods, which do nest.

Gaussian quadrature rules do not nest, but the related Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulas do.

=== Adaptive algorithms ===
=== Extrapolation methods ===
The accuracy of a quadrature rule of the Newton–Cotes type is generally a function of the number of evaluation points. The result is usually more accurate as the number of evaluation points increases, or, equivalently, as the width of the step size between the points decreases. It is natural to ask what the result would be if the step size were allowed to approach zero. This can be answered by extrapolating the result from two or more nonzero step sizes, using series acceleration methods such as Richardson extrapolation. The extrapolation function may be a polynomial or rational function. Extrapolation methods are described in more detail by Stoer and Bulirsch (Section 3.4) and are implemented in many of the routines in the QUADPACK library.

=== Conservative (a priori) error estimation ===
Let formula_17 have a bounded first derivative over formula_18 i.e. formula_19 The mean value theorem for formula_20 where formula_21 gives
formula_22
for some formula_23 depending on formula_24.

If we integrate in formula_24 from formula_26 to formula_27 on both sides and take the absolute values, we obtain
formula_28

We can further approximate the integral on the right-hand side by bringing the absolute value into the integrand, and replacing the term in formula_29 by an upper bound

where the supremum was used to approximate.

Hence, if we approximate the integral formula_30 by the quadrature rule formula_31 our error is no greater than the right hand side of . We can convert this into an error analysis for the Riemann sum, giving an upper bound of
formula_32
for the error term of that particular approximation. (Note that this is precisely the error we calculated for the example formula_33.) Using more derivatives, and by tweaking the quadrature, we can do a similar error analysis using a Taylor series (using a partial sum with remainder term) for &quot;f&quot;. This error analysis gives a strict upper bound on the error, if the derivatives of &quot;f&quot; are available.

This integration method can be combined with interval arithmetic to produce computer proofs and &quot;verified&quot; calculations.

=== Integrals over infinite intervals ===
Several methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals. The standard technique involves specially derived quadrature rules, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature for integrals on the whole real line and Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for integrals on the positive reals. Monte Carlo methods can also be used, or a change of variables to a finite interval; e.g., for the whole line one could use
formula_34
and for semi-infinite intervals one could use
formula_35
as possible transformations.

== Multidimensional integrals ==
The quadrature rules discussed so far are all designed to compute one-dimensional integrals. To compute integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach is to phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying Fubini&#x27;s theorem (the tensor product rule). This approach requires the function evaluations to grow exponentially as the number of dimensions increases. Three methods are known to overcome this so-called &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;.

A great many additional techniques for forming multidimensional cubature integration rules for a variety of weighting functions are given in the monograph by Stroud.
Integration on the sphere has been reviewed by Hesse et al. (2015).

=== Monte Carlo ===
Monte Carlo methods and quasi-Monte Carlo methods are easy to apply to multi-dimensional integrals. They may yield greater accuracy for the same number of function evaluations than repeated integrations using one-dimensional methods.

A large class of useful Monte Carlo methods are the so-called Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, which include the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm and Gibbs sampling.

=== Sparse grids ===
Sparse grids were originally developed by Smolyak for the quadrature of high-dimensional functions. The method is always based on a one-dimensional quadrature rule, but performs a more sophisticated combination of univariate results. However, whereas the tensor product rule guarantees that the weights of all of the cubature points will be positive if the weights of the quadrature points were positive, Smolyak&#x27;s rule does not guarantee that the weights will all be positive.

=== Bayesian quadrature ===
Bayesian quadrature is a statistical approach to the numerical problem of computing integrals and falls under the field of probabilistic numerics. It can provide a full handling of the uncertainty over the solution of the integral expressed as a Gaussian process posterior variance.

== Connection with differential equations ==
The problem of evaluating the definite integral
:formula_36
can be reduced to an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation by applying the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus. By differentiating both sides of the above with respect to the argument &quot;x&quot;, it is seen that the function &quot;F&quot; satisfies
:formula_37

Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations, such as Runge–Kutta methods, can be applied to the restated problem and thus be used to evaluate the integral. For instance, the standard fourth-order Runge–Kutta method applied to the differential equation yields Simpson&#x27;s rule from above.

The differential equation formula_38 has a special form: the right-hand side contains only the independent variable (here formula_39) and not the dependent variable (here formula_40). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably. The problem of evaluating integrals is thus best studied in its own right.

Conversely, the term &quot;quadrature&quot; may also be used for the solution of differential equations: &quot;solving by quadrature&quot; or &quot;reduction to quadrature&quot; means expressing its solution in terms of integrals.

<text>James Bradley (September 1692 – 13 July 1762) was an English astronomer and priest who served as the third Astronomer Royal from 1742. He is best known for two fundamental discoveries in astronomy, the aberration of light (1725–1728), and the nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis (1728–1748).

These two discoveries were called &quot;the most brilliant and useful of the century&quot; by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, historian of astronomy, mathematical astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory. In his &quot;History of astronomy in the 18th century&quot; (1821), Delambre stated:&quot;It is to these two discoveries by Bradley that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy. ... This double service assures to their discoverer the most distinguished place (after Hipparchus and Kepler) above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all countries.&quot;

== Biography ==
Bradley was born at Sherborne, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, to William Bradley and Jane Pound in September 1692. His nephew John was also an astronomer. After attending Westwood&#x27;s Grammar School at Northleach in Gloucestershire, he entered Balliol College, Oxford, on 15 March 1711, and took degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1714 and 1717 respectively. His early observations were made at the rectory of Wanstead in Essex, under the tutelage of James Pound, his uncle and a skilled astronomer. Bradley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 November 1718.

He took orders on becoming vicar of Bridstow in Herefordshire in the following year, and a small sinecure living in Wales was also procured for him by his friend Samuel Molyneux. He resigned his ecclesiastical preferments in 1721, when appointed to the Savilian chair of astronomy at Oxford, while as reader on experimental philosophy from 1729 to 1760, he delivered 79 courses of lectures at the Ashmolean Museum.

In 1742, Bradley was appointed to succeed Edmond Halley as Astronomer Royal; his reputation enabled him to apply successfully for a set of instruments costing £1,000; and with an 8-foot quadrant completed for him in 1750 by John Bird, he accumulated at Greenwich in ten years materials of inestimable value for the reform of astronomy. A crown pension of £250 a year was conferred upon him in 1752.

Bradley retired in broken health, nine years later, to the Cotswold village of Chalford in Gloucestershire. He had medical attention from a local doctor, and Daniel Lysons from Oxford. He died at Skiveralls House on 13 July 1762. He was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity church, Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire. His wife died before him, in 1757. He was survived by one daughter.

==Works==
In 1722, Bradley measured the angular diameter of Venus with a large aerial telescope with an objective focal length of .

Bradley&#x27;s discovery of the aberration of light was made while attempting to detect stellar parallax. Bradley worked with Samuel Molyneux until Molyneux&#x27;s death in 1728, trying to measure the parallax of Gamma Draconis.

This stellar parallax ought to have shown up, if it existed at all, as a small annual cyclical motion of the apparent position of the star. However, while Bradley and Molyneux did not find the expected apparent motion due to parallax, they found instead a different and unexplained annual cyclical motion. Shortly after Molyneux&#x27;s death, Bradley realised that this was caused by what is now known as the aberration of light. The basis on which Bradley distinguished the annual motion actually observed from the expected motion due to parallax, was that its annual timetable was different.

Calculation showed that if there had been any appreciable motion due to parallax, then the star should have reached its most southerly apparent position in December, and its most northerly apparent position in June. What Bradley found instead was an apparent motion that reached its most southerly point in March, and its most northerly point in September; and that could not be accounted for by parallax: the cause of a motion with the pattern actually seen was at first obscure.

A story has often been told, probably apocryphally, that the solution to the problem eventually occurred to Bradley while he was in a sailing boat on the River Thames. He noticed that when the boat turned about, a small flag at the top of the mast (a telltale) changed its direction, even though the wind had not changed; the only thing that had changed was the direction and speed of the boat. Bradley worked out the consequences of supposing that the direction and speed of the earth in its orbit, combined with a consistent speed of light from the star, might cause the apparent changes of stellar position that he observed. He found that this fitted the observations well, and also gave an estimate for the speed of light, and showed that the stellar parallax, if any, with extremes in June and December, was far too small to measure at the precision available to Bradley. (The smallness of any parallax, compared with expectations, also showed that the stars must be many times more distant from the Earth than anybody had previously believed.)

This discovery of what became known as the aberration of light was, for all realistic purposes, conclusive evidence for the movement of the Earth, and hence for the correctness of Aristarchus&#x27;, Copernicus&#x27;, and Kepler&#x27;s theories; it was announced to the Royal Society in January 1729. The theory of the aberration also gave Bradley a means to improve on the accuracy of the previous estimate of the speed of light, which had previously been estimated by the work of Ole Rømer and others. Bradley&#x27;s published value for the speed of light, expressed as a time of 8 minutes 12 seconds for light to travel the distance between the Earth and the Sun, was only about 1.3% too high, and was the first accurate determination of this fundamental physical constant.

The earliest observations upon which the discovery of the aberration was founded were made at Molyneux&#x27;s house on Kew Green, and were continued at the house of Bradley&#x27;s uncle James Pound in Wanstead, Essex. After publication of his work on the aberration, Bradley continued to observe, to develop and check his second major discovery, the nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis, but he did not announce this in print until 14 February 1748, when he had tested its reality by minute observations during an entire revolution (18.6 years) of the moon&#x27;s nodes.

The publication of Bradley&#x27;s observations was delayed by disputes about their ownership; but they were finally issued by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in two folio volumes (1798, 1805). The insight and industry of the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel were, however, needed for the development of their fundamental importance.

<doc id="170097" wikidata="Q756307" url="?curid=170097" title="Mean free path">
<text>In physics, mean free path is the average distance over which a moving particle (such as an atom, a molecule, or a photon) travels before substantially changing its direction or energy (or, in a specific context, other properties), typically as a result of one or more successive collisions with other particles.

==Scattering theory==
Imagine a beam of particles being shot through a target, and consider an infinitesimally thin slab of the target (see the figure). The atoms (or particles) that might stop a beam particle are shown in red. The magnitude of the mean free path depends on the characteristics of the system. Assuming that all the target particles are at rest but only the beam particle is moving, that gives an expression for the mean free path:

:formula_1

where is the mean free path, is the number of target particles per unit volume, and is the effective cross-sectional area for collision.

The area of the slab is , and its volume is . The typical number of stopping atoms in the slab is the concentration times the volume, i.e., . The probability that a beam particle will be stopped in that slab is the net area of the stopping atoms divided by the total area of the slab:

:formula_2

where is the area (or, more formally, the &quot;scattering cross-section&quot;) of one atom.

The drop in beam intensity equals the incoming beam intensity multiplied by the probability of the particle being stopped within the slab:

:formula_3

This is an ordinary differential equation:

:formula_4

whose solution is known as Beer–Lambert law and has the form formula_5, where is the distance traveled by the beam through the target, and is the beam intensity before it entered the target; is called the mean free path because it equals the mean distance traveled by a beam particle before being stopped. To see this, note that the probability that a particle is absorbed between and is given by

:formula_6

Thus the expectation value (or average, or simply mean) of is

:formula_7

The fraction of particles that are not stopped (attenuated) by the slab is called transmission formula_8, where is equal to the thickness of the slab.

==Kinetic theory of gases==
In the kinetic theory of gases, the &quot;mean free path&quot; of a particle, such as a molecule, is the average distance the particle travels between collisions with other moving particles. The derivation above assumed the target particles to be at rest; therefore, in reality, the formula formula_9 holds for a beam particle with a high speed formula_10 relative to the velocities of an ensemble of identical particles with random locations. In that case, the motions of target particles are comparatively negligible, hence the relative velocity formula_11.

If, on the other hand, the beam particle is part of an established equilibrium with identical particles, then the square of relative velocity is:

formula_12

In equilibrium, formula_13 and formula_14 are random and uncorrelated, therefore formula_15, and the relative speed is

formula_16

This means that the number of collisions is formula_17 times the number with stationary targets. Therefore, the following relationship applies:

:formula_18

and using formula_19 (ideal gas law) and formula_20 (effective cross-sectional area for spherical particles with diameter formula_21), it may be shown that the mean free path is

:formula_22

where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, formula_23 is the pressure of the gas and formula_24 is the absolute temperature.

In practice, the diameter of gas molecules is not well defined. In fact, the kinetic diameter of a molecule is defined in terms of the mean free path. Typically, gas molecules do not behave like hard spheres, but rather attract each other at larger distances and repel each other at shorter distances, as can be described with a Lennard-Jones potential. One way to deal with such &quot;soft&quot; molecules is to use the Lennard-Jones σ parameter as the diameter. 

Another way is to assume a hard-sphere gas that has the same viscosity as the actual gas being considered. This leads to a mean free path 

:formula_25

where formula_26 is the molecular mass, formula_27 is the density of ideal gas, and &quot;μ&quot; is the dynamic viscosity. This expression can be put into the following convenient form

:formula_28

with formula_29 being the specific gas constant, equal to 287 J/(kg*K) for air. 

The following table lists some typical values for air at different pressures at room temperature. Note that different definitions of the molecular diameter, as well as different assumptions about the value of atmospheric pressure (100 vs 101.3 kPa) and room temperature (293.17 K vs 296.15 K or even 300 K) can lead to slightly different values of the mean free path.
==In other fields==
===Radiography===
In gamma-ray radiography the &quot;mean free path&quot; of a pencil beam of mono-energetic photons is the average distance a photon travels between collisions with atoms of the target material. It depends on the material and the energy of the photons:

:formula_30

where &quot;μ&quot; is the linear attenuation coefficient, &quot;μ/ρ&quot; is the mass attenuation coefficient and &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the material. The mass attenuation coefficient can be looked up or calculated for any material and energy combination using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) databases.

In X-ray radiography the calculation of the &quot;mean free path&quot; is more complicated, because photons are not mono-energetic, but have some distribution of energies called a spectrum. As photons move through the target material, they are attenuated with probabilities depending on their energy, as a result their distribution changes in process called spectrum hardening. Because of spectrum hardening, the &quot;mean free path&quot; of the X-ray spectrum changes with distance.

Sometimes one measures the thickness of a material in the &quot;number of mean free paths&quot;. Material with the thickness of one &quot;mean free path&quot; will attenuate to 37% (1/&quot;e&quot;) of photons. This concept is closely related to half-value layer (HVL): a material with a thickness of one HVL will attenuate 50% of photons. A standard x-ray image is a transmission image, an image with negative logarithm of its intensities is sometimes called a &quot;number of mean free paths&quot; image.

===Electronics===
In macroscopic charge transport, the mean free path of a charge carrier in a metal formula_31 is proportional to the electrical mobility formula_32, a value directly related to electrical conductivity, that is:
:formula_33

where &quot;q&quot; is the charge, formula_34 is the mean free time, &quot;m*&quot; is the effective mass, and &quot;v&quot;F is the Fermi velocity of the charge carrier. The Fermi velocity can easily be derived from the Fermi energy via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation. In thin films, however, the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path, making surface scattering much more noticeable, effectively increasing the resistivity.

Electron mobility through a medium with dimensions smaller than the mean free path of electrons occurs through ballistic conduction or ballistic transport. In such scenarios electrons alter their motion only in collisions with conductor walls.

===Optics===
If one takes a suspension of non-light-absorbing particles of diameter &quot;d&quot; with a volume fraction &quot;Φ&quot;, the mean free path of the photons is:

:formula_35

where &quot;Q&quot;s is the scattering efficiency factor. &quot;Q&quot;s can be evaluated numerically for spherical particles using Mie theory.

===Acoustics===
In an otherwise empty cavity, the mean free path of a single particle bouncing off the walls is:

:formula_36

where &quot;V&quot; is the volume of the cavity, &quot;S&quot; is the total inside surface area of the cavity, and &quot;F&quot; is a constant related to the shape of the cavity. For most simple cavity shapes, &quot;F&quot; is approximately 4.
This relation is used in the derivation of the Sabine equation in acoustics, using a geometrical approximation of sound propagation.

===Nuclear and particle physics===
In particle physics the concept of the mean free path is not commonly used, being replaced by the similar concept of attenuation length. In particular, for high-energy photons, which mostly interact by electron–positron pair production, the radiation length is used much like the mean free path in radiography.

Independent-particle models in nuclear physics require the undisturbed orbiting of nucleons within the nucleus before they interact with other nucleons.

<doc id="170100" wikidata="Q495888" url="?curid=170100" title="Temporary Autonomous Zone">
<text>T.A.Z.: The Temporary Autonomous Zone is a book by the anarchist writer and poet Hakim Bey (Peter Lamborn Wilson). It was published in 1991 by Autonomedia and in 2011 by Pacific Publishing Studio (). It is composed of three sections, &quot;Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism&quot;, &quot;Communiques of the Association for Ontological Anarchy&quot; and &quot;The Temporary Autonomous Zone&quot;.

==Themes==
The book describes the socio-political tactic of creating temporary spaces that elude formal structures of control.

Bey later expanded the concept beyond the &quot;temporary&quot;, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve had to consider the fact that not all existing autonomous zones are &#x27;temporary.&#x27; Some are ... more-or-less &#x27;permanent.&#x27;&quot; Hence, the concept of the permanent autonomous zone.

The titular section is divided up into the following subsections:
# Pirate Utopias
# Waiting for the Revolution
# The Psychotopology of Everyday Life
# The Net and the Web
# &quot;Gone to Croatan&quot;
# Music as an Organizational Principle
# The Will To Power as Disappearance
# Ratholes in the Babylon of Information

<text>Blues musicians are musical artists who are primarily recognized as writing, performing, and recording blues music. They come from different eras and include styles such as ragtime-vaudeville, Delta and country blues, and urban styles from Chicago and the West Coast. In the last several decades, blues music has developed a less regional character and has been influenced by rhythm and blues, rock, and other popular music.

<doc id="170104" wikidata="Q25662" url="?curid=170104" title="Juniper">
<text>Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( ) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, including the Arctic, parts of Asia, and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on earth.

==Description==
Junipers vary in size and shape from tall trees, tall, to columnar or low-spreading shrubs with long, trailing branches. They are evergreen with needle-like and/or scale-like leaves. They can be either monoecious or dioecious. The female seed cones are very distinctive, with fleshy, fruit-like coalescing scales which fuse together to form a berrylike structure (galbulus), long, with one to 12 unwinged, hard-shelled seeds. In some species, these &quot;berries&quot; are red-brown or orange, but in most, they are blue; they are often aromatic and can be used as a spice. The seed maturation time varies between species from 6 to 18 months after pollination. The male cones are similar to the other Cupressaceae, with 6 to 20 scales.

In hardiness zones 7 through 10, junipers can bloom and release pollen several times each year. Different junipers bloom in autumn, while most pollinate from early winter until late spring.

Many junipers (e.g. &quot;J. chinensis&quot;, &quot;J. virginiana&quot;) have two types of leaves; seedlings and some twigs of older trees have needle-like leaves long, on mature plants the leaves are overlapping like (mostly) tiny scales, measuring . When juvenile foliage occurs on mature plants, it is most often found on shaded shoots, with adult foliage in full sunlight. Leaves on fast-growing &#x27;whip&#x27; shoots are often intermediate between juvenile and adult.

In some species (e.g. &quot;J. communis&quot;, &quot;J. squamata&quot;), all the foliage is of the juvenile needle-like type, with no scale leaves. In some of these (e.g. &quot;J. communis&quot;), the needles are jointed at the base, while in others (e.g. &quot;J. squamata&quot;), the needles merge smoothly with the stem.
The needle leaves of junipers are hard and sharp, making the juvenile foliage very prickly to handle. This can be a valuable identification feature in seedlings, as the otherwise very similar juvenile foliage of cypresses (&quot;Cupressus, Chamaecyparis&quot;) and other related genera are soft and not prickly.

Junipers are gymnosperms, which means they have seeds, but no flowers or fruits. Depending on the species, the seeds they produce take 1–3 years to develop. The impermeable coat of the seed keeps water from getting in and protects the embryo when dispersed. It can also result in a long dormancy that is usually broken by physically damaging the seed coat. Dispersal can occur from being swallowed whole by frugivores and mammals. The resistance of the seed coat allows it to be passed down through the digestive system without being destroyed along the way. These seeds last a long time, as they can be dispersed long distances over the course of a few years.

==Classification==

===Sections===
The genus has been divided into sections in somewhat different ways. A system based on molecular phylogenetic data from 2013 and earlier used three sections:
* Section &quot;Caryocedrus&quot; – 1 species with large, blue, woody, 3-seeded cones; native to the Mediterranean
* Section &quot;Juniperus&quot; – 14 species with blue or red seed cones, often with 3 seeds; 12 species native to the eastern hemisphere, one endemic to North America, and one species, &quot;J. communis&quot;, circumboreal
* Section &quot;Sabina&quot; – about 60 species with variously coloured seed cones with 1 to 13 seeds; species about equally divided between the eastern and western hemispheres &quot;Juniperus&quot; sect. &quot;Sabina&quot; was further divided into clades.

A new classification of gymnosperms published in 2022 recognised the sections as three separate genera: &quot;Arceuthos&quot; for section &quot;Caryocedrus&quot;, &quot;Sabina&quot; for section &quot;Sabina&quot;, and &quot;Juniperus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; for section &quot;Juniperus&quot;.

===Species===
==== &quot;Juniperus&quot; sect. &quot;Caryocedrus&quot; ====
Cones with three seeds fused together; needles with two stomatal bands.
One species:
*&quot;Juniperus drupacea&quot; – Syrian juniper

==== &quot;Juniperus&quot; sect. &quot;Juniperus&quot; ====

==Ecology==
Juniper plants thrive in a variety of environments. The junipers from Lahaul valley can be found in dry, rocky locations planted in stony soils. Grazing animals and the villagers are rapidly using up these plants. There are several important features of the leaves and wood of this plant that cause villagers to cut down these trees and make use of them. Additionally, the western juniper plants, a particular species in the juniper genus, are found in woodlands where there are large, open spaces. Junipers are known to encompass open areas so that they have more exposure to rainfall. Decreases in fires and a lack of livestock grazing are the two major causes of western juniper takeover. This invasion of junipers is driving changes in the environment. For instance, the ecosystem for other species previously living in the environment and farm animals has been compromised. When junipers increase in population, there is a decrease in woody species like mountain big sagebrush and aspen. Among the juniper trees themselves, there is increased competition, which results in a decrease in berry production. Herbaceous cover decreases, and junipers are often mistaken for weeds. As a result, several farmers have thinned the juniper trees or removed them completely. However, this reduction did not result in any significant difference on wildlife survival. Some small mammals found it advantageous to have thinner juniper trees, while cutting down the entire tree was not favorable.

Some junipers are susceptible to &quot;Gymnosporangium&quot; rust disease and can be a serious problem for those people growing apple trees, an alternate host of the disease.

Juniper is the exclusive food plant of the larvae of some moths and butterflies, including &quot;Bucculatrix inusitata&quot;, juniper carpet, &quot;Chionodes electella&quot;, &quot;Chionodes viduella&quot;, juniper pug, and pine beauty. Those of the tortrix moth &quot;Cydia duplicana&quot; feed on the bark around injuries or canker.

==Cultivation==

Junipers are among the most popular conifers to be cultivated as ornamental subjects for parks and gardens. They have been bred over many years to produce a wide range of forms, in terms of colour, shape and size. They include some of the dwarfest (miniature) cultivars. They are also used for bonsai. Some species found in cultivation include:
*&quot;Juniperus chinensis&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus horizontalis&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus&quot; × &quot;pfitzeriana&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus procumbens&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus rigida&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus scopulorum&quot;
*&quot;Juniperus squamata&quot;
== Toxicity ==
In drier areas, juniper pollen easily becomes airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs. This pollen can also irritate the skin and cause contact dermatitis. Cross-allergenic reactions are common between juniper pollen and the pollen of all species of cypress.

Monoecious juniper plants are highly allergenic, with an Ogren Plant Allergy Scale (OPALS) rating of 9 out of 10. Completely male juniper plants have an OPALS rating of 10, and release abundant amounts of pollen. Conversely, all-female juniper plants have an OPALS rating of 1, and are considered &quot;allergy-fighting&quot;.

== Uses ==

===Ethnic and herbal use===
Most species of juniper are flexible and have a high compression strength-to-weight ratio. This has made the wood a traditional choice for the construction of hunting bows among some of the Native American cultures in the Great Basin region. These bow staves are typically backed with sinew to provide tension strength that the wood may lack.

Ancient Mesopotamians believed that juniper oil could be used to ward off the evil eye.

Embalming vessels in the burial chambers from a 26th Dynasty embalming workshop at Saqqara have shown the usage of Juniper oil/tar.

Some Indigenous peoples of the Americas use juniper in traditional medicine; for instance the Dineh (Navajo), who use it for diabetes. Juniper ash has also been historically consumed as a source of calcium by the Navajo people.

Juniper is traditionally used in Scottish folkloric and Gaelic Polytheist saining rites, such as those performed at Hogmanay (New Year), where the smoke of burning juniper, accompanied by traditional prayers and other customary rites, is used to cleanse, bless, and protect the household and its inhabitants.

Local people in Lahaul Valley present juniper leaves to their deities as a folk tradition. It is also useful as a folk remedy for pains and aches, as well as epilepsy and asthma. They are reported to collect large amounts of juniper leaves and wood for building and religious purposes.

===General use===

Juniper berries are a spice used in a wide variety of culinary dishes and are best known for the primary flavoring in gin (and responsible for gin&#x27;s name, which is a shortening of the Dutch word for juniper, &quot;jenever&quot;). A juniper-based spirit is made by fermenting juniper berries and water to create a &quot;wine&quot; that is then distilled. This is often sold as a juniper brandy in eastern Europe. Juniper berries are also used as the primary flavor in the liquor jenever. Juniper berry sauce is often a popular flavoring choice for quail, pheasant, veal, rabbit, venison, and other game dishes.

A tea can be made from the young twigs. Twigs or needles are used to flavour the traditional Finnish junperbeer, sahti as well.

Dense and rot resistant, the irregular trunks of junipers have been used as fence posts and firewood. Stands that produce enough wood for specialty uses generally go under the common name &quot;cedar&quot;, including &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;, the &quot;red cedar&quot; that is used widely in cedar drawers and closets. The lack of space or a hyphen between the words &quot;red&quot; and &quot;cedar&quot; is sometimes used to indicate that this species is not a true cedar (&quot;Cedrus&quot;).

Juniper in weave is a traditional cladding technique used in Northern Europe, e.g. at Havrå, Norway.

Juniper berries are steam distilled to produce an essential oil that may vary from colorless to yellow or pale green. Some of its chemical components are terpenoids and aromatic compounds, such as cadinene, a sesquiterpene.

<text>Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, (29 September 1725 – 22 November 1774), also known as Clive of India, was the first British Governor of the Bengal Presidency. Clive has been widely credited for laying the foundation of the British East India Company (EIC) rule in Bengal. He began as a &quot;writer&quot; (the term used then in India for an office clerk) for the EIC in 1744 and established Company rule in Bengal by winning the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In return for supporting the Nawab Mir Jafar as ruler of Bengal, Clive was guaranteed a jagir of £30,000 () per year, which was the rent the EIC would otherwise pay to the Nawab for their tax-farming concession. When Clive left India in January 1767 he had a fortune of £180,000 () which he remitted through the Dutch East India Company.

Blocking impending French mastery of India, Clive improvised a 1751 military expedition that ultimately enabled the EIC to adopt the French strategy of indirect rule via puppet government. In 1755 he was hired by the EIC to return to India, where he secured the company&#x27;s trade interests by overthrowing the ruler of Bengal, the richest state in India. Back in England from 1760 to 1765, he used the wealth accumulated from India to obtain an Irish barony from the Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, and a seat in Parliament via Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, representing the Whig party in Shrewsbury, Shropshire (1761–1774), as he had previously done in Mitchell, Cornwall (1754–1755).

Clive&#x27;s actions on behalf of the EIC have made him one of Britain&#x27;s most controversial colonial figures. His achievements included checking French imperialist ambitions on the Coromandel Coast and establishing EIC control over Bengal, thereby furthering the establishment of the British Raj, though he worked only as an agent of the East India Company, not of the British government. Vilified by his political rivals in Britain, he went on trial (1772 and 1773) before Parliament, where he was absolved from every charge. Historians have criticised Clive&#x27;s management of Bengal during his tenure with the EIC, in particular regarding the great famine of 1770, which killed between one and ten million people.

==Early life==
Robert Clive was born at Styche, the Clive family estate, near Market Drayton in Shropshire, on 29 September 1725 to Richard Clive and Rebecca (née Gaskell) Clive. The family had held the small estate since the time of Henry VII and had a lengthy history of public service: members of the family included a Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland under Henry VIII, and a member of the Long Parliament. Robert&#x27;s father, who supplemented the estate&#x27;s modest income by practising as a lawyer, also served in Parliament for many years, representing Montgomeryshire. Robert was their eldest son of thirteen children; he had seven sisters and five brothers, six of whom died in infancy.

Clive&#x27;s father was known to have a temper, which the boy apparently inherited. For reasons that are unknown, Clive was sent to live with his mother&#x27;s sister in Manchester while still a toddler. The site is now Hope Hospital. Biographer Robert Harvey suggests that this move was made because Clive&#x27;s father was busy in London trying to provide for the family. Daniel Bayley, the sister&#x27;s husband, reported that the boy was &quot;out of measure addicted to fighting&quot;. He was a regular troublemaker in the schools to which he was sent. When he was older he and a gang of teenagers established a protection racket that vandalised the shops of uncooperative merchants in Market Drayton. [Note : the original of these stories first occurs in John Malcolm&#x27;s 1836 biography which say these were verbal anecdotes given to him, third hand, in 1827, 53 years after Robert Clive&#x27;s death] There Clive also exhibited fearlessness at an early age. He is reputed to have climbed the tower of St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church in Market Drayton and perched on a gargoyle, frightening those down below. 

When Clive was nine his aunt died, and, after a brief stint in his father&#x27;s cramped London quarters, he returned to Shropshire. There he attended the Market Drayton Grammar School, where his unruly behaviour (and an improvement in the family&#x27;s fortunes) prompted his father to send him to Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in London. His bad behaviour continued, and he was then sent to a trade school in Hertfordshire to complete a basic education. Despite his early lack of scholarship, in his later years he devoted himself to improving his education. He eventually developed a distinctive writing style, and a speech in the House of Commons was described by William Pitt as the most eloquent he had ever heard.

==First journey to India (1744–1753)==


In 1744 Clive&#x27;s father acquired for him a position as a &quot;factor&quot; or company agent in the service of the East India Company, and Clive set sail for India. After running aground on the coast of Brazil, his ship was detained for nine months while repairs were completed. This enabled him to learn some Portuguese, one of the several languages then in use in south India because of the Portuguese centre at Goa. At this time the East India Company had a small settlement at Fort St. George near the village of Madraspatnam, later Madras, now the major Indian metropolis of Chennai, in addition to others at Calcutta, Bombay, and Cuddalore. Clive arrived at Fort St. George in June 1744, and spent the next two years working as little more than a glorified assistant shopkeeper, tallying books and arguing with suppliers of the East India Company over the quality and quantity of their wares. He was given access to the governor&#x27;s library, where he became a prolific reader.

===Political situation in south India===
The India Clive arrived in was divided into a number of successor states to the Mughal Empire. Over the forty years since the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, the power of the emperor had gradually fallen into the hands of his provincial viceroys or &quot;Subahdars&quot;. The dominant rulers on the Coromandel Coast were the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah I, and the Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan. The Nawab nominally owed fealty to the nizam, but in many respects acted independently. Fort St. George and the French trading post at Pondicherry were both located in the Nawab&#x27;s territory.

The relationship between the Europeans in India was influenced by a series of wars and treaties in Europe, and by competing commercial rivalry for trade on the subcontinent. Through the 17th and early 18th centuries, the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British had vied for control of various trading posts, and for trading rights and favour with local Indian rulers. The European merchant companies raised bodies of troops to protect their commercial interests and latterly to influence local politics to their advantage. Military power was rapidly becoming as important as commercial acumen in securing India&#x27;s valuable trade, and increasingly it was used to appropriate territory and to collect land revenue.

===First Carnatic War===

In 1720 France effectively nationalised the French East India Company, and began using it to expand its imperial interests. This became a source of conflict with the British in India with the entry of Britain into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1744. The Indian theatre of the conflict is also known as the First Carnatic War, referring to the Carnatic region on the southeast coast of India. Hostilities in India began with a British naval attack on a French fleet in 1745, which led the French Governor-General Dupleix to request additional forces. On 4 September 1746, Madras was attacked by French forces led by La Bourdonnais. After several days of bombardment the British surrendered and the French entered the city. The British leadership was taken prisoner and sent to Pondicherry. It was originally agreed that the town would be restored to the British after negotiation but this was opposed by Dupleix, who sought to annex Madras to French holdings. 

The remaining British residents were asked to take an oath promising not to take up arms against the French; Clive and a handful of others refused, and were kept under weak guard as the French prepared to destroy the fort. Disguising themselves as natives, Clive and three others eluded their inattentive sentry, slipped out of the fort, and made their way to Fort St. David (the British post at Cuddalore), some to the south. Upon his arrival, Clive decided to enlist in the Company army rather than remain idle; in the hierarchy of the company, this was seen as a step down. Clive was, however, recognised for his contribution in the defence of Fort St. David, where the French assault on 11 March 1747 was repulsed with the assistance of the Nawab of the Carnatic, and was given a commission as ensign.

In the conflict, Clive&#x27;s bravery came to the attention of Major Stringer Lawrence, who arrived in 1748 to take command of the British troops at Fort St. David. During the 1748 Siege of Pondicherry Clive distinguished himself in successfully defending a trench against a French sortie: one witness of the action wrote Clive&#x27;s &quot;platoon, animated by his exhortation, fired again with new courage and great vivacity upon the enemy.&quot; The siege was lifted in October 1748 with the arrival of the monsoons, but the war came to a conclusion with the arrival in December of news of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. Madras was returned to the British as part of the peace agreement in early 1749.

===Tanjore expedition===
The end of the war between France and Britain did not, however, end hostilities in India. Even before news of the peace arrived in India, the British had sent an expedition to Tanjore on behalf of a claimant to its throne. This expedition, on which Clive, now promoted to lieutenant, served as a volunteer, was a disastrous failure. Monsoons ravaged the land forces, and the local support claimed by their client was not in evidence. The ignominious retreat of the British force (which lost its baggage train to the pursuing Tanjorean army while crossing a swollen river) was a blow to the British reputation. Major Lawrence, seeking to recover British prestige, led the entire Madras garrison to Tanjore in response. At the fort of Devikottai on the Coleroon River the British force was confronted by the much larger Tanjorean army. Lawrence gave Clive command of 30 British soldiers and 700 sepoys, with orders to lead the assault on the fort. Clive led this force rapidly across the river and toward the fort, where the small British unit became separated from the sepoys and were enveloped by the Tanjorean cavalry. Clive was nearly cut down and the beachhead almost lost before reinforcements sent by Lawrence arrived to save the day. The daring move by Clive had an important consequence: the Tanjoreans abandoned the fort, which the British triumphantly occupied. The success prompted the Tanjorean rajah to open peace talks, which resulted in the British being awarded Devikottai and the costs of their expedition, and the British client was awarded a pension in exchange for renouncing his claim. Lawrence wrote of Clive&#x27;s action that &quot;he behaved in courage and in judgment much beyond what could be expected from his years.&quot;

On the expedition&#x27;s return the process of restoring Madras was completed. Company officials, concerned about the cost of the military, slashed its size, denying Clive a promotion to captain in the process. Lawrence procured for Clive a position as the commissary at Fort St. George, a potentially lucrative posting (its pay included commissions on all supply contracts).

==Second Carnatic War==

The death of Asaf Jah I, the Nizam of Hyderabad, in 1748 sparked a struggle to succeed him that is known as the Second Carnatic War, which was also furthered by the expansionist interests of French Governor-General Dupleix. Dupleix had grasped from the first war that small numbers of disciplined European forces (and well-trained sepoys) could be used to tip balances of power between competing interests, and used this idea to greatly expand French influence in southern India. For many years he had been working to negotiate the release of Chanda Sahib, a longtime French ally who had at one time occupied the throne of Tanjore, and sought for himself the throne of the Carnatic. Chanda Sahib had been imprisoned by the Marathas in 1740; by 1748 he had been released from custody and was building an army at Satara.

Upon the death of Asaf Jah I, his son, Nasir Jung, seized the throne of Hyderabad, although Asaf Jah had designated as his successor his grandson, Muzaffar Jung. The grandson, who was ruler of Bijapur, fled west to join Chanda Sahib, whose army was also reinforced by French troops sent by Dupleix. These forces met those of Anwaruddin Mohammed Khan in the Battle of Ambur in August 1749; Anwaruddin was slain, and Chanda Sahib victorious entered the Carnatic capital, Arcot. Anwaruddin&#x27;s son, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, fled to Trichinopoly where he sought the protection and assistance of the British. In thanks for French assistance, the victors awarded them a number of villages, including territory nominally under British sway near Cuddalore and Madras. The British began sending additional arms to Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and sought to bring Nasir Jung into the fray to oppose Chanda Sahib. Nasir Jung came south to Gingee in 1750, where he requested and received a detachment of British troops. Chanda Sahib&#x27;s forces advanced to meet them, but retreated after a brief long-range cannonade. Nasir Jung pursued, and was able to capture Arcot and his nephew, Muzaffar Jung. Following a series of fruitless negotiations and intrigues, Nasir Jung was assassinated by a rebellious soldier. This made Muzaffar Jung nizam and confirmed Chanda Sahib as Nawab of the Carnatic, both with French support. Dupleix was rewarded for French assistance with titled nobility and rule of the nizam&#x27;s territories south of the Kistna River. His territories were &quot;said to yield an annual revenue of over 350,000 rupees&quot;.

Robert Clive was not in southern India for many of these events. In 1750 Clive was afflicted with some sort of nervous disorder, and was sent north to Bengal to recuperate. It was there that he met and befriended Robert Orme, who became his principal chronicler and biographer. Clive returned to Madras in 1751.

===Siege of Arcot===
In the summer of 1751, Chanda Sahib left Arcot to besiege Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah at Trichinopoly. This placed the British at Madras in a precarious position, since the latter was the last of their major allies in the area. The British company&#x27;s military was also in some disarray, as Stringer Lawrence had returned to England in 1750 over a pay dispute, and much of the company was apathetic about the dangers the expanding French influence and declining British influence posed. The weakness of the British military command was exposed when a force was sent from Madras to support Muhammad Ali at Trichinopoly, but its commander, a Swiss mercenary, refused to attack an outpost at Valikondapuram. Clive, who accompanied the force as commissary, was outraged at the decision to abandon the siege. He rode to Cuddalore, and offered his services to lead an attack on Arcot if he was given a captain&#x27;s commission, arguing this would force Chanda Sahib to either abandon the siege of Trichinopoly or significantly reduce the force there.

Madras and Fort St. David could supply him with only 200 Europeans, 300 sepoys, and three small cannons; furthermore, of the eight officers who led them, four were civilians like Clive, and six had never been in action. Clive, hoping to surprise the small garrison at Arcot, made a series of forced marches, including some under extremely rainy conditions. Although he did fail to achieve surprise, the garrison, hearing of the march being made under such arduous conditions, opted to abandon the fort and town; Clive occupied Arcot without firing a shot.

The fort was a rambling structure with a dilapidated wall a mile long (too long for his small force to effectively man), and it was surrounded by the densely packed housing of the town. Its moat was shallow or dry, and some of its towers were insufficiently strong to use as artillery mounts. Clive did the best he could to prepare for the onslaught he expected. He made a foray against the fort&#x27;s former garrison, encamped a few miles away, which had no significant effect. When the former garrison was reinforced by 2,000 men Chanda Sahib sent from Trichinopoly it reoccupied the town on 15 September. That night Clive led most of his force out of the fort and launched a surprise attack on the besiegers. Because of the darkness, the besiegers had no idea how large Clive&#x27;s force was, and they fled in panic.

The next day Clive learned that heavy guns he had requested from Madras were approaching, so he sent most of his garrison out to escort them into the fort. That night the besiegers, who had spotted the movement, launched an attack on the fort. With only 70 men in the fort, Clive once again was able to disguise his small numbers, and sowed sufficient confusion against his enemies that multiple assaults against the fort were successfully repulsed. That morning the guns arrived, and Chanda Sahib&#x27;s men again retreated.

Over the next week Clive and his men worked feverishly to improve the defences, aware that another 4,000 men, led by Chanda Sahib&#x27;s son Raza Sahib and accompanied by a small contingent of French troops, was on its way. (Most of these troops came from Pondicherry, not Trichinopoly, and thus did not have the effect Clive desired of raising that siege.) Clive was forced to reduce his garrison to about 300 men, sending the rest of his force to Madras in case the enemy army decided to go there instead. Raza Sahib arrived at Arcot, and on 23 September occupied the town. That night Clive launched a daring attack against the French artillery, seeking to capture their guns. The attack very nearly succeeded in its object, but was reversed when enemy sniper fire tore into the small British force. Clive himself was targeted on more than one occasion; one man pulled him down and was shot dead. The affair was a serious blow: 15 of Clive&#x27;s men were killed, and another 15 wounded.

Over the next month the besiegers slowly tightened their grips on the fort. Clive&#x27;s men were subjected to frequent sniper attacks and disease, lowering the garrison size to 200. He was heartened to learn that some 6,000 Maratha forces had been convinced to come to his relief, but that they were awaiting payment before proceeding. The approach of this force prompted Raza Sahib to demand Clive&#x27;s surrender; Clive&#x27;s response was an immediate rejection, and he further insulted Raza Sahib by suggesting that he should reconsider sending his rabble of troops against a British-held position. The siege finally reached critical when Raza Sahib launched an all-out assault against the fort on 14 November. Clive&#x27;s small force maintained its composure, and established killing fields outside the walls of the fort where the attackers sought to gain entry. Several hundred attackers were killed and many more wounded, while Clive&#x27;s small force suffered only four British and two sepoy casualties.

The historian Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote a century later of the siege:
... the commander who had to conduct the defence ... was a young man of five and twenty, who had been bred as a book-keeper ... Clive ... had made his arrangements, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. He was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post ... After three desperate onsets, the besiegers retired behind the ditch. The struggle lasted about an hour ... the garrison lost only five or six men.

His conduct during the siege made Clive famous in Europe. The Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder described Clive, who had received no formal military training whatsoever, as the &quot;heaven-born general&quot;, endorsing the generous appreciation of his early commander, Major Lawrence. The Court of Directors of the East India Company voted him a sword worth £700, which he refused to receive unless Lawrence was similarly honoured.

Clive and Major Lawrence were able to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion. In 1754, the first of the provisional Carnatic treaties was signed between Thomas Saunders, the Company president at Madras, and Charles Godeheu, the French commander who displaced Dupleix. Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah was recognised as Nawab, and both nations agreed to equalise their possessions. When war again broke out in 1756, during Clive&#x27;s absence in Bengal, the French obtained successes in the northern districts, and it was Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah&#x27;s efforts which drove them from their settlements. The Treaty of Paris (1763) formally confirmed Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah as Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 a &quot;firman&quot; (decree) came from the Emperor of Delhi, recognising the British possessions in southern India.

==Marriage and return to England==

On 18 February 1753 in Madras, Clive married Margaret Maskelyne (1735–1817), sister of the Rev. Dr Nevil Maskelyne, fifth Astronomer Royal. They had nine children:
* Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis (1754–1839), succeeded his father
* Richard Clive (4 March 1755 – bur. 19 October 1755), died young
* Jane Clive (15 June 1756 – September 1759), died young
* Robert Clive (13 October 1759 – June 1760), died young
* Hon. Rebecca Clive (15 September 1760 – December 1795), married in 1780 to Lt.-Gen. John Robinson, MP
* Hon. Charlotte Clive (19 January 1762 – 20 October 1795), died unmarried
* Hon. Margaretta Clive (15 August 1763 – August 1814), married 11 April 1780 Lt.-Col. Lambert Theodore Walpole (killed in 1798 Wexford Rebellion), great-nephew of Robert Walpole
* Hon. Elizabeth Clive (30 October 1764 – bur. 18 December 1764), died young
* Lt-Col. Hon. Robert Henry Clive (14 August 1769 – 28 July 1833), died unmarried

Margaret Maskelyne set out to find Clive, who reportedly had fallen in love with her portrait. When she arrived, Clive was a national hero. They were married at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in (then) Madras on 18 February 1753. They then returned to England.

Clive was then offered command of British forces in North America, but he declined. 

From 1754 to 1755, Clive briefly sat as Member of Parliament for the “rotten borough” of St Michael&#x27;s in Cornwall, which then returned two Members. He and his colleague John Stephenson were later unseated by petition of their defeated opponents, Richard Hussey and Simon Luttrell.

==Second journey to India (1755–1760)==

In July 1755, Clive returned to India to act as deputy governor of Fort St. David at Cuddalore. He arrived after having lost a considerable fortune en route, as the &quot;Doddington&quot;, the lead ship of his convoy, was wrecked near Port Elizabeth, losing a chest of gold coins belonging to Clive worth £33,000 (). Nearly 250 years later in 1998, illegally salvaged coins from Clive&#x27;s treasure chest were offered for sale, and in 2002 a portion of the coins were given to the South African government after protracted legal wrangling.

Clive, now promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the British Army, took part in the capture of the fortress of Gheriah, a stronghold of the Maratha Admiral Tuloji Angre. The action was led by Admiral James Watson and the British had several ships available, some Royal troops and some Maratha allies. The overwhelming strength of the joint British and Maratha forces ensured that the battle was won with few losses. A fleet surgeon, Edward Ives, noted that Clive refused to take any part of the treasure divided among the victorious forces as was custom at the time.

===Fall and recapture of Calcutta (1756–57)===
Following this action Clive headed to his post at Fort St. David and it was there he received news of twin disasters for the British. Early in 1756, Siraj ud-Daulah had succeeded his grandfather Alivardi Khan as Nawab of Bengal. In June, Clive received news that the new Nawab had attacked the British at Kasimbazar and shortly afterwards on 20 June he had taken the fort at Calcutta. The losses to the Company because of the fall of Calcutta were estimated by investors at £2,000,000 (). Those British who were captured were placed in a punishment cell which became infamous as the Black Hole of Calcutta. In stifling summer heat, it was reported that 43 of the 64 prisoners died as a result of suffocation or heat stroke. While the Black Hole became infamous in Britain, it is debatable whether the Nawab was aware of the incident.

By Christmas 1756, as no response had been received to diplomatic letters to the Nawab, Admiral Charles Watson and Clive were dispatched to attack the Nawab&#x27;s army and remove him from Calcutta by force. Their first target was the fortress of Baj-Baj which Clive approached by land while Admiral Watson bombarded it from the sea. The fortress was quickly taken with minimal British casualties. Shortly afterwards, on 2 January 1757, Calcutta itself was taken with similar ease.

Approximately a month later, on 3 February 1757, Clive encountered the army of the Nawab itself. For two days, the army marched past Clive&#x27;s camp to take up a position east of Calcutta. Sir Eyre Coote, serving in the British forces, estimated the enemy&#x27;s strength as 40,000 cavalry, 60,000 infantry and thirty cannon. Even allowing for overestimation this was considerably more than Clive&#x27;s force of approximately 540 British infantry, 600 Royal Navy sailors, 800 local sepoys, fourteen field guns and no cavalry. The British forces attacked the Nawab&#x27;s camp during the early morning hours of 5 February 1757. In this battle, unofficially called the &#x27;Calcutta Gauntlet&#x27;, Clive marched his small force through the entire Nawab&#x27;s camp, despite being under heavy fire from all sides. By noon, Clive&#x27;s force broke through the besieging camp and arrived safely at Fort William. During the assault, around one tenth of the British attackers became casualties. (Clive reported his losses at 57 killed and 137 wounded.) While technically not a victory in military terms, the sudden British assault intimidated the Nawab. He sought to make terms with Clive, and surrendered control of Calcutta on 9 February, promising to compensate the East India Company for damages suffered and to restore its privileges.

===War with Siraj Ud Daulah===
As Britain and France were once more at war, Clive sent the fleet up the river against the French colony of Chandannagar, while he besieged it by land. There was a strong incentive to capture the colony, as capture of a previous French settlement near Pondicherry had yielded the combined forces prizes valued at £130,000 (). After consenting to the siege, the Nawab unsuccessfully sought to assist the French. Some officials of the Nawab&#x27;s court formed a confederacy to depose him. Mir Jafar, the Nawab&#x27;s commander-in-chief, led the conspirators. With Admiral Watson, Governor Drake and Mr. Watts, Clive made a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement in which it was agreed to give the office of viceroy of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha to Mir Jafar, who was to pay £1,000,000 () to the company for its losses in Calcutta and the cost of its troops, £500,000 () to the British inhabitants of Calcutta, £200,000 () to the native inhabitants, and £70,000 () to its Armenian merchants.

Clive employed Umichand, a rich Bengali trader, as an agent between Mir Jafar and the British officials. Umichand threatened to betray Clive unless he was guaranteed, in the agreement itself, £300,000 (). To dupe him a fictitious agreement was shown to him with a clause to this effect. Admiral Watson refused to sign it. Clive deposed later to the House of Commons that, &quot;to the best of his remembrance, he gave the gentleman who carried it leave to sign his name upon it; his lordship never made any secret of it; he thinks it warrantable in such a case, and would do it again a hundred times; he had no interested motive in doing it, and did it with a design of disappointing the expectations of a rapacious man.&quot;

===Plassey===

The whole hot season of 1757 was spent in negotiations with the Nawab of Bengal. In the middle of June Clive began his march from Chandannagar, with the British in boats and the sepoys along the right bank of the Hooghly River. During the rainy season, the Hooghly is fed by the overflow of the Ganges to the north through three streams, which in the hot months are nearly dry. On the left bank of the Bhagirathi, the most westerly of these, above Chandernagore, stands Murshidabad, the capital of the Mughal viceroys of Bengal. Some miles farther down is the field of Plassey, then an extensive grove of mango trees.

On 21 June 1757, Clive arrived on the bank opposite Plassey, in the midst of the first outburst of monsoon rain. His whole army amounted to 1,100 Europeans and 2,100 sepoy troops, with nine field-pieces. The Nawab had drawn up 18,000 horse, 50,000-foot and 53 pieces of heavy ordnance, served by French artillerymen. For once in his career Clive hesitated, and called a council of sixteen officers to decide, as he put it, &quot;whether in our present situation, without assistance, and on our own bottom, it would be prudent to attack the Nawab, or whether we should wait till joined by some country (Indian) power.&quot; Clive himself headed the nine who voted for delay; Major Eyre Coote led the seven who counselled immediate attack. But, either because his daring asserted itself, or because of a letter received from Mir Jafar, Clive was the first to change his mind and to communicate with Major Eyre Coote. One tradition, followed by Macaulay, represents him as spending an hour in thought under the shade of some trees, while he resolved the issues of what was to prove one of the decisive battles of the world. Another, turned into verse by Sir Alfred Lyall, pictures his resolution as the result of a dream. However that may be, he did well as a soldier to trust to the dash and even rashness that had gained Arcot and triumphed at Calcutta since retreat, or even delay, might have resulted in defeat.

After heavy rain, Clive&#x27;s 3,200 men and the nine guns crossed the river and took possession of the grove and its tanks of water, while Clive established his headquarters in a hunting lodge. On 23 June, the engagement took place and lasted the whole day, during which remarkably little actual fighting took place. Gunpowder for the cannons of the Nawab was not well protected from rain. That impaired those cannons. Except for the 40 Frenchmen and the guns they worked, the Indian side could do little to reply to the British cannonade (after a spell of rain), which, with the 39th Regiment, scattered the host, inflicting on it a loss of 500 men. Clive had already made a secret agreement with aristocrats in Bengal, including Jagat Seth and Mir Jafar. Clive restrained Major Kilpatrick, for he trusted to Mir Jafar&#x27;s abstinence, if not desertion to his ranks, and knew the importance of sparing his own small force. He was fully justified in his confidence in Mir Jafar&#x27;s treachery to his master, for he led a large portion of the Nawab&#x27;s army away from the battlefield, ensuring his defeat.

Clive lost hardly any European troops; in all 22 sepoys were killed and 50 wounded. It is curious in many ways that Clive is now best-remembered for this battle, which was essentially won by suborning the opposition rather than through fighting or brilliant military tactics. Whilst it established British military supremacy in Bengal, it did not secure the East India Company&#x27;s control over Upper India, as is sometimes claimed. That would come only seven years later in 1764 at the Battle of Buxar, where Sir Hector Munro defeated the combined forces of the Mughal Emperor and the Nawab of Awadh in a much more closely fought encounter.

Siraj Ud Daulah fled from the field on a camel, securing what wealth he could. He was soon captured by Mir Jafar&#x27;s forces and later executed by the assassin Mohammadi Beg. Clive entered Murshidabad and established Mir Jafar as Nawab, the price which had been agreed beforehand for his treachery. Clive was taken through the treasury, amid £1,500,000 () sterling&#x27;s worth of rupees, gold and silver plate, jewels and rich goods, and besought to ask what he would. Clive took £160,000 (), a vast fortune for the day, while £500,000 () was distributed among the army and navy of the East India Company, and provided gifts of £24,000 () to each member of the company&#x27;s committee, as well as the public compensation stipulated for in the treaty.

In this extraction of wealth Clive followed a usage fully recognised by the company, although this was the source of future corruption which Clive was later sent to India again to correct. The company itself acquired revenue of £100,000 () a year, and a contribution towards its losses and military expenditure of £1,500,000 sterling (). Mir Jafar further discharged his debt to Clive by afterwards presenting him with the quit-rent of the company&#x27;s lands in and around Calcutta, amounting to an annuity of £27,000 () for life, and leaving him by will the sum of £70,000 (), which Clive devoted to the army.

====Further campaigns====

=====Battle of Condore=====
While busy with the civil administration, Clive continued to follow up his military success. He sent Major Coote in pursuit of the French almost as far as Benares. He dispatched Colonel Forde to Vizagapatam and the northern districts of Madras, where Forde won the Battle of Condore (1758), pronounced by Broome &quot;one of the most brilliant actions on military record&quot;.

=====Mughals=====

Clive came into direct contact with the Mughal himself, for the first time, a meeting which would prove beneficial in his later career. Prince Ali Gauhar escaped from Delhi after his father, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, had been murdered by the usurping Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk and his Maratha associate Sadashivrao Bhau.

Prince Ali Gauhar was welcomed and protected by Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh. In 1760, after gaining control over Bihar, Odisha and some parts of the Bengal, Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Mir Jafar and the Company in order to reconquer the riches of the eastern Subahs for the Mughal Empire. Ali Gauhar was accompanied by Muhammad Quli Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal, Kadim Husein and Ghulam Husain Tabatabai. Their forces were reinforced by the forces of Shuja-ud-Daula and Najib-ud-Daula. The Mughals were also joined by Jean Law and 200 Frenchmen, and waged a campaign against the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Prince Ali Gauhar successfully advanced as far as Patna, which he later besieged with a combined army of over 40,000 in order to capture or kill Ramnarian, a sworn enemy of the Mughals. Mir Jafar was terrified at the near demise of his cohort and sent his own son Miran to relieve Ramnarian and retake Patna. Mir Jafar also implored the aid of Robert Clive, but it was Major John Caillaud, who defeated and dispersed Prince Ali Gauhar&#x27;s army.

=====Dutch aggression=====
While Clive was preoccupied with fighting the French, the Dutch directors of the outpost at Chinsurah, not far from Chandernagore, seeing an opportunity to expand their influence, agreed to send additional troops to Chinsurah. Despite Britain and the Dutch Republic not formally being at war, a Dutch fleet of seven ships, containing more than fifteen hundred European and Malay troops, came from Batavia and arrived at the mouth of the Hooghly River in October 1759, while Mir Jafar, the Nawab of Bengal, was meeting with Clive in Calcutta. They met a mixed force of British and local troops at Chinsurah, just outside Calcutta. The British, under Colonel Francis Forde, defeated the Dutch in the Battle of Chinsurah, forcing them to withdraw. The British engaged and defeated the ships the Dutch used to deliver the troops in a separate naval battle on 24 November. Thus Clive avenged the massacre of Amboyna – the occasion when he wrote his famous letter; &quot;Dear Forde, fight them immediately; I will send you the order of council to-morrow&quot;.

Meanwhile, Clive improved the organisation and drill of the sepoy army, after a European model, and enlisted into it many Muslims from upper regions of the Mughal Empire. He re-fortified Calcutta. In 1760, after four years of hard labour, his health gave way and he returned to England. &quot;It appeared&quot;, wrote a contemporary on the spot, &quot;as if the soul was departing from the Government of Bengal&quot;. He had been formally made Governor of Bengal by the Court of Directors at a time when his nominal superiors in Madras sought to recall him to their help there. But he had discerned the importance of the province even during his first visit to its rich delta, mighty rivers and teeming population. Clive selected some able subordinates, notably a young Warren Hastings, who, a year after Plassey, was made Resident at the Nawab&#x27;s court.

The long-term outcome of Plassey was to place a very heavy revenue burden upon Bengal. The company sought to extract the maximum revenue possible from the peasantry to fund military campaigns, and corruption was widespread amongst its officials. Mir Jafar was compelled to engage in extortion on a vast scale in order to replenish his treasury, which had been emptied by the company&#x27;s demand for an indemnity of 2.8 &quot;crores&quot; of rupees (£3 million).

==Return to the British isles==

In 1760, the 35-year-old Clive returned to Great Britain with a fortune of at least £300,000 () and the quit-rent of £27,000 () a year. He financially supported his parents and sisters, while also providing Major Lawrence, the commanding officer who had early encouraged his military genius, with a stipend of £500 () a year. In the five years of his conquests and administration in Bengal, the young man had crowded together a succession of exploits that led Lord Macaulay, in what that historian termed his &quot;flashy&quot; essay on the subject, to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte, declaring that &quot;[Clive] gave peace, security, prosperity and such liberty as the case allowed of to millions of Indians, who had for centuries been the prey of oppression, while Napoleon&#x27;s career of conquest was inspired only by personal ambition, and the absolutism he established vanished with his fall.&quot; Macaulay&#x27;s ringing endorsement of Clive seems more controversial today, as some would argue that Clive&#x27;s ambition and desire for personal gain set the tone for the administration of Bengal until the Permanent Settlement 30 years later. The immediate consequence of Clive&#x27;s victory at Plassey was an increase in the revenue demand on Bengal by at least 20%, which led to considerable hardship for the rural population, particularly during the famine of 1770.
In 1762 Clive was awarded an Irish peerage, created Baron Clive &quot;of Plassey, County Clare&quot;; he bought lands in County Limerick and County Clare, Ireland. Thomas Maunsell (1726-1814), an officer who had fought under Clive at the Battle of Plassey, bought lands near Limerick that he named Plassey, County Limerick. In 1970 these lands were acquired by a precursor of the University of Limerick, whose main administrative centre is now Plassey House. Despite a popular myth, Clive never owned the land.

During the three years that Clive remained in the British isles, he sought a political position, chiefly so that he might influence the course of events in India, which he had left full of promise. He had been well received at court, was elevated to the peerage, had bought estates, and returned a few friends as well as himself to the House of Commons. Clive was MP for Shrewsbury from 1761 until his death. He was allowed to sit in the Commons because his peerage was Irish. He was also elected Mayor of Shrewsbury for 1762–63. Clive received an honorary degree as DCL from Oxford University in 1760, and in 1764 he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath.

Clive set himself to reform the home system of the East India Company, and began a bitter dispute with the chairman of the Court of Directors, Laurence Sulivan, whom he defeated in the end. In this he was aided by the news of reverses in Bengal. Mir Jafar had finally rebelled over payments to British officials, and Clive&#x27;s successor had put Qasim Ali Khan, Mir Jafar&#x27;s son-in-law upon the &quot;musnud&quot; (throne). After a brief tenure, Mir Qasim had fled, ordering Walter Reinhardt Sombre (known to the Muslims as Sumru), a Swiss mercenary of his, to butcher the garrison of 150 British at Patna, and had disappeared under the protection of his brother, the Viceroy of Awadh. The whole company&#x27;s service, civil and military, had become mired in corruption, demoralised by gifts and by the monopoly of inland and export trade, to such an extent that the Indians were pauperised, and the company was plundered of the revenues Clive had acquired. For this Clive himself must bear much responsibility, as he had set a very poor example during his tenure as Governor. Nevertheless, the Court of Proprietors, forced the Directors to hurry Lord Clive to Bengal with the double powers of Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

==Third journey to India (1765-1767)==
On 11 April 1765, Clive&#x27;s ship docked at Madras. Upon learning of Mir Jafar&#x27;s death and the aftermath of the Battle of Buxar, he sent a coded letter to a friend back in England, directing him to mortgage all his property and to buy as much stock in the Company as possible before the news broke, anticipating that its value would rise. On 3 May 1765 Clive landed at Calcutta to learn that Mir Jafar left him personally £70,000 (). Mir Jafar was succeeded by his son-in-law Kasim Ali, though not before the government had been further demoralised by taking £100,000 () as a gift from the new Nawab; while Kasim Ali had induced not only the viceroy of Awadh, but the emperor of Delhi himself, to invade Bihar. At this point a mutiny in the Bengal army occurred, which was a grim precursor of the Indian rebellion of 1857, but on this occasion it was quickly suppressed by blowing the sepoy ringleader from a gun. Major Munro, &quot;the Napier of those times&quot;, scattered the united armies on the hard-fought field of Buxar. The emperor, Shah Alam II, detached himself from the league, while the Awadh viceroy threw himself on the mercy of the British.

Clive had now an opportunity of repeating in Hindustan, or Upper India, what he had accomplished in Bengal. He might have secured what is now called Uttar Pradesh, and have rendered unnecessary the campaigns of Wellesley and Lake. But he believed he had other work in the exploitation of the revenues and resources of rich Bengal itself, making it a base from which British India would afterwards steadily grow. Hence he returned to the Awadh viceroy all his territory save the provinces of Allahabad and Kora, which he presented to the weak emperor.

===Mughal &quot;Firman&quot;===
In return for the Awadhian provinces Clive secured from the emperor one of the most important documents in British history in India, effectively granting title of Bengal to Clive. It appears in the records as &quot;firman from the King Shah Aalum, granting the diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha to the Company 1765.&quot; The date was 12 August 1765, the place Benares, the throne an English dining-table covered with embroidered cloth and surmounted by a chair in Clive&#x27;s tent. It is all pictured by a Muslim contemporary, who indignantly exclaims that so great a &quot;transaction was done and finished in less time than would have been taken up in the sale of a jackass&quot;. By this deed the Company became the real sovereign rulers of thirty million people, yielding a revenue of £4,000,000 sterling ().

On the same date Clive obtained not only an imperial charter for the Company&#x27;s possessions in the Carnatic, completing the work he began at Arcot, but a third &quot;firman&quot; for the highest of all the lieutenancies of the empire, that of the Deccan itself. This fact is mentioned in a letter from the secret committee of the court of directors to the Madras government, dated 27 April 1768. 

The British presence in India was still tiny compared to the number and strength of the princes and people of India, but also compared to the forces of their ambitious French, Dutch and Danish rivals. Clive had this in mind when he penned his last advice to the directors, as he finally left India in 1767:

&quot;We are sensible that, since the acquisition of the dewany, the power formerly belonging to the soubah of those provinces is totally, in fact, vested in the East India Company. Nothing remains to him but the name and shadow of authority. This name, however, this shadow, it is indispensably necessary we should seem to venerate.&quot;

===Attempts at administrative reform===
Having thus founded the Empire of British India, Clive sought to put in place a strong administration. The salaries of civil servants were increased, the acceptance of gifts from Indians was forbidden, and Clive exacted covenants under which participation in the inland trade was stopped. Unfortunately this had very little impact in reducing corruption, which remained widespread until the days of Warren Hastings. Clive&#x27;s military reforms were more effective. He put down a mutiny of the British officers, who chose to resent the veto against receiving presents and the reduction of &quot;batta&quot; (extra pay) at a time when two Maratha armies were marching on Bengal. His reorganisation of the army, on the lines of that which he had begun after Plassey, neglected during his absence in Great Britain, subsequently attracted the admiration of Indian officers. He divided the whole army into three brigades, making each a complete force, in itself equal to any single Indian army that could be brought against it.

Clive was also instrumental in making the company virtual master of North India by introducing his policy of &quot;Dual system of government&quot;. According to the new arrangement enforced by him, the company became liable only for revenue affairs of Bengal (&quot;Diwani&quot;) and Bihar while the administration and law and order was made a prerogative of the Nawab. An office of &quot;Deputy Nawab&quot; was created, who was at the helms of all the affairs vis a vis revenue of two of the richest provinces of India besides being the company&#x27;s representative while the &quot;Nizamat&quot; (Law and order) remained in the hands of the Nawab who appointed his own representative to deal with the company. This system proved to be detrimental for the administration of Bengal and ultimately the &quot;Dual system of government&quot; was abolished by Clive.

==Retirement and death==
Clive left India for the last time in February 1767. In 1768, he lived at the Chateau de Larzac in Pézenas, Hérault, Languedoc-Roussillon in southern France. Local tradition is that he introduced local bakers to a sweet pastry, Petit pâté de Pézenas, and that he (or his chef) had brought the recipe from India as a refined version of the savoury keema naan. Pézenas is known for such delicacies.

Later in 1768, Clive was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and served as treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury.

In 1769, he acquired the house and gardens of Claremont near Esher in Surrey, and commissioned Capability Brown to remodel the garden and house.

A great famine killed about a third of the population of Bengal between 1769 and 1773. It was argued at the time, notably by Adam Smith, that East India Company officials caused the famine due to bad management, particularly their abuse of trade monopoly and land tax for personal gain. These revelations and subsequent debates in Parliament reduced Clive&#x27;s political popularity.

In 1772 Parliament opened an inquiry into the East India Company&#x27;s practices in India. Clive&#x27;s political opponents turned these hearings into attacks on Clive. Questioned about some of the large sums of money he had received while in India, Clive pointed out that they were not contrary to accepted Company practice, and defended his behaviour by stating that he had foregone opportunities for greater gain, concluding memorably: &quot;I stand astonished at my own moderation.” The hearings highlighted the need for reform of the Company; but a vote to censure Clive for his actions failed. Later in 1772, Clive was invested Knight of the Bath (eight years after he had been made knight bachelor), and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire.

Clive continued to be involved in Parliamentary discussions on company reforms. In 1773, General John Burgoyne, one of Clive&#x27;s most vocal critics, pressed the case that some of Clive&#x27;s gains were made at the expense of the Company and of the government. Clive again made a spirited defence of his actions, and closed his testimony by stating: &quot;Take my fortune, but save my honour.&quot; The vote that followed exonerated Clive, who was commended for the &quot;great and meritorious service&quot; he rendered to the country. Immediately thereafter Parliament began debating the Regulating Act, which significantly reformed the East India Company&#x27;s practices.

On 22 November 1774 Clive died, aged 49, at his home Berkeley Square in London. His death was caused by a cut to his throat from a penknife he held. The cause of his death has long been the subject of controversy. No inquest was carried out, and contemporary newspapers reported the death as due to an apoplectic fit or stroke. Clive’s 20th-century biographer John Watney concluded ambiguously: &quot;He did not die from a self-inflicted wound ... He died as he severed his jugular with a blunt paper knife brought on by an overdose of drugs&quot;. While Clive left no suicide note, Samuel Johnson wrote that he &quot;had acquired his fortune by such crimes that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat&quot;. Clive&#x27;s demise has been linked to his history of depression and to opium addiction, but the likely immediate impetus was excruciating pain resulting from gallstones which he had been attempting to abate with opium. According to William Dalrymple, Clive suffered from acute depression from an early age, and tried to take his own life twice in his youth. During his Indian stint depression also troubled him. He was morose, and spoke little. 

He was buried in St Margaret&#x27;s Parish Church at Moreton Say, near his birthplace in Shropshire. After his death, a satirical cartoon in a London newspaper represented him as &#x27;Lord Vulture&#x27;, picking the bones of the Indian dead, perhaps referring to the Bengal famine.

==Criticism==
Clive&#x27;s actions in India have been criticised by modern historians, particularly his economic management which contributed to the Bengal Famine of 1770, which killed between one and ten million people. Changes caused by Clive to the Indian revenue system and agricultural practices, designed to maximize profits for the East India Company, increased poverty in Bengal. Clive himself commented on the poor conditions of Bengal under Company rule,

 I shall only say that such a scene of anarchy, confusion, bribery, corruption, and extortion was never seen or heard of in any country but Bengal; nor did such and so many fortunes acquire in so unjust and rapacious a manner. The three provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa producing a clear revenue of £3 million sterling, have been under the absolute management of the company&#x27;s servants, ever since Mir Jafar&#x27;s restoration to the subahship; and they have, both civil and military, exacted and levied contributions from every man of power and consequence, from the Nawab down to the lowest zamindar. 

In January 2021, the private school that Clive attended, Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, renamed Clive House to &quot;Raphael House&quot; (after the sportsman John Edward Raphael). Petitions have called for removal of a statue of Clive from The Square in Shrewsbury. No more than 20,000 signatures supported such a move, and on 16 July 2020 Shropshire Council voted 28–17 to retain the statue. A similar petition for removal of Clive&#x27;s statue from outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Whitehall, accrued some 80,000 signatures.

In light of criticism of Clive&#x27;s legacy, in 2020 Haberdashers&#x27; Adams school in Newport, Shropshire announced that Clive House was to be renamed &quot;Owen House&quot; (after the Shropshire poet Wilfred Owen).

==Legacy==


* Robert Clive&#x27;s desk from his time at Market Drayton Grammar School is on display at Market Drayton museum complete with his carved initials. The town also has a Clive Road.
* Robert Clive&#x27;s pet Aldabra giant tortoise died on 23 March 2006 in the Kolkata zoo. The tortoise, whose name was &quot;Adwaita&quot; (meaning the &quot;One and Only&quot; in Bengali), appeared to be 150–250 years old. Adwaita had been in the zoo since the 1870s and the zoo&#x27;s documentation showed that he came from Clive&#x27;s estate in India.
* A statue of Clive stands in the main square in the market town of Shrewsbury, as well as a later one in King Charles Street near St James&#x27;s Park, London.
* Clive&#x27;s coat of arms can be seen (impaled with his wife&#x27;s) in relief in the pediment at Claremont in Esher, Surrey, which Clive had rebuilt.
* Robert Clive established the first slaughterhouse in India, in Calcutta in 1760.
* With the re-capture of Calcutta by Clive in 1756, the cultivation of poppies for the opium trade soon came to be the mainstay of the East India Trading Company&#x27;s commerce with Imperial China.
* Clive is responsible for opening the first organized brothel within the Army cantonment of Calcutta. He was not interested in eradication of prostitution but in regulation so that their own soldiers and sailors could be protected from venereal diseases. However, two properties in central Calcutta owned by women named Ishwari and Bhobi, whom the Company identified as prostitutes, were seized in 1753.

===Cultural===
* Robert Browning&#x27;s 1880 poem &quot;&quot; recounts a fictional episode in which Clive, as a young clerk, duels a card-sharping soldier. Clive shoots and misses; the cheat then admits his crime and spares Clive&#x27;s life. The poem&#x27;s narrator, and those watching the duel, initially believe that the episode shows Clive&#x27;s courage in standing up honestly; but Clive rebukes them that the magnanimous cheat showed far more honour. The poem largely focuses on the relationship between courage and fear, and closes with an allusion to Clive&#x27;s suicide (&quot;Clive&#x27;s worst deed – we&#x27;ll hope condoned&quot;).
* A bestselling children&#x27;s novel, G. A. Henty&#x27;s &quot;With Clive in India: Or, the Beginnings of an Empire&quot; (1884), celebrates Clive&#x27;s life and career from a pro-British point of view.
* R. J. Minney&#x27;s stage play &quot;Clive of India&quot; (1933) portrays the life of Clive, particularly focusing on his victory at the Battle of Plassey. It was based on a biography of Clive that Minney had written two years earlier.
* The 1935 film &quot;Clive of India&quot;, based on Minney&#x27;s play, starred Ronald Colman, Loretta Young, and Clive&#x27;s descendant Colin Clive.
* Due to being the brother-in-law of Nevil Maskelyne, Clive is mentioned in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel Mason &amp; Dixon - specifically during the sections with Mason and Maskelyne on the island of Saint Helena.

* &quot;Clive of India&quot; is a brand of curry powder manufactured in Australia by McKenzie&#x27;s Foods.
* &quot;Clive&quot; was a house at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood, where he was a student for seven years before his expulsion. Members were distinguished by their red striped ties. In January 2021 the house was renamed after former pupil and sportsman John Raphael.
* Clive is a Senior Girls house at the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School, where all houses are named after prominent military figures.
* Clive was a house at Haberdashers&#x27; Adams school in Newport, Shropshire which in 2021 was renamed Owen house, after the poet and soldier Wilfred Owen who was born near Oswestry in Shropshire. This follows criticism of Robert Clive in light of the George Floyd protests.
* Clive Road, in West Dulwich, London, commemorates Baron Clive despite being so named close to a century after his death. Following the completion of the relocation of The Crystal Palace from Hyde Park to what is now Upper Norwood in 1854, the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway was opened on 10 June 1854 to cope with crowds visiting the Crystal Palace. This led to a huge increase in employment in the area and a subsequent increase in the building of residential properties. Many of the new roads were named after eminent figures in British imperial history, such as Robert Clive.
* There is a settlement named after Clive in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay province of New Zealand.

<text>The Rugby Championship, formerly known as the Tri Nations Series (1996–2011), is an international rugby union competition contested annually by Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. These are traditionally the four highest ranked national teams in the Southern Hemisphere; the Six Nations is a similar tournament in the Northern Hemisphere.

The competition is administered by SANZAAR, a consortium consisting of four national governing bodies: the South African Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby Union, Rugby Australia and the Argentine Rugby Union. The inaugural Tri Nations tournament was in 1996, and was won by New Zealand. South Africa won their first title in 1998, and Australia their first in 2000. Following the last Tri Nations tournament in 2011, New Zealand had won ten championships, with South Africa and Australia on three titles each. The first Rugby Championship was won by New Zealand, who won all six of their matches.

New Zealand, South Africa and Australia have frequently been ranked among the top rugby nations. South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup four times, followed by New Zealand with three, and Australia twice, accounting for nine of the ten Cups.

==History==
===Foundation===
Australia and New Zealand first played each other in 1903. South Africa toured both nations in 1921 but there was never any formal competition between these teams, unlike the Home Nations (now known as the Six Nations Championship) in the Northern Hemisphere and the three nations only met sporadically.

In the 1930s, Australia and New Zealand started contesting the Bledisloe Cup during rugby tours between the two countries.

The final acceptance of professionalism in rugby union launched the Tri Nations concept - nearing the completion of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, multimillion-pound negotiations between the South African, New Zealand and Australian unions took place to form SANZAR. The new union soon announced a ten-year deal worth £360 million. The competition was established to create an equivalent to the Five Nations in Europe.

In 2012, this competition was extended to include Argentina, a country whose impressive performances in international games (especially in reaching the third place in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby Championship.

===Format===
The series is played on a home-and-away basis. From the first tournament in 1996 until 2005, the three teams played each other twice. From then until 2012, each team played the others three times, totally six games per team, except in the Rugby World Cup years of 2007 and 2011 when the series reverted to a double round-robin.

With the addition of Argentina, in 2012, the format once again reverted to a double round-robin, meaning each team again played six games. For 2015, to provide the teams longer preparation time ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, each side played the others&#x27; teams only once each. This format was also adopted for the 2019 Tournament.

===Related competitions===
In addition to the Rugby Championship trophy, the winner of games played between Australia and New Zealand also go toward determining the winner of the Bledisloe Cup each year. Similarly, the Freedom Cup is contested between New Zealand and South Africa, the Mandela Challenge Plate between Australia and South Africa, and the Puma Trophy between Australia and Argentina.

===Tri Nations===

The opening tournament of 1996 was dominated by the All Blacks who stormed to victory undefeated, leaving the Springboks and the Wallabies with just one win each — against each other. The opening exchange was between New Zealand and Australia, New Zealand winning by over 40 points and, although they won all four of their games, the later matches were a lot closer in their scorelines. The launch of the Tri Nations was considered a huge success.

A similar story unfolded the following year, 1997. The All Blacks maintained their dominance over the new competition and again went undefeated. Australia and South Africa found themselves in similar position again with just one win each. The 1998 series was something of a turnaround for all nations with South Africa winning the tournament and Australia finishing second. Two-time winner New Zealand finished at the bottom with no wins. In the following tournament in 1999 New Zealand again became Tri Nations champions and defending champions South Africa fell to the bottom.

Australia, the World Champions at the time, won their first Tri Nations championship in 2000. That tournament is also notable for Australia&#x27;s opening match against New Zealand at Stadium Australia where 109,874 spectators attended. Jonah Lomu scored a try in injury time to grab the win for the All Blacks. The game was hailed as one of the greatest ever, and the end competition thought by some to be the best Tri Nations ever at the time.

Australia continued their reign as Tri Nations champions by successfully defending the trophy the following year. Their run ended in 2002 when the All Blacks won the championship again. New Zealand successfully defended it in 2003. South Africa won the 2004 tournament where the three nations finished with two wins each. The Springboks emerged as winners due to their superior table points. The trophy returned to New Zealand in 2005 and the Wallabies failed to win a game. In 2006 New Zealand retained the trophy with 2 games still to be played. In 2007, the Tri Nations was shortened to two games against either team, because it clashed with the Rugby World Cup in France. The Tri Nations championship and the Bledisloe Cup came down to the final match, between New Zealand and Australia at Eden Park. New Zealand ran out easy winners, and lifted both the trophies. There was some controversy as South Africa fielded less than a full strength squad in the away legs in Australia and New Zealand in anticipation of the World Cup. New Zealand defended their title in 2008, in beating Australia in the final match in Brisbane. In 2009, South Africa claimed the season crown in their final match with an away win over New Zealand in Hamilton. 2010 saw another dominant performance by New Zealand, winning the tournament with 2 games to spare and all 6 of their games.

On 5 December 2020, a traditional version of the Australian National Anthem was sung for the first time in the Eora indigenous language, before the match between Argentina and Australia.

===Expansion===
The competition was expanded in 2006 and saw each of the three nations play each other three times, although the 2007 series reverted to a double round-robin to reduce fixture congestion in a World Cup year. Historically there were persistent rumours about the inclusion of Argentina and this was formalised on 14 September 2009 when it was announced that Argentina would become part of the competition in 2012. There have also been rumours about a Pacific Islands team being included too.

Until then, Argentina was the only tier 1 nation that had no regular competition, and some, among them former Pumas captain Agustín Pichot, had even spoken of them joining the Six Nations. However, a spokesperson said: &quot;We belong in a tournament in the southern hemisphere and not in an expanded Six Nations&quot;. The inclusion of Argentina did have some support from some bodies, South African Rugby Union deputy chief executive saying: &quot;We would support (their) request to play in the Tri-Nations&quot;. Former Springbok coach Jake White also said: &quot;I think it would add a new dimension to the tournament and perhaps refresh it.&quot;

Since 2007 a deal between the International Rugby Board (IRB), the world governing body for the sport, was brokering a deal with SANZAR to admit Argentina to the Tri Nations as early as 2008 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that many players and fans in the SANZAR countries disliked the expansion to a triple round-robin, noting that former All Blacks scrum-half Justin Marshall accused SANZAR of overkill in 2006. Also, the piece added that South Africa is highly dissatisfied with the current Tri Nations format, as it requires that the Boks tour for a month while the Wallabies and All Blacks fly in and out of South Africa in a week. The addition of Argentina would even out travel commitments for all teams involved. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted that there were two main stumbling blocks to adding Argentina:
* Division of broadcast revenue, which is currently shared equally by the four SANZAAR countries.
* At the time, the biggest stumbling block was possibly the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR). &quot;The Times&quot; noted that some UAR members were &quot;deeply attached to amateurism&quot;, adding that the IRB had a blueprint on the table for a South American provincial competition similar to SANZAR&#x27;s Super Rugby, featuring six Argentine provincial sides and one each from Uruguay and Chile, but UAR had yet to approve it.

However, by August 2007, it became clear that there would be no expansion of the series before the current television contract between SANZAR and News Corporation expires in 2010. An IRB spokesman stated that the main problems with adding the Pumas to the Tri Nations, besides media contracts, were fixture congestion and the lack of a professional structure in Argentina. Domestic rugby in Argentina is still amateur; in fact, the UAR constitution specifically prohibited professional rugby in the country until December 2007, and even did not allow for a professional league. Because of this, a large majority of the Pumas play for European club teams, which would likely create further scheduling conflicts. Admission of Argentina was therefore submitted to several conditions for the UAR:

* Ensure its best players would be available at the Tri-nations time of year, late summer, which is exactly when France&#x27;s Top 14 and England&#x27;s Premiership start their first games.
* Develop professional rugby inside Argentina thanks to a SANZAR loan and financial support from the IRB; Professionalisation has since entered Argentina.
* Reform competitions into a single united professional league. There are now regional leagues being the one from Buenos Aires city the strongest and a short 4-team clubs national championship.

In November 2007, the IRB held a conference on the future worldwide growth of the sport, with the status of &quot;Los Pumas&quot; a key topic of discussion. The most important decision made at the conference, with regard to the Tri Nations, was the agreement of the UAR to establish a professional rugby structure between 2008 and 2012, at which time Argentina would be &quot;fully integrated into the Southern top-flight Rugby playing structure.&quot; At the time of the IRB conference, the UAR had already scheduled a special meeting for 28 December 2007 to amend its constitution to allow players to be paid. Shortly after the IRB conference, New Zealand Rugby Union deputy chief executive Steve Tew expressed doubts that, within ten years, a professional domestic competition in Argentina would be sufficiently viable to retain elite players in South America despite all the good intentions and funding of the IRB. The aforementioned UAR meeting did not result in the formation of a professional league. The 23 provincial delegates voted unanimously to keep their domestic league amateur, but approved a plan to centrally contract the Pumas selection pool to the UAR as professionals. In February 2009, the UAR announced that under a plan supervised and financed by the IRB, it had contracted 31 local players, who will each receive 2,300 Argentine pesos (US$655/£452) per month. The eventual goal is for these players to form the core of a future Pumas selection pool.

Argentina officially joined The Rugby Championship in a meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 November 2011.

Japan have been in talks with joining the competition as they seek to face better opponents. They previously played in the Asia Rugby Championship which they dominated in for many years, facing lower competition. Fiji have also been mentioned as another potential candidate to join the competition, as they tend to be the better performing tier 2 country. Along with Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, other smaller potentials to join, compete in the annual World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup.

On 5 October 2023, Flying Fijians head coach Simon Raiwalui confirmed that there were ongoing discussions of Fiji being part of the competition after the 2023 Rugby World Cup. He mentioned the need of results, rankings and administrative structures for admission into Rugby Championship.

==Competition==
The order of fixtures has changed several times in the history of the series. In the past each team played the others twice. After some tweaking of the schedule it was decided to start the series with two fixtures in either South Africa or New Zealand and move the series to the country that did not host the opening rounds. Under this setup Australia&#x27;s home fixtures were always the middle two in the series.

The recent reworking of the calendar took effect with the 2006 event. This was the result of a new television deal between SANZAR and broadcasters in the United Kingdom and the SANZAR countries. Each team plays the other three times. In 2006 the series opened in New Zealand and the first four rounds alternated between New Zealand and Australia. The fifth round was in Australia. After a one-week break the series returned to New Zealand and then finished with South Africa&#x27;s three home fixtures. Each team has two home fixtures against one team and only one home fixture against the other.

The competition begins in July. Originally it had started late in July but, with the expansion of the series, the start date has moved to early in the month. It typically ends early in September. The Rugby Championship opens after the completion of the Super Rugby competition for the year because players from the SANZAR countries are involved in both.

The winner is determined by a points system:
*4 points for a win
*2 points for a draw
*0 points for a loss

&quot;Bonus points&quot; may also be earned in any given match and count toward deciding the series winner. A total of two bonus points can be possibly scored:
*The &quot;Attacking bonus point&quot;. Prior to 2016, a team could gain an attacking bonus point by scoring four or more tries in the match, regardless of the final result. From the 2016 competition onwards, this was modified so that an attacking bonus point is awarded if a team scores at least three tries more than their opponents.
*The &quot;Defending bonus point&quot; by losing by seven points (a converted try) or fewer.

A victorious team can collect either 4 or 5 points, depending on whether or not it gained an attacking bonus point. A team that draws can collect either 2 or 3 points, depending on whether or not it gained an attacking bonus point. A losing team may collect from 0 to 2 points. At the end of the series the team with the most points is declared the winner.

If teams end level on points for any position, the first tiebreaker is total number of wins in the competition, then number of wins against the other team/s tied on points, then overall points differential, then points differential between the team/s tied on points, then most tries scored in the competition. If that can&#x27;t differentiate the team, the series or position will be shared.

However, the Rugby Championship has yet to finish in a tie for the top spot.

<doc id="170113" wikidata="Q6523648" url="?curid=170113" title="Leo Cruz">
<text>Leonardo Cruz (born January 17, 1953, in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic), better known in the world of boxing as Leo Cruz, was a world Jr. Featherweight champion from the Dominican Republic. He is the younger brother of former lightweight world champion of boxing, Carlos Cruz.

==Personal==
Leo was the brother of Carlos Cruz. Carlos had conquered the world Lightweight title by beating Carlos Ortiz in 1968, but lost his life in a plane crash on February 15, 1970 that killed all 102 passengers and crew on board.

==Early life==
Leo moved to Puerto Rico early in the 1970s, and began identifying himself as half Puerto Rican almost immediately.

==Pro career==
He began his successful professional boxing career in Puerto Rico, with a string of wins. Despite having beaten future two time world champion Lupe Pintor, however, Cruz was still a virtual unknown when given a chance to win the WBC world Jr. Featherweight championship. Despite losing by a knockout in the 13th round against world champion Wilfredo Gómez, his stock around the boxing world rose after that fight. Cruz kept on fighting, and winning, until he was given a second world title try, this time by the WBA world champion Sergio Victor Palma, in Buenos Aires. Cruz was beaten by a decision in 15 by the Argentine world champion, but in a rematch on 12 June 1982 at Miami, Cruz became world champion by defeating Palma by a decision, also in 15 rounds.

Cruz in his first defense knocked out Benito Badilla of Chile in eight rounds, at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. When Gómez left his WBC title vacant soon after, Cruz became recognized by most fans as the universal world champion. Then, he defeated South Korean challenger Soon-Hyun Chung, by decision in 15; after dropping him in round eight; also in San Juan. In his first defense at his home country, Cruz put his title on the line in August 1983 against Nicaraguan challenger Cleo Garcia at Santo Domingo. Cruz retained the title by a decision.

With a defense against Puerto Rican &quot;Victor Luvi Callejas&quot; looming ahead, Cruz went to Milan in February 1984, and, while defending his crown against Italian Loris Stecca, was stopped in round 12, therefore losing the WBA world junior featherweight title.

==Comeback==
Cruz attempted a comeback in 1985, winning one fight, but retiring for good after losing a second comeback fight in 1989.

<text>Eleanor Alice Hibbert (née Burford; 1 September 1906 – 18 January 1993) was an English writer of historical romances. She was a prolific writer who published several books a year in different literary genres, each genre under a different pen name: Jean Plaidy for fictionalized history of European royalty and the three volumes of her history of the Spanish Inquisition, Victoria Holt for gothic romances, and Philippa Carr for a multi-generational family saga. She also wrote light romances, crime novels, murder mysteries and thrillers under pseudonyms Eleanor Burford, Elbur Ford, Kathleen Kellow, Anna Percival, and Ellalice Tate.

In 1989, the Romance Writers of America gave her the Golden Treasure award in recognition of her contributions to the romance genre. By the time of her death, she had written more than 200 books that sold more than 100 million copies and had been translated into 20 languages. She continues to be a widely borrowed author among British libraries.

==Personal life==




Hibbert was born Eleanor Alice Burford on 1 September 1906 at 20 Burke Street, Canning Town, now part of the London borough of Newham. She inherited a love of reading from her father, Joseph Burford, a dock labourer. Her mother was Alice Louise Burford, née Tate.

When she was quite young, ailing health forced her to be privately educated at home. At the age of 16 she went to a business college, where she studied shorthand, typewriting, and languages. She then worked for a jeweller in Hatton Garden where she weighed gems and typed. She also worked as a language interpreter in a café for French and German-speaking tourists.

In her early twenties, she married George Percival Hibbert (&quot;c.&quot; 1886–1966), a wholesale leather merchant about twenty years older than herself, who shared her love of books and reading. She was his second wife. During World War II, the Hibberts lived in a cottage in Cornwall that looked out over a bay called Plaidy Beach.

Between 1974 and 1978, Eleanor Hibbert bought a 13th-century manor house in Sandwich, Kent, that she named &quot;King&#x27;s Lodging&quot; because she believed that it had served previously as lodging for English monarchs Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The house had carved fireplaces and a staircase from the Tudor period. Hibbert restored the house and furnished it opulently but soon found it too big for her taste and too far from London.

She then moved to a two-storey penthouse apartment at Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, that overlooked the Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park. She shared her apartment with Mrs. Molly Pascoe, a companion who also travelled with her.

In 1985, Hibbert sold &quot;King&#x27;s Lodging&quot;.

Hibbert spent her summers in her cottage near Plaidy Beach in Cornwall. To get away from the cold English winter, Hibbert would sail around the world on board a cruise ship three months a year from January to April. The cruise would take her to exotic destinations like Egypt and Australia, locations that she later incorporated into her novels. She sailed to Sydney aboard the cruise ship &quot;Oronsay&quot; in 1970, and the &quot;Canberra&quot; in 1978.

Towards the end of her life, her eyesight started failing.

Eleanor Hibbert died on 18 January 1993 on the cruise ship &quot;Sea Princess&quot; somewhere between Athens, Greece and Port Said, Egypt and was buried at sea. A memorial service was later held on 6 March 1993, at St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church, Kensington Park Road, London.

==Writing career==

===Literary influences===
Eleanor Hibbert grew up in London. She first discovered her fascination for the past when she visited Hampton Court in her teenage years. After her marriage, Hibbert achieved the financial independence she needed to realise her desire to write. London&#x27;s monuments and royal personalities filled Hibbert&#x27;s historical novels. She was also influenced by her regular visits to British historic homes and their architecture.

During World War II, the Hibberts lived in Cornwall, whose pebble beaches, high cliffs and treacherous blue waters served as the setting for many of the &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; gothic novels.
In later life, Hibbert took a world cruise every year. Her ship called in ports of countries like Turkey, Egypt, India, South Africa, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Australia. These exotic destinations serve as the backdrop in later &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novels. In the late 1960s, Hibbert spent two months visiting the Australian goldfields 40 miles north of Melbourne, research for her 1971 &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novel, &quot;The Shadow of the Lynx&quot;. In 1972, Hibbert travelled from Sydney to Melbourne via the Snowy Mountains and visited Hobart, Launceston, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo.

Hibbert&#x27;s &quot;Philippa Carr&quot; novels were based partly in Cornwall and partly in Australia.

Hibbert was influenced in her writing by the Brontës (especially the novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;), George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, and Leo Tolstoy.

===Early work===
During the 1930s, Hibbert wrote nine long novels (each about 150,000 words in length), all of them serious psychological studies of contemporary life. However, none of these was accepted for publication. At the same time, she wrote short stories for newspapers including the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Evening News&quot;. Some also appeared in &quot;The Star&quot;, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Realm&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. The turning point came when the fiction editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; told her, &quot;You&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree: you must write something which is saleable, and the easiest way is to write romantic fiction.&quot;

Hibbert read 50 romance novels as research and then published her first fiction book, &quot;Daughter of Anna&quot;, in 1941. It was a period novel set in Australia of the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was a moderate success and Hibbert received £30 as advance for it. The book was published under her maiden name, &quot;Eleanor Burford&quot;, which was also used for her contemporary novels. Following the success of the book, Hibbert was contracted by Herbert Jenkins publishers to write one book a year. By 1961 Hibbert had published 31 novels under this name, including ten romance novels for Mills &amp; Boon.

===Pseudonyms===

In 1945, she chose the pseudonym &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; for her new novel &quot;Together They Ride&quot; at the request of her agent. The name was inspired by Plaidy Beach near the Hibberts&#x27; home in Looe, Cornwall during World War II. Her agent suggested the first name, saying &quot;&quot;Jean&quot; doesn&#x27;t take much room at the back of the book&quot;. The book was published by Gerald G. Swan, a London publisher. The next book written under the &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; pseudonym was &quot;Beyond the Blue Mountains&quot; in 1948. The publisher Robert Hale accepted the 500-page manuscript after it had been rejected by several others. The firm wrote to Hibbert&#x27;s literary agency, A.M. Heath, &quot;Will you tell this author that there are glittering prizes ahead for those who can write as she does?&quot;. In 1949, Hibbert hit her stride with the first &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; novel that fictionalized stories of royalty: &quot;The King&#x27;s Pleasure&quot;, featuring Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. A total of 91 &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; novels were published. Hibbert&#x27;s last &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; book, &quot;The Rose Without a Thorn&quot;, was published posthumously.

Hibbert also wrote four non-fiction books under the pseudonym &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot;. The first, &quot;A Triptych of Poisoners&quot; (1958), was a collection of short biographies of poisoners: Cesare Borgia, Marie d&#x27;Aubray and Edward William Pritchard. The other three were a trilogy on the Spanish Inquisition: &quot;The Rise&quot; (1959), &quot;The Growth&quot; (1960) and &quot;The End&quot; (1961).

From 1950 to 1953, Hibbert wrote four novels as &quot;Elbur Ford&quot;, a pen name derived from her maiden name, Eleanor Burford. These novels were based on real-life murderers of the nineteenth century: Edward William Pritchard (&quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot;, 1950); Adelaide Bartlett (&quot;Poison in Pimlico&quot;, 1950); Euphrasie Mercier (&quot;The Bed Disturbed&quot;, 1952) and Constance Kent (&quot;Such Bitter Business&quot;, 1953 – published in the U.S. in 1954 under the title &quot;Evil in the House&quot;).

Between 1952 and 1960, Hibbert used the pseudonym &quot;Kathleen Kellow&quot; to write eight novels that were mostly crime and mystery fiction. From 1956 to 1961, she wrote five novels as &quot;Ellalice Tate&quot;, a pseudonym inspired by her mother&#x27;s name, Alice Tate.

In 1960, at the suggestion of her agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, she wrote her first Gothic romance, &quot;Mistress of Mellyn&quot;, under the name &quot;Victoria Holt&quot;. The pseudonym was created by choosing the name &quot;Victoria&quot; for its regal, romantic ring while the name &quot;Holt&quot; was taken from the military bank of Holt &amp; Company where Hibbert had an account. Published by Doubleday in the United States and Collins in the United Kingdom, &quot;Mistress of Mellyn&quot; became an instant international bestseller and revived the Gothic romantic suspense genre.

&quot;Mistress of Mellyn&quot; was a clever weaving of elements from earlier Gothic novels such as &quot;Jane Eyre (1847)&quot;, &quot;The Woman in White (1859)&quot;, and &quot;Rebecca (1938)&quot;. Its setting in Cornwall made the resemblance to &quot;Rebecca (1938)&quot; so remarkable that it was speculated that &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; was a pseudonym for Daphne du Maurier. After six Victoria Holt novels were published over eight years, it was revealed that Hibbert was the author. Hibbert wrote a further 31 novels as Victoria Holt, primarily portraying fictitious characters set against an authentic period background, usually of the late 19th century. The last Victoria Holt novel, &quot;The Black Opal&quot;, was published after her death.

In 1960, Hibbert wrote a novel under the name &quot;Anna Percival&quot;, a pseudonym inspired by her husband&#x27;s middle name, Percival. Hibbert never used that pen name again.

She created her last pseudonym, Philippa Carr, in 1972 at the suggestion of her publisher, Collins, to create a new series showing successive generations of English gentlewomen involved in important historical events starting with the Reformation and ending with World War II.

Hibbert continued to use the pseudonym &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; for her historical novels about the crowned heads of Europe. Her books written under this pseudonym were popular with the general public and were also hailed by critics and historians for their historical accuracy, quality of writing, and attention to detail.


===Research===
Hibbert based her research on the writings of British historians such as John Speed, James Anthony Froude, Alexander Fraser Tytler and Agnes Strickland.

Each of Hibbert&#x27;s &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; books featured a bibliography at the end, listing the historical works consulted during the process of writing the book.
The Kensington Central Library gave Hibbert special concessions to aid her research. She was allowed to go down to the vault where the out-of-circulation books were stored, and borrow them a trolley-load at a time. She was even allowed to take the books home and keep them as long as she wanted.

When her eyesight started failing towards the end of her life, she borrowed audiobooks from the Westminster City Council public libraries.

===Writing discipline===
Hibbert was a prolific writer, churning out multiple books in a year under different pseudonyms, chiefly Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt and Philippa Carr. &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; proved very popular in the United Kingdom, selling large quantities in paperback while &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; was a bestseller in the United States. Many of her readers never realized that behind all these pen names was a single author.

Hibbert attributed her large output to her regular working habits. She described herself as a compulsive writer and would write all seven days in the week. She started every morning at the typewriter on her desk, usually completing five thousand words by lunchtime. Though writing stimulated her, she found the typewriter to be a physical strain. She devoted five hours every day to her writing, in addition to the time that it took her to proof-read her draft and conduct research. In the afternoon, she would personally answer all the fan mail she received. She would also spend time at Kensington Central Library. In the evening, she played chess if she could find an opponent or attended social engagements.

Even while on her annual cruise around the world, Hibbert maintained her discipline. She wrote in the mornings, played chess in the afternoons, and joined in the shipboard entertainments in the evenings. She preferred to work on her Victoria Holt novels while on board the cruise ship because they did not require as much research or fact-checking at a library.

=== Literary agents and publishers ===
Eleanor Hibbert enjoyed healthy, lifelong relationships with her literary agents and publishers, a rare feat in the publishing world. She was represented in the United Kingdom by A.M. Heath Literary Agency and by McIntosh &amp; Otis in the United States. Her long-time American agent was Patricia Schartle Myrer followed by Julie Fallowfield.

London publisher Herbert Jenkins published 20 light romantic novels from 1941 to 1955 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name &quot;Eleanor Burford&quot;. The contract, initially for one book a year at an advance of £30 a title, was later revised to two books a year when the books proved successful.

Mills and Boon, a London publisher that specialised in low-priced, paperback, romantic novels brought out 10 romance novels from 1956 to 1962 that Hibbert wrote under the pen name &quot;Eleanor Burford&quot;.

Gerald G Swan published the first &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; book in 1945 but every one after that was published by Robert Hale. Starting with &quot;Beyond the Blue Mountains&quot; (1948) and extending over the entire course of her lifetime, Robert Hale published a total of 90 Jean Plaidy books in hardcover with dust jackets illustrated by specialist artist Philip Gough.

MacRae Smith Co. of Philadelphia published &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; titles in the United States. Foreign language editions of &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; books began appearing in 1956: in French by Éditions Robert Laffont, Paris; in Spanish by Guillermo Kraft Limitada, Buenos Aires; and in Dutch by Uitgeverij A.J. Luitingh, Amsterdam.

In 1951, Canadian paperback publishers Harlequin reprinted &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Blue Mountains&quot; in paperback to achieve their greatest commercial success to that date: of the 30,000 copies sold, only 48 were returned.

Robert Hale published eight &quot;Kathleen Kellow&quot; crime and mystery novels between 1952 and 1960 in hardcover with dust jackets by Philip Gough. Robert Hale also published the sole book written under the &quot;Anna Percival&quot; pseudonym, &quot;The Brides of Lanlory&quot;.

From 1950 to 1953, four &quot;Elbur Ford&quot; crime novels were published by London publisher William Morrow in the United Kingdom and New York publisher Werner Laurie in the United States.

From 1956 to 1961, Hodder &amp; Stoughton published all five historical novels written under the pseudonym &quot;Ellalice Tate&quot;.

From 1960 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 32 &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novels for the publishing giants Collins in the United Kingdom and Doubleday in the United States. Many of them were bestsellers and were translated into 20 languages to reach a worldwide audience.

From 1972 to 1993, Hibbert wrote 19 &quot;Philippa Carr&quot; novels that were published by Collins in the United Kingdom and Putnam in the United States. A few of them were later translated into foreign languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Russian and Polish.

By the time of her death in 1993, Hibbert had sold 75 million books translated in 20 languages under the name &quot;Victoria Holt&quot;, 14 million under the name &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; and 3 million under the name &quot;Philippa Carr&quot;.

After her death, Mark Hamilton of the A.M. Heath Literary Agency took over as executor for her literary estate, estimated to be worth about £8,790,807 at probate.

===Reception and legacy===

==== 20th century ====
&quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; historical novels were welcomed by readers who found them to be an easy way to gain insight into a sweeping panorama of European history.

It was common for school girls in England to read these in history lessons, whilst hiding them behind their proper text books.

In the last decade of the 20th century, historical fiction went out of fashion. &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; titles went out of print.

==== 21st century ====
In October 2001, Rachel Kahan, associate editor at Crown Publishing Group, and &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; fan since childhood, discovered that &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; books had gone out of print in the United States.
Kahan bought the reprint rights to ten &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; novels. In April 2003, Crown chose to publish two books under the Three Rivers Press imprint, both featuring Henry VIII. &quot;The Lady in the Tower&quot; and &quot;The Rose Without a Thorn&quot; tell the story of two of his six wives, Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard, both of whom were beheaded. The books were published in paperback with new titles, modern covers and a readers&#x27; guide at the back. The first printing of 30,000 copies of each book sold out in 3 months. Based on this success, Crown&#x27;s United Kingdom unit, Arrow Books, bought the entire &quot;Jean Plaidy&quot; backlist.

===Reprints===

=== Reception and legacy ===

==== 20th century ====
&quot;Victoria Holt&quot; books proved popular with the reading public and many of them made it to bestseller lists. Hibbert won loyalty from large numbers of women readers who passed along their copies to the next generation of women in their family. Hibbert described her heroines as &quot;women of integrity and strong character&quot; who were &quot;struggling for liberation, fighting for their own survival.&quot;
Her 1960 novel &quot;Mistress of Mellyn&quot; single-handedly revived the Gothic romance genre. Many women started writing their own gothic romances. Even male authors like Tom E. Huff and Julian Fellowes succumbed to the trend and wrote romances under female pseudonyms.

&quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novels became best-sellers. In 1970, when gothic mania was at its peak, &quot;The Secret Woman&quot; became one of the top 10 best-selling books in the United States. By 1975, a &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; paperback began with a first printing of 800,000 copies.

By the early 1970s gothic novels outsold all other genres in paperback fiction, including mysteries, science fiction and Westerns. This coincided with consolidation within the publishing industry where paperbacks and hardcover publishers were brought together under the same corporate parent for the first time. More sophisticated marketing efforts led to placement in grocery and drugstore checkout aisles, where they found their target audience: educated, middle-class women with a reading habit.

Hibbert&#x27;s romance novels were clean; at the most the main characters exchanged smouldering looks of longing. However, by 1969 the sexual revolution had made explicit description more acceptable. In April 1972, the romance novel &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot; took advantage of this change in trend and revolutionized the historical romance genre by detailing physical intimacy between the protagonists. Another such novel, &quot;Sweet Savage Love&quot;, that followed in 1974 cemented the trend. A new genre was thus born, dubbed the &#x27;sweet savage romance&#x27; or the &#x27;bodice ripper&#x27; because of the heaving, partly exposed bosom often pictured on the cover.

Interest in Hibbert&#x27;s clean romances declined. In 1976, a critic complained that Victoria Holt&#x27;s heroines &quot;must be a little bit dumb or they won&#x27;t get themselves into such improbable messes in the first place.&quot; The next &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novel, &quot;The Devil on Horseback&quot; (1977), was described as &quot;from another era, sort of out of step with today&#x27;s style.&quot; Critics judged the books as falling &quot;short of her previous standards.&quot;

By the early 1980s, Gothic romances were no longer as popular as a decade earlier. Readers demanded more sex and adventure in their romance novels. Publishers created paperback imprints like Silhouette and Candlelight Ecstasy simply to satisfy the enormous demand for &quot;bodice rippers&quot; and &quot;hot historicals&quot;.

Bowing to the changing times, Hibbert wrote &quot;The Demon Lover&quot;, a 1982 &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; novel, in a style that borrowed several elements from the plot of &quot;Sweet Savage Love&quot;: forced seduction of a naive girl by a powerful man ending in marriage, set against a background of turmoil in war time. Critics congratulated the move: &quot;Her latest, &#x27;The Demon Lover&#x27;, is a straight romance with sexual passion, which is currently &#x27;in&#x27;. It has no suspense: the thrilling twists and turns of plot that marked her Gothic novels are no more.&quot;

Victoria Holt&#x27;s heroines left the decorous drawing rooms of Victorian England to find adventure in far more exotic locations: inside an Egyptian pyramid (&quot;The Curse of the Kings&quot;, 1973); among Chinese antiques in Hong Kong (&quot;The House of a Thousand Lanterns&quot;, 1974); down the opal mines of Australia (&quot;The Pride of the Peacock&quot;, 1976); on a tea plantation in Ceylon (&quot;The Spring of the Tiger&quot;, 1979); among lush, tropical islands off the coast of Australia (&quot;The Road to Paradise Island&quot;, 1985); in Crimea with Florence Nightingale (&quot;Secret for a Nightingale&quot;, 1986); in mutiny-filled British India (&quot;The India Fan&quot;, 1988); in a Turkish nobleman&#x27;s harem in Constantinople (&quot;The Captive&quot;, 1989); in the British colonies of South Africa (&quot;Snare of Serpents&quot;, 1990); and on a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands (&quot;The Black Opal&quot;, 1993).

In 1993, Hibbert died. In the closing years of the 20th century, &quot;Victoria Holt&quot; titles were made available in large print, audiobook and Braille formats. Translations in several European languages, Russian, Hebrew, Persian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese also appeared.
==== 21st century ====
In 2006, London publisher Harper reprinted four of Victoria Holt&#x27;s most popular titles with new covers: &quot;Mistress of Mellyn&quot; (1961), &quot;The Shivering Sands&quot; (1969), &quot;The Shadow of the Lynx&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Time of the Hunter&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1983). Foreign language translations in European languages, Japanese, Sinhalese and Thai were also published that year.

<text>Great ape personhood is a movement to extend personhood and some legal protections to the non-human members of the great ape family: bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.

Advocates include primatologists Jane Goodall and Dawn Prince-Hughes, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, philosophers Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, and legal scholar Steven Wise.

==Status==
On February 28, 2007, the parliament of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain, passed the world&#x27;s first legislation that would effectively grant legal personhood rights to all great apes. On June 25 2008, a parliamentary committee set forth resolutions urging Spain to grant the primates the right to life and liberty. If approved &quot;it will ban harmful experiments on apes and make keeping them for circuses, television commercials, or filming illegal under Spain&#x27;s penal code.&quot;

In 1992, Switzerland amended its constitution to recognize animals as &quot;beings&quot; and not &quot;things&quot;. However, in 1999 the Swiss constitution was completely rewritten, and this distinction was removed. A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 constitutional amendment, the first European Union member to do so.

New Zealand created specific legal protections for five great ape species in 1999. The use of gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans in research, testing, or teaching is limited to activities intended to benefit the animals or its species. A New Zealand animal protection group later argued the restrictions conferred weak legal rights.

Several European countries including Austria, the Netherlands, and Sweden have completely banned the use of great apes in animal testing. Austria was the first country to ban experimentation on lesser apes. Under EU Directive 2010/63/EU, the entire European Union banned great ape experimentation in 2013.

Argentina granted a captive orangutan basic rights in late 2014.

On April 20, 2015, Justice Barbara Jaffe of New York State Supreme Court ordered a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to two captive chimpanzees. The next day the ruling was amended to strike the words &quot;writ of habeas corpus&quot;.

==Advocacy==
Well-known advocates include primatologist Jane Goodall, who was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations to fight the bushmeat trade and end ape extinction; Richard Dawkins, former Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University; Peter Singer, professor of philosophy at Princeton University; and attorney and former Harvard professor Steven Wise, founder and president of the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), whose aim is to use U.S. common law on a state-by-state basis to achieve recognition of legal personhood for great apes and other self-aware, autonomous non-human animals.

In December 2013, the NhRP filed three lawsuits on behalf of four chimpanzees being held in captivity in New York State, arguing that they should be recognized as legal persons with the fundamental right to bodily liberty (i.e. not to be held in captivity) and that they are entitled to common law writs of habeas corpus and should be immediately freed and moved to sanctuaries. All three petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied, allowing for the right to appeal. The NhRP is appealing all three decisions.

Goodall&#x27;s longitudinal studies revealed the social and family life of chimps to be similar to those of human beings. Goodall describes them as individuals, and claims they relate to her as an individual member of the clan. Laboratory studies of ape language ability revealed other human traits, as did genetics, and eventually three of the great apes were reclassified as hominids.

Other studies, such as one done by Beran and Evans, indicate other qualities that humans share with non-human primates, namely the ability to self-control. In order for chimpanzees to control their impulsivity, they use self-distraction techniques similar to those that are used by children. Great apes also exhibited ability to plan as well as project &quot;oneself into the future&quot;, known as &quot;mental time travel&quot;. Such complicated tasks require self-awareness, which great apes appear to possess: &quot;the capacity that contribute to the ability to delay gratification, since a self-aware individual may be able to imagine future states of the self&quot;.

The recognition of great ape intelligence, alongside the increasing risk of great ape extinction, has led the animal rights movement to put pressure on nations to recognize apes as having limited rights and being legal &quot;persons.&quot; In response, the United Kingdom introduced a ban on research using great apes, although testing on other primates has not been limited.

Writer and lecturer Thomas Rose argues that granting legal rights to non-humans is not a new concept. He points out that in most of the world, &quot;corporations are recognized as legal persons and are granted many of the same rights humans enjoy, the right to sue, to vote, and to freedom of speech.&quot; Dawn Prince-Hughes has written that great apes meet the commonly accepted standards for personhood: &quot;self-awareness; comprehension of past, present, and future; the ability to understand complex rules and their consequences on emotional levels; the ability to choose to risk those consequences, a capacity for empathy, and the ability to think abstractly.&quot;

Gary Francione questions the concept of granting personhood on the basis of whether the animal is human-like (as some have argued) and believes sentience should be the sole criteria used to determine if an animal should enjoy basic rights. He asserts that several other animals, including mice and rats, should also be granted such rights.

==Interpretation==
Depending on the exact wording of any proposed or adopted declaration, personhood for the great apes raises questions concerning protections and obligations under national and international laws including:
* Articles 7–29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
* The 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness regarding nationality and citizenship for persons
* Provisions 4 and 5 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child

<doc id="170124" wikidata="Q898322" url="?curid=170124" title="Paul C. Doherty">
<text>Paul Charles Dominic Doherty (born 21 September 1946) is an English author, educator, lecturer and historian. He is also the Headmaster of Trinity Catholic High School in London, England. Doherty is a prolific writer, has produced dozens of historical novels and a number of nonfiction history books.

==Biography==
Doherty was born in 1946 and spent his early years in Middlesbrough. After A-levels, he went to Ushaw College, Durham for three years to study for the Catholic priesthood, which he did not pursue. He attended Liverpool University where he gained a First Class Honours Degree in History and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he received a doctorate for his thesis on Edward II. Doherty is a historian who lectures for a number of organisations, particularly on historical mysteries.

In 1981 he was appointed Headmaster at Trinity Catholic High School in Woodford Green and a role he continues to this day. In 2003 he was appointed as Interim Headteacher of King Solomon High School, after Jo Shooter left. He was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his services to education in 2011.

==Literary career==
Doherty has published several series of historical mysteries set in the Middle Ages, Classical, Greek, Ancient Egyptian and other periods. He writes both fiction and non-fiction under his own name, both as P.C. Doherty and Paul C. Doherty, as well as under the pennames Anna Apostolou, Michael Clynes, Ann Dukthas, C. L. Grace, Paul Harding, and Vanessa Alexander.

His works include &quot;The Sorrowful Mysteries of Brother Athelstan&quot;, the &quot;Hugh Corbett&quot; medieval mysteries, and the &quot;Canterbury Tales of Mystery and Murder&quot;, which are listed below. As &quot;Michael Clynes&quot;, Doherty wrote the Roger Shallot mysteries, set in the era of Henry VIII. He has written 100 published books which have been printed in multiple languages and published around much of the world.

In a Doherty interview with Michael Shankland, the latter says of Doherty: &quot;I admire how this writer can use the medium of a novel to demonstrate a deep knowledge of the complex working of early 14th-century diplomacy and espionage. Paul C. Doherty seems to be one of the few writers focusing on the Hundred Years&#x27; War who understands the importance of the relationship between England and Gascony during this era&quot;.

A review of &quot;The Horus Killings&quot; at reviewingtheevidence.com opines that Doherty maintains a balance between historical description and the action of the plot on perfect pitch. &quot;The mix is near perfect. The descriptive passages enhance the story, allowing the reader to vividly visualize an unfamiliar setting without detracting from the page-turning pace desirable in a light mystery.&quot; Harriet Klausner states in her review of this same book that &quot;Ancient historical fiction/mystery readers, especially Egyptologists, will cherish this novel.&quot;

A 2009 review by Mike Ripley, himself an acclaimed author and regular contributor to &quot;SHOTS Crime and Mystery&quot; magazine, states of Doherty&#x27;s book &quot;The Spies of Sobeck&quot;:

&quot;A very wise literary agent (and there are some) once told me that the trick with historical mysteries was to hook the reader early on with the mystery and then give them the history lesson. They know the lesson is coming but they want to be lured, almost fooled, into listening to it. Paul Doherty goes out of his way to break this rule. His latest novel and the seventh in his &#x27;Ancient Egyptian Mysteries&#x27; series, &quot;The Spies of Sobeck&quot; starts (and ends) with historical notes by the author; there&#x27;s also a map and a list of characters and their position in the hierarchy of Egypt in 1477BC. So the reader is left in no doubt that they are in for a history lesson and they get one; and it is the positive master class we have come to expect from Paul Doherty. This is history red in tooth and claw and Doherty has proved, in more than fifty novels over a variety of historical settings, that when he gives a history lesson, readers sit up straight and pay attention.&quot;

In 1998 Doherty was included in the &quot;Times&quot;″ &quot;Murder They Write: 100 masters of crime&quot; list published as a supplement to the &quot;Times&quot; on 18 April 1998. The list, compiled by book critics and authors, included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler.

He was awarded the Herodotus Award, for lifelong achievement for excellence in the writing of historical mysteries by the Historical Mystery Appreciation Society. &quot;Treason of the Ghosts&quot; was named one of &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;Best of this year&#x27;s crime novels&quot; in 2000.

==Documentaries==
The UK Channel Five documentary, &quot;The Secret Life of Elizabeth I&quot; (2006), was based on his book of the same title. It explored Doherty&#x27;s theory that Elizabeth I may have had a secret love child.

He recently appeared in a &quot;National Geographic Channel&quot; documentary, &quot;Secrets of the Virgin Queen&quot;. The documentary examines some controversial theories as to why Elizabeth never married (2011).
