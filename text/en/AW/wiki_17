<text>Sassafras is a genus of three extant and one extinct species of deciduous trees in the family Lauraceae, native to eastern North America and eastern Asia. The genus is distinguished by its aromatic properties, which have made the tree useful to humans.

== Description ==
Sassafras trees grow from tall with many slender sympodial branches and smooth, orange-brown bark or yellow bark. All parts of the plants are fragrant. The species are unusual in having three distinct leaf patterns on the same plant: unlobed oval, bilobed (mitten-shaped), and trilobed (three-pronged); the leaves are hardly ever five-lobed. Three-lobed leaves are more common in &quot;Sassafras tzumu&quot; and &quot;S. randaiense&quot; than in their North American counterparts, although three-lobed leaves often occur on &quot;S. albidum&quot;. The young leaves and twigs are quite mucilaginous and produce a citrus-like scent when crushed. The tiny, yellow flowers are generally six-petaled; &quot;S. albidum&quot; and (the extinct) &quot;S. hesperia&quot; are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees, while &quot;S. tzumu&quot; and &quot;S. randaiense&quot; have male and female flowers occurring on the same trees. The fruit is a drupe, blue-black when ripe.

The largest known sassafras tree in the world is in Owensboro, Kentucky, and is over high and in circumference.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Sassafras&quot; was first described by the Bohemian botanist Jan Presl in 1825. The name &quot;sassafras&quot;, applied by the botanist Nicolas Monardes in 1569, comes from the French . Some sources claim it originates from the Latin or : &quot;stone-breaking&quot;; &quot;rock&quot; + &quot;to break&quot;). Sassafras trees are not within the family Saxifragaceae.

Early European colonists reported that the plant was called &quot;winauk&quot; by Native Americans in Delaware and Virginia and &quot;pauane&quot; by the Timucua. Native Americans distinguished between white sassafras and red sassafras, terms which referred to different parts of the same plant but with distinct colors and uses. Sassafras was known as fennel wood (German ) due to its distinctive aroma.

=== Species ===
The genus &quot;Sassafras&quot; includes four species, three extant and one extinct. Sassafras plants are endemic to North America and East Asia, with two species in each region that are distinguished by some important characteristics, including the frequency of three-lobed leaves (more frequent in East Asian species) and aspects of their sexual reproduction (North American species being dioecious).

Taiwanese sassafras, Taiwan, is treated by some botanists in a distinct genus as &quot;Yushunia randaiensis&quot; (Hayata) Kamikoti, though this is not supported by recent genetic evidence, which shows &quot;Sassafras&quot; to be monophyletic.

==== North America ====

* &quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; (Nuttall) Nees – sassafras, white sassafras, red sassafras, or silky sassafras, eastern North America, from southernmost Ontario, Canada through the eastern United States, south to central Florida, and west to southern Iowa and East Texas, formerly, Wisconsin
* †&quot;Sassafras hesperia&quot; (Berry) – western North American, from the Eocene Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington and British Columbia; extinct, known only from fossils.

==== East Asia ====
* &quot;Sassafras tzumu&quot; (Hemsl.) Hemsl. – Chinese sassafras or tzumu, central and southwestern China
* &quot;Sassafras randaiense&quot; (Hayata) Rehd. – Taiwan

== Distribution and habitat ==
Many Lauraceae are aromatic, evergreen trees or shrubs adapted to high rainfall and humidity, but the genus &quot;Sassafras&quot; is deciduous. Deciduous sassafras trees lose all of their leaves for part of the year, depending on variations in rainfall. In deciduous tropical Lauraceae, leaf loss coincides with the dry season in tropical, subtropical and arid regions.

Sassafras is commonly found in open woods, along fences, or in fields. It grows well in moist, well-drained, or sandy loam soils and tolerates a variety of soil types, attaining a maximum in southern and wetter areas of distribution.

&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; ranges from southern Maine and southern Ontario west to Iowa, and south to central Florida and eastern Texas, in North America. &quot;S. tzumu&quot; may be found in Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, China. &quot;S. randaiense&quot; is native to Taiwan.

== Ecology ==

The leaves, bark, twigs, stems, and fruits are eaten by birds and mammals in small quantities. For most animals, sassafras is not consumed in large enough quantities to be important, although it is an important deer food in some areas. Carey and Gill rate its value to wildlife as fair, their lowest rating. Sassafras leaves and twigs are consumed by white-tailed deer and porcupines. Other sassafras leaf browsers include groundhogs, marsh rabbits, and American black bears. Rabbits eat sassafras bark in winter. American beavers will cut sassafras stems. Sassafras fruits are eaten by many species of birds, including bobwhite quail, eastern kingbirds, great crested flycatchers, phoebes, wild turkeys, gray catbirds, northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, downy woodpeckers, thrushes, vireos, and northern mockingbirds. Some small mammals also consume sassafras fruits.

==Toxicity==
Sassafras oil contains safrole, which may have a carcinogenic effect.

==Uses==
All parts of sassafras plants, including roots, stems, twig leaves, bark, flowers, and fruit, have been used for culinary, medicinal, and aromatic purposes, both in areas where they are endemic and in areas where they were imported, such as Europe. The wood of sassafras trees has been used as a material for building ships and furniture in China, Europe, and the United States, and sassafras played an important role in the history of the European colonization of the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries. Sassafras twigs have been used as toothbrushes and fire starters.

===Culinary===
&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; is an important ingredient in some distinct foods of the US. It has been the main ingredient in traditional root beers and sassafras root teas, and the ground leaves of sassafras are a distinctive additive in Louisiana&#x27;s Cajun cuisine. Sassafras is used in filé powder, a common thickening and flavoring agent in Louisiana gumbo. Methods of cooking with sassafras combine this ingredient native to America with traditional North American and European culinary techniques; they contribute to the unique Creole cuisine, which is heavily influenced by the blend of cultures in Louisiana and other states along the Gulf coast.

Sassafras, once a key ingredient in commercial American root beers, is no longer used, as its oil was banned in 1960 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all commercially mass-produced foods and medications. The FDA&#x27;s directive was in response to health concerns about the carcinogenicity of safrole, a major constituent of sassafras oil, in animal studies.

Sassafras leaves and flowers have also been used in salads, and to flavor fats or cure meats. The young twigs can also be eaten fresh or dried. Additionally, the subterranean portion of the plant can be peeled, dried and boiled to make tea.

===Traditional medicine===

Numerous Native American tribes used the leaves of sassafras to treat wounds by rubbing the leaves directly into a wound and used different parts of the plant for many medicinal purposes such as treating acne, urinary disorders, and sicknesses that increased body temperature, such as high fevers. East Asian types of sassafras such as &quot;S. tzumu&quot; (chu mu) and &quot;S. randaiense&quot; (chu shu) are used in Chinese medicine to treat rheumatism and trauma. Some modern researchers conclude that the oil, roots and bark of sassafras have analgesic and antiseptic properties. Different parts of the sassafras plant (including the leaves and stems, the bark, and the roots) have been used to treat scurvy, skin sores, kidney problems, toothaches, rheumatism, swelling, menstrual disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, bronchitis, hypertension, and dysentery. It is also used as a fungicide, dentifrice, rubefacient, diaphoretic, perfume, carminative and sudorific. Before the twentieth century, Sassafras enjoyed a great reputation in the medical literature, but became valued for its power to improve the flavor of other medicines.

Sassafras root was an early export from North America, as early as 1609.

Sassafras wood and oil were both used in dentistry. Early toothbrushes were crafted from sassafras twigs or wood because of its aromatic properties. Sassafras was also used as an early dental anesthetic and disinfectant.

=== Wood ===
&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; is often grown as an ornamental tree for its unusual leaves and aromatic scent. Outside of its native area, it is occasionally cultivated in Europe and elsewhere. The durable and beautiful wood of sassafras plants has been used in shipbuilding and furniture-making in North America, in Asia, and in Europe (once Europeans were introduced to the plant). Sassafras wood was also used by Native Americans in the southeastern United States as a fire-starter because of the flammability of its natural oils found within the wood and the leaves.

=== Oil and aroma ===
Steam distillation of dried root bark produces an essential oil which has a high safrole content, as well as significant amounts of varying other chemicals such as camphor, eugenol (including 5-methoxyeugenol), asarone, and various sesquiterpenes. Many other trees contain similarly high percentages and their extracted oils are sometimes referred to as sassafras oil, which once was extensively used as a fragrance in perfumes and soaps, food and for aromatherapy. Safrole is a precursor for the clandestine manufacture of the drugs MDA and MDMA, and as such, sales and import of sassafras oil (as a safrole-containing mixture of above-threshold concentration) are heavily restricted in the US.

Sassafras oil has also been used as a natural insect or pest deterrent, and in liqueurs (such as the opium-based Godfrey&#x27;s Cordial), and in homemade liquor to mask strong or unpleasant smells. Sassafras oil has also been added to soap and other toiletries. It is banned in the United States for use in commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA as a potential carcinogen.

===Commercial use===
For a more detailed description of uses by indigenous peoples of North America, and a history of the commercial use of &quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; by Europeans in the United States in the 16th and 17th centuries, see the article on the extant North American species of sassafras, &quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;.

In modern times, the sassafras plant has been grown and harvested for the extraction of sassafras oil. It is used in a variety of commercial products or their syntheses, such as the insecticide synergistic compound piperonyl butoxide. These plants are primarily harvested for commercial purposes in Asia and Brazil.

<doc id="168037" wikidata="Q188886" url="?curid=168037" title="Station wagon">
<text>A station wagon (US, also wagon) or estate car (UK, also estate) is an automotive body-style variant of a sedan with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate, or tailgate), instead of a trunk/boot lid. The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design—to include an A, B, and C-pillar, as well as a D-pillar. Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.

The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; defines a station wagon as &quot;an automobile with one or more rows of folding or removable seats behind the driver and no luggage compartment but an area behind the seats into which suitcases, parcels, etc., can be loaded through a tailgate.&quot;

When a model range includes multiple body styles, such as sedan, hatchback, and station wagon, the models typically share their platform, drivetrain, and bodywork forward of the A-pillar, and usually the B-pillar. In 1969, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; said, &quot;Station wagon-style ... follows that of the production sedan of which it is the counterpart. Most are on the same wheelbase, offer the same transmission and engine options, and the same comfort and convenience options.&quot;

Station wagons have evolved from their early use as specialized vehicles to carry people and luggage to and from a train &quot;station&quot;. The demand for station wagon body style has faded since the 2010s in favor of the crossover or SUV designs.

== Name ==
Reflecting the original purpose of transporting people and luggage between country estates and train stations, the station wagon body style is called an &quot;estate car&quot; or &quot;estate&quot; in the United Kingdom or a &quot;wagon&quot; in Australia and New Zealand.

Either horse-drawn or automotive, the earliest use of the station wagon description would be considered to describe utility vehicles or light trucks. The depot hackney or taxi, often on a Model T chassis with an exposed wood body, most often found around railroad stations, was the predecessor of the station wagon body style in the United States. These early models with exposed wooden bodies became known as woodies. By the 1920s the status of the station wagon description changed to consider them as vehicles for passengers.

In Germany, the term &quot;Kombi&quot; is used, which is short for &quot;Kombinationskraftwagen&quot; (&quot;combination motor vehicle&quot;). &quot;Kombi&quot; is also the term used in Poland.

In Russia and some Post-Soviet countries, this type of car is called &quot;universal&quot;.

Manufacturers may designate station wagons across various model lines with a proprietary nameplate for marketing and advertising differentiation. Examples include &quot;Avant&quot;, &quot;Break&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Kombi&quot;, &quot;Sports Tourer&quot;, &quot;Sports Wagon&quot;, &quot;Tourer&quot;, &quot;Touring&quot;, and &quot;Variant&quot;.

==Design characteristics==
===Comparison with hatchbacks===
Station wagons and hatchbacks have in common a two-box design configuration, a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo as well as a hatch or rear door (often called a tailgate in the case of a station wagon) that is hinged at roof level. Folding rear seats designed to provide a larger space for cargo in place of passenger capacity, are also typical features for station wagons and hatchbacks.

Distinguishing features between hatchbacks and station wagons include:
* D-pillar: Station wagons are more likely to have a D-pillar (hatchbacks and station wagons both have A-, B-, and C-pillars).
* Cargo volume: Station wagons prioritize passenger and cargo volume—with windows beside the cargo volume. Of the two body styles, a station wagon roof (viewed in profile) more likely extends to the very rearmost of the vehicle, enclosing a full-height cargo volume—a hatchback design (especially a liftback version) is likely to have steeply sloping roofline behind the B- or C-Pillar, prioritizing style over interior volume or cargo capacity, sometimes having a shorter rear overhang and smaller side windows (or no windows at all).

Other differences are more variable and can potentially include:
*Cargo floor contour: A station wagon often has a fold-flat floor (for increased cargo capacity), whereas a hatchback is more likely to have a cargo floor with a pronounced contour.
*Seating: Some station wagons have three rows of seats, whereas a hatchback will have two at most. The rearmost row of seating in a station wagon is often located in the cargo area and can be front-facing, rear-facing, or side-facing.
*Rear suspension: A station wagon may include a reconfigured rear suspension for additional load capacity and to minimize intrusion in the cargo volume.
*Rear Door: Hatchbacks usually feature a top-hinged liftgate for cargo access, with variations ranging from a two-part liftgate to a complex tailgate that can function as a full tailgate or a trunk lid. Station wagons have also been equipped with numerous tailgate configurations. Hatchbacks may be called Liftbacks when the opening area is very sloped, and the door is lifted to open. A design director from General Motors has described the difference as &quot;Where you break the roofline, at what angle, defines the spirit of the vehicle&quot;, he said. &quot;You could have a 90-degree break in the back and have a station wagon.&quot;

It has become common for station wagons to use a platform shared with other body styles, resulting in many shared components (such as chassis, engine, transmission, bodywork forward of the A-pillar, interior features, and optional features) being used for the wagon, sedan, and hatchback variants of the model range.

===Tailgate designs===
Many modern station wagons have an upward-swinging, full-width, full-height rear door supported on gas springs—often where the rear window can swing up independently. A variety of other designs have been employed in the past.

==== Split gate ====
The split gate features an upward-swinging window and a downward-swinging tailgate, both manually operated. This configuration was typical in the 1920s through the 1940s, and remained common on many models into the 1960s.

====Retractable window====
In the early 1950s, tailgates with hand-cranked roll-down rear windows began to appear. Later in the decade, electric power was applied to the tailgate window so it could be operated from the driver&#x27;s seat and by a key-activated switch in the tailgate. By the early 1970s, this arrangement was available on full-size, intermediate, and compact wagons. The lowered bottom hinged tailgate extended the cargo area floor and could serve as a picnic table for &quot;tailgating.&quot; 
* Side hinge: A side-hinged tailgate that opened like a door was offered on some three-seat station wagons to make it easier for the back-row passengers to enter and exit their rear-facing seats. 

====Retractable roof====
A station wagon design featuring a retractable rear roof section and a conventional rear tailgate with a window that rolled down and the gate opened down. The sliding roof section allowed the carrying of tall objects in the rear cargo area. This configuration appeared on the 1963–1966 Studebaker Wagonaire station wagon and the 1998-2009 GMC Envoy XUV SUV model.

====Dual and tri-operating gates====
In the United States, Ford&#x27;s full-size station wagons for 1966 introduced a system marketed as &quot;Magic Doorgate&quot;—a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass, where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open on a side hinge—with the rear window retracted in either case. Competitors marketed their versions as a &quot;Drop and Swing&quot; or &quot;Dual Action Tailgate.&quot; For 1969, Ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the door pivoted open on its side hinge, marketing the system, engineered by Donald N. Frey as the &quot;Three-Way Magic Doorgate&quot;. 

Similar configurations became the standard feature on full-size and intermediate station wagons from General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and American Motors Corporation (AMC). Some full-size GM wagons added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; a small portion of the bumper was attached to the tailgate to fill the gap. When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a &quot;step&quot; to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper &quot;whole&quot;.

====Clamshell====
Full-size General Motors, from 1971 through 1976 station wagons (Chevrolet Kingswood, Townsman, Brookwood, Bel Air, Impala, and Caprice Estates; Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari; Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and the Buick Estate models) featured a &#x27;clam shell&#x27; design marketed as the &quot;Glide-away&quot; tailgate, also called a &quot;disappearing&quot; tailgate because when open, the tailgate was entirely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered below the load floor. Manually operated types included a lower tailgate counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open. It required a push to lower the gate. Raising it required a pull on a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate. Power-assisted operation of both the upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years. Station wagons with this design were available with an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat. They could accommodate sheets of plywood or other panels with the rear seats folded. The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open the cargo area. This enabled access even if the station wagon&#x27;s rear was parked against a wall. 

The GM design, as used in a Pontiac Grand Safari, with a forward-facing third-row seat and the clamshell tailgate, was less popular with consumers and was described as the &quot;least convenient of all wagon arrangements&quot; with difficult passenger egress and problematic tailgate operation in comparison to the 1974 AMC Ambassador, Dodge Monaco, and Mercury Colony Park, full-size station wagons conducted by &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine.
Subsequent GM full-size wagons reverted to the door/gate system for its full-size wagons.

====Lift-gate====
A simplified, one-piece lift-gate on smaller wagons. The AMC Hornet Sportabout was introduced for the 1972 model year and featured a &quot;liftgate-style hatchback instead of swing-out or fold-down tailgate ... would set a precedent for liftgates in modern SUVs.&quot; The 1978-1996 GM&#x27;s mid-size station wagons also returned to the upward-lifting rear window/gate as had been used in the 1940s.
* Swing-up window: An upward-lifting, full-height, full-width rear door, where the window on the rear door can be opened independently from the rear door itself. The window is also opened upwards and is held on pneumatic struts. The Renault Laguna II station wagon and Ford Taurus wagon featured this arrangement.
* Fold-up license plate: Wagons (including the Volvo Amazon wagon, early models of the Range Rover, and the Subaru Baja) had an upward folding hinged license plate attached to the lower tailgate of the split rear door. When the tailgate was folded down, the plate hung down and remained readable. The wagon versions of the Citroën DS, called the Break, Familiale, or Safari, had a different solution: two number plates were fitted to the tailgate at right angles to each other so one would be visible in either position.

===Safety equipment===
Cargo barriers may be used to prevent unsecured cargo from causing injuries in the event of sudden deceleration, collision, or a rollover.

=== Performance models ===
Performance models of station wagons have included the 1970 Ford Falcon (XY) &#x27;Grand Sport&#x27; pack, the 1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS-454 and the 1992 BMW M5 (E34).

The 1994 Audi RS2, developed with Porsche, has been described as the world&#x27;s first performance station wagon. This was followed by the Audi RS4 and Audi RS6.

The 2006 through 2008 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 model brought power and performance with station wagon features. The cars featured a 6.1 L Hemi V8 engine rated at . The Dodge Magnum SRT-8 shared its platform with the Chrysler 300C Touring SRT-8, which was only sold in Europe.

Other German manufacturers have produced station wagon versions of their performance models, such as the Mercedes-AMG C63, Mercedes-AMG E63, BMW M5 (E60/E61), Volkswagen Golf R and Volkswagen Passat R36 wagons.

The Cadillac CTS-V Wagon introduced for the 2011 model year was considered the most potent production station wagon offered with a manual transmission, and the Corvette-engined version continued until 2014.

==History by country==
=== United States ===
==== 1910 to 1940: Origins and woodie wagons ====
The first station wagons were built in around 1910 by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the Ford Model T chassis. They were initially called &quot;depot hacks&quot; because they worked around train &quot;depots&quot; as &quot;hacks&quot; (short for hackney carriage, as taxicabs were then known). They also came to be known as &quot;carryalls&quot; and &quot;suburbans&quot;. Station wagons were initially considered commercial vehicles (rather than consumer automobiles) and the framing of the early station wagons was left unfinished, due to the commercial nature of the vehicles. Early station wagons were fixed-roof vehicles, but lacked the sides and glass that would generally enclose the passenger compartment, and included rudimentary benches for seating passengers. Instead of framed glass, side curtains of canvas could be unrolled. More rigid curtains could be snapped to protect passengers from outside elements. The roofs of &quot;woodie&quot; wagons were usually made of stretched canvas treated with a waterproofing dressing. The framing of the wooden bodies was sheathed in steel and coated with tinted lacquer for protection. These wooden bodies required constant maintenance: varnishes required re-coating, and expansion/contraction of the wood meant that bolts and screws needed periodic re-tightening. 

Manufacture of the wooden bodies was initially outsourced to custom coachbuilders, because the production of the all-wood bodies was very time-consuming. Eventually, car manufacturers began producing their station wagon designs. In 1922, the Essex Closed Coach became the first mass-produced car to use a steel body (in this case, a fully enclosed sedan body style). In 1923, Star (a division of Durant Motors) became the first car company to offer a station wagon assembled on its production line (using a wooden wagon body shipped in from an outside supplier). One of the first builders of wagon bodies was the Stoughton Wagon Company from Wisconsin, which began putting custom wagon bodies on the Ford Model T chassis in 1919 and by 1929 the Ford Motor Company was the biggest producer of chassis&#x27; for station wagons. Since Ford owned its own hardwood forest and mills (at the Ford Iron Mountain Plant in what is today Kingsford, Michigan in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula) it began supplying the wood components for the Model A station wagon. Also in 1929, J.T. Cantrell began supplying woodie bodies for Chrysler vehicles, which continued until 1931.

By the 1930s, station wagons had become expensive and well-equipped vehicles. When it was introduced in 1941, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country was the most expensive car in the company&#x27;s model range. The first all-steel station wagon body style was the 1935 Chevrolet Suburban. As part of the overall trend in the automotive industry, wooden bodies were superseded by all-steel bodies due to their strength, cost, and durability. The commercial vehicle status was also reflected on those vehicles&#x27; registrations For example, there were special &quot;Suburban&quot; license plates in Pennsylvania used well into the 1960s, long after station wagons became car-based.

==== 1945 to 1970: Steel-bodied station wagons ====
The first all-steel station wagon was the 1935 Chevrolet Suburban, which was built on the chassis of a panel truck. However, most station wagons were produced with wooden bodies until after World War II.

When automobile production resumed after World War II, technological advances made all-steel station wagon bodies more practical, eliminating the cost, noise, and maintenance associated with wood bodies. The first mass-produced steel-bodied station wagon was the 1946 Willys Station Wagon, based on the chassis of the Jeep CJ-2A. In 1947, Crosley introduced a steel-bodied station wagon version of the Crosley CC Four.

The first postwar station wagon to be based on a passenger car chassis was the 1949 Plymouth Suburban, which used a two-door body style. Several manufacturers produced steel and wooden-bodied station wagons concurrently for several years. For example, Plymouth continued the production of wooden-bodied station wagons until 1950. The final wooden-bodied station built in the United States was the 1953 Buick Super Estate.

By 1951, most station wagons were being produced with all-steel bodies. Station wagons experienced the highest production levels in the United States from the 1950s through the 1970s as a result of the American Mid-20th century baby boom.

The late 1950s through the mid-1960s was also the period of greatest variation in body styles, with models available without a B-pillar (called hardtop or pillarless models) or with a B-pillar, both in 2-door and 4-door variants. 

The 1956 Rambler was an all-new design, and the 4-door &quot;Cross Country&quot; featured the industry&#x27;s first station wagon hardtop. However, the pillarless models could be expensive to produce, added wind noise, and created structural issues with body torque. GM eliminated the pillarless wagon from its lineup in 1959, while AMC and Ford exited the field beginning with their 1960 and 1961 vehicles, leaving Chrysler and Dodge with the body style through the 1964 model year.

==== 1970 to 1990: Competition from minivans ====
The popularity of the station wagon—particularly full-size station wagons—in the United States was blunted by increased fuel prices caused by the 1973 oil crisis. Then, in 1983, the market for station wagons was further eroded by the Chrysler minivans, based on the K platform. While the K platform was also used for station wagon models (such as the Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries), the minivan would soon eclipse them in popularity. 

The CAFE standards provided an advantage to minivans (and later SUVs) over station wagons because the minivans and SUVs were classified as trucks in the United States and, therefore subject to less stringent fuel economy and emissions regulations. Station wagons remained popular in Europe and in locations where emissions and efficiency regulations did not distinguish between cars and light trucks.

==== 1990 to present: Competition from SUVs ====
The emergence and popularity of SUVs, which closely approximate the traditional station wagon body style, was a blow. After low sales, the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Roadmaster, the last American full-size wagons, were discontinued in 1996. Smaller station wagons were marketed as lower-priced alternatives to SUVs and minivans. Domestic wagons also remained in the Ford, Mercury, and Saturn lines. However, after 2004, these compact station wagons also began to be phased out in the United States. The Ford Taurus wagon was discontinued in 2005, and the Ford Focus station wagon was discontinued in 2008. An exception to this trend was the Subaru Legacy and Subaru Outback station wagon models, which continue to be produced at the Subaru of Indiana plant. With other brands, the niche previously occupied by station wagons is now primarily filled with a similar style of Crossover SUV, which generally has a car underpinning and a wagon body.

Imported station wagons, despite remaining popular in other countries, struggled in the United States. European car manufacturers such as Audi, Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz continued to offer station wagons in their North American product ranges (marketed using the labels &quot;Avant&quot;, &quot;Touring&quot;, and &quot;Estate&quot; respectively). However, these vehicles had fewer trim and power train levels than their sedan counterparts. The Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG in Estate trim is a performance station wagon offered in the U.S. market. The station wagon variants of the smaller Mercedes-Benz C-Class line-up were dropped in 2007, and the BMW 5 Series Touring models were discontinued in 2010 due to slow sales in the United States, with only 400 wagons sold in 2009. In 2012, the Volvo V50 compact station wagon was withdrawn from the U.S. market due to poor sales.

The Cadillac CTS gave rise to a station wagon counterpart, the 2010 CTS Sportwagon, which defied the trend by offering almost as many trim levels as its sedan counterpart. The CTS wagon, particularly in the performance CTS-V trim, received positive reviews until it was discontinued in 2014.

In 2011, the Toyota Prius V introduced hybrid power to the compact wagon market, but was discontinued in 2017 to streamline the Toyota hybrid lineup and focus on the RAV4 Hybrid Crossover SUV.

The 2015 VW Golf &quot;Sportwagen&quot; was marketed as a sub-compact station wagon in the North American market. This model was withdrawn from the U.S. market after 2019.

In 2016, Volvo reintroduced a large wagon to the U.S. market with the Volvo V90, but only by special order.

==== Simulated wood paneling ====
As the wooden bodies were replaced by steel from 1945 until 1953, manufacturers applied wooden decorative trim to the steel-bodied wagons as a visual link to the previous wooden style. By the late 1950s, the wooden trim was replaced by &quot;simulated wood&quot; in the form of stick-on vinyl coverings. The woodgrain feature is not that the body is wood—or that it could ever be wood—rather, it is &quot;totally honest in its artificiality.&quot;

The design element was also used on cars that were not station wagons, including sedans, pickup trucks, and convertibles. 

Unique simulated wood designs included trim on the body pillars of the compact-size Nash Rambler station wagons that went up the roof&#x27;s drip rail and around on the spit liftgate. The larger-sized Cross Country station wagon was available with bodyside wood trim that went unbroken up the C and D pillars to a thin strip on the roof above the side windows.

Ford marketing began using “Country Squire” with the 1950 model year for the station wagon body design. From 1950 through 1991, their simulated wood trim differentiated the Ford Country Squire station wagon models from the lower trim versions. The &quot;Squire&quot; trim level was an available option in a few different Ford model ranges, including the Falcon Squire, Fairlane Squire, and the 1970s the Pinto Squire. The Squire was the highest trim level of any Ford Wagon and included additional exterior and better interior trims.

Other woodie-style wagon models produced in significant numbers include the 1984 through 1993 Jeep Grand Wagoneer that launched the luxury SUV market segment. Simulated wood-grain trim differentiated the top level models of the 1957-1991 Mercury Colony Park, 1968–1988 Chrysler Town &amp; Country, 1970–1990 Buick Estate, 1971–1992 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and 1969–1972 Chevrolet Kingswood Estate.

==== Full-size wagons ====
From the 1950s until the 1990s, many full-size American station wagons could be optioned with a third row of seating in the cargo area (over the rear axle) for a total of nine seats. Before 1956, the third-row seats were forward-facing.

Chrysler&#x27;s 1957 models had a roof too low to permit a forward-facing seat in the cargo area, so a rear-facing seat was used for the third row.

General Motors adopted the rear-facing third row for most models during 1959-1971 and 1977–1996. However, the 1964–1972 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser and 1964–1969 Buick Sport Wagon featured raised roof lines beginning above the second-row seat and continuing to the rear tailgate, resulting in the third row of seats being forward-facing. General Motors also used forward-facing seats for the third row from 1971 through 1976 clam shell wagons.

The Ford and Mercury full-size wagons built after 1964 were available with four rows of seats, with the rear two rows in the cargo area facing each other. The third and fourth rows were designed for two people each (although these seats were relatively narrow in later models), giving a total seating capacity of ten people.

The trend since the 1980s for smaller station wagon bodies has limited the seating to two rows, resulting in a total capacity of five people, or six people, if a bench front seat is used. Since the 1990s, full-size station wagons have been largely replaced by SUVs with three-row seating, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Land Rover Defender 130 and the Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class, and BMW X7.

==== Two-door wagons ====
The first two-door station wagon was the 1946 Willys Jeep Station Wagon. Other early two-door station wagons were the 1951 Nash Rambler and the 1954 Studebaker Conestoga. In 1956, Studebaker introduced three new two-door wagons in Pelham, Parkview, and Pinehurst trims.

General Motors began producing two-door station wagons in 1955 with the &quot;Chevrolet Handyman&quot; and the &quot;Pontiac Chieftain&quot;. General Motors also introduced the sportier Chevrolet Nomad and Pontiac Safari to their lineup in 1955. Ford began production of steel-bodied two-door station wagons in 1952 with the Ford Ranch Wagon. In 1956, Ford responded to the Nomad and Safari with the two-door wagon, the Ford Parklane. This was a one-year-only model, succeeded by the Ford Del Rio in 1957.

After the merger of Nash and Hudson, the new company, American Motors (AMC), reintroduced the two-door wagon in the &quot;new&quot; Rambler American line in 1958. It was &quot;recycling&quot; with only a few modifications from the original version and targeted buyers looking for &quot;no-frills&quot; economy. American Motors&#x27; strategy of reintroducing an old design made for two distinct model runs, one of few examples where such a strategy has been successful for an automobile manufacturer.

The Chevrolet Vega Kammback, introduced in September 1970, was the first U.S.-made four-seat wagon and the first two-door wagon from GM in six years. It shared its wheelbase and length with Vega coupe versions and was produced in the 1971 through 1977 model years.

American Motors offered a two-door wagon version of the AMC Pacer from 1977 through 1980. The wagon embodied all the features and handling of the coupe, including the wheelbase, while only longer and increasing cargo capacity to with the rear seat down.

The last two-door wagon available marketed in the United States, the Geo Storm was the 1991 and 1992 &quot;Wagonback&quot;, featuring a long roof and a rear hatch in place of the sloping liftback versions.

===United Kingdom===

==== 1930s to 1950s ====
Early estate cars were after-market conversions, with the new bodywork using a wooden frame and either steel or wooden panels. These wooden-bodied cars, produced until the 1960s, were among the most expensive vehicles. Since the 1930s, the term shooting-brake (originally a term for hunting vehicles) has been an alternative, if now rarely used, to the term for estates in the UK.

Later, estates were produced by vehicle manufacturers and included the 1937 Commer (based on the Hillman Minx Magnificent) designed for &quot;operators requiring reliable light transport units&quot; and the chassis for the Supervan &quot;multipurpose utility vehicle, primarily designed for estate transport ... seating accommodation for five persons and the driver ... being quickly convertible to carry anything from hunting equipment to farm produce.&quot; Others included the 1952 Morris Minor Traveller, 1952 Morris Oxford Traveller, 1954 Hillman Husky, 1954 Austin A30 Countryman and 1955 Ford Squire. Most of these models were two-door estates, and several models were built on the chassis of relatively small cars.

Manufacturers often chose a specific model name to apply to all their estate cars as a marketing exercise - for example, Austin used the Countryman name, and Morris called it Traveller. Some estates were closely derived from existing commercial van models, such as the Austin A30/35 Countryman and the Hillman Husky. Others included the Austin Cambridge Countryman and the Standard Ten Companion.

Rover and Austin produced 4×4 canvas-topped utility vehicles in the 1950s that were available in estate body styles sold as &quot;Station Wagons&quot;. They incorporated better seating and trim than standard editions with options such as heaters. Early advertising for the Land Rover version took the name literally, showing the vehicle collecting people and goods from a railway station.

Despite the popularity of station wagons in America, estate offerings in the U.K. from Ford and Vauxhall were limited to factory-approved aftermarket conversions of the Ford Consul and Vauxhall Cresta until the factory-built Vauxhall Victor wagon was introduced in 1958.

==== 1960s to 1970s ====
One of the smallest estates ever produced was the Morris Mini Traveller / Austin Mini Countryman, introduced in 1960.
Ford&#x27;s first factory-built estate was the 1963 Ford Cortina.

The 1967 Hillman Husky station wagon version of the Hillman Imp was unusual in being a rear-engined estate.

Ford and Vauxhall produced factory-built estate variants of all three of their respective core models (small-, family- and large-size cars) by the 1970s. The FD- and FE-Series Vauxhall Victors, built between 1966 and 1978, were large cars and featured estate models in the style of an American station wagon with front and rear bench seats and large-capacity petrol engines.

Other estates sold in the United Kingdom included the Morris 1100 (introduced in 1966), Vauxhall Viva (introduced 1967), Ford Escort and Squre (introduced in 1968), and Vauxhall Chevette (introduced 1976).

==== 1980s to present ====

In the decades following, Vauxhall has produced the Astra family car from 1980 continuing till now in estate form, as well as other estate versions of larger cars such as the Cavalier, replaced in 1995 by the Vectra which itself was replaced in 2008 by the Insignia, staying in production till 2022. The second generation Insignia was also made in Country Tourer form, a slightly raised crossover version of the standard Insignia Sports Tourer. Between 1978 and 2003, they also sold estate versions of two executive cars, the Carlton and the Omega. Vauxhall also produced the Signum in the mid-2000s as an executive take on a Vectra estate, and it was only available in such a body style; the Insignia VXR, a high-performance variant of the Insignia available in its first generation could also be had as an estate, with a V6 engine producing 321 bhp.
Ford made a variety of estates, such as the Focus estate from 1998 that replaced the Escort, as well as the estate version of the family car Mondeo (1992-2022, which itself replaced the Sierra&#x27;s estate variant made by Ford of Britain. 

Jaguar produced the X-Type as an estate during the early 2000s, while the larger XF Sportbrake, produced from 2012, and the second generation, were available estate body style. The first generation had a &#x27;floating roof&#x27; appearance as its D-pillars were blended with the rear and side windows to make it look like glass. The XFR-S was available with a 5.0 L supercharged V8, while the latter generation&#x27;s most powerful engine was a 3.0 L supercharged V6.

The Mini Clubman, made from 2007 until 2024 in Oxford, is an estate car made unique by having a split side-opening tailgate across both generations and a shooting brake body style in its first, with a small rearward-opening door on its right-hand side for rear seat access. The second generation was available in the high-performance John Cooper Works trim with up to .

MG marketed the MG5 EV - a rebadged Roewe Ei5, made in China - solely as an estate in the United Kingdom, the first estate since the brand&#x27;s rebirth. Previously, MG sold the ZT, a badge-engineered Rover 75. This large family car also had the faster ZT-T version, a modified version of which, with over 800 bhp, gained the World&#x27;s Fastest (non-production) Estate Car title in September 2003, with a top speed of . Before its discontinuation, Rover produced various estate cars: the aforementioned 75, also sold in V8 form, and the Rover 400 in the 1990s. 


===Germany===
Germany is the largest market for station wagons in the world, with around 600,000 to 700,000 vehicles sold each year—amounting to 20% of all car sales. German-designed station wagons have been produced by Audi, BMW, Borgward, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, and Volkswagen. Some larger models are available with a third row of seats, such as the rear-facing jump seat for two passengers in the cargo area of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon.

In 1961, Volkswagen introduced the two-door &quot;Variant&quot; body style of the Volkswagen Type 3 (also known as the Volkswagen 1500—later the Volkswagen 1600). The Type 3&#x27;s rear-engine layout was retained for the station wagon models, but the engine profile was flattened, resulting in a small car with interior room and trunk space in the front. The model was offered through the 1973 model year.

Station wagons produced in East Germany include the 1956–1965 Wartburg 311/312/313, the 1963–1990 Trabant 601 Universal, and the 1966–1988 Wartburg 353 Tourist.

===France===
In France, almost all station wagon models are called a &quot;Break&quot;.

The first station wagon produced by a French manufacturer was the Citroën Traction Avant Familiale model introduced in 1935. The first Peugeot station wagon was the Peugeot 203, introduced in 1950.

In 1958, the Citroën ID Break (known as the Safari in English-speaking countries) was introduced, larger than other French station wagon models and of similar size to contemporary full-size station wagons from the United States. It seated eight people, with two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in the cargo area. The &#x27;Familiale&#x27; version had a front bench seat, a forward-facing three-space bench seat in the middle, and a folding forward-facing three-seat bench in the rear, providing a versatile nine-seat car. The Citroën ID also had a two-part tailgate and a hydropneumatic suspension that allowed a self-leveling ride height and automatic brake biasing regardless of the load carried. The car could also &#x27;kneel&#x27; to the ground to facilitate loading heavy or large items. The successors to the ID, the Citroën CX and Citroën XM, continued to be among the largest station wagon cars produced in Europe. Nevertheless, the model was discontinued in 2000, and a station wagon version was unavailable for its Citroën C6 successor.

The Peugeot 404, introduced in 1960, offered a conventional large station wagon alternative to the innovative Citroëns. Its replacement, the 505 was available in both five-seat and seven-seat &#x27;Familiale&#x27; versions. As with the Citroëns, changing demands in the French car market led to the end of the large Peugeot station wagon models in the mid-1990s, with the smaller Peugeot 406 becoming the largest station wagon model in the range from 1995. Similarly to the United States, the decline of traditional Break and Familiale models in France was partly due to the introduction of the minivan in the form of the Renault Espace in 1984.

===Sweden===
The first station wagon produced in Sweden was the Volvo Duett, introduced in 1953. The Duett two-door wagon was conceived as a dual-function delivery van and people-carrier and is based on the chassis of the PV444 and PV544 sedans.

In 1962, the Volvo Duett was supplemented by a larger but lower Amazon, which has a four-door body and a horizontal split tailgate. Volvo continued production of station wagons through the Volvo 145 (introduced in 1967), then the Volvo 200 Series (introduced in 1974), and the Volvo 700 Series (introduced in 1985). In many markets, the station wagon models of the 700 Series significantly outsold the sedan models. In 1990, the 700 Series was replaced by the Volvo 900 Series, which was sold alongside the smaller Volvo 850 wagon that was introduced one year later. The 900 Series ended production in 1998, and its successor (the Volvo S80) did not include any wagon models. Volvo station wagons produced since the mid-1990s are the Volvo V40, Volvo V50, Volvo V60, Volvo V70, and Volvo V90, with the V60 and V90 models currently in production.

Saab began producing station wagons in 1959, with the Saab 95 two-door wagon, based on the Saab 93 sedan. Following a hiatus in station wagon production since the Saab 95 ended production in 1978, in 1997 the company introduced the four-door Saab 9-5 station wagon, produced until 2010. In 2005 a &#x27;Sportwagon&#x27; version of the Saab 9-3 was introduced and produced until 2011.

In 2017 station wagons accounted for 31% of all sold cars.

===Switzerland===
In 1983, station wagons represented 15% of the passenger car market, reflecting a trend throughout Europe of increasing popularity through the 1980s, with the vehicles becoming less cargo-oriented.

===Japan===
The first Japanese station wagon was the 1961 Isuzu Bellel four-door wagon, based on a compact sedan chassis. This was followed by the 1963 Mazda Familia, 1966 Toyota Corolla, 1967 Isuzu Florian, 1969 Mitsubishi Galant, 1973 Mitsubishi Lancer and 1974 Honda Civic wagons. However, Japanese manufacturers did not build station wagons in large volumes until the 1980s when the body style, along with SUVs and minivans, boomed in popularity as leisure vehicles.

Models marketed as passenger station wagons in export markets were often sold as utilitarian &quot;van&quot; models in the home market. Some were not updated in a model&#x27;s life in Japan for consecutive generations. For example, a sedan might have a model life of four years, but the wagon was not updated for up to eight years (such as the Toyota Corolla wagon built from 1979 until 1987 and the 1987–1996 Mazda Capella wagon). Station wagons remain popular in Japan, although they are in slow decline as the SUVs and minivans have taken over a large portion of this market since the 2000s, with manufacturers replacing their station wagons with equivalent hatchbacks or crossover SUVs (i.e., Subaru replaced the wagon with the hatchback for their third-generation Impreza range). Several Japanese compact MPVs such as Subaru Exiga and Toyota Prius α take elements from older station wagons while being more in line with their corresponding category.

===Korea===
South Korean manufacturers do not have a strong tradition of producing station wagons. The first station wagon by the South Korean manufacturer was released in 1995 as the Hyundai Avante Touring (Lantra Sportswagon), followed in early 1996 as the Kia Pride station wagon. Daewoo Motors followed a year later with the first-generation Nubira.

South Korean manufacturer Kia produces both the Cee&#x27;d and Optima station wagons designated as Sportswagons with sister company Hyundai offering station wagon versions of the i30 and i40.

===Australia===
The first Australian-designed car was built in 1948, but locally designed station wagons did not appear until nine years later when the 1957 Holden FE was introduced. Holden&#x27;s main competitor, the Ford Falcon (XK) introduced wagon models in 1960.

Ford and Holden produced wagon models based on each generation of their large sedans until 2010. Other wagons produced in Australia include the smaller Toyota Camry and Mitsubishi Magna. The Ford and Holden wagons were usually built on a longer wheelbase than their sedan counterparts until the introduction of the Holden Commodore (VE), which switched to sharing the sedan&#x27;s wheelbase.

Ford ceased production of wagons in Australia when the Ford Falcon (BF) ended production in 2010, primarily due to the declining station wagon and large car market, but also following the 2004 introduction and sales success of the Ford Territory SUV. Production of wagons in Australia ceased in 2017 when the Holden Commodore (VF) ended production.

<text>Harold Stephen Black (April 14, 1898 – December 11, 1983) was an American electrical engineer, who revolutionized the field of applied electronics by inventing the negative feedback amplifier in 1927. To some, his invention is considered the most important breakthrough of the twentieth century in the field of electronics, since it has a wide area of application. This is because all electronic devices (vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors and MOS transistors) are inherently nonlinear, but they can be made substantially linear with the application of negative feedback. Negative feedback works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity (or in other words, smaller distortion/intermodulation). By sacrificing gain, it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier. However, a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate. Once the stability problem is solved, the negative feedback amplifier is extremely useful in the field of electronics. Black published a famous paper, &quot;Stabilized feedback amplifiers&quot;, in 1934.

== Biography ==
He was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1898. He went to Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) for his first degree. Subsequently, he received a B.S.S. in Electrical Engineering from WPI in 1921 and then joined Western Electric, which was the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T. He joined Bell Labs (1925), where he was a member of technical staff until his retirement (1963).

Black started writing his autobiography with the tentative title &quot;Before the ferry docked&quot;. However, he died in December 1983 at age 85 before he could finish it.

== Work ==
Amplifiers are unavoidably non-linear. Therefore, every time a signal is amplified in a telecommunications network, which can happen dozens of times in a circuit, noise and distortion are added. Black first invented the feed-forward amplifier which compares the input and output signals and then negatively amplifies the distortion and combines the two signals, canceling out some of the distortion. This amplifier design improved, but did not solve, the problems of transcontinental telecommunication.

After years of work Black invented the negative feedback amplifier which uses negative feedback to reduce the gain of a high-gain, non-linear amplifier and makes it act as a low-gain, linear amplifier with much lower noise and distortion. The Negative feedback amplifier allowed Bell system to reduce overcrowding of lines and extend its long-distance network by means of carrier telephony. It enabled the design of accurate fire-control systems in World War II, and it formed the basis of early operational amplifiers, as well as precise, variable-frequency audio oscillators.

According to Black he got his inspiration to invent the negative feedback amplifier when he was traveling from New Jersey to New York City by taking a ferry to cross the Hudson River in August 1927. Having nothing to write on he sketched his thoughts on a misprinted page of the New York Times and then signed and dated it. At that time, Bell Laboratories headquarters were located in 463 West Street, Manhattan, New York City instead of New Jersey and he lived in New Jersey such that he took the ferry every morning to go to work.

Fifty years after his 1927 invention, he published an article in IEEE Spectrum regarding the historical background of his invention. He published a classical paper on negative feedback amplifier in 1934, which has been re-printed in the Proceedings of IEEE two times in 1984 and 1999 Inside his 1934 classical paper &quot;Stabilized feed-back amplifiers&quot;, he mentioned Harry Nyquist&#x27;s work on stability criterion because a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable and oscillate. Thus, with the help of Nyquist&#x27;s theory, he managed to demonstrate a stable negative feedback amplifier which can be used in reality. Bernard Friedland wrote an introduction for the 1999 re-print in Proc. IEEE. James E. Brittain wrote about him in 1997.
An obituary regarding Black was published by IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control in 1984.

He also worked on pulse-code modulation and wrote a book on &quot;Modulation Theory&quot; (Van Nostrand, 1953). He held many patents the most famous of which was US Patent 2,102,671 &quot;Wave Translation System&quot;, which was issued to Bell Laboratories in 1937, covering the negative feedback amplifier.

<text>Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow is the debut studio album by American/British rock band Rainbow, released in 1975.

==Recording==
During studio sessions in Tampa Bay, Florida on 12 December 1974, Blackmore originally planned to record the solo single &quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot;- a cover of a track by the band Quatermass from 1970 – and the newly composed &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot;, which was to be the B-side.
Other musicians involved included singer/lyricist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Gary Driscoll of blues rock band Elf, and cellist Hugh McDowell of ELO. Satisfied with the two tracks, Blackmore decided to extend the sessions to a full album.

The other members of Elf, keyboardist Micky Lee Soule and bassist Craig Gruber, were used for the recording of the album in Musicland Studios in Munich, West Germany during February and March, 1975. Though it was originally planned to be a solo album, the record was billed as &quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, and later progressed as a new band project. Blackmore and Dio did promotional work for the album. While rehearsing for the tour, Blackmore decided to fire Gruber and bring in Jimmy Bain on bass, and after that he fired Driscoll. As a consequence of that, Soule decided to quit the band to play on a Roger Glover album and tour with the Ian Gillan Band. This first line-up never performed live, and the live photos used in the album art are of Blackmore while with Deep Purple and of Elf playing live.

The last track of the album, &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot;, is an instrumental cover of a song by the Yardbirds from their 1965 album &quot;Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds&quot;. A version featuring vocals subsequently appeared on Rainbow&#x27;s live album &quot;On Stage&quot; and their 1995 studio album &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot;.

==Release==
The original vinyl release had a gate-fold sleeve, although the later budget re-issue on Polydor was reduced to a single sleeve. On the cassette version of the album, Side One features the last five tracks, while Side Two plays the first four. On the case insert and on the cassette itself, &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot; is written as &quot;Sixteen Century Greensleeves&quot;.

&quot;Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was re-issued on CD in re-mastered form in the US in April 1999. The European release followed later in the year.

Vocalist Ronnie James Dio considered this release his favourite Rainbow album.

Despite the title implying the record being a Ritchie Blackmore solo release, in later years Blackmore has jokingly stated that Dio&#x27;s contributions warranted a re-titling of &quot;Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was praised in British contemporary reviews for its fantasy/heroic-like lyrical content and the innovative rock style. However, the reviewer for the American magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; disparaged the album, describing Blackmore&#x27;s playing &quot;listless and bored in relation to past performances&quot; and the band &quot;a completely anonymous group.&quot;

Modern reviews have a similar tenor. AllMusic reviewer wrote that the album has &quot;a few listenable tracks&quot;, with young Dio &quot;at his best when he fully gives in to his own and Blackmore&#x27;s medieval fantasy leanings in hard-rocking tracks like &#x27;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&#x27; and &#x27;Man on the Silver Mountain&#x27;&quot;, but remarked how the band became &quot;a true embarrassment when they try to lighten up and boogie down.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff noticed that on this album Blackmore &quot;confirms the creative vacuum that was much in evidence towards his last years with Purple&quot;, offering a &quot;boring, dated, diluted and largely illogical smorgasbord of guitar rock stylings, all inexpressively played over&quot;. He also criticized Martin Birch&#x27;s dull and inexpensive production, &quot;which ruins what is already a limp noodle of a record&quot; and saved only by the songs &#x27;Man on the Silver Mountain&#x27; and &#x27;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&#x27;, &quot;which approach the worthiness of &quot;Rising&quot;&quot;.

==Covers==
The album&#x27;s songs have been performed by subsequent Rainbow line-ups and covered by other bands.

* Rainbow included an updated version of &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot; on their 1995 album &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot;.
* Blackmore&#x27;s Night have released a folk rock cover version of &quot;Self Portrait&quot; on their second studio album &quot;Under a Violet Moon&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Temple of the King&quot; on 2013&#x27;s &quot;Dancer and the Moon&quot;. They also performed a live cover of &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot; (titled as &quot;16th Century Greensleeves&quot;) on their 2002 live album &quot;Past Times with Good Company&quot;.
* Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow re-recorded &quot;Black Sheep of the Family&quot; in 2019.

<doc id="168041" wikidata="Q488415" url="?curid=168041" title="Anatomical terms of location">
<text>Standard anatomical terms of location are used to describe unambiguously the anatomy of animals, including humans. The terms, typically derived from Latin or Greek roots, describe something in its standard anatomical position. This position provides a definition of what is at the front (&quot;anterior&quot;), behind (&quot;posterior&quot;) and so on. As part of defining and describing terms, the body is described through the use of anatomical planes and anatomical axes.

The meaning of terms that are used can change depending on whether an organism is bipedal or quadrupedal. Additionally, for some animals such as invertebrates, some terms may not have any meaning at all; for example, an animal that is radially symmetrical will have no anterior surface, but can still have a description that a part is close to the middle (&quot;proximal&quot;) or further from the middle (&quot;distal&quot;).

International organisations have determined vocabularies that are often used as standards for subdisciplines of anatomy. For example, &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, and &quot;Terminologia Embryologica&quot; for humans and &quot;Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria&quot; for animals. These allow parties that use anatomical terms, such as anatomists, veterinarians, and medical doctors, to have a standard set of terms to communicate clearly the position of a structure.

==Introduction==
Standard anatomical and zoological terms of location have been developed, usually based on Latin and Greek words, to enable all biological and medical scientists, veterinarians, doctors and anatomists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive. Much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans (&quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;, and &quot;Terminologia Embryologica&quot;), and for animals (&quot;Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria&quot;).

Different terms are used for groups of creatures with different body layouts, such as bipeds (creatures that stand on two feet, such as humans) and quadrupeds. The reasoning is that the neuraxis is different between the two groups, and so is what is considered the standard anatomical position, such as how humans tend to be standing upright and with their arms reaching forward. Unique terms are also used to describe invertebrates, because of their wider variety of shapes and symmetries. 

===Standard anatomical position===

Because animals can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body, terms to describe position need to refer to an animal when it is in its standard anatomical position. This means descriptions as if the organism is in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures. In humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward, with thumbs out and to the sides.
===Planes===

Anatomical terms describe structures with relation to four main anatomical planes:

# The median plane, also called the midsagittal plane, which divides the body into left and right. This passes through the head, spinal cord, navel and, in many animals, the tail.
# The sagittal planes, also called the parasagittal planes, which are to the median plane.
# The coronal plane, also called the frontal plane, which divides the body into front and back.
# The transverse plane, also called the axial plane or horizontal plane, which is perpendicular to the other two planes. In a human, this plane is parallel to the ground; in a quadruped, this divides the animal into anterior and posterior sections.

===Axes===

The axes of the body are lines drawn about which an organism is roughly symmetrical. To do this, distinct ends of an organism are chosen, and the axis is named according to those directions. An organism that is symmetrical on both sides has three main axes that intersect at right angles. An organism that is round or not symmetrical may have different axes. Example axes are:

* The anteroposterior axis
* The cephalocaudal axis
* The dorsoventral axis

Examples of axes in specific animals are shown below.
===Modifiers===
Several terms are commonly seen and used as prefixes:

* Sub- () is used to indicate something that is beneath, or something that is subordinate to or lesser than. For example, subcutaneous means beneath the skin.
* Hypo- () is used to indicate something that is beneath. For example, the hypoglossal nerve supplies the muscles beneath the tongue.
* Infra- () is used to indicate something that is within or below. For example, the infraorbital nerve runs within the orbit.
* Inter- () is used to indicate something that is between. For example, the intercostal muscles run between the ribs.
* Super-&quot; or &quot;Supra- () is used to indicate something that is above something else. For example, the supraorbital ridges are above the eyes.

Other terms are used as suffixes, added to the end of words:
* -ad () and -ab () are used to indicate that something is towards (-ad) or away from (-ab) something else. For example, &quot;distad&quot; means &quot;in the distal direction&quot;, and &quot;distad of the femur&quot; means &quot;beyond the femur in the distal direction&quot;. Further examples may include cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, and proximad.

==Main terms==

===Superior and inferior===
Superior () describes what is above something and inferior () describes what is below it. For example, in the anatomical position, the most superior part of the human body is the head and the most inferior is the feet. As a second example, in humans, the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head.

===Anterior and posterior===
Anterior () describes what is in front, and posterior () describes what is to the back of something. For example, for a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part; for many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes but anterior to the tail.
===Medial and lateral===
These terms describe how close something is to the midline, or the medial plane. Lateral () describes something to the sides of an animal, as in &quot;left lateral&quot; and &quot;right lateral&quot;. Medial () describes structures close to the midline, or closer to the midline than another structure. For example, in a human, the arms are lateral to the torso. The genitals are medial to the legs. Temporal has a similar meaning to lateral but is restricted to the head.

The terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, or sinistral and dextral, are sometimes used but more precise terms are preferred. Proper right and proper left are sometimes used such that the &quot;proper right&quot; hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.

Terms derived from lateral include:

* Contralateral (): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are controlled by the left, contralateral, side of the brain.
* Ipsilateral (): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.
* Bilateral (): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral orchiectomy means removal of testes on both sides of the body.
* Unilateral (): on one side of the body. For example, a stroke can result in unilateral weakness, meaning weakness on one side of the body.

Varus () and valgus ( ) are terms used to describe a state in which a part further away is abnormally placed towards (varus) or away from (valgus) the midline.

===Proximal and distal===


The terms proximal () and distal () are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively. Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.

&quot;Proximal and distal&quot; are frequently used when describing appendages, such as fins, tentacles, and limbs. Although the direction indicated by &quot;proximal&quot; and &quot;distal&quot; is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.

The terms are also applied to internal anatomy, such as to the reproductive tract of snails. Unfortunately, different authors use the terms in opposite senses. Some consider &quot;distal&quot; as further from a point of origin near the centre of the body and others as further from where the organ reaches the body&#x27;s surface; or other points of origin may be envisaged.

This terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.
===Dorsal and ventral===
These two terms, used in anatomy and embryology, and zoology, describe something at the back (&quot;dorsal&quot;) or front/belly (&quot;ventral&quot;) of an organism.

The dorsal () surface, (also dorsum) of an organism or organ, refers to the back, or upper side, such as in the human, the dorsum of the tongue, the dorsum of the hand, and the dorsum of the foot. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.
The ventral () surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism, or organ such as the undersurface of the tongue. 

In a fish, the dorsal fin is on the upper surface and its ventral fins (pelvic fins) are on the belly or undersurface.

The terms are used in other contexts, for example in dorsal and ventral gun turrets on a bomber aircraft.

===Rostral, cranial, and caudal===
Specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:

* Rostral () describes something situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.
* Cranial () or cephalic () describes how close something is to the head of an organism.
* Caudal () describes how close something is to the trailing end of an organism.

For example, in horses, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.

These terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine. In humans, &quot;cranial&quot; and &quot;cephalic&quot; are used to refer to the skull, with &quot;cranial&quot; being used more commonly. The term &quot;rostral&quot; is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term &quot;caudal&quot; is used more in embryology and only occasionally used in human anatomy. This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus, the &quot;rostrocaudal axis&quot; refers to a C shape (see image).

=== Combined terms ===

Many anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, anterolateral indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle), or to a named organ such as the anterolateral tibial tubercle. The term can also describe the direction and location of something that enters or courses through the body such as the anterolateral system in the spinal cord, and the anterolateral central arteries. Another term anteromedial is used for example in the anteromedial central arteries.

In chest radiography, an X-ray image may be taken from different views including the front to back view (anteroposterior), the back to the front view (posteroanterior), and the side view (lateromedial). Top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top X-ray projections are known as superoinferior (also caudal view) and inferosuperior, (also cranial view). Combined terms were once generally hyphenated, but typically the hyphen is omitted.

In the more internal brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system the terms dorsal and ventral and their combinations are often used in place of anterior and posterior. In these organs numerous references need to be used, and in the brain for example the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex can be referred to without confusion with the posterior cingulate cortex. And some termed structures can also be divided such as the anterior cingulate cortex that can be divided anatomically based on cognitive (dorsal), and emotional (ventral) components.

===Central and peripheral===
Central and peripheral refer to the distance towards and away from the centre of something. That might be an organ, a region in the body, or an anatomical structure. For example, the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous systems.

Central () describes something close to the centre. For example, the great vessels run centrally through the body; many smaller vessels branch from these.

Peripheral (, originally from Ancient Greek) describes something further away from the centre of something. For example, the arm is peripheral to the body.

===Superficial and deep===
These terms refer to the distance of a structure from the surface.

Deep () describes something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the external oblique muscle of the abdomen is deep to the skin. &quot;Deep&quot; is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from Old English rather than Latin – the anglicised Latin term would have been &quot;profound&quot; ().

Superficial () describes something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in skin, the epidermis is superficial to the subcutis.

==Other terms and special cases==
===Anatomical landmarks===
The location of anatomical structures can also be described in relation to different anatomical landmarks. They are used in anatomy, surface anatomy, surgery, and radiology.

Structures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra, depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as &quot;C4&quot;, at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra &quot;T4&quot;, and at the level of the third lumbar vertebra &quot;L3&quot;. Because the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they are not often used to provide the location.

References may also take origin from superficial anatomy, made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the anterior superior iliac spine, the medial malleolus or the medial epicondyle.

Anatomical lines are theoretical lines, used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the cardiac exam in medicine to feel the apex beat of the heart.

===Mouth and teeth===
Special terms are used to describe the mouth and teeth. Fields such as osteology, paleontology and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example, teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like &quot;anterior&quot; or &quot;lateral&quot; become ambiguous. For example, the terms &quot;distal&quot; and &quot;proximal&quot; are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the dental arch, and &quot;medial&quot; and &quot;lateral&quot; are used to refer to the closeness to the midline of the dental arch. Terms used to describe structures include &quot;buccal&quot; () and &quot;palatal&quot; () referring to structures close to the cheek and hard palate respectively.

===Hands and feet===

Several anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.

Additional terms may be used to avoid confusion when describing the surfaces of the hand and what is the &quot;anterior&quot; or &quot;posterior&quot; surface. The term &quot;anterior&quot;, while anatomically correct, can be confusing when describing the palm of the hand; Similarly is &quot;posterior&quot;, used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can pronate and supinate and flip the location of the hand. For improved clarity, the directional term palmar () is commonly used to describe the front of the hand, and dorsal is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a dog&#x27;s paw is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The palmar fascia is &quot;palmar&quot; to the tendons of muscles which flex the fingers, and the dorsal venous arch is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.

In humans, volar can also be used synonymously with &quot;palmar&quot; to refer to the underside of the palm, but plantar is used exclusively to describe the sole. These terms describe location as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;; For example, &quot;volar&quot; pads are those on the underside of hands or fingers; the &quot;plantar&quot; surface describes the sole of the heel, foot or toes.

Similarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the radius are radial, structures closer to the ulna are ulnar, and structures relating to both bones are referred to as radioulnar. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the tibia (shinbone) are tibial and structures near the fibula are fibular (or peroneal).

===Rotational direction===
Anteversion and retroversion are complementary terms describing an anatomical structure that is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body), relative to some other position. They are particularly used to describe the curvature of the uterus.
* Anteversion () describes an anatomical structure being tilted further &quot;forward&quot; than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, a woman&#x27;s uterus typically is anteverted, tilted slightly &quot;forward&quot;. A misaligned pelvis may be anteverted, that is to say tilted &quot;forward&quot; to some relevant degree.
* Retroversion () describes an anatomical structure tilted &quot;back&quot; away from something. An example is a retroverted uterus.

===Other directional terms===
Several other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:

* Axial (): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, &quot;abaxial&quot; and &quot;adaxial&quot;, refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively
* Luminal (): on the—hollow—inside of an organ&#x27;s lumen (body cavity or tubular structure); adluminal is towards, abluminal is away from the lumen. Opposite to outermost (the adventitia, serosa, or the cavity&#x27;s wall).
* Parietal (): pertaining to the outer wall of a body cavity. For example, the parietal peritoneum is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the parietal bone of the skull or associated structures.
* Terminal () at the extremity of a usually projecting structure. For example, &quot;...an antenna with a terminal sensory hair&quot;.
* Visceral and &quot;viscus&quot; (): associated with organs within the body&#x27;s cavities and pertaining to the innermost layer. For example, the stomach is covered with a lining called the visceral peritoneum, as opposed to the parietal peritoneum. &quot;Viscus&quot; can also be used to mean &quot;organ&quot;. For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity, and &quot;visceral pain&quot; refers to pain originating from internal organs.
* Aboral (opposite to oral) is used to denote a location along the gastrointestinal tract that is relatively closer to the anus.

==Specific animals and other organisms==
Different terms are used because of different body plans in animals, whether animals stand on one or two legs, and whether an animal is symmetrical or not, as discussed above. For example, as humans are approximately bilaterally symmetrical organisms, anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for other vertebrates. However, humans stand upright on two legs, meaning their anterior/posterior and ventral/dorsal directions are the same, and the inferior/superior directions are necessary. Humans do not have a beak, so a term such as &quot;rostral&quot; used to refer to the beak in some animals is instead used to refer to part of the brain; humans do also not have a tail so a term such as &quot;caudal&quot; that refers to the tail end may also be used in humans and animals without tails to refer to the hind part of the body.

In invertebrates, the large variety of body shapes presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, meaning &quot;near&quot; refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, meaning &quot;standing away from&quot; is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the body plan of the organism.

===Asymmetrical and spherical organisms===
In organisms with a changeable shape, such as amoeboid organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in spherically symmetrical organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as &quot;superficial&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;, or sometimes &quot;proximal&quot; and &quot;distal&quot;, are usefully descriptive.

===Elongated organisms===

In organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The &quot;long&quot; or &quot;longitudinal axis&quot; is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular &quot;transverse axis&quot; can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are planktonic (free-swimming) protists, and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present.

Some elongated protists have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the cytostome in &quot;Paramecium&quot; or &quot;Stentor&quot;), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism&#x27;s locomotion (such as the end with the flagellum in &quot;Euglena&quot;), is normally designated as the anterior end. The opposite end then becomes the posterior end. Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always planktonic (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile (normally attached to a surface).


Organisms that are attached to a substrate, such as sponges, animal-like protists also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the basal end (), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the apical end ().

===Radially symmetrical organisms===
Radially symmetrical organisms include those in the group Radiata primarily jellyfish, sea anemones and corals and the comb jellies. Adult echinoderms, such as starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and others are also included, since they have a pentamerous symmetry having five discrete symmetric parts arranged around a central axis. Echinoderm larvae are not included, since they are bilaterally symmetrical. Radially symmetrical organisms always have one distinctive axis.

Cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones and corals) have an incomplete digestive system, meaning that one end of the organism has a mouth, the oral end (), and the opposite aboral end (). has no opening from the gut (coelenteron). They are radially symmetric around the oral-aboral axis 

Having only the single distinctive axis, &quot;lateral&quot;, &quot;dorsal&quot;, and &quot;ventral&quot; have no meaning in such organisms, and all can be replaced by the generic term peripheral (). Medial can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible radial axes and medio-peripheral (half-) axes. However, some biradially symmetrical comb jellies do have distinct &quot;tentacular&quot; and &quot;pharyngeal&quot; axes and are thus anatomically equivalent to bilaterally symmetrical animals.


===Spiders===
Special terms are used for spiders. Two such terms are useful in describing views of the legs and pedipalps of spiders, and other arachnids. Prolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid&#x27;s body. Retrolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid&#x27;s body. Most spiders have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the carapace of the prosoma, and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other taxa. Usually, the eyes are arranged in two roughly parallel, horizontal and symmetrical rows of eyes. Eyes are labelled according to their position as anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).

<text>On Stage is a double live album originally released by the British hard rock band Rainbow in 1977. It was recorded live over several German and Japanese dates in late 1976 during the &quot;Rising&quot; world tour. The album was released first in the US on 7 July 1977, before being released a week later on 15 July in the UK.

==Recording==
The recording features the customary introduction to a Rainbow show – the classic quote from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Toto: I have a feeling we&#x27;re not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow!&quot; with the last word repeated as an echo, then the actual band plays a musical phrase from the song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; before breaking into &quot;Kill the King&quot;.

A few of the tracks were edited by producer Martin Birch. Mistreated has the guitar/vocal duel removed, the &quot;Lazy&quot; introduction to &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot;, the drum solo has been omitted from &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot;, and the running order was changed to more easily fit four sides of vinyl.

==Release and reception==
Geoff Ginsberg of AllMusic writes: &quot;&quot;On Stage&quot; is full of great songs and playing, but somehow it lacks some of the excitement that existed at those early Ritchie Blackmore concerts. The production is just kind of flat. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there is some great stuff to be found here and nowhere else, such as the side-long version of &quot;Mistreated,&quot; from Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Burn&quot;.&quot;

The song &quot;Kill the King&quot; appeared on this album before it was recorded for a studio album. A studio version appears on the follow-up release, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

The single &quot;Kill the King&quot;, with &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; and &quot;Mistreated&quot; as double B-sides, was released in the UK in September 1977. This was Rainbow&#x27;s debut in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 44. After the commercial success of &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;, &quot;All Night Long&quot; and &quot;I Surrender&quot;, &quot;Kill the King&quot; was re-released in 1981 this time climbing to No. 41. Songwriter and lead singer Ronnie James Dio claimed that the violent imagery in the song is actually about a chess game.

A more representative example of a Rainbow concert of the time was the 1991 release &quot;Live in Germany 1976&quot;, which featured unedited concert performances and includes both tour staple &quot;Stargazer&quot; and the usual encore &quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot;.

The deluxe edition was released on 13 November 2012 in Europe. The second disc was originally planned to contain tracks from the concert hall at the &quot;&quot;Orix Theater&quot; (formerly Osaka Kōsei Nenkin Kaikan) in Osaka, Japan (9 December 1976). Instead the second disc contains tracks from the final Rainbow gig in Tokyo, Japan at the &quot;Nippon Budokan Hall&quot;&quot; on 16 December 1976.

<text>Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll is the third studio album by the British heavy metal band Rainbow, released on 14 April 1978 and the last to feature original lead vocalist Ronnie James Dio.

==Background==
Recording of the album commenced in April 1977 at a studio in Château d&#x27;Hérouville, France, featuring Ritchie Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio and Cozy Powell. Keyboards were initially played on a session basis by former Rainbow member Tony Carey, while bass parts were started by Mark Clarke. Clarke was soon dismissed, however, and the bass parts were recorded by Blackmore himself. By July 1977 seven tracks that ended on the album were in demo form. Recording was suspended while the band recruited Bob Daisley and David Stone and thereafter commenced extensive touring of Europe in the summer and autumn of 1977. A return to the Château d&#x27;Hérouville studio in December saw the band finish the album and also yielded a final track, &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;.

Although Daisley and Stone are listed on the album credits for their contributions, they joined the band partway through the recording sessions and only appear on three and four songs, respectively. Stone wrote parts of &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;, the middle 8 section during the guitar solo. He was paid for the work, but not credited on the album.

==Artwork==
The original vinyl release was in a gatefold-sleeve cover illustrated by Debbie Hall, with a lyric-sheet insert. The crowd picture is actually from a Rush concert, with the wording on the banner the fans were holding replaced by the Rainbow album title and the visible Rush T-shirts airbrushed to black.

Original copies of the single &quot;L.A. Connection&quot; were issued on red vinyl and featured aspects of the previous studio album&#x27;s cover picture on the B-side&#x27;s label.

==Release and reception==

Geoff Ginsberg of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; &quot;would turn out to be the last great album Rainbow would ever make, although they did enjoy a great deal of chart success in the post-Dio era.&quot;

The album, among other Rainbow releases, is often cited as a strong influence on formation of the power metal genre, especially on its fantasy-themed lyrics and aesthetics.

== Reissues==
*&quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was remastered on CD for the US market in April 1999, with the European version following later. The US version had a matte booklet/insert, which matched the original vinyl sleeve for all markets, whereas the European issue was the standard glossy type.
*&quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Story&quot;, an album and a book about the making of the LP was released in June 2009 in the &quot;Rock Landmarks&quot; series. The inlay story was written by Jerry Bloom, author of &quot;Black Knight&quot;, a Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s biography.
*On 12 April 2012 a picture disc album version of &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was released in the US as part of Record Store Day 2012.
*A deluxe edition version was released on 13 November in Europe, featuring rough mixes of the album tracks from July 1977 except &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;, which was written later.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio except where noted. All lyrics by Dio.

* Track 3 - Many vinyl copies label the song&#x27;s length as 3:35.
===2012 Deluxe Edition===
Disc one contains the original album with no bonus tracks.

* Track 7 - &quot;Rainbow Eyes&quot; is an early version. Tracks 10–14 are prerecorded with live vocal by Dio.

<text>Drury Lane is a street on the eastern boundary of the Covent Garden area of London, running between Aldwych and High Holborn. The northern part is in the borough of Camden and the southern part in the City of Westminster. Drury Lane is part of London&#x27;s West End Theatreland.

==Notable landmarks==

The street originated as an early medieval lane referred to in Latin as the &quot;Via de Aldwych&quot;, which probably connected St. Giles Leper Hospital with the fields of Aldwych Close, owned by the hospital but traditionally said to have been granted to the Danes as part of a peace treaty with King Alfred the Great in Saxon times. It acquired its name from the Suffolk barrister Sir Robert Drury, who built a mansion called Drury House on the lane around 1500. After the death in 1615 of his great-great-grandson, another Robert Drury, the property passed out of the family. It became the London house of the Earl of Craven, then a public house under the sign of his reputed mistress, the Queen of Bohemia. Subsequently, the gardens and courtyards of the house were built over with rows of small houses. The remains of the house itself, which had been progressively demolished, were finally cleared in 1809. By this time, Drury Lane had become one of the worst slums in London, dominated by prostitution and gin palaces. The area was eventually cleared to make way for the developments of Kingsway and Aldwych.

The Muffin Man resided on Drury Lane, according to the famous nursery rhyme.

The term &quot;Drury Lane&quot; is often used to refer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which has in different incarnations been located in the street since the 17th century, even though today the main entrance is on Catherine Street. Also in Drury Lane is the Gillian Lynne Theatre.
173 Drury Lane was the location of the first J Sainsbury store. The store was opened in 1869 and the company is now one of the UK&#x27;s largest supermarket chains.

<doc id="168053" wikidata="Q205329" url="?curid=168053" title="Amazon river dolphin">
<text>The Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), also known as the boto, bufeo or pink river dolphin, is a species of toothed whale endemic to South America and is classified in the family Iniidae. Three subspecies are currently recognized: &quot;I. g. geoffrensis&quot; (Amazon river dolphin), &quot;I. g. boliviensis&quot; (Bolivian river dolphin) and &quot;I. g. humboldtiana&quot; (Orinoco river dolphin). The position of the Araguaian river dolphin (&quot;I. araguaiaensis&quot;) within the clade is still unclear. The three subspecies are distributed in the Amazon basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco basin, respectively.

The Amazon river dolphin is the largest species of river dolphin, with many adult males reaching in weight, and in length. Adults acquire a pink color, more prominent, in males, giving it its nickname &quot;pink river dolphin&quot;. Sexual dimorphism is very evident, with males measuring 16% longer and weighing 55% more than females. Like other toothed whales, they have a melon, an organ that is used for bio sonar. The dorsal fin, although short in height, is regarded as long, and the pectoral fins are also large. The fin size, unfused vertebrae, and its relative size allow for improved maneuverability when navigating flooded forests and capturing prey.

They have one of the widest-ranging diets among toothed whales, and feed on up to 53 different species of fish, such as croakers, catfish, tetras and piranhas. They also consume other animals such as river turtles, aquatic frogs, and freshwater crabs.

In 2018, this species was ranked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered, with a declining population. Threats include incidental catch in fishing lines, direct hunting for use as fishing bait or predator control, damming, and pollution; as with many species, habitat loss and continued human development is becoming a greater threat.

It is the only species of river dolphin kept in captivity, mainly in Venezuela and Europe. It is difficult to train and there is a high mortality rate among captive individuals.

==Taxonomy==

The species &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot; was described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1817. Originally, the Amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily Platanistoidea, which constituted all river dolphins, making them a paraphyletic group. Today, however, the Amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily Inioidea. There is no consensus on when and how their ancestral species penetrated the Amazon basin; they may have done so during the Miocene from the Pacific Ocean, before the formation of the Andes, or from the Atlantic Ocean.

There is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies. The IUCN and Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy recognize two subspecies: &quot;I. g. geoffrensis&quot; (Amazon river dolphin) and &quot;I. g. boliviensis&quot; (Bolivian river dolphin). A third proposed subspecies, &quot;I. g. humboldtiana&quot; (Orinoco river dolphin), was first described in 1977. Molecular analysis suggests that the Orinoco dolphins are derived from the Amazon population and are not genetically distinct. Comparative morphological research also indicates that &quot;I. g. humboldtiana&quot; is not distinguishable from &quot;I. g. geoffrensis&quot;. However, Cañizales (2020) found that &quot;I. g. humboldtiana&quot; skulls were morphologically distinct and recommended that it be elevated to species status.

In 1994, it was proposed that &quot;I. g. boliviensis&quot; was a different species based on skull morphology. In 2002, following the analysis of mitochondrial DNA specimens from the Orinoco basin, the Putumayo River (tributary of the Amazon) and the Tijamuchy and Ipurupuru rivers, geneticists proposed that genus &quot;Inia&quot; be divided into at least two evolutionary lineages: one restricted to the river basins of Bolivia and the other widely distributed in the Orinoco and Amazon. A recent study, with more comprehensive sampling of the Madeira system, including above and below the Teotonio Rapids (which were thought to obstruct gene flow), found that the &quot;Inia&quot; above the rapids did not possess unique mtDNA. As such the species level distinction once held is not supported by current results. Therefore, the Bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies. In addition, a 2014 study identifies a third species in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin, but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive.

===Subspecies===

&quot;Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis&quot; inhabits most of the Amazon River, including rivers Tocantins, Araguaia, low Xingu and Tapajos, the Madeira to the rapids of Porto Velho, and rivers Purus, Yurua, Ica, Caqueta, Branco, and the Rio Negro through the channel of Casiquiare to San Fernando de Atabapo in the Orinoco river, including its tributary: the Guaviare.

&quot;Inia geoffrensis boliviensis&quot; has populations in the upper reaches of the Madeira River, upstream of the rapids of Teotonio, in Bolivia. It is confined to the Mamore River and its main tributary, the Iténez.

&quot;Inia geoffrensis humboldtiana&quot; are located in the Orinoco River basin, including the Apure and Meta rivers. This subspecies is restricted, at least during the dry season, to the waterfalls of Rio Negro rapids in the Orinoco between and Puerto Ayacucho, and the Casiquiare canal. This subspecies is not recognized by the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy, or the IUCN.

==Description==

The Amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin. Adult males reach a maximum length and weight of (average ) and (average ), while females reach a length and weight of (mean ) and (average ). It has very evident sexual dimorphism, with males measuring and weighing between 16% and 55% more than females, making it unique among river dolphins, where females are generally larger than males.

The texture of the body is robust and strong but flexible. Unlike in oceanic dolphins, the cervical vertebrae are not fused, allowing the head to turn 90 degrees. The flukes are broad and triangular, and the dorsal fin, which is keel-shaped, is short in height but very long, extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region. The pectoral fins are large and paddle-shaped. The length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement, allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed.

The body color varies with age. Newborns and the young have a dark grey tint, which in adolescence transforms into light grey, and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface. Males tend to be pinker than females due to more frequent trauma from intra-species aggression. The color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker. It is believed that the difference in color depends on the temperature, water transparency, and geographical location. There was one albino on record, kept in Duisburg Zoo&#x27;s dolphinarium. However, as of 2020, this specimen and one other have died. 

The skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales. It has a long, thin snout, with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws. Dentition is heterodont, meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length, with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey. Anterior teeth are conical and later have ridges on the inside of the crown. Despite small eyes, the species seems to have good eyesight in and out of the water. It has a melon on the head, the shape of which can be modified by muscular control when used for biosonar. Breathing takes place every 30 to 110 seconds.

===Longevity===

Life expectancy of the Amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown, but in captivity, the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years. However, a 1986 study of the average longevity of this species in captivity in the United States is only 33 months. An individual named Baby at the Duisburg Zoo, Germany, lived at least 46 years, spending 45 years, 9 months at the zoo.

==Biology and ecology==
The Amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos, but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals. Pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the Amazon, but the average is three. In the Orinoco, the largest observed groups number 30, but the average is just above five. During prey time, as many as 35 pink dolphins work together to obtain their prey. Typically, social bonds occur between mother and child, but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups. The largest congregations are seen in areas with abundant food, and at the mouths of rivers. There is significant segregation during the rainy season, with males occupying the river channels, while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas. However, in the dry season, there is no such separation. Due to the high level of prey fish, larger group-sizes are seen in large sections that are directly influenced by whitewater (such as main rivers and lakes, especially during low water season) than in smaller sections influenced by blackwater (such as channels and smaller tributaries). In their freshwater habitat they are apex predators and gatherings depend more on food sources and habitat availability than in oceanic dolphins where protection from larger predators is necessary.

Captive studies have shown that the Amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin, but also less sociable. It is very curious and has a remarkable lack of fear of foreign objects. However, dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment, where they have been reported to hold the oars of fishermen, rub against boats, pluck underwater plants, and play with sticks, logs, clay, turtles, snakes, and fish.

They are slow swimmers; they commonly travel at speeds of but have been recorded to swim at speeds up to . When they surface, the tips of the snout, melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously, the tail rarely showing before diving. They can also shake their fins, and pull their tail fin and head above the water to observe the environment. They occasionally jump out of the water, sometimes as high as a meter (3.14 ft). They are harder to train than most other species of dolphin.

===Courtship===
Adult males have been observed carrying objects in their mouths such as branches or other floating vegetation, or balls of hardened clay. The males appear to carry these objects as a socio-sexual display which is part of their mating system. The behavior is &quot;triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group, or perhaps it attracts such into the group. A plausible explanation of the results is that object-carrying is aimed at females and is stimulated by the number of females in the group, while aggression is aimed at other adult males and is stimulated by object-carrying in the group.&quot;
Before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism, it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous. Later, it was shown that males were larger than females and are documented wielding an aggressive sexual behavior in the wild and in captivity. Males often have a significant degree of damage in the dorsal, caudal, and pectoral fins, as well as the blowhole, due to bites and abrasions. They also commonly have numerous secondary teeth-raking scars. This suggests fierce competition for access to females, with a polygynous mating system, though polyandry and promiscuity cannot be excluded.

In captivity, courtship and mating foreplay have been documented. The male takes the initiative by nibbling the fins of the female, but reacts aggressively if the female is not receptive. A high frequency of copulations in a couple was observed; they used three different positions: contacting the womb at right angles, lying head to head, or head to tail.

===Reproduction===
Breeding is seasonal, and births occur between May and June. The period of birthing coincides with the flood season, and this may provide an advantage because the females and their offspring remain in flooded areas longer than males. As the water level begins to decrease, the density of food sources in flooded areas increases due to loss of space, providing enough energy for infants to meet the high demands required for growth. Gestation is estimated to be around eleven months and captive births take 4 to 5 hours. At birth, calves are long and in captivity have registered a growth of per year. Lactation takes about a year. The interval between births is estimated between 15 and 36 months, and the young dolphins are thought to become independent within two to three years.

The relatively long duration of breastfeeding and parenting suggests a high level of parental care. Most couples observed in their natural environment consist of a female and her calf. This suggests that long periods of parental care contribute to learning and development of the young.

===Diet===

The diet of the Amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales. It consists of at least 53 different species of fish, grouped in 19 families. The prey size is between , with an average of . The most frequently consumed fish belong to the families Sciaenidae (croakers), Cichlidae (cichlids), Characidae (characins and tetras), and Serrasalmidae (pacus, piranhas and silver dollars). The dolphin&#x27;s dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles (such as &quot;Podocnemis sextuberculata&quot;) and freshwater crabs (such as &quot;Poppiana argentiniana&quot;). The diet is more diverse during the wet season, when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds, thus becoming more difficult to catch. The diet becomes more selective during the dry season when prey density is greater.

Usually, these dolphins are active and feeding throughout the day and night. However, they are predominantly crepuscular. They consume about 5.5% of their body weight per day. They sometimes take advantage of the disturbances made by boats to catch disoriented prey. Sometimes, they associate with the distantly related tucuxi (&quot;Sotalia fluviatilis&quot;), and giant otters (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;) to hunt in a coordinated manner, by gathering and attacking fish stocks at the same time. Apparently, there is little competition for food between these species, as each prefers different prey. It has also been observed that captive dolphins share food.

===Echolocation===
Amazonian rivers are often very murky, and the Amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey. However, echolocation in shallow waters and flooded forests may result in many echoes to keep track of. For each click produced a multitude of echoes are likely to return to the echolocating animal almost on top of each other which makes object discrimination difficult. This may be why the Amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales. By sending out clicks of lower amplitude only nearby objects will cast back detectable echoes, and hence fewer echoes need to be sorted out, but the cost is a reduced biosonar range. Toothed whales generally do not produce a new echolocation click until all relevant echoes from the previous click have been received, so if detectable echoes are only reflected back from nearby objects, the echoes will quickly return, and the Amazon river dolphin is then able to click at a high rate. This in turn allow these animals to have a high acoustic update rate on their surroundings which may aid prey tracking when echolocating in shallow rivers and flooded forests with plenty of hiding places for the prey. While preying in murky water, they emit series of clicking noises, 30 to 80 per second, which they use by listening to the bouncing sonar which bounces off their prey.

===Communication===
Like other dolphins, river dolphins use whistling tones to communicate. The issuance of these sounds is related to the time they return to the surface before diving, suggesting a link to food. Acoustic analysis revealed that the vocalisations are different in structure from the typical whistles of other species of dolphins.

Male Amazon river dolphins have been observed to exhibit an unusual aerial urination behavior, predominantly in social contexts involving other males. During these events, a urinating male positions itself upside down, ejecting a urine stream into the air, while a receiving male actively seeks the stream with its rostrum, possibly detecting chemical signals through specialized bristles. Researchers speculate that this behavior likely serves a social or communicative function beyond waste elimination, potentially facilitating chemical communication in a species with limited olfactory capabilities.

==Distribution and population==

Amazon river dolphins are the most widespread river dolphins. They are present in six countries in South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, in an area covering about . The boundaries are set by waterfalls, such as the Xingu and Tapajós rivers in Brazil, as well as very shallow water. A series of rapids and waterfalls in the Madeira River have isolated one population, recognized as the subspecies &quot;I. g. boliviensis&quot;, in the southern part of the Amazon basin in Bolivia.

They are also distributed in the basin of the Orinoco River, except the Caroni River and the upper Caura River in Venezuela. The only connection between the Orinoco and the Amazon is through the Casiquiare canal. The distribution of dolphins in the rivers and surrounding areas depends on the time of year; in the dry season they are located in the river beds, but in the rainy season, when the rivers overflow, they disperse to the flooded areas, both the forests and the plains.

Studies to estimate the population are difficult to analyze due to the difference in the methodology used. In a study conducted in the stretch of the Amazon called Solimões River, with a length of between the cities of Manaus and Tabatinga, a total of 332 individuals was sighted ± 55 per inspection. Density was estimated at 0.08–0.33 animals per square kilometer in the main channels, and 0.49 to 0.93 animals per square kilometer in the branches. In another study, on a stretch of at the confluence of Colombia, Brazil and Peru, 345 individuals with a density of 4.8 per square km in the tributaries around the islands. 2.7 and 2.0 were observed along the banks. Additionally, another study was conducted in the Amazon at the height of the mouth of the Caqueta River for six days. As a result of the studies conducted, it was found that the density is higher in the riverbanks, 3.7 per km, decreasing towards the center of the river. In studies conducted during the rainy season, the density observed in the flood plain was 18 animals per square km, while on the banks of rivers and lakes ranged from 1.8 to 5.8 individuals per square km. These observations suggest that the Amazon river dolphin is found in higher density than any other cetacean.

===Habitat and migration===
The Amazon river dolphin is located in most of the area&#x27;s aquatic habitats, including; river basins, major courses of rivers, canals, river tributaries, lakes, and at the ends of rapids and waterfalls. Cyclical changes in the water levels of rivers take place throughout the year. During the dry season, dolphins occupy the main river channels, and during the rainy season, they can move easily to smaller tributaries, to the forest, and to floodplains.

Males and females appear to have selective habitat preferences, with the males returning to the main river channels when water levels are still high, while the females and their offspring remain in the flooded areas as long as possible; probably because it decreases the risk of aggression by males toward the young and predation by other species.

In the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, Peru, photo-identification is used to recognize individuals based on pigmentation patterns, scars and abnormalities in the beak. 72 individuals were recognized, of which 25 were again observed between 1991 and 2000. The intervals between sightings ranged from one day to 7.5 years. The maximum range of motion was , with an average of . The longest distance in one day was , with an average of . In a previous study conducted at the center of the Amazon River, a dolphin was observed that moved only a few dozen kilometers from the dry season and wet season. However, three of the reviewed 160 animals were observed over from where they were first registered. Research in 2011 concluded that photo-identification by skilled operatives using high-quality digital equipment could be a useful tool in monitoring population size, movements and social patterns.

==Interactions with humans==

===In captivity===

The Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only one exists in captivity, at Zoologico de Quistochoca in Peru. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last died at the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002.

===Threats===
The region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of containing diverse fundamental ecosystems. One of these ecosystems is a floodplain, or a várzea forest, and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption. The várzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing. Várzea consists of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient rich species. The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the várzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding.

In addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (&quot;Colossoma macropomum&quot;) and the pirapitinga (&quot;Piaractus brachypomus&quot;), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish and when the Amazon River dolphins are removed from the commercial catch in the nets and lines, it causes damages to the equipment and the capture, as well as generating ill will from the local fishermen. The negative reactions of the local fishermen are also attributed to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibition on killing the Amazon river dolphin, yet not compensating the fishermen for the damage done to their equipment and catch.

During the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the entangled dolphins. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (&quot;Calophysus macropterus&quot;). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back to 2000. Increasing demand for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.

Of the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data do not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon the carcasses, and the complexity of the river currents make it nearly impossible to locate all of the dead animals. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that a legal course of action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under a Brazilian federal law prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.

The Amazon river is also threatened by the dumping of mercury into its waters from industrial mining, along with other harsh chemicals. Just like deforestation and burning, mercury in the water of the Amazon river is very dangerous for the fauna of the river. In 2019, F. Mosquera-Guerra at al, published a study that showed the presence of mercury in the Amazon river dolphins. They analyzed the dolphin&#x27;s muscle tissue of different taxa of the Amazon basin and found high concentrations of mercury in the Tapajos River (Brazil) from an adult male of I. g. geoffrensis (pink dolphin).

In September 2023, 154 Amazon river dolphins died in Brazil&#x27;s Lake Tefé following record-high water temperatures of and reduced water levels during a drought. While there are ongoing studies by the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development to determine the cause of the deaths, the leading hypothesis is that the elevated temperature caused algae in the lake to release a toxin that attacks the central nervous system.

===Conservation===
In 2008, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) expressed concern for captured botos for use as bait in the Central Amazon, which is an emerging problem that has spread on a large scale. The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Fauna and Flora (CITES), and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, because it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.

According to a previous assessment by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission in 2000, the population of botos appears great and there is little or no evidence of population decline in numbers and range. However, increased human intervention on their habitat is expected to, in the future, be the most likely cause of the decline of its range and population. A series of recommendations were issued to ensure proper follow-up to the species, among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations, making a record of the distribution of the species, information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines.

In September 2012, Bolivian President Evo Morales enacted a law to protect the dolphin and declared it a national treasure.

In 2018, the species was listed on the Red list of endangered species.

Increasing pollution and gradual destruction of the Amazon rainforest add to the vulnerability of the species. The biggest threats are deforestation and other human activities that contribute to disrupt and alter their environment. Another source of concern is the difficulty in keeping these animals alive in captivity, due to intra-species aggression and low longevity. Captive breeding is not considered a conservation option for this species.

The Global Declaration for River Dolphins seeks to reverse the decline of river dolphin populations throughout the world. As of early 2024, 11 of the 14 countries that have river dolphins have signed the declaration.

===In mythology===

In traditional Amazon River folklore, at night, an Amazon river dolphin becomes a handsome young man who seduces girls, impregnates them, and then returns to the river in the morning to become a dolphin again. Similarly, the female becomes a beautiful, well-dressed, wealthy-looking young woman. This dolphin shapeshifter is called an &quot;encantado&quot;. The myth has been suggested to have arisen partly because dolphin genitalia bear a resemblance to those of humans. Others believe the myth served (and still serves) as a way of hiding the incestuous relations which are quite common in some small, isolated communities along the river. In the area, tales relate it is bad luck to kill a dolphin. Legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an Amazon river dolphin, they will have lifelong nightmares. According to the pink Amazon river dolphin myth, it is said that this creature takes form of a human and seduces men and women to the Underworld of Encante. This underworld place is said to be &#x27;Atlantis-like Paradise&#x27;, yet no one has come back from it alive. Myths say that whoever kills the amazon dolphin will have bad luck, but it&#x27;s worse for whoever eats it. Local legends also state that the dolphin is the guardian of the Amazonian manatee, and that if one should wish to find a manatee, one must first make peace with the dolphin.

Associated with these legends is the use of various fetishes, such as dried eyeballs and genitalia. These may or may not be accompanied by the intervention of a shaman. A recent study has shown, despite the claim of the seller and the belief of the buyers, none of these fetishes is derived from the &quot;boto&quot;. They are derived from &quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot;, are most likely harvested along the coast and the Amazon River delta, and then are traded up the Amazon River. In inland cities far from the coast, many, if not most, of the fetishes are derived from domestic animals such as sheep and pigs.

<doc id="168057" wikidata="Q1753320" url="?curid=168057" title="Down to Earth (Rainbow album)">
<text>Down to Earth is the fourth studio album by the British hard rock band Rainbow. It is their last album to feature drummer Cozy Powell, their first with bassist Roger Glover and keyboardist Don Airey and their only album with vocalist Graham Bonnet. Released in 1979, it contains Rainbow&#x27;s first hit single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;, marking a more commercial direction of the band&#x27;s sound.

==Writing and recording==
The writing of &quot;Down to Earth&quot; began at Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s house in Connecticut in January 1979. By that time, he had dismissed both bassist Bob Daisley and keyboard player David Stone before singer Ronnie James Dio quit the band. Blackmore had already recruited his old Deep Purple bandmate Roger Glover as producer and started auditioning musicians for the vacant slots in the band, while songwriting progressed with Blackmore, Cozy Powell and session musician Clive Chaman on bass. The backing tracks were largely written by Blackmore and Glover. &quot;It was a great opportunity for me, and why should I bear a grudge? &quot;(about being dismissed from Purple in 1973)&quot; &quot; recalled Glover. &quot;I&#x27;m a huge Ritchie fan. Some of my biggest influences have come from him.&quot;

By early 1979, Blackmore had recruited keyboardist Don Airey – a suggestion from Powell – and considered Peter Goalby of Trapeze, as well as another old Deep Purple bandmate Ian Gillan, to replace Dio. In April 1979, Jack Green of The Pretty Things was hired as new bass player for the recording sessions at Château Pelly de Cornfeld, in the countryside of Southern France, but he did not stay for long. Producer Glover ended up playing bass on the album and provided lyrics for all songs. While auditions for the new singer proceeded, Glover tracked down ex-Marbles singer Graham Bonnet, who auditioned in France and was immediately hired.

During song composition, Bonnet composed his vocal melodies though his contributions remained uncredited. His vocals were not recorded with the other tracks in France, but later at Kingdom Sound Studios in Long Island, when all other recording sessions were completed. &quot;Down to Earth&quot; is the only Rainbow album to feature Bonnet, though he was still part of the band when writing for &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; began.

Also recorded for the proposed next single, but unreleased due to Bonnet&#x27;s departure, was &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;. Bonnet had previously recorded this song for his first, eponymously titled, solo album in 1977. Rainbow&#x27;s version was recorded in the studio in May 1980, during rehearsals for the Japanese leg of the &quot;Down to Earth&quot; tour. It was subsequently played live throughout that tour.

==Tour==
In 1980, Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow headlined the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in England.

Songs from &quot;Down to Earth&quot; have been performed by Graham Bonnet at his solo shows, as well as at concerts performed with Don Airey (2001) and Joe Lynn Turner (2007).

==Release==
In the UK there was a limited edition clear vinyl LP release.

&quot;Bad Girl&quot;, an outtake from the album sessions, was used as the B-side to the &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; single. Similarly, &quot;Weiss Heim&quot;, an instrumental recorded in Copenhagen in January 1980, was the B-side to &quot;All Night Long&quot;.

A remastered CD reissue was released in May 1999, with packaging duplicating the original vinyl.

In 2011, a Deluxe Edition of the album was released, featuring a bonus disc with previously unreleased songs and instrumental versions of the basic tracks.

==Reception==

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine defines the album &quot;a fine hard rock platter&quot;, which &quot;might not offer anything unique, but it delivers the goods.&quot; He criticizes mostly Bonnet&#x27;s vocals, but praises &quot;the guitar artistry and mystical sensibility of Ritchie Blackmore&quot;, who &quot;sounds invigorated on the album&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Adrien Begrand, reviewing the 2011 Deluxe Edition, remarks how &quot;Down to Earth&quot; &quot;is somewhat underrated compared to the towering Dio discography, but it remains a strong outing 31 years later&quot;, even with &quot;the new material sounding so much more stripped-down compared to the overtly epic heavy metal arrangements of Dio-era Rainbow&quot;. The songs are &quot;eight searing, hooky hard rockers&quot;, remarkably rendered by Bonnet&#x27;s performance and energy. The album &quot;is perhaps the most divisive record in Rainbow’s catalogue&quot; according to &quot;Record Collector&quot; reviewer, because of &quot;Blackmore&#x27;s single-minded pursuit of mainstream success&quot; and the departure from the sound of preceding albums. He adds that this is a &quot;strong&quot; album with many &quot;classic radio&quot; staples, but the second disc of the Deluxe Edition does not add anything essential to the listening experience.

In 2005, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; was ranked number 431 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot;″s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Blackmore&#x27;s opinion==

In an interview with &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1979, Blackmore said: &quot;I have so much respect for classical musicians that when I listen to myself I think, oh, that&#x27;s nonsense. I can put down other people&#x27;s music because the fact is I put down my own music and say it&#x27;s rubbish. A lot of it is- not all of it- &quot;No Time to Lose&quot; definitely is but &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; is OK. But a good deal of it is a waste of time.&quot;

<doc id="168058" wikidata="Q310808" url="?curid=168058" title="Antiochus X Eusebes">
<text>Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (;  – 92 or 88 BC) was a Seleucid monarch who reigned as King of Syria during the Hellenistic period between 95 BC and 92 BC or 89/88 BC (224 SE [Seleucid year]). He was the son of Antiochus IX and perhaps his Egyptian wife Cleopatra IV. Eusebes lived during a period of general disintegration in Seleucid Syria, characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by Ptolemaic Egypt and incursions by the Parthians. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of Seleucus VI, the son of his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII. Antiochus X then went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed.

Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI&#x27;s brothers, Antiochus XI, Philip I and Demetrius III. Antiochus XI defeated AntiochusX and expelled him from the capital Antioch in 93 BC. A few months later, AntiochusX regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to both Philip I and Demetrius III becoming involved. The civil war continued but its outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions between different ancient historians&#x27; accounts. AntiochusX married his stepmother, Antiochus IX&#x27;s widow Cleopatra Selene, and had several children with her, including a future king Antiochus XIII.

The death of Antiochus X is a mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian Josephus, who wrote that AntiochusX marched east to fight off the Parthians who were attacking a queen called Laodice; the identity of this queen and who her people were continues to be debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian Appian has AntiochusX defeated by the Armenian king Tigranes II and losing his kingdom; the third century historian Eusebius wrote that AntiochusX was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the Romans to help him regain the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that AntiochusX was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital in SE (88/87 BC).

== Background, early life and name ==

The second century BC witnessed the disintegration of the Syria-based Seleucid Empire due to never-ending dynastic feuds and foreign Egyptian and Roman interference. Amid constant civil wars, Syria fell to pieces. Seleucid pretenders fought for the throne, tearing the country apart. In 113 BC, Antiochus IX declared himself king in opposition to his half-brother Antiochus VIII. The siblings fought relentlessly for a decade and a half until Antiochus VIII was killed in 96 BC. The following year, Antiochus VIII&#x27;s son Seleucus VI marched against Antiochus IX and killed him near the Syrian capital Antioch.

Egypt and Syria attempted dynastic marriages to maintain a degree of peace. Antiochus IX married several times; known wives are his cousin Cleopatra IV of Egypt, whom he married in 114 BC, and her sister Cleopatra Selene, the widow of Antiochus VIII. Some historians, such as John D. Grainger, maintain the existence of a first wife unknown by name who was the mother of Antiochus X. Others, such as Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, believe that the first wife of Antiochus IX and the mother of his son was Cleopatra IV, in which case AntiochusX would have been born in . None of those assertions are based on evidence, and the mother of AntiochusX is not named in ancient sources. Antiochus is a Greek name meaning &quot;resolute in contention&quot;. The capital Antioch received its name in deference to Antiochus, the father of the Seleucid dynasty&#x27;s founder Seleucus I; the name became dynastic and many Seleucid kings bore it.

== Reign ==

According to Josephus, following the death of his father, AntiochusX went to the city of Aradus where he declared himself king; it is possible that Antiochus IX, before facing Seleucus VI, sent his son to that city for protection. Aradus was an independent city since 137 BC, meaning that AntiochusX made an alliance with it, since he would not have been able to subdue it by force at that stage of his reign. As the descendants of Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX fought over Syria, they portrayed themselves in the likeness of their respective fathers to indicate their legitimacy; Antiochus X&#x27;s busts on his coins show him with a short nose that ends with an up-turn, like his father. Ancient Hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers. Instead, they usually employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other rulers with similar names; the numbering of kings is mostly a modern practice. On his coins, AntiochusX appeared with the epithets &quot;Eusebes&quot; (the pious) and &quot;Philopator&quot; (father-loving). According to Appian, the king received the epithet Eusebes from the Syrians because he escaped a plot on his life by Seleucus VI, and, officially, the Syrians thought that he survived because of his piety, but, in reality, it was a prostitute in love with AntiochusX who saved him.

Beginning his reign in 218 SE (95/94 BC), AntiochusX was deprived of resources and lacked a queen. He therefore married a woman who could provide what he needed, his stepmother Cleopatra Selene. AntiochusX was probably no more than twenty years old while his wife was in her forties. This union was not unprecedented in the Seleucid dynasty, as Antiochus I had married his stepmother Stratonice, but nevertheless, the marriage was scandalous. Appian commented that he thought the real reason behind the epithet &quot;Eusebes&quot; to be a joke by the Syrians, mocking Antiochus X&#x27;s piety, as he showed loyalty to his father by bedding his widow. Appian concluded that it was &quot;divine vengeance&quot; for his marriage that eventually led to Antiochus X&#x27;s fall.

=== First reign in Antioch ===

One of Antiochus X&#x27;s first actions was to avenge his father; in 94 BC, he advanced on the capital Antioch and drove Seleucus VI out of northern Syria into Cilicia. According to Eusebius, the final battle between AntiochusX and Seleucus VI took place near the Cilician city of Mopsuestia, ending in Antiochus X&#x27;s victory while Seleucus VI took refuge in the city, where he perished as a result of a popular revolt.

During the Seleucid period, currency struck in times of campaigns against a rival or a usurper showed the king bearded, and what seems to be the earliest bronze coinage of AntiochusX shows him with a curly beard, while later currency, apparently meant to show the king in firm control of his realm, depicted AntiochusX clean shaven. Early in 93 BC, the brothers of Seleucus VI, Antiochus XI and Philip I, avenged Seleucus VI by sacking Mopsuestia. Antiochus XI then advanced on Antioch, defeated Antiochus X, and expelled him from the city, reigning alone in the capital for few months.

=== Second reign in Antioch ===

Antiochus X recruited new soldiers and attacked Antioch the same year. He emerged victorious, while Antiochus XI drowned in the Orontes River as he tried to flee. Now AntiochusX ruled northern Syria and Cilicia; around this time, Mopsuestia minted coins with the word &quot;autonomous&quot; inscribed. This new political status seems to have been a privilege bestowed upon the city by Antiochus X, who, as a sign of gratitude for Mopsuestia&#x27;s role in eliminating Seleucus VI, apparently not just rebuilt it, but also compensated it for the damage it suffered at the hands of Seleucus VI&#x27;s brothers. In the view of the numismatist , some coins minted in Mopsuestia may carry a portrait of Antiochus X. Other cities minted their own civic coinage under the king&#x27;s rule, including Tripolis, Berytus, and perhaps the autonomous city of Ascalon.

In the capital, Antiochus X might have been responsible for building a library and an attached museum on the model of the Library of Alexandria. Philip I was probably centered at Beroea; his brother, Demetrius III, who ruled Damascus, supported him and marched north probably in the spring of 93 BC. AntiochusX faced fierce resistance from his cousins. In the year 220 SE (93/92BC), the city of Damascus stopped issuing coins in the name of Demetrius III, then resumed the following year; this could have been the result of incursions by Antiochus X, which weakened his cousin and made Damascus vulnerable to attacks by the Judaean king Alexander Jannaeus.

== Children ==
The Roman statesman Cicero wrote about two sons of AntiochusX and Cleopatra Selene who visited Rome during his time (between 75 and 73 BC); one of them was named Antiochus. The king might have also fathered a daughter with his wife; according to the first century historian Plutarch, the Armenian king Tigranes II, who killed Cleopatra Selene in 69 BC, &quot;put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity&quot;. This statement makes it possible to assume that AntiochusX had at least one daughter with his wife.
* Antiochus XIII: mentioned by Cicero. His epithets raised questions about how many sons with that name AntiochusX fathered; when Antiochus XIII issued coins as a sole ruler, he used the epithet &quot;Philadelphos&quot; (&quot;brother-loving&quot;), but on jugate coins that show Cleopatra Selene as regent along with a ruling son named Antiochus, the epithet &quot;Philometor&quot; (&quot;mother-loving&quot;) is used. The historian , agreeing with the view of Bouché-Leclercq, argued that two sons, both named Antiochus, resulted from the marriage of AntiochusX and Cleopatra Selene. Cicero, on the other hand, left one of the brothers unnamed, and clearly stated that Antiochus was the name of only one prince. Ehling&#x27;s theory is possible but only if &quot;Antiochus Philometor&quot; was the prince named by Cicero, and the brother, who had a different name, assumed the dynastic name Antiochus with the epithet Philadelphos when he became king following the death of Antiochus Philometor. In the view of the historian Adrian Dumitru, such a scenario is complicated; more likely, Antiochus XIII bore two epithets, &quot;Philadelphos&quot; and &quot;Philometor&quot;. Several numismatists, such as Oliver D. Hoover, Catharine Lorber and Arthur Houghton, agree that both epithets denoted Antiochus XIII.
* Seleucus VII: the numismatist Brian Kritt deciphered and published a newly discovered jugate coin bearing the portrait of Cleopatra Selene and a co-ruler in 2002. Kritt&#x27;s reading gave the name of King Seleucus Philometor and, considering the epithet which means mother loving, equated him with the unnamed son mentioned by Cicero. Kritt gave the newly discovered king the regnal name Seleucus VII. Some scholars, such as Lloyd Llewellyn Jones and , accepted the reading, but Hoover rejected Kritt&#x27;s reading as the coin is badly damaged and some of the letters cannot be read. Hoover proposed a different reading where the king&#x27;s name is Antiochus, to be identified with Antiochus XIII.
* Seleucus Kybiosaktes: the unnamed son mentioned by Cicero does not appear in other ancient literature. Seleucus Kybiosaktes, a man who appeared in Egypt as a husband of its queen Berenice IV, is identified by modern scholarship with the unnamed prince. According to the first century BC historian Strabo, Kybiosaktes pretended to be of Seleucid descent. Kritt considered it plausible to identify Seleucus VII with Seleucus Kybiosaktes.

== Conflict with Parthia and demise ==
Information about Antiochus X after the interference of Demetrius III is scanty. Ancient sources and modern scholars present different accounts and dates for the demise of the king. Antiochus X&#x27;s end as told by Josephus, which has the king killed during a campaign against the Parthians, is considered the most reliable and likely by modern historians. Towards the end of his reign, Antiochus X increased his coin production, and this could be related to the campaign undertaken by the Seleucid monarch against Parthia, as recorded by Josephus. The Parthians were advancing in eastern Syria in the time of Antiochus X, which would have made it important for the king to counterattack, thus strengthening his position in the war against his cousins. The majority of scholars accept the year 92 BC for Antiochus X&#x27;s end:

=== Year of death ===

No known coins issued by the king in Antioch contain a date. Josephus wrote that the king fell soon after Demetrius III&#x27;s interference, but this statement is vague. Most scholars, such as Edward Theodore Newell, understood Josephus&#x27;s statement to indicate 92BC. According to Hoover, the dating of Newell is apparently based on combining the statement of Josephus with that of Eusebius, who wrote that AntiochusX was ejected from the capital in 220 SE (93/92 BC) by Philip I. Hoover considered Newell&#x27;s dating hard to accept; a market weight from Antioch bearing Antiochus X&#x27;s name, from 92 BC, might contradict the dating of 220 SE (93/92 BC). On the other hand, in the year 221 SE (92/91BC), the city of Antioch issued civic coinage mentioning no king; Hoover noted that the civic coinage mentions Antioch as the &quot;metropolis&quot; but not as autonomous, and this might be explained as a reward from AntiochusX bestowed upon the city for supporting him in his struggle against his cousins.

In 2007, using a methodology based on estimating the annual die usage average rate (the Esty formula), Hoover proposed the year 224 SE (89/88 BC) for the end of Antiochus X&#x27;s reign. Later in 2011, Hoover noted that this date is hard to accept considering that during Antiochus X&#x27;s second reign in the capital, only one or two dies were used per year, far too few for the Seleucid average rate to justify a long reign. Hoover then noted that there seem to be several indications that the coinage of Antiochus X&#x27;s second reign in the capital, along with the coinages of Antiochus XI and Demetrius III, were re-coined by Philip I who eventually took Antioch , thus explaining the rarity of those kings&#x27; coins. Hoover admitted that his conclusion is &quot;troubling&quot;. The historian considered Hoover&#x27;s dating and arguments too speculative, as they contradict ancient literature.

=== Manner of death ===
The manner of the king&#x27;s death varies depending on which ancient account is used. The main ancient historians providing information on Antiochus X&#x27;s end are Josephus, Appian, Eusebius and Saint Jerome:

The account of Josephus: &quot;For when he was come as an auxiliary to Laodice, queen of the Gileadites, when she was making war against the Parthians, and he was fighting courageously, he fell.&quot; The Parthians might have been allied with Philip I. The people of Laodice, their location, and who she was are hard to determine, as surviving manuscripts of Josephus&#x27;s work transmit different names for the people. Gileadites is an older designation based on the Codex Leidensis (Lugdunensis) manuscript of Josephus&#x27;s work, but the academic consensus uses the designation Sameans, based on the &quot;Codex Palatinus (Vaticanus) Graecus&quot; manuscript.
* Based on the reading Gileadites: In the view of Bouché-Leclercq, the division of Syria between AntiochusX and his cousins must have tempted the Parthian king Mithridates II to annex the kingdom. Bouché-Leclercq, agreeing with the historian Alfred von Gutschmid, identified the mysterious queen with Antiochus X&#x27;s cousin Laodice, daughter of Antiochus VIII, and wife of Mithridates I, the king of Commagene, which had recently detached from the Seleucids, and suggested that Laodice resided in Samosata. Bouché-Leclercq hypothesized that AntiochusX did not go to help his rivals&#x27; sister, but to stop the Parthians before they reached his own borders. The historian Adolf Kuhn, on the other hand, considered it implausible that AntiochusX would support a daughter of Antiochus VIII and he questioned the identification with the queen of Commagene. Ehling, attempting to explain Antiochus X&#x27;s assistance of Laodice, suggested that the queen was a daughter of Antiochus IX, a sister of Antiochus X.
* Based on the reading Sameans: the historian considered Laodice a queen of a nomadic tribe based on the similarities between the name from the &quot;Codex Palatinus (Vaticanus) Graecus&quot; with the Samènes, a people mentioned by the sixth century geographer Stephanus of Byzantium as an Arab nomadic tribe. This would solve the problems posed by the identification with the queen of Commagene, and end the debate regarding the location of the people, as the nature of their nomadic life makes it impossible to determine exactly the place where the fight took place. Dobiáš attributed the initiative to AntiochusX who was not merely trying to defend his borders but actively attacking the Parthians.

The account of Appian: Antiochus X was expelled from Syria by Tigranes II of Armenia. Appian gave Tigranes II a reign of fourteen years in Syria ending in 69 BC. That year witnessed the retreat of the Armenian king due to a war with the Romans. Hence, the invasion of Syria by Tigranes, based on the account of Appian, probably took place in 83 BC. Bellinger dismissed this account, and considered that Appian confused AntiochusX with his son Antiochus XIII. Kuhn considered a confusion between father and son to be out of the question because Appian mentioned the epithet Eusebes when talking about the fate of Antiochus X. In the view of Kuhn, AntiochusX retreated to Cilicia after being defeated by Tigranes II, and his sons ruled that region after him and were reported visiting Rome in 73 BC. However, numismatic evidence proves that Demetrius III controlled Cilicia following the demise of Antiochus X, and that Tarsus minted coins in his name SE (88/87 BC). The Egyptologist Christopher J. Bennett, considered it possible that AntiochusX retreated to Ptolemais after being defeated by Tigranes since it became his widow&#x27;s base. In his history, Appian failed to mention the reigns of Demetrius III and Philip I in the capital which preceded the reign of Tigranes II. According to Hoover, Appian&#x27;s ignorance of the intervening kings between AntiochusX and Tigranes II might explain how he confused Antiochus XIII, who is known to have fled from the Armenian king, with his father.

Eusebius and others: According to Eusebius, who used the account of the third century historian Porphyry, AntiochusX was ejected from the capital by Philip I in 220 SE (93/92 BC) and fled to the Parthians. Eusebius added that following the Roman conquest of Syria, AntiochusX surrendered to Pompey, hoping to be reinstated on the throne, but the people of Antioch paid money to the Roman general to avoid a Seleucid restoration. AntiochusX was then invited by the people of Alexandria to rule jointly with the daughters of Ptolemy XII, but he died of illness soon after. This account has been questioned by many scholars, such as Hoover and Bellinger. The story told by Eusebius contains factual inaccuracies, as he wrote that in the same year AntiochusX was defeated by Philip I, he surrendered to Pompey, while at the same time Philip I was captured by the governor of Syria Aulus Gabinius. However, Pompey arrived in Syria only in 64 BC, and left it in 62 BC. Aulus Gabinius was appointed governor of Syria in 57 BC. Also, the part of Eusebius&#x27;s account regarding the surrender to Pompey echoes the fate of Antiochus XIII; the writer seems to be confusing the fate of AntiochusX with that of his son. The second century historian Justin, writing based on the work of the first century BC historian Trogus, also confused the father and son, as he wrote that AntiochusX was appointed king of Syria by the Roman general Lucullus following the defeat of Tigranes II in 69 BC.

== Succession ==

It is known from numismatic evidence that Demetrius III eventually succeeded AntiochusX in Antioch. Eusebius&#x27;s statement that AntiochusX was ejected from the capital by Philip I in 220 SE (93/92 BC) is contradicted by the coins of Demetrius III, who was not mentioned at all by Eusebius. Any suggestions that Philip I controlled Antioch before the demise of Demetrius III can be dismissed; in addition to the numismatic evidence, no ancient source claimed that Demetrius III had to push Philip I out of the city.

In 1949, a jugate coin of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII, from the collection of the French archaeologist Henri Arnold Seyrig, was dated by the historian Alfred Bellinger to 92BC and ascribed to Antioch. Based on Bellinger&#x27;s dating, some modern historians, such as Ehling, proposed that Cleopatra Selene enjoyed an ephemeral reign in Antioch between the death of her husband and the arrival of his successor. Bellinger doubted his own dating and the coin&#x27;s place of issue in 1952, suggesting Cilicia instead of Antioch. This coin is dated by many twenty-first century scholars to 82BC.

<doc id="168059" wikidata="Q231647" url="?curid=168059" title="Straitjacket">
<text>A straitjacket is a garment shaped like a jacket with long sleeves that surpass the tips of the wearer&#x27;s fingers. Its most typical use is restraining people who may cause harm to themselves or others. Once the wearer&#x27;s arms are in the sleeves, the person restraining the wearer crosses the sleeves against the chest and ties the ends of the sleeves to the back of the jacket, ensuring the arms are close to the chest with as little movement as possible.

Although &quot;straitjacket&quot; is the most common spelling, &quot;strait-jacket&quot; or &quot;straightjacket&quot; are also used. Straitjackets are also called camisoles or strait-waistcoats.

The effect of a straitjacket as a restraint makes it of special interest in escapology. The straitjacket is also a staple prop in stage magic.

The straitjacket comes from the Georgian era of medicine. Physical restraint was used both as treatment for mental illness and to pacify patients in understaffed asylums.

Due to their strength, canvas and duck cloth are the most common materials for institutional straitjackets.

==History==

The word &quot;strait&quot;, in this context, means &quot;confinement&quot;. 
The straitjacket is described as early as 1772, in a book by the Irish physician David Macbride, although there are claims an upholsterer named Guilleret invented it in 1790 France for Bicêtre Hospital. (See the &quot;French Wikipedia article,&quot; &quot;Camisole de force&quot;.)

Before the development of psychiatric medications and talking therapy, doctors did not know how to treat mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders. They attempted treatments that are cruel by modern standards, and the straitjacket was one of them. At the height of its use, doctors considered it more humane than restraints of ropes or chains. It prevented the patient from damaging clothes or furniture, and from injuring self, staff, or fellow inmates.

Before the American Civil War, the mentally ill were often in poorhouses, workhouses, or prisons when their families could no longer care for them. Patients were forced to live with criminals and treated likewise: locked in a cell or even chained to walls. By the 1860s, Americans wanted to provide better assistance to the less fortunate, including the mentally ill. The number of facilities devoted to the care of people with mental disorders saw a dramatic increase. These facilities, meant to be places of refuge, were called &quot;insane asylums&quot;. Between 1825 and 1865, the number of asylums in the United States increased from nine to sixty-two.

The establishment of asylums did not mean treatment improved. Because doctors did not understand what caused the behavior of their patients, they often listed the possible causes of mental illness as religious excitement, sunstroke, or even reading novels. They believed the patient had lost all control over their morals and strict discipline was necessary to help the patient regain self-control. Asylums often employed straitjackets to restrain patients who could not control themselves.

Many assessors, including Marie Ragone and Diane Fenex, considered straitjackets humane, gentler than prison chains. The restraint seemed to apply little to no pressure to the body or limbs and did not cause skin abrasions. Moreover, straitjackets allowed some freedom of movement. Unlike patients anchored to a chair or bed by straps or handcuffs, those in straitjackets could walk. Some registered nurse specialists even recommended restrained individuals stroll outdoors, thereby reaping the benefits of both control and fresh air.

Despite its popular consideration as humane, straitjackets were misused. Over time, asylums filled with patients and lacked adequate staff to provide proper care. The attendants were often ill-trained to work with the mentally ill and resorted to restraints to maintain order and calm. In fact, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some prisons even used straitjackets to punish or torture inmates.

Modified variants of the garment are still in use. A particular brand of straitjacket is called an &quot;Argentino&quot; suit, manufactured by PSP Argentino Inc. In Canada in 2015, there was a class action lawsuit that won over the misuse of the restraint.

==Security==

The security of a straitjacket depends very much on its size, which should be as small as practicable to be secure. A tight jacket at the chest and armpits will make it difficult for the wearer to pull the arms out of the sleeves.

The sleeves of the jacket are sewn shut at the ends—a significant restraint in itself because it restrains the use of the hands. The arms are folded across the front, with the ends of the sleeves wrapping around to fasten or tie behind the back. On some jackets, the sleeve-ends are anchored to the garment to allow the fastening or knot to rotate away from the wearer&#x27;s hands as they move their arms, making it more difficult to undo. Some straitjackets are designed to have the person&#x27;s arms crossed behind them rather than in front to ensure further restraint.

Most jackets feature a crotch-strap to prevent wearers from pulling off the jacket. Some bear loops at the front and/or sides; the sleeves are threaded through these to prevent the arms from being raised over the head. Friction buckles are used to fasten institutional jackets with webbing or cloth straps because they are difficult to open without a free pair of hands.

In stage magic, gimmicked jackets, made for magicians who practice escape stunts, omit arm loops, fasten with simpler buckles, and/or leave hidden openings in the sleeves.

==Safety==
Wearing an institutional straitjacket for long periods of time may cause pain for wearers. Blood pools in the elbows, causing swelling. The hands may become numb from lack of proper circulation. Bone and muscle stiffness causes the upper arms and shoulders to experience pain. Many wearers in these situations attempt to move and stretch their arms by thrashing around in their jackets, which is why institutions take great precautions, such as monitoring patients and conforming to strict protocols, when outfitting people in straitjackets.

==Escape techniques==
To remove a straitjacket with both back and crotch-straps, it is not necessary to be able to dislocate one&#x27;s shoulders in order to gain the slack necessary to pull an arm out of the sleeves. The necessity of this ability was fictitiously created by Harry Houdini and his brother Hardeen to try to lessen the amount of competition. Houdini later in his career published his technical handling of the escape in a newspaper. Escape artists around the world commonly continue this rumor to &quot;spice up&quot; the escape. Without dislocating the shoulder, it is sometimes possible to get more room by pulling at the inside of the arms as they are being strapped or by keeping an elbow held outward to gain slack in the sleeves when the arm is relaxed. Another way to gain slack is to take and hold a deep breath while the jacket is being done up.

It is possible for one person to put a willing volunteer into a straitjacket, but it generally takes at least two people to straitjacket a struggling person. 
For a jacket without a front strap, the most common way to escape is to hoist the arms over the head before undoing the crotch strap and at last the strap at the back of the neck. This allows the jacket to simply be peeled off upward over the head. The straitjacket escape was popularized by Houdini, who &quot;discovered&quot; it. Houdini first did it behind a curtain, forcing the audience to listen to thumps while watching a billowing curtain for many minutes. He found the trick went over better when the audience could see his struggles. In a few of his later and more popular acts, he performed the straitjacket escape while hung upside down from a crane, and also did the same when placed in a sealed milk can which was filled. Houdini&#x27;s (and many other illusionists) acts showed the straitjacket in action in a variety of ways.

===Notable escapes===

Straitjacket escape is one of the most sensational and famous magicians&#x27; tricks; it was a staple in illusionist Harry Houdini&#x27;s act. Thus, new world records for straitjacket escape are constantly being attempted, in various ways and with various degrees of difficulty added. Some of the more newsworthy attempts and successes include:

*On the 1980s weekly television show &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Live Wednesday&quot;, Steve &quot;Mr. Escape&quot; Baker successfully escaped from two straitjackets while hanging upside down over the stage.
*On &quot;Mindfreak&quot;, Criss Angel set a world record when he escaped from two straitjackets at once while hanging from a crane over Bourbon Street in New Orleans.
*On October 8, 2007, American Cliff Gerstman escaped from a straitjacket while floating in zero gravity. The escape was performed in an airplane flown by Zero G Inc. and sponsored by Northrop Grumman. This was the world&#x27;s first zero gravity straitjacket escape and took 40 seconds to complete.
*On September 4, 2010, on the Fox News channel show &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, Alexanderia the Great set a record for an extreme straitjacket escape. She escaped a regulation straitjacket secured with 50 feet of 1/4 inch chain and 10 padlocks in 2:37.
* On July 23, 2013, Alexanderia the Great performed an underwater straitjacket escape in a small bullet-proof clear tank in full view for &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, live on stage at Radio City Music Hall.
*The official &quot;Fastest Escape from a Regulated Posey Straitjacket&quot; is 2.84 seconds, set by Danilo Audiello at the Studio Fleming Medicina Generale, Foggia, Italy, on 11 August 2014.

<text>Philip I Epiphanes Philadelphus (; between 124 and 109 BC–83 or 75 BC) was a Hellenistic Seleucid monarch who reigned as the king of Syria from 94 to either 83 or 75 BC. The son of Antiochus VIII and his wife Tryphaena, he spent his early life in a period of civil war between his father and his uncle Antiochus IX. The conflict ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII; Antiochus IX took power in the Syrian capital Antioch, but soon fell in battle with Antiochus VIII&#x27;s eldest son Seleucus VI.

After the murder of Seleucus VI in 94 BC, Philip I became king with his twin brother Antiochus XI, and planned to avenge Seleucus VI. In 93 BC Antiochus XI took Antioch from Antiochus IX&#x27;s son Antiochus X. Antiochus XI became the senior king, and Philip I remained in a base in Cilicia. Antiochus X returned and killed Antiochus XI that year. Philip I then allied with his younger brother Demetrius III, who was based in Damascus. Antiochus X was probably killed in 88 BC. Demetrius III took the capital and besieged Philip I in Beroea (Aleppo), but the latter prevailed and took Antioch; their youngest brother Antiochus XII took Damascus.

Philip I tried unsuccessfully to take Damascus for himself, after which he disappears from the historical record; there is no information about when or how he died. The Antiochenes, apparently refusing to accept Philip I&#x27;s minor son Philip II as his successor, invited Tigranes II of Armenia to take the city. While the invasion of Tigranes II is traditionally dated to 83 BC, the year most scholars agree on for Philip I&#x27;s death, the conflict may have taken place in 74 BC. Numismatic evidence and clues in ancient contemporary literature indicate that Philip I might have died in 75 BC, giving Antiochus X&#x27;s widow Cleopatra Selene and her son Antiochus XIII, who probably took control of the south following the death of Antiochus XII in 82 BC, a year of claiming the whole kingdom. Philip I initiated monetary reforms, and his coins remained in circulation until the Romans conquered Syria in 64 BC. Thereafter, Roman authorities in Syria continued to issue coins modeled on Philip I&#x27;s coins, including his portrait, until 13 BC.

==Background, name and early life==

The Seleucid dynasty which ruled Syria following the death of Alexander the Great was plagued by dynastic feuds during the 2nd century BC, exacerbated by Ptolemaic and Roman interference. Dynastic marriage was used to maintain a degree of peace between Ptolemaic Egypt and Syria; Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Thea became the consort of three successive Syrian kings in 150, 145 and 138 BC. Syria gradually disintegrated due to constant civil wars, as the Seleucid kings and their heirs fought for power, tearing the country apart. This lasted until about 123 BC, when Antiochus VIII provided a degree of stability which lasted for a decade until his brother Antiochus IX declared himself king.

With his Ptolemaic wife Tryphaena, whom he married in 124 BC, Antiochus VIII fathered five sons: Seleucus VI, the eldest; Antiochus XI and Philip I, who were apparently twins; their younger brother, Demetrius III; and the youngest, Antiochus XII. The name Philip (Greek &quot;Phílippos&quot;) means &quot;lover of horses&quot;. Seleucid kings were mostly named Seleucus and Antiochus; &quot;Philip&quot; was used by the Antigonid dynasty as a royal name, and its use by the Seleucids, who were descended from the Antigonids through Queen Stratonice, was probably meant to signify that they were heirs of the latter. The war with Antiochus IX claimed Tryphaena&#x27;s life in 109 BC. Following Antiochus VIII&#x27;s assassination in 96 BC, his second wife, Tryphaena&#x27;s sister Cleopatra Selene, married Antiochus IX, who took Antioch. Antiochus VIII&#x27;s sons did not submit to their uncle; Seleucus VI took Antioch in 95 BC after killing Antiochus IX, while Demetrius III seized and ruled Damascus. Antiochus IX&#x27;s son Antiochus X married Cleopatra Selene and defeated Seleucus VI, who escaped to Mopsuestia, where he was killed by rebels in 94 BC.

==Reign==

Philip I and Antiochus XI probably resided in Cilicia during Seleucus VI&#x27;s reign. In 94 BC, shortly after their brother&#x27;s death, Philip I and Antiochus XI minted jugate coins with their portraits on the obverse. The historian Alfred Bellinger suggested that their base of operations was a coastal city north of Antioch, but according to the numismatist Arthur Houghton, Beroea is a stronger candidate because the city&#x27;s rulers were Philip I&#x27;s allies. All the jugate coins were minted in Cilicia; the series with the most numerous surviving specimens was probably issued in Tarsus, making it the likely base of operations. Antiochus XI was portrayed in front of his brother, indicating that he was the senior king. Deriving their legitimacy from Antiochus VIII, the brothers were depicted on the coins with exaggerated aquiline noses similar to their father. Hellenistic kings did not use regnal numbers, which is a modern practise; instead, they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs. On his coins, Philip I used the epithets Philadelphus (sibling-loving) and Epiphanes (the glorious, or illustrious). The brothers intended to avenge Seleucus VI; according to the fourth century writer Eusebius, they sacked Mopsuestia and destroyed it.

===Reign in Cilicia and Beroea===

While Philip I remained in Cilicia, Antiochus XI advanced on Antioch and drove Antiochus X from the city in the beginning of 93 BC. Philip I did not live in the Syrian metropolis and left Antiochus XI as master of the capital. By autumn 93 BC, Antiochus X regrouped and defeated Antiochus XI, who drowned in the Orontes. The first century historian Josephus mentioned only Antiochus XI in the battle, but Eusebius wrote that Philip I was also present. Bellinger believed that Philip I&#x27;s troops participated, but that he remained behind at his base, since only Antiochus XI was killed. Following the defeat, Philip I is thought to have retreated to his capital, which was probably the same base from which he and his brother operated when they first prepared to avenge Seleucus VI. Antiochus X eventually controlled Cilicia, and Philip I probably took Beroea as his base.

Demetrius III may have marched north to support Antiochus XI in the battle of 93 BC, and he certainly supported Philip I in the struggle against Antiochus X. Eusebius wrote that Philip I defeated Antiochus X and replaced him in the capital in 93/92 BC (220 SE (Seleucid year)). However, Eusebius does not note the reign of Antiochus XI or mention Demetrius III. The account contradicts archaeological evidence, represented in a market weight belonging to Antiochus X from 92 BC, and contains factual mistakes. The English minister and numismatist Edgar Rogers believed that Philip I ruled Antioch immediately after Antiochus XI, but suggestions that Philip I controlled Antioch before the demise of Antiochus X and Demetrius III can be dismissed; they contradict the numismatic evidence, and no ancient source claimed that Demetrius III, who actually succeeded Antiochus X in Antioch, had to push Philip I out of the city.

In any case, Antiochus X disappeared from the record after 92 BC, but could have remained in power until 224 SE (89/88 BC); he probably died fighting against Parthia. Taking advantage of Antiochus X&#x27;s death, Demetrius III rushed to the capital and occupied it; this led Philip I to break his alliance with his brother. With most of Syria in the hands of Demetrius III, Philip I retreated to his base. In 88 BC, Demetrius III marched on Beroea for the final battle with Philip I. To raise the siege, Philip I&#x27;s ally Straton, the ruler of Beroea, called on the Arab phylarch Aziz and the Parthian governor Mithridates Sinaces for help. The allies defeated Demetrius III, who was sent into captivity in Parthia. Any captive who was a citizen of Antioch was released without a ransom, a gesture which must have eased Philip I&#x27;s occupation of Antioch.

===Reign in the capital===

Shortly after the battle, in late 88 BC or early 87 BC, Philip I entered the Syrian capital, and had Cilicia under his authority. He was faced with the need to replenish the empty treasury to rebuild a country destroyed after years of civil war, and in case a new pretender to the throne arose. Those factors, combined with the low estimates of annual coin dies used by Philip I&#x27;s immediate predecessors in Antioch—Antiochus X (his second reign) and Demetrius III—compared with the general die estimates of late Seleucid kings, led numismatist Oliver D. Hoover to propose that Philip I simply re-coined his predecessors&#x27; coins and skewed their dies. This resulted in currency bearing Philip I&#x27;s image, reduced in weight from the standard to . This yielded a profit of half an obol on each older coin which was re-struck. Profit was, however, not the main aim of Philip I; it is more probable that he wanted to pay his troops with coins bearing his own image instead of that of his rivals. The recoinage was also necessary since Philip I&#x27;s coins were reduced in weight and the king needed to enforce the use of his currency by removing his rivals&#x27; heavier coins out of circulation. Philip I may have adopted the New Seleucid era dating, which have the return of Antiochus VIII from his exile in Aspendos in 200 SE (113/112 BC) as a starting point; the traditional Seleucid era started in 1 SE (312/311 BC).

Philip I&#x27;s position on the throne was insecure: Cleopatra Selene hid in Syria with Antiochus XIII, her son by Antiochus X, waiting for an opportunity to regain the throne, while Antiochus XII replaced Demetrius III in Damascus, but there is no evidence that he sought to compete with his brother for Antioch. According to Josephus, Philip I took advantage of Antiochus XII&#x27;s absence in a campaign against Nabataea to seize Damascus. The governor of the city—Milesius, who opened the gates for the Philip I—was not given a suitable reward by his new master, leading him to wait until Philip I left the city; he then closed the gates, locking the king out until Antiochus XII returned. In the Seleucid dynasty, currency struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper) showed the king with a beard. Antiochus XII was shown beardless for the first two years of his reign; in 228 SE (85/84 BC), he appeared with a beard, possibly related to Philip I&#x27;s attack on Damascus. But since Antiochus XII did not march north against his brother, the hypothesis about a connection between Antiochus XII&#x27; beard and Philip I&#x27;s attempt to take Damascus weakens; no coins of Philip I were struck in Damascus, indicating that his occupation of the city was brief.

==End and succession==
After the attack on Damascus, Philip I disappeared from ancient literature. Without proof, 83 BC is commonly accepted as Philip I&#x27;s year of death by most scholars; he could have been buried in the Nikatoreion Mausoleum, Seleucia Pieria. Traditionally, Philip I is considered by most scholars to have been succeeded by Tigranes II of Armenia, who was invited by the people of Antioch despite the existence of Philip I&#x27;s probably-minor son Philip II. The second century historian Appian assigned a fourteen-year reign to Tigranes II which ended in 69 BC, and most scholars accepted the ancient historian&#x27;s version, hence the date 83 BC. The fate of Philip I is a source of debate in academic circles, as no clues regarding how, where, and when, his life ended, exist. Many theories were presented by different historians:

* Escaped to Cilicia: An inscription of Philip II was found in Olba, the capital of a Cilician priestly principality. Historian Auguste Bouché-Leclercq concluded that Philip I could not have returned to the capital following his defeat in Damascus because the populace became weary of the endless Seleucid dynastic quarrels. Bouché-Leclercq conjectured, based on the inscription of his son, that Philip I might have escaped to Cilicia and died in the chaos caused by the Second Mithridatic War (83–81 BC) between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Rome. Another possibility is that Philip I was preparing to take back his throne after the death of Antiochus XII (d. 82 BC), but was caught off guard by the arrival of Tigranes II and put to death in Cilicia. Historian Theodora Stillwell MacKay suggested that Philip I fled to Olba following his confrontation with Antiochus XII. The epigraphers Josef Keil and Adolf Wilhelm suggested that Philip I stayed with the priest-prince of the city.
* Peaceful long reign: according to Bellinger, the silence of ancient literature might be an indication of a peaceful reign that was perhaps facilitated by Philip I&#x27;s alliance with Parthia; this would explain the massive amount of silver coinage produced by Philip I found as far as Dura-Europos, which was under Parthian rule. Appian&#x27;s account is flawed, and contradicts contemporary accounts, notably the Roman statesman Cicero, who wrote in 75 BC that Cleopatra Selene sent Antiochus XIII to Rome to appeal for his right to the Egyptian throne; he did not have to appeal for his rights to Syria which, in the words of Cicero, he inherited from his ancestors. Cleopatra Selene and her son probably took advantage of Antiochus XII&#x27;s death in 82 BC to assume control of the south; the statement of Cicero indicates that in 75 BC, Tigranes II was still not in control of Syria, for if he were, Antiochus XIII would have asked the Roman Senate for support to regain Syria, since Tigranes II was the son-in-law of Rome&#x27;s enemy, Mithridates VI. Likewise, Philip I could not have been alive since Antiochus XIII went to Rome without having to assert his right to Syria.

:The argument for a later Armenian invasion is corroborated by Josephus, who wrote that the Jews heard about the Armenian invasion and Tigranes II&#x27;s plans to attack Judea only during the reign of the Hasmonean queen Salome Alexandra, which began in 76 BC; it would be odd if Tigranes II took control of Syria in 83 BC and the Jews learned about it only after 76 BC. Another point of argument is the massive quantity of coinage left by Philip I, which could not have been produced if his reign was short and ended in 83 BC. In light of this, Hoover proposed 75 BC, or slightly earlier, as Philip I&#x27;s last year; this would be in line with Cicero&#x27;s statement about Antiochus XIII. Hoover suggested the year 74 BC as the date of Tigranes II&#x27;s invasion, giving Cleopatra Selene and her son time to claim the whole country.

==Legacy==

Philip I&#x27;s coins were still in circulation when the Romans annexed Syria in 64 BC. The first Roman coins struck in Syria were copies of Philip I&#x27;s coins, and bore his image with the monogram of the Roman governor. The first issue was in 57 BC under governor Aulus Gabinius, and the last series of Philip I&#x27;s posthumous coins was minted in 13 BC. The Romans may have considered Philip I the last legitimate Seleucid king, a theory held by Kevin Butcher and other scholars. Hoover opted for a simpler answer; Philip I&#x27;s coins were the most numerous and earlier Seleucid coin models were destroyed, making it economically sensible for the Romans to continue Philip I&#x27;s model. Anomalous coins of Philip, differing from his standard lifetime models but similar to the later Roman Philip coins, indicate that they might have been minted by the autonomous city of Antioch between 64 and 58 BC before governor Aulus Gabinius issued his Philipean coins, making it viable for the Romans to continue minting coins already being struck.

<text>Handcuffs are restraint devices designed to secure an individual&#x27;s wrists in proximity to each other. They comprise two parts, linked together by a chain, a hinge, or rigid bar. Each cuff has a rotating arm which engages with a ratchet that prevents it from being opened once closed around a person&#x27;s wrist. Without a key, handcuffs cannot be removed without specialist knowledge, and a handcuffed person cannot move their wrists more than a few centimetres or inches apart, making many tasks difficult or impossible.

Handcuffs are frequently used by law enforcement agencies worldwide to prevent suspected criminals from escaping from police custody.

==Styles==
=== Metal handcuffs ===

There are three main types of contemporary metal handcuffs: chain (cuffs are held together by a short chain), hinged (since hinged handcuffs permit less movement than a chain cuff, they are generally considered to be more secure), and rigid solid bar handcuffs. While bulkier to carry, rigid handcuffs permit several variations in cuffing. Hiatts Speedcuffs are rigid handcuffs used by most police forces in the United Kingdom. Both rigid and hinged cuffs can be used one-handed to apply pain-compliance/control techniques that are not workable with the chain type of cuff. Various accessories are available to improve the security or increase the rigidity of handcuffs, including boxes that fit over the chain or hinge and can themselves be locked with a padlock.

In 1933 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used a type called &quot;Mitten Handcuffs&quot; to prevent criminals from being able to grab an object like the officer&#x27;s gun. While used by some in law enforcement it was never popular.

Handcuffs may be manufactured from various metals, including carbon steel, stainless steel and aluminium, or from synthetic polymers.

Sometimes two pairs of handcuffs are needed to restrain a person with an exceptionally large waistline because the hands cannot be brought close enough together; in this case, one cuff on one pair of handcuffs is handcuffed to one of the cuffs on the other pair, and then the remaining open handcuff on each pair is applied to the person&#x27;s wrists. Oversized handcuffs are available from a number of manufacturers.

The National Museum of Australia has a number of handcuffs in its collection dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These include &#x27;T&#x27;-type &#x27;Come Along&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;-type and &#x27;Figure-8&#x27; handcuffs.

===Plastic handcuffs===

Plastic restraints, known as wrist ties, riot cuffs, plasticuffs, flexicuffs, flex-cuffs, tri-fold cuffs, zapstraps, zipcuffs, or zip-strips, are lightweight, disposable plastic strips resembling electrical cable ties. They can be carried in large quantities by soldiers and police and are therefore well-suited for situations where many may be needed, such as during large-scale protests and riots. In recent years, airlines have begun to carry plastic handcuffs as a way to restrain disruptive passengers. Disposable restraints could be considered to be cost-inefficient; they cannot be loosened, and must be cut off to permit a restrained subject to be fingerprinted, or to attend to bodily functions. It is not unheard of for a single subject to receive five or more sets of disposable restraints in their first few hours in custody.

However, aforementioned usage means that cheap handcuffs are available in situations where steel ones would normally lie unused for long times. Recent products have been introduced that serve to address this concern, including disposable plastic restraints that can be opened or loosened with a key; more expensive than conventional plastic restraints, they can only be used a very limited number of times, and are not as strong as conventional disposable restraints, let alone modern metal handcuffs. In addition, plastic restraints are believed by many to be more likely to inflict nerve or soft-tissue damage to the wearer than metal handcuffs.

===Legcuffs===
Legcuffs are similar to handcuffs, but have a larger inner perimeter so that they fit around a person&#x27;s ankles. Some models consist of elliptically contoured cuffs so that they widely adapt to the anatomy of the ankle, minimizing pressure on the Achilles&#x27; tendon. Standard-type leg irons have a longer chain connecting the two cuffs compared to handcuffs.

On occasions when a suspect exhibits extremely aggressive behavior, leg irons may be used in addition to handcuffs; sometimes the chain connecting the leg irons to one another is looped around the chain of the handcuffs, and then the leg irons are applied, resulting in the person being &quot;hog-tied&quot;. In a few rare cases, hog-tied persons lying on their stomachs have died from positional asphyxia, making the practice highly controversial, and leading to its being severely restricted, or even completely banned, in many localities.

Legcuffs are also used when transporting prisoners outside of a secure area to prevent attempts to escape. When being placed in standard legcuffs, the prisoner will still have the possibility to manage normal steps and can therefore walk independently, but is prevented from running. When the connecting chain between the legcuffs is shortened, the prisoner will have even difficulties to walk so that the flight risk is further minimized. In this case, the prisoner will have to be carried by the transporting officers or has to be moved in a wheelchair.

In some countries, prisoners are permanently shackled with legcuffs even when they are held in their cells. Such a long term use of leg shackles may soon result in pressure marks on the prisoner&#x27;s ankles and will cause serious harm. Therefore, such a treatment of prisoners is commonly considered a cruel and unusual punishment.

=== Combinations ===

Some prisoners being transported from custody to outside locations, for appearances at court, to medical facilities, etc., will wear handcuffs augmented with a belly chain. In this type of arrangement a metal, leather, or canvas belt is attached to the waist, sometimes with a locking mechanism. The handcuffs are secured to the belly chain and the prisoner&#x27;s hands are kept at waist level. This allows a relative degree of comfort for the prisoner during prolonged internment in the securing device, while providing a greater degree of restriction to movement than simply placing the handcuffs on the wrists in the front. When the handcuffs are concealed by a handcuff cover and secured at the prisoner&#x27;s waist by a belly chain, this combination will result in a rather more severe restraint and the restrained person may feel discomfort or even pain.

For added security, some transport restraints have a pair of leg irons connected to a pair of handcuffs or a belly chain by a longer connector chain. These combinations further restrict the detainee&#x27;s freedom of movement and prevent them from escaping.

== Security ==

=== Double locks ===
Handcuffs with double locks have a detent which when engaged stops the cuff from ratcheting tighter to prevent the wearer from tightening them. Tightening could be intentional or by struggling; if tightened, the handcuffs may cause nerve damage or loss of circulation. Also some wearers could tighten the cuffs to attempt an escape by having the officer loosen the cuffs and attempting to escape while the cuffs are loose. Double locks also make picking the locks more difficult.

There exist three kinds of double locks as described in a Smith &amp; Wesson brochure:

;Lever lock: Movement of a lever on the cuff causes the detent to move into a position that locks the bolt. No tool is required to double lock this type of cuff.
;Push pin lock: A small peg on the key is inserted endwise into a hole to engage the detent.
;Slot lock: These also are actuated with a peg, but in this case it is inserted into a slot and moved sideways to engage the detent.

Double locks are generally disengaged by inserting the key and rotating it in the opposite direction from that used to unlock the cuff.

===Keys===
Most modern handcuffs in the United States, the United Kingdom and Latin America can be opened with the same standard universal handcuff key. This allows for easier transport of prisoners. However, there are handcuff makers who use keys based on different standards. Maximum security handcuffs require special keys. Handcuff keys usually do not work with thumbcuffs. The Cuff Lock handcuff key padlock uses this same standard key.

To prevent the restrained person from eventually opening the handcuffs with a handcuff key, a handcuff cover may be used to conceal the keyholes of the handcuffs.

===Hinged and Rigid Handcuffs===

When applied behind the back with keyholes away from the hands, handcuffs connected by a hinge or rigid bar are much more secure than handcuffs connected by a chain. Even with a key in hand it is difficult or impossible to reach the keyholes with it.

==Hand positioning==
In the past, police officers typically handcuffed an arrested person with their hands in front, but since approximately the mid-1960s behind-the-back handcuffing has been the standard. The vast majority of police academies in the United States today also teach their recruits to apply handcuffs so that the palms of the suspect&#x27;s hands face outward after the handcuffs are applied. The Jacksonville, Florida Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and others are notable exceptions, as they favor palms-together handcuffing. This helps prevent radial neuropathy or handcuff neuropathy during extended periods of restraint. Suspects are handcuffed with the keyholes facing up (away from the hands) to make it difficult to open them even with a key or improvised lock-pick.

Because a person&#x27;s hands are used in breaking falls, being handcuffed introduces a significant risk of injury if the prisoner trips or stumbles, in addition to injuries sustained from overly tight handcuffs causing handcuff neuropathy. Police officers having custody of the person need to be ready to catch a stumbling prisoner.

As soon as restraints go on, the officer has full liability. The risk of the prisoner losing balance is higher if the hands are handcuffed behind the back than if they are handcuffed in front; however, the risk of using fisted hands together as a weapon increases with hands in front.

==Escaping==
Since handcuffs are only intended as temporary restraints, they are not the most complicated of locks.

There are several ways of escaping from handcuffs:

# slipping hands out when the hands are smaller than the wrist
#lock picking
# releasing the pawl with a shim
# opening the handcuffs with a duplicate key, often hidden on the body of the performer before the performance.

The above methods are often used in escapology. As most people&#x27;s hands are larger than their wrists, the first method was much easier before the invention of modern ratchet cuffs, which can be adjusted to a variety of sizes. Modern handcuffs are generally ratcheted until they are too tight to be slipped off the hands. However, slipping out of ratchet cuffs is still possible. During his shows, Harry Houdini was frequently secured with multiple pairs of handcuffs. Any pair that was too difficult to be picked was placed on his upper arms. Being very muscular, his upper arms were far larger than his hands. Once he had picked the locks on the lower pairs of handcuffs, the upper pair could simply be slipped off.

It is also technically possible to break free from handcuffs by applying massive amounts of force from one&#x27;s arms to cause the device to split apart or loosen enough to squeeze one&#x27;s hands through; however, this takes exceptional strength (especially with handcuffs made of steel). This also puts an immense amount of pressure on the biceps and triceps muscles, and when tried by suspects (even unsuccessfully) can lead to injury, including bruising around the wrists, or tearing the muscles used (including pulling them off their attachments to the bones).

Another common method of escaping (or attempting to escape) from being handcuffed behind the back, is that one would, from a sitting or lying position, bring one&#x27;s legs up as high upon one&#x27;s torso as possible, then push one&#x27;s arms down to bring the handcuffs below one&#x27;s feet, finally pulling the handcuffs up using one&#x27;s arms to the front of one&#x27;s body. This can lead to awkward or painful positions depending on how the handcuffs were applied, and typically requires a good amount of flexibility. It can also be done from a standing position, where, with some degree of effort, the handcuffed hands are slid around the hips and down the buttocks to the feet; then sliding each foot up and over the cuffs. These maneuvers, and the reverse (otherwise impossible) maneuver of bringing the handcuffed hands up behind the back and forwards over the head and then down in front, can be done fairly easily by some people who were born without collarbones because of the inherited deformity called cleidocranial dysostosis.

From this position, one has a better chance of attempting to use a tool (such as a shim or lockpick) to work one&#x27;s way out of the handcuffs.

==National regulations regarding depiction of handcuffed suspects==

In Japan, if an arrested suspect of crime was photographed or filmed while handcuffed, their hands have to be pixelated if it is used on TV or in the newspapers. This is because Kazuyoshi Miura, who had been arrested on suspicion of the murder of his wife, brought a successful case to court arguing that being pictured in handcuffs implied guilt, and had prejudiced the trial.

Similarly, in France, a law prohibits media from airing images of people in handcuffs, or otherwise restrained, before they have been convicted by a court. Also in Italy the Code of criminal procedure prohibits the publication of images of people deprived of personal liberty while they are handcuffed or subjected to other means of physical coercion. According to the Italian independent authority on data protection, the same prohibition applies when the image of the handcuffs is pixelated.

In Hong Kong, people being arrested and led away in handcuffs are usually given the chance by the policemen to have their heads covered by a black cloth bag.

In Sri Lanka, women are generally not handcuffed by the police.

The High Court in Windhoek, Namibia, prohibited in mid July 2020 the use of handcuffs under any circumstances, as it violates the constitution.

==Use in BDSM==
Police handcuffs are sometimes used in sexual bondage and BDSM activities. This is potentially unsafe, because they were not designed for this purpose, and their use can result in nerve injury (handcuff neuropathy) or other tissue damage. Bondage cuffs were designed specifically for this application. They were designed using the same model of soft restraints used on psychiatric patients because they can be worn for long periods of time. Many such models can be fastened shut with padlocks.

==Metaphorical uses==
Handcuffs are familiar enough for the word to be used in metaphors, e.g.:
* Golden handcuffs – an incentive given to an employee by a firm, most or all of which must be repaid to the company if the employee leaves the firm within a specified period of time.
* As a verb, meaning to be kept from doing something by another&#x27;s action or inaction – &quot;He said that his computer work is &quot;handcuffed&quot; by his internet provider&#x27;s refusal to accept .zip files.&quot;
* In fantasy football, one strategy is to have both a star player and his backup, or &quot;handcuff&quot;, on a team&#x27;s roster of players. If the star is injured, the handcuff will be his likely replacement.
* One of the Spanish terms for &quot;handcuffs&quot;, , literally means &quot;wives, (female) spouses&quot;.

==Handcuffs gesture==

In the &#x27;handcuffs gesture&#x27; the arms are crossed at the wrists in front of the chest, to represent being handcuffed. Uses are:
* By police, to mean &quot;Allow yourself to be handcuffed&quot;.
* It has been known to be used to mean &quot;We support our comrade who has been arrested&quot;.
* By José Mourinho at a football match at F.C. Internazionale Milano.

<doc id="168079" wikidata="Q176883" url="?curid=168079" title="2010 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 2010 FIFA World Cup was the 19th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men&#x27;s national football teams. It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.

The matches were played in 10 stadiums in nine host cities around the country, with the opening and final played at the Soccer City stadium in South Africa&#x27;s largest city, Johannesburg. Thirty-two teams were selected for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.

In the final, Spain, the European champions, beat third-time losing finalists the Netherlands 1–0 after extra time to win their first world title. Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa were eliminated in the group stage, as were both 2006 World Cup finalists, Italy and France. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first stage. New Zealand, with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were also eliminated in the group stage.


==Host selection==
Africa was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived rotation policy, abandoned in 2007, to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.

Following the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya&#x27;s solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official &quot;List of Requirements&quot;.

The winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament. Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football &quot;made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in&quot;. With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

During 2006 and 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country. Franz Beckenbauer, Horst R. Schmidt, and, reportedly, some FIFA executives expressed concern over the planning, organisation, and pace of South Africa&#x27;s preparations. FIFA officials repeatedly expressed their confidence in South Africa as host, stating that a contingency plan existed only to cover natural catastrophes, as had been in place at previous FIFA World Cups.

===Bribery and corruption===
On 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.

On 4 June 2015, FIFA executive Chuck Blazer, having co-operated with the FBI and the Swiss authorities, confirmed that he and the other members of FIFA&#x27;s executive committee were bribed in order to promote the South African 1998 and 2010 World Cup bids. Blazer stated, &quot;I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.&quot;

On 6 June 2015, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Morocco had actually won the vote, but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead.

==Qualification==

The qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in Durban on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, South Africa qualified automatically for the tournament. As in the previous tournament, the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and Italy had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the 2008 Summer Olympics the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.

Some controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match, and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant. As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee&#x27;s assistants for the South African tournament.
Costa Rica complained over Uruguay&#x27;s winning goal in the CONMEBOL–CONCACAF playoff, while Egypt and Algeria&#x27;s November 2009 matches were surrounded by reports of crowd trouble. On the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:
Slovakia was making its first appearance as an independent nation but had previously been represented as part of the Czechoslovakia team that had last played in the 1990 tournament; North Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; Honduras and New Zealand were both making their first appearances since 1982; Algeria were at the finals for the first time since the 1986 competition; and Greece qualified for the first time since 1994. Serbia also made its first appearance as an independent nation, having previously been present as Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930, as SFR Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1990, as FR Yugoslavia in 1998 and as Serbia and Montenegro in 2006.

Teams that failed to qualify for this tournament included Saudi Arabia, which had qualified for the previous four tournaments; Tunisia and Croatia, both of whom had qualified for the previous three finals; Costa Rica, Ecuador, Poland and Sweden, who had qualified for the previous two editions; 2006 quarter-finalists Ukraine and Euro 2008 semi-finalists Russia and Turkey. The highest ranked team not to qualify was Croatia (ranked 10th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was North Korea (ranked 105th).

, this was the last time South Africa, New Zealand, North Korea, Paraguay, Slovakia and Slovenia qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Costa Rica, Iran, Belgium, and Croatia (only time) failed to qualify.

==Preparations==

Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be R8.4 billion (just over US$1 billion or €950 million).

South Africa also improved its public transport infrastructure within the host cities, including Johannesburg&#x27;s Gautrain and other metro systems, and major road networks were improved. In March 2009, Danny Jordaan, the president of the 2010 World Cup organising committee, reported that all stadiums for the tournament were on schedule to be completed within six months.

The country implemented special measures to ensure the safety and security of spectators in accordance with standard FIFA requirements, including a temporary restriction of flight operation in the airspace surrounding the stadiums.

At a ceremony to mark 100 days before the event, FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised the readiness of the country for the event.

===Construction strike===
On 8 July 2009, 70,000 construction workers who were working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs. The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the &quot;no work no pay&quot; strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011. The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were back at work within a week of it starting. There were no further strikes and all stadiums and construction projects were completed in time for the kick off.

==Prize money==
The total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$420 million (including payments of US$40 million to domestic clubs), a 60 percent increase on the 2006 tournament. Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received US$1 million for preparation costs. Once at the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:
* US$8 million – To each team eliminated at the group stage (16 teams) ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$9 million – To each team eliminated in the round of 16 (8 teams) ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$14 million – To each team eliminated in the quarter-finals (4 teams) ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$18 million – Fourth placed team ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$20 million – Third placed team ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$24 million – Runner up ($ million in 2025 US dollars)
* US$30 million – Winner ($ million in 2025 US dollars)

In a first for the World Cup, FIFA made payments to the domestic clubs of the players representing their national teams at the tournament. This saw a total of US$40 million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the G-14 group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club Charleroi S.C. for injury to Morocco&#x27;s Abdelmajid Oulmers in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club Newcastle United for an injury to England&#x27;s Michael Owen in the 2006 World Cup.

==Venues==
In 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of 13 venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nelspruit, Orkney, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg. This was narrowed down to the ten venues that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006.

The altitude of several venues affected the motion of the ball and player performance, although FIFA&#x27;s medical chief downplayed this consideration. Six of the ten venues were over above sea level, with the two Johannesburg venues—FNB Stadium (also known as Soccer City) and Ellis Park Stadium—the highest at approximately .

FNB Stadium, Cape Town Stadium, and Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth were the most-used venues, each hosting eight matches. Ellis Park Stadium and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban hosted seven matches each, while Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg hosted six matches each. Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane and Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit hosted four matches each, but did not host any knockout-stage matches.

The following stadiums were all upgraded to meet FIFA specifications:
* Cecil Payne Stadium
* Dobsonville Stadium
* Gelvandale Stadium
* Giant Stadium
* HM Pitje Stadium

* King Zwelithini Stadium
* Olympia Park Stadium
* Orlando Stadium
* Princess Magogo Stadium
* Rabie Ridge Stadium

* Rand Stadium
* Ruimsig Stadium
* Seisa Ramabodu Stadium
* Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium
* Super Stadium
===Team base camps===
The base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In February 2010, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team. Fifteen teams were in Gauteng Province, while six teams were based in KwaZulu-Natal, four in the Western Cape, three in North West Province, and one each in Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, and the Northern Cape.

==Final draw==

The FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, except allowing a maximum of two European teams in a group.

The group draw was staged in Cape Town, South Africa, on 4 December 2009 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. The ceremony was presented by South African actress Charlize Theron, assisted by FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke. The balls were drawn by English football star David Beckham and African sporting figures Haile Gebrselassie, John Smit, Makhaya Ntini, Matthew Booth and Simphiwe Dludlu.

==Opening ceremony==
==Referees==

FIFA&#x27;s Referees&#x27; Committee selected 29 referees through its Refereeing Assistance Programme to officiate at the World Cup: four from the AFC, three from the CAF, six from CONMEBOL, four from CONCACAF, two from the OFC, and ten from UEFA. English referee Howard Webb was chosen to referee the final, making him the first person to referee both the UEFA Champions League final and the World Cup final in the same year.

==Squads==
As with the 2006 tournament, each team&#x27;s squad for the 2010 World Cup consisted of 23 players. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.

Of the 736 players participating in the tournament, over half played their club football in five European domestic leagues; those in England (117 players), Germany (84), Italy (80), Spain (59) and France (46). The English, German and Italian squads were made up of entirely home based players, while only Nigeria had no players from clubs in their own league. In all, players from 52 national leagues entered the tournament. FC Barcelona of Spain was the club contributing the most players to the tournament, with 13 players of their side travelling, 7 with the Spanish team, while another 7 clubs contributed 10 players or more.

In another first for South Africa 2010, one squad included three siblings. Jerry, Johnny, and Wilson Palacios made history thanks to their inclusion in Honduras&#x27;s 23-man list. Unusually, the game between Germany and Ghana had two brothers playing for opposite nations, with Jérôme Boateng and Kevin-Prince Boateng playing respectively.

==Match summary==
The 32 national teams involved in the tournament together played a total of 64 matches starting from the group stage matches and progressing to the knockout stage matches, with teams eliminated through the various progressive stages. Rest days were allocated during the various stages to allow players recovery during the tournament. Preliminary events were also held in celebration of the World Cup event. All times listed in the table below are in South African Standard Time (UTC+02).

==Group stage==
&quot;All times are South Africa Standard Time (UTC+2).&quot;

The tournament match schedule was announced in November 2007. In the first round, or group stage, the 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with each team playing the other three teams in their group once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16.

The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the round of 16 (four as group winners), and four further advancing to the quarter-finals. However, only Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.

Of the six African teams, only Ghana advanced to the round of 16. South Africa became the first host nation in World Cup history to be eliminated in the first round, despite beating France and drawing with Mexico, while Ghana and Ivory Coast were the only other African teams to win a match. The overall performance of the African teams, in the first World Cup to be hosted on the continent, was judged as disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great Roger Milla.

Only six out of the thirteen UEFA teams advanced to the round of 16, a record low since the introduction of this stage in 1986. Nonetheless, the final was contested by two European teams. In another World Cup first, the two finalists from the preceding tournament, Italy and France, were eliminated at the group stage, with Italy becoming the third defending champions to be eliminated in the first round after Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002. New Zealand, one of the lowest-ranked teams, surprised many by drawing all three of their group matches, ending the tournament as the only undefeated team.

==Knockout stage==

&quot;All times listed are South African Standard Time (UTC+2).&quot;

The knockout stage comprised the 16 teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of extra time; if scores were still level, there was a penalty shoot-out to determine who progressed to the next round.

===Bracket===
===Round of 16===
In this round, each group winner (A to H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.
* South American teams again performed strongly in the round of 16, with four teams advancing to the quarter-finals including Brazil who defeated fellow South Americans Chile.
* European teams performed even more strongly in the sense that all matches between a European and a non-European team were won by the European team. In the previous edition (2006), they had also achieved this.
* England&#x27;s 4–1 loss to Germany was their biggest ever margin of defeat at a World Cup finals. It was also the first time that a World Cup finals match between these two traditional rivals had a decisive result in regulation time, their three previous meetings all being tied at 90 minutes, with two settled in extra time and one in a penalty shoot-out.
* Ghana defeated the United States after extra time to become the third African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002), and the only African team to have achieved both a top 8 finish and a separate top 16 finish (in 2006).
* Paraguay and Ghana reached the quarter-finals for the first time.

The round was marked by some controversial referees&#x27; decisions, including:
* A disallowed goal by England in their 4–1 loss against Germany, where the shot by Frank Lampard was seen to cross substantially over the goal line when shown on television broadcast replays.
* An allowed goal by Argentina in their 3–1 win over Mexico, where Argentine striker Carlos Tevez was seen to be offside when shown on television broadcast replays, which were shown inside the stadium shortly after the incident.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: &quot;Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees&#x27; mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.&quot; Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: &quot;We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.&quot; Blatter&#x27;s call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.
----







===Quarter-finals===
The three quarter-finals between European and South American teams all resulted in wins for Europeans. Germany had a 4–0 victory over Argentina, and the Netherlands came from behind to beat Brazil 2–1, handing the Brazilians their first loss in a World Cup match held outside Europe (other than in a penalty shoot-out) since 1950 when Uruguay won the decisive match 2–1. Spain reached the final four for the first time since 1950 after a 1–0 win over Paraguay. Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time after Luis Suárez controversially handled the ball on the line.
----



===Semi-finals===
The Netherlands qualified for the final for the third time with a 3–2 win over Uruguay. Spain reached their first ever final with a 1–0 victory over Germany. As a result, it was the first World Cup final not to feature at least one of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina.
----
===Third place play-off===
Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to secure third place. Germany holds the record for most third-place finishes in the World Cup (4), while Uruguay holds the record for most fourth-place finishes (3).
===Final===

The final was held on 11 July 2010 at Soccer City, Johannesburg. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with an extra time goal from Andrés Iniesta. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116th minute). The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958, and the first team to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.

A large number of fouls were committed in the final match. Referee Howard Webb handed out 14 yellow cards, more than doubling the previous record for this fixture, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986, and John Heitinga of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. The Netherlands had chances to score, most notably in the 60th minute when Arjen Robben was released by Wesley Sneijder to be one-on-one with Spain&#x27;s goalkeeper Iker Casillas, only for Casillas to save the shot with an outstretched leg. For Spain, Sergio Ramos missed a free header from a corner kick when he was unmarked. Iniesta finally broke the deadlock in extra time, scoring a volleyed shot from a pass by Cesc Fàbregas.

This result marked the first time that two teams from the same continent had won successive World Cups (following Italy in 2006), and saw Europe reaching 10 World Cup titles, surpassing South America&#x27;s nine titles. Spain became the first team since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as European champions. The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.

A closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer Shakira. Afterwards, the former South African President Nelson Mandela made a brief appearance on the pitch, wheeled in by a motorcart.

==Statistics==
===Goalscorers===
South African winger Siphiwe Tshabalala was the first player to score a goal in the competition, in their 1–1 draw against Mexico, the opening game of the tournament. Danish defender Daniel Agger was credited with the first own goal of the tournament, in his side&#x27;s 2–0 loss to the Netherlands. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuaín was the only player to score a hat-trick in the tournament, in Argentina&#x27;s 4–1 win over South Korea, the match where the second and last own goal was scored. It was the 49th World Cup hat-trick in the history of the tournament.

Spain set a new record for the fewest goals scored by a World Cup-winning team, with eight. The previous record low was 11, set by Brazil in 1994, England in 1966, and Italy in 1938. Spain had the fewest goalscorers for a champion as well (three – Villa with five goals, Iniesta with two and Puyol with one). They also had the fewest goals conceded for a champion (2), equal with Italy (2006) and France (1998). Spain&#x27;s victory marked the first time that a team won the World Cup without conceding a goal in the knockout stage.

The four top scorers in the tournament had five goals each. All of the four top scorers also came from the teams that finished in the top four, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Uruguay. The Golden Boot went to Thomas Müller of Germany who had three assists, compared to one for the three others. The Silver Boot went to David Villa of Spain, who played a total of 635 minutes, and the Bronze Boot to Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands, who played 652 minutes. Diego Forlán of Uruguay had five goals and one assist in 654 minutes. A further three players scored four goals.

Only 145 goals were scored at South Africa 2010, the lowest of any FIFA World Cup since the tournament switched to a 64-game format. This continued a downward trend since the first 64-game finals were held 12 years earlier, with 171 goals at France 1998, 161 at Korea/Japan 2002 and 147 at Germany 2006.

===Discipline===
28 players were suspended after being shown two consecutive yellow cards (13 players), a single red card (8 players), or a yellow card followed by a red card (7 players).

===Final standings===
Shortly after the final, FIFA issued a final ranking of every team in the tournament. The ranking was based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition. All 32 teams are ranked based on criteria which have been used by FIFA. The final ranking was as follows:

===All-Star Team===
FIFA released an All-Star Team based on the Castrol performance index in its official website.

===Dream Team===
For the first time, FIFA published a Dream Team decided by an online public vote. People were invited to select a team (in a 4–4–2 formation) and best coach; voting was open until 23:59 on 11 July 2010, with entrants going into a draw to win a prize.

Six of the eleven players came from the Spanish team, as did the coach. The remainder of the team comprised two players from Germany, and one each from Brazil, the Netherlands and Uruguay.

==Marketing==
===Sponsorship===
The sponsors of the 2010 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.

===Vuvuzelas===
The 2010 finals amplified international public awareness of the vuvuzela, a long horn blown by fans throughout matches. Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France&#x27;s Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team&#x27;s poor performance. Other critics include Lionel Messi, who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch, and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators&#x27; voices were drowned out by the sound.

Others watching on television complained that the ambient audio feed from the stadium contained only the sounds of the vuvuzelas with the usual sounds of people in the stands drowned out. A spokesperson for ESPN and other networks said that they were taking steps to minimise the ambient noise on their broadcasts. The BBC also investigated the possibility of offering broadcasts without vuvuzela noise.

== Symbols==
===Mascot===
The official mascot for the 2010 World Cup was &quot;Zakumi&quot;, an anthropomorphised African leopard with green hair, presented on 22 September 2008. His name came from &quot;ZA&quot; (the international abbreviation for South Africa) and the term &quot;kumi&quot;, which means &quot;ten&quot; in various African languages. The mascot&#x27;s colours reflected those of the host nation&#x27;s playing strip – yellow and green.

===Match ball===

The match ball for the 2010 World Cup, manufactured by Adidas, was named the &quot;Jabulani&quot;, which means &quot;bringing joy to everyone&quot; in Zulu. It was the 11th World Cup match ball made by the German sports equipment maker; it featured 11 colours, representing each player of a team on the pitch and the 11 official languages of South Africa. A special match ball with gold panels, called the &quot;Jo&#x27;bulani&quot;, was used at the final in Johannesburg.

The ball was constructed using a new design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These were spherically moulded from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The surface of the ball was textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove that was intended to improve the ball&#x27;s aerodynamics. The design received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from Loughborough University, United Kingdom. The balls were made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.

Some football stars complained about the new ball, arguing that its movements were difficult to predict. Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César compared it to a &quot;supermarket&quot; ball that favored strikers and worked against goalkeepers. Argentinian coach Diego Maradona said: &quot;We won&#x27;t see any long passes in this World Cup because the ball doesn&#x27;t fly straight.&quot; However, a number of Adidas-sponsored players responded favourably to the ball.

===Music===
The official song of the 2010 World Cup &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot;, was performed by the Colombian singer Shakira and the band Freshlyground from South Africa, and is sung in both English and Spanish. The song is based on a traditional African soldiers&#x27; song, &quot;Zangalewa&quot;. Shakira and Freshlyground performed the song at the pre-tournament concert in Soweto on 10 June. It was also sung at the opening ceremony on 11 June and at the closing ceremony on 11 July.

The official mascot song of the 2010 World Cup was &quot;Game On&quot;.

The official anthem of the 2010 World Cup was &quot;Sign of a Victory&quot; by R. Kelly with the Soweto Spiritual Singers, which was also performed at the opening ceremony.

==Event effects==

===Social===
Tournament organiser Danny Jordaan dismissed concerns that the attack on the Togo national team which took place in Angola in January 2010 had any relevance to the security arrangements for the World Cup. There were also reports of thefts against visitors to the country for the World Cup. Tourists from China, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Japan and Colombia had become victims of crime. On 19 June after the match between England and Algeria, a fan was able to break through the FIFA-appointed security staff at Green Point stadium and gain access to the England team dressing room. The breach took place shortly after Prince William and Prince Harry had left the room. The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The Football Association lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.

====Resettlement and eviction====

As with many &quot;hallmark events&quot; throughout the world, the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to evictions, which many claim are meant to &#x27;beautify the city&#x27;, impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers. On 14 May 2009, the Durban-based shack-dwellers&#x27; movement Abahlali baseMjondolo took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act, meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup.

Another prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup was the N2 Gateway housing project in Cape Town, which planned to remove over 20,000 residents from the Joe Slovo Informal Settlement along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup. NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the Anti-Eviction Campaign have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and said that the camp has been used to accommodate poor families evicted to make way for the 2010 World Cup.

However some have argued that evictions are ordinarily common in South Africa and that in the lead up to the tournament many evictions were erroneously ascribed to the World Cup.

===Economy===
Some groups experienced complications in regards to scheduled sporting events, advertising, or broadcasting, as FIFA attempted to maximise control of media rights during the Cup. Affected parties included an international rugby union Test match, a South African airline and some TV networks, all of whom were involved in various legal struggles with World Cup organisers.

During the tournament, group ticket-holders who did not utilise all their allotted tickets led to some early-round matches having as many as 11,000 unoccupied seats.

While the event did help to boost the image of South Africa, it turned out to be a major financial disappointment. Construction costs for venues and infrastructure amounted to £3 billion (€3.6 billion), and the government expected that increased tourism would help to offset these costs to the amount of £570 million (€680 million). However, only £323 million (€385 million) were actually taken in as 309,000 foreign fans came to South Africa, well below the expected number of 450,000.

Local vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5 kilometre radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup match. For a vendor to operate within the radius, a registration fee of R60,000 (approximately US$7,888 or €6,200) had to be paid to FIFA. This fee was out of most local vendors&#x27; reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture in favour of multinational corporations.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared the event &quot;a huge financial success for everybody, for Africa, for South Africa and for FIFA,&quot; with revenue to FIFA of £2.24 billion (€2 billion).

===Quality===
In a December 2010 &quot;Quality Progress&quot;, FIFA President Blatter rated South Africa&#x27;s organisational efforts a nine out of 10 scale, declaring that South Africa could be considered a plan B for all future competitions. The South African Quality Institute (SAQI) assisted in facility construction, event promotion, and organisations. The main issue listed in the article was lack of sufficient public transportation.

==Media==
===Broadcasting===

The 2010 FIFA World Cup was expected to be the most-watched television event in history. Hundreds of broadcasters, representing about 70 countries, transmitted the Cup to a TV audience that FIFA officials expect to exceed a cumulative 26 billion people, an average of approximately 400 million viewers per match. FIFA estimated that around 700 million viewers would watch the World Cup final.

New forms of digital media have also allowed viewers to watch coverage through alternative means. &quot;With games airing live on cell phones and computers, the World Cup will get more online coverage than any major sporting event yet,&quot; said Jake Coyle of the Associated Press.
In the United States, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 averaged a 2.1 rating, 2,288,000 households and 3,261,000 viewers for the 64 World Cup games. The rating was up 31 percent from a 1.6 in 2006, while households increased 32 percent from 1,735,000 and viewers rose from 2,316,000. The increases had been higher while the US remained in the tournament. Through the first 50 games, the rating was up 48 percent, households increased 54 percent and viewers rose 60 percent. Univision averaged 2,624,000 viewers for the tournament, up 17 percent, and 1,625,000 households, an increase of 11 percent. An executive of the Nielsen Company, a leading audience research firm in the US, described the aggregate numbers for both networks&#x27; coverage of the match between the United States and Ghana as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Live World Cup streaming on ESPN3.com pulled in some of the largest audiences in history, as 7.4 million unique viewers tuned in for matches. In total, ESPN3.com generated 942 million minutes of viewing or more than two hours per unique viewer. All 64 live matches were viewed by an average of 114,000 persons per minute. Most impressive were the numbers for the semi-final between Spain and Germany, which was viewed by 355,000 people per minute, making it ESPN3.com&#x27;s largest average audience ever.

===Filming===
Sony technology was used to film the tournament. 25 of the matches were captured using 3D cameras. Footage was captured in 3D through Sony&#x27;s proprietary multi-image MPE-200 processors, housed in specially designed 3D outside broadcast trucks. It supplied its flagship HDC-1500 cameras as well as its new HDC-P1 unit, a compact, point-of-view (POV)-type camera with 3, 2/3-inch CCD sensors. The 3D games were produced for FIFA by Host Broadcast Services.

===Video games===
In PlayStation Home, Sony released a virtual space based on the 2010 FIFA World Cup in the Japanese version of Home on 3 December 2009. This virtual space is called the &quot;FevaArena&quot; and is a virtual stadium of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, featuring different areas for events, a FIFA mini-game, and a shop with FIFA related content.

On 27 April 2010, EA Sports released the official 2010 World Cup video game.

===FIFA Fan Fest===
FIFA expanded the FIFA Fan Fest, hosting in Sydney, Buenos Aires, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Rio de Janeiro, and Mexico City, as well as several venues around South Africa. The Durban Fan Fest was the most popular in South Africa during the tournament followed by the Cape Town Fan Fest.

<text>The World Abilitysport Games (known as the IWAS World Games before 2023) are a parasports multi-sport event for athletes who use wheelchairs or are amputees. Organized by World Abilitysport (formerly IWAS), the Games are a successor to the original Stoke Mandeville Games founded in 1948 by Ludwig Guttmann, and specifically the International Stoke Mandeville Games—the first international sporting competition for athletes with disabilities which was held in 1952, itself an Olympic year, between British and Dutch athletes and which ultimately was the forerunner to the modern Paralympic Games.

The 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972 editions of the International Stoke Mandeville Games were held in the same host country as the Summer Olympics; they were retroactively recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the first four Summer Paralympic Games. The event continued to be held annually, as simply the International Stoke Mandeville Games, in between Paralympic years.

After the Paralympics expanded to include events for disability classifications other than wheelchairs, the ISMG for wheelchair athletes continued to be hosted annually in Stoke Mandeville, and later other countries, in all non-Paralympic years.

In 2024 the previous IWAS merged with the [[Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CPISRA) to form [[World Abilitysport]] and the &quot;IWAS World Games&quot; were once more renamed World Abilitysport Games accordingly.

A separate event to be known as the [[Guttmann Games]] for events and disciplines not yet on the Paralympic Game schedules, organised by World Abilitysport, has been planned for 2024.

== History ==
The event was first established in 1948 as the Stoke Mandeville Games by neurologist Ludwig Guttmann, who organized a sporting competition involving World War II veterans with spinal cord injuries at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital rehabilitation facility in Aylesbury, England, taking place concurrently with the first post-war Olympic Games in London. In 1952, the Netherlands joined in the event, creating the first international sports competition for athletes with a disability, after which it was renamed the International Stoke Mandeville Games. 

In 1960 and subsequent Olympic years, the ISMG began to increasingly be hosted in the same country (if not the same host city) as their respective Olympics, with all other editions remaining in Stoke Mandeville. The Games were also increasingly referred to as &quot;Paralympics&quot;, originally in reference to paraplegia, but later officially referring to an event operating in parallel with the Olympic movement. While the Paralympic Games expanded to include athletes from all disability groups beginning in 1976, the Stoke Mandeville Games continued to be organized as a multi-sport event for wheelchair athletes in non-Paralympic years. Games were held annually in Aylesbury under the direction of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF), which later became the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF). 

In 2003, the Games were combined with a competition for amputee athletes organized by the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD). In 2004, ISMWSF and ISOD merged to create the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS). The Games were subsequently renamed the &quot;World Wheelchair and Amputee Games&quot; in 2005, and later renamed to simply the &quot;IWAS World Games&quot;.

In 2024, IWAS merged with the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) to form World Abilitysport.

== Games by year ==

The inaugural competition, initially named &quot;Stoke Mandeville Games for the Paralyzed&quot; in 1948, was just named &quot;Stoke Mandeville Games&quot; the next year, before becoming the &quot;International Stoke Mandeville Games&quot; (ISMG) in 1952.

Beginning in 1960 during Summer Olympic years, the ISMG were held in the same host city as the Summer Olympics. These particular editions of the Games were retroactively recognised as being the first four Paralympic Games. The Games were otherwise hosted in Stoke Mandeville in all other years. Beginning in 1976, the Paralympic Games began hosting events for amputees and the visually impaired; at this point, the Paralympics were no longer credited as being editions of the ISMG, but the ISMG went on hiatus during Paralympic years.

== IWAS Under 23 World Games (IWAS Junior World Games) ==
For some years now, the IWAS Federation has hosted junior competitions, which were named &quot;IWAS World Junior Games&quot; by 2015. Since 2016 they are called &quot;IWAS Under 23 World Games&quot; and will only be played in years with even numbers.

== World Abilitysport Guttmann Games ==

In 2024, World Abilitysport announced its inaugural World Abilitysport Guttmann Games. Named after the founder of the Stoke Mandeville Games, the event will take place in Stoke Mandeville in July 2024, and feature competition in sports not on the Paralympic programme. It is scheduled to feature para dance sport and power hockey competitions, as well as wheelchair cricket as a demonstration sport. The event will be broadly analogous to the World Games, a similar multi-sport event for non-Olympic sports and disciplines.

<text>Dahme-Spreewald (, ) is a district in Brandenburg, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Oder-Spree, Spree-Neiße, Oberspreewald-Lausitz, Elbe-Elster and Teltow-Fläming, and by the city of Berlin.

== History ==
The Spreewald region has always been a centre of Sorbian culture. In medieval times the cities of Lübben and Luckau had successively been capitals of the margravate of Lower Lusatia. From 1815 on Lower Lusatia was a part of Prussia. Throughout the 19th century the region remained an agriculturally used area, some urbanisation taking place in the very north (close to Berlin) only.

When the state of Brandenburg was newly founded in 1990, the districts of Lübben, Luckau and Königs Wusterhausen had been established. In 1993 the three districts were merged.

== Geography ==
The Spree river enters the district in the southeast and leaves to the northeast. The wooded regions along its banks are called Spreewald. The Spreewald is the westernmost part of Lusatia. Especially the cities of Lübben and Lübbenau welcome many tourists each year, offering boat trips and relaxing holidays in the beautiful Spreewald nature.

The Dahme river is a tributary of the Spree. It forms many lakes in the northern part of the district. The Dahme leaves the district towards Berlin, where it is occasionally used for boat races. Eventually, it joins the Spree.

== Demography ==


== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* top left: the bull is the heraldic animal of Lusatia
* top right: the eagle is the heraldic animal of Brandenburg
* bottom: the crown symbolises the former hunting lodge of the Prussian kings, which was in Königs Wusterhausen

<doc id="168093" wikidata="Q46814" url="?curid=168093" title="Severus II">
<text>Flavius Valerius Severus (died September 307), also called Severus II, was a Roman emperor from 306 to 307, and a member of the Tetrarchy. He shared control of the western half of the empire with Constantine I, but spent most of his short reign in a civil war against the usurper Maxentius, who later killed him and took over Italy.

== Background and early career ==
Severus was of humble birth, born in Northern Illyria around the middle of the third century. A friend of emperor Galerius, he rose to become a senior officer in the Roman army, being nominated as &quot;caesar&quot; of the Western Roman Empire. According to Lactantius, Diocletian objected to Galerius&#x27;s suggestion, saying in response, &quot;What! That dancer, that habitual drunkard who turns night into day and day into night?&quot; Galerius persisted, saying that Severus had served faithfully as paymaster and purveyor of the army. Diocletian acquiesced and Severus succeeded to the post of &quot;caesar&quot; on 1 May 305, thus becoming the junior colleague of Constantius I, &quot;augustus&quot; of the western half of empire.

== Augustus, 306–307 ==

When Constantius died in Britain in July 306, his son Constantine I was immediately acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. At the same time, Severus was promoted to &quot;augustus&quot; by Galerius. Lactantius reports that Galerius had done this to promote the older man to the higher office, while accepting the imperial symbols of Constantine and accepting him as a member of the Tetrarchy, albeit with the rank of &quot;caesar&quot;. Despite his lower title, Constantine controlled most of the Western empire (Britain, Gaul, and Hispania), leaving Severus with the control of Italy and Western Africa.

When Maxentius, the son of the retired emperor Maximian, revolted at Rome in October, Galerius sent Severus to suppress the rebellion. Severus moved towards Rome from his capital, Mediolanum, at the head of an army previously commanded by Maximian. Fearing the arrival of Severus, Maxentius offered Maximian the co-rule of the empire. Maximian accepted, and when Severus arrived under the walls of Rome and besieged it, his men deserted to Maxentius. Severus fled to Ravenna, an impregnable position. Maximian offered to spare his life and treat him humanely if he surrendered peaceably, which he did around April 307. Despite Maximian&#x27;s assurance, Severus was nonetheless displayed as a captive and later imprisoned at Tres Tabernae, near the current Cisterna di Latina. One belief is that when Galerius himself invaded Italy to suppress Maxentius and Maximian, the former ordered Severus&#x27;s death. His death probably took place in September or October, as documents with his name were still issued in September, while news of his death already arrived in Egypt by December. Lactantius reports that he was permitted to kill himself by opening his veins. Another belief is that Severus was killed in Ravenna.

The position of Western &quot;augustus&quot; remained officially vacant until the Conference of Carnuntum of November 308, in which Licinius was appointed as new emperor (although his western domains only consisted of the Balkan Peninsula). Severus was survived by his son Flavius Severianus, but he was later executed by Licinius for treason.

<doc id="168094" wikidata="Q208681" url="?curid=168094" title="Kris Kristofferson">
<text>Kristoffer Kristofferson (June 22, 1936 – September 28, 2024) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He was a pioneering figure in the outlaw country movement of the 1970s, moving away from the polished Nashville sound and toward a more raw, introspective style. During the 1970s, he also embarked on a successful career as a Hollywood actor.

Kristofferson released his debut album &quot;Kristofferson&quot; in 1970. Among his songwriting credits are &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, &quot;For the Good Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mornin&#x27; Comin&#x27; Down&quot;, and &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;, all of which became hits for other artists. Kristofferson was also a member of the country music supergroup the Highwaymen between 1985 and 1995. He has charted 12 times on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts; his highest peaking singles there are &quot;Why Me&quot; and &quot;Highwayman&quot;, which reached number one in 1973 and 1985, respectively. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2004 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. He was a three-time Grammy Award winner, out of 13 total nominations.

As an actor, he became known for his roles in &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; (1972), &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976); for the latter, he earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for the film &quot;Songwriter&quot; (1984). His acting career waned somewhat following his role in the box office bomb &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), but he continued to act in films such as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1986), &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1996), and the &quot;Blade&quot; film trilogy (1998–2004). 

== Life and career ==
=== Early years and military service ===
Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (née Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a United States Army Air Corps officer (later a major general in the United States Air Force). During Kristofferson&#x27;s childhood, his father encouraged him to pursue a military career. 

Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth because of his father&#x27;s military service, and the family settled in San Mateo, California. After graduating from San Mateo High School in 1954, he enrolled at Pomona College, hoping to become a writer. His early writing included prize-winning essays: &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Gone Are the Days&quot; were published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. These stories touch on the roots of Kristofferson&#x27;s passions and concerns. &quot;The Rock&quot; is about a geographical feature resembling the form of a woman, while the latter was about a racial incident.

At the age of 17, Kristofferson took a summer job with a dredging contractor on Wake Island in the western Pacific Ocean. He called it &quot;the hardest job I ever had&quot;.

Kristofferson attended Pomona College and experienced his first national exposure in 1958, appearing in the March 31 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; for his achievements in collegiate rugby union, American football, and track and field. He and his classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, and it remains a Southern California rugby institution. Kristofferson graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in literature. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year. In a 2004 interview with &quot;Pomona College Magazine&quot;, Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life.

In 1958, Kristofferson was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, studying at Merton College. While at Oxford, he was awarded a Blue for boxing, played rugby for his college, and began writing songs. At Oxford, he became acquainted with fellow Rhodes scholar, art critic, and poet Michael Fried. With the help of his manager, Larry Parnes, Kristofferson recorded for Top Rank Records under the name Kris Carson. Parnes was working to sell Kristofferson as &quot;a Yank at Oxford&quot; to the British public; Kristofferson was willing to accept that promotional approach if it helped his singing career, which he hoped would enable him to progress toward his goal of becoming a novelist. 

This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful. In 1960, Kristofferson graduated with a B.Phil. in English literature. In 1961, he married his longtime girlfriend, Frances &quot;Fran&quot; Mavia Beer.

Kristofferson joined the Army in 1960 after graduating from Oxford. He became a helicopter pilot who trained at Fort Rucker in Alabama and also attended Ranger School, then worked as a helicopter pilot in Germany in the early 1960s and was eventually offered a teaching position at West Point in 1965, but turned it down and left the Army to chase his dream of becoming a country music singer/songwriter. He later used his piloting skills as a source of income while trying to succeed in Nashville in his early years there.

=== Early career ===
After relocating to Nashville, Tennessee, Kristofferson contacted Marijohn Wilkin, the aunt of his former platoon commander, who signed Kristofferson to her publishing house Buckhorn Music. Wilkin pitched his song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Vietnam Blues&quot; to singer Dave Dudley. Concurrently, Kristofferson worked a series of odd jobs that included bartender, construction worker, and railroad worker. He later worked as a janitor for Columbia Records, which afforded him the possibility of talking directly with the artists and a presence during recording sessions.

After his second child was born with esophagus issues, Kristofferson worked at Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI) in Lafayette, Louisiana. While flying workers to and from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, he would often write new songs. At weekends, he returned to Nashville, and for the following week he would pitch the songs around town before returning to Louisiana. The trips exhausted Kristofferson; his children were living with Fran in California and he felt his career as a songwriter was failing. PHI also admonished him for his increased alcohol consumption. Upon returning to Nashville the same week, Kristofferson learned three of his songs had been recorded: &quot;Jody and the Kid&quot; by Roy Drusky, &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis and &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; by Roger Miller.

Through June Carter, Kristofferson first attempted to pitch material to her husband Johnny Cash. Carter took the demos, which were eventually lost in a pile of other material Cash had received. At the time, Kristofferson worked on the weekends for the Tennessee National Guard. To attract Cash&#x27;s attention, Kristofferson landed a helicopter in Cash&#x27;s property. Cash eventually invited Kristofferson to a &quot;guitar pull&quot; party in his house. Cash was impressed and invited Kristofferson to perform with him at the 1969 Newport Folk Festival. Unsatisfied by Buckhorn Music, Kristofferson decided to change labels. Monument Records director Bob Beckham invited Kristofferson to play songs for him and label owner Fred Foster. Kristofferson performed &quot;To Beat the Devil&quot;, &quot;Jody and the Kid&quot;, &quot;The Best of All Possible Worlds&quot; and &quot;Duvalier&#x27;s Dream&quot;; Foster was impressed and offered Kristofferson two contracts; one as a recording artist for Monument Records and one as a songwriter for Combine Music. The ten-year contract required Kristofferson to submit ten records containing songs he had written. Kristofferson was surprised he had been signed as a singer; he told Foster at the time: &quot;I can&#x27;t sing, I sound like a frog!&quot; Kristofferson later said Buckhorn Music had not allowed him to record demos of his compositions.

In 1969, Kristofferson left Nashville to join the production of his first motion picture, Dennis Hopper&#x27;s &quot;The Last Movie&quot;, in Peru. In his absence, Cash continued promoting Kristofferson&#x27;s original songs with other singers. Upon returning to Nashville, Kristofferson learned of his new popularity and started to work on his debut album for Monument, &quot;Kristofferson&quot;. As his manager and producer, Foster had decided to keep some of Kristofferson&#x27;s original material from being passed to other artists. The new material, as well as his songs that had already been recorded by other artists, were included in the recording sessions, which were held at Monument Recording Studio.

Monument released &quot;Kristofferson&quot; in June 1970. Kristofferson wrote or co-wrote every song on the album. He collaborated with Marijohn&#x27;s son, John Buck Wilkin, on &quot;Blame it on the Stones&quot;. Though &quot;Kristofferson&quot; was not a commercial success, it received positive reviews from critics. According to Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the album &quot;is able to combine lyric sophistication with country music&#x27;s traditional interest in everyday problems&quot;. The commercial success of &quot;Sunday Mornin&#x27; Comin&#x27; Down&quot; led to the first of several industry awards nominations for the singer. Johnny Cash&#x27;s rendition of the single earned Kristofferson his first Country Music Association award for Song of the Year that November.

Kristofferson&#x27;s next album for Monument was 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Tongued Devil and I&quot;. He wrote nine of the album&#x27;s 10 songs, including the single &quot;Lovin&#x27; Her Was Easier (than Anything I&#x27;ll Ever Do Again)&quot;. He collaborated with songwriter Shel Silverstein on &quot;The Taker&quot; and keyboardist Donnie Fritts on &quot;Epitaph (Black and Blue)&quot;. Also included on the album was a cover of Bobby Bare&#x27;s &quot;Good Christian Soldier&quot;. &quot;Lovin&#x27; Her Was Easier (than Anything I&#x27;ll Ever Do Again)&quot; reached number 46 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Billboard Hot 100 and number 4 on Adult Contemporary. One year later, Monument released his third album &quot;Border Lord&quot;. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the Grammy Awards that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;. Kristofferson&#x27;s 1972 fourth album, &quot;Jesus Was a Capricorn&quot;, initially had slow sales, but the third single, &quot;Why Me&quot;, was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on November 8, 1973.

=== Film ===
For the next several years, Kristofferson focused on acting. He appeared in &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; (1972) with Gene Hackman; &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), directed by Paul Mazursky; three Sam Peckinpah films: &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; (1974), and &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978); and Michael Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977) with Burt Reynolds. He continued acting in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), &quot;Vigilante Force&quot; (1976), &quot;The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; (1976), and the romantic drama &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976) with Barbra Streisand, for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977) and the romantic war film &quot;Hanover Street&quot; (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson&#x27;s solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;. His next film, the two-part 1979 NBC-TV movie &quot;Freedom Road&quot;, did not get good ratings.

Kristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in Michael Cimino&#x27;s bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1981, he co-starred with Jane Fonda in &quot;Rollover&quot;, directed by Alan J. Pakula. In 1986, he starred in &quot;The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James&quot; with Johnny Cash and &quot;Flashpoint&quot; with Treat Williams in 1984, directed by William Tannen. This was followed, in 1985, by the neo-noir thriller &quot;Trouble In Mind&quot; co-starring Keith Carradine and Lori Singer. In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series &quot;Amerika&quot; with Robert Urich and Christine Lahti. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film &quot;Millennium&quot; with Cheryl Ladd. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt South Texas sheriff in John Sayles&#x27; &quot;Lone Star&quot;, a film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1997, he co-starred in the film &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; with Steven Seagal.

In 1998, Kristofferson took a role in the film &quot;Blade&quot;, alongside Wesley Snipes, as Blade&#x27;s mentor Abraham Whistler. He reprised the role in &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002) and again in &quot;&quot; (2004). In 1998 he starred in &quot;Dance with Me&quot; along with Vanessa Williams and Chayanne. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in &quot;Payback&quot;. He played rancher Rudolph Meyer in (1999). He was then in the 2001 Tim Burton version of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. He also played the title character &quot;Yohan&quot; as an old man in the Norwegian film . He co-starred in the 2011 film &quot;Dolphin Tale&quot; and its 2014 sequel, &quot;Dolphin Tale 2&quot;. In 2012, Kristofferson was in &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; with longtime friend Dolly Parton. In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in &quot;The Motel Life&quot;, as well as &quot;Angels Sing&quot; with Willie Nelson and Lyle Lovett. In 2006, Kristofferson starred with Geneviève Bujold in the film &quot;Disappearances&quot; about whiskey running from Quebec to the U.S. during the Great Depression.

=== Mid-career ===
In 1972, Kristofferson appeared with Coolidge on British TV on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, performing &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;. Also in 1972, Al Green released his version of &quot;For the Good Times&quot; on the album &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot;. In April 1973, Kristofferson received an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pomona College during Alumni Weekend, accompanied by Cash and Coolidge. Four months later, Kristofferson married Coolidge. The duo released an album titled &quot;Full Moon&quot;, another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. His fifth album, &quot;Spooky Lady&#x27;s Sideshow&quot;, released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as Ronnie Milsap and Johnny Duncan continued to record Kristofferson&#x27;s material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including Willie Nelson, whose 1979 LP release of &quot;(Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson&quot; reached number five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.

In 1979, Kristofferson traveled to Havana, Cuba, to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival that took place on March 2–4, alongside Coolidge, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnigan, Weather Report, and Billy Joel, plus an array of Cuban artists such as Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata Güines, and Orquesta Aragón. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos&#x27;s documentary &quot;Havana Jam &#x27;79&quot;.

On November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where Kristofferson sang &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot; with Miss Piggy, Coolidge sang &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone&quot; with forest animals, and the pair sang &quot;Song I&#x27;d Like to Sing&quot; with the Muppet monsters. They divorced in 1980.

===Later years===
In 1982, Kristofferson joined Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Brenda Lee on &quot;The Winning Hand&quot;, a double album consisting of remastered and updated performances of recordings the four artists had made for the Monument label during the mid-1960s; the album reached the top ten on the U.S. country album charts. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in the 1984 releases &quot;The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck&quot;, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, and &quot;Songwriter&quot;. Nelson and Kristofferson both appeared in &quot;Songwriter&quot;, and Kristofferson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. The album &quot;Music from Songwriter&quot;, featuring Nelson-Kristofferson duets, was a country success.

Nelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and by 1985, they added Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash to form the supergroup the Highwaymen. Their self-titled first album, released on May 6, was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. The single from the album, a cover of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s &quot;Highwayman&quot;, was awarded the ACM&#x27;s single of the year in 1985. In 1985, Kristofferson starred in &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot; and released &quot;Repossessed&quot;, a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly &quot;They Killed Him&quot; (also performed by Bob Dylan), a tribute to his heroes, including Martin Luther King Jr., Jesus, and Mahatma Gandhi. Kristofferson also appeared in &quot;Amerika&quot; at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under Soviet control.
In spite of the success of &quot;Highwayman 2&quot; in 1990, Kristofferson&#x27;s solo recording career slipped significantly in the early 1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1996 film by John Sayles) reinvigorated Kristofferson&#x27;s acting career, and he soon appeared in &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;Blade II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot;, &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, Tim Burton&#x27;s remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot;, &quot;Payback&quot;, &quot;The Jacket&quot;, and &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;.

The Songwriters Hall of Fame inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame earlier, in 1977. In 1999, &quot;The Austin Sessions&quot; was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as Mark Knopfler, Steve Earle, and Jackson Browne. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, he underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.

In 2003, &quot;Broken Freedom Song&quot; was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco. That year, he received the &quot;Spirit of Americana&quot; free speech award from the Americana Music Association. In 2004, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. On October 21, 2005, the movie &quot;Dreamer&quot; was released, in which Kristofferson played the role of &quot;Pop&quot;, a retired thoroughbred horse trainer. The movie was inspired by the true story of the mare Mariah&#x27;s Storm which won the Turfway Breeders Cup Classic. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; &quot;This Old Road&quot;. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won CMT&#x27;s Johnny Cash Visionary Award. Rosanne Cash, Cash&#x27;s daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in Nashville. Previous recipients include Cash, Hank Williams Jr., Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, and the Dixie Chicks. &quot;John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes,&quot; Kristofferson said during a phone interview. &quot;I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I&#x27;d be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times.&quot;

In July 2007, Kristofferson was featured on CMT&#x27;s &quot;Studio 330 Sessions&quot; where he played many of his hits.

On June 13, 2008, Kristofferson performed an acoustic in-the-round set with Patty Griffin and Randy Owen (Alabama) for a special taping of a PBS songwriters series aired in December. Each performer played five songs. Kristofferson&#x27;s set included &quot;The Best of All Possible Worlds&quot;, &quot;Darby&#x27;s Castle&quot;, &quot;Casey&#x27;s Last Ride&quot;, &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes that Rainbow Again&quot;. Taping was done in Nashville.

Kristofferson released a new album of original songs titled &quot;Closer to the Bone&quot; on September 28, 2009. It is produced by Don Was on the New West Records label. Prior to the release, Kristofferson remarked: &quot;I like the intimacy of the new album. It has a general mood of reflecting on where we all are at this time of life.&quot;

On November 10, 2009, Kristofferson was honored as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI Country Awards. Throughout his career, Kristofferson&#x27;s songwriting garnered 48 BMI Country and Pop Awards. He later remarked, &quot;The great thing about being a songwriter is you can hear your baby interpreted by so many people that have creative talents vocally that I don&#x27;t have.&quot; Kristofferson had always denied having a good voice, and had said that as he had aged, any quality it once had was beginning to decay.
In December 2009, it was announced that Kristofferson would be portraying Joe on the upcoming album &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot;, a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King.

On May 11, 2010, Light in the Attic Records released demos that were recorded during Kristofferson&#x27;s janitorial stint at Columbia. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Tell Me How the Story Ends: The Publishing Demos&quot; was the first time these recordings were released and included material that would later be featured on other Kristofferson recordings and on the recordings of other prominent artists, such as the original recording of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;.

On June 4, 2011, Kristofferson performed a solo acoustic show at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center, showcasing both some of his original hits made famous by other artists, and newer songs.

In early 2013, Kristofferson released a new album of original songs called &quot;Feeling Mortal&quot;. A live album titled &quot;An Evening With Kris Kristofferson&quot; was released in September 2014.

Kristofferson voiced the character Chief Hanlon of the NCR Rangers in the hit 2010 video game &quot;&quot;.

In an interview for &quot;Las Vegas&quot; magazine Q&amp;A by Matt Kelemen on October 23, 2015, Kristofferson revealed that a new album, &quot;The Cedar Creek Sessions&quot;, recorded in Austin, would include some old and some new songs. Released on June 17, 2016, it would be his last studio album issued during his lifetime. That December, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album.

Kristofferson covered Brandi Carlile&#x27;s &quot;Turpentine&quot; on the 2017 album &quot;Cover Stories&quot;.

In August 2018, Kristofferson&#x27;s final film, &quot;Blaze&quot;, opened. Three months later, on November 7, Kristofferson performed, with assistance from Carlile, the Joni Mitchell composition &quot;A Case of You&quot;, from the 1971 Mitchell album &quot;Blue&quot;, at the &quot;Both Sides Now – Joni 75 A Birthday Celebration&quot; to celebrate the 75th birthday of Mitchell.

In June 2019, Kristofferson was announced as being one of the supporting artists for a Barbra Streisand &quot;exclusive European concert&quot; on July 7 in London&#x27;s Hyde Park as part of the Barclay&#x27;s Summertime Concert series.

===Retirement and death===

By January 2021, Kristofferson announced his retirement from performing, citing age and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. According to manager Tamara Saviano, &quot;It was an evolution, and it just felt very organic.&quot; Kristofferson&#x27;s final performance was held in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 2023, where he sang a cover of &quot;Lovin&#x27; You Was Easier&quot; with Rosanne Cash in honor of Willie Nelson&#x27;s 90th birthday; the concert was later released as &quot;Long Story Short: Willie Nelson 90&quot; that December.

Kristofferson died at his Maui home on September 28, 2024; he was 88. He previously requested for the first three lines of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot; on his tombstone:

Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
== Personal life ==
In 1961, Kristofferson married his longtime girlfriend Frances &quot;Fran&quot; Mavia Beer, but they divorced in 1969. Kristofferson briefly dated Janis Joplin before her death in October 1970. His second marriage was to singer Rita Coolidge in 1973, ending in divorce in 1980. Kristofferson married Lisa Meyers in 1983.

Kristofferson and Meyers owned a home in Las Flores Canyon in Malibu, California, and maintained a residence in Hana, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. Kristofferson had eight children from his three marriages: two from his first marriage, one from his second marriage, and five from his marriage to his third wife.

=== Political views and advocacy ===
Kristofferson was a vocal opponent of the Gulf War and Iraq War and a critic of a number of United States military interventions and foreign policy positions, including the United States invasion of Panama and U.S. support of the Contras during the Nicaraguan Revolution and of the Apartheid government in South Africa. 

Kristofferson endorsed Jesse Jackson&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1988 and Ross Perot&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1992.

Kristofferson&#x27;s debut LP included a pro-Vietnam War song, but he said that he later became an opponent of the war after speaking with returning soldiers who had seen combat. Speaking about a soldier who had told him that he had witnessed other soldiers throwing people out of helicopters during interrogation, Kristofferson said, &quot;The notion that you could make a young person do something so inhumane to another soldier—or even worse, a civilian—convinced me that we were in the wrong.&quot; Kristofferson called himself a &quot;dove with claws&quot; and remained proud of his military service in spite of his anti-imperialist views. 

In a 1991 interview on New Zealand TV, he condemned media support for the Gulf War, saying &quot;The lapdog media cranks out propaganda that would make a Nazi blush.&quot; Kristofferson was a supporter of the United Farm Workers and appeared at several rallies and benefits for them, campaigning with Cesar Chavez for the passage of Proposition 14. He continued to play at benefits for the UFW through the 2010s. In 1987, he played at a benefit concert for Leonard Peltier with Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson and Joni Mitchell. In 1995, he dedicated a song to Mumia Abu-Jamal at a concert in Philadelphia, and was booed by the crowd.

He performed in benefit concerts for Palestinian children, and said that he &quot;found a considerable lack of work as a result.&quot; At a Bob Dylan anniversary concert shortly after Sinead O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s protest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, he showed solidarity with her when she was booed by the crowd.

<doc id="168095" wikidata="Q55617997" url="?curid=168095" title="Urashima Tarō">
<text>is the protagonist of a Japanese fairy tale (&quot;otogi banashi&quot;), who, in a typical modern version, is a fisherman rewarded for rescuing a sea turtle, and carried on its back to the Dragon Palace (Ryūgū-jō) beneath the sea. There, he is entertained by the princess Otohime as a reward. He spends what he believes to be several days with the princess. But when he returns to his home village, he discovers he has been gone for at least 100 years. When he opens the forbidden jewelled box (tamatebako), given to him by Otohime on his departure, he turns into an old man.

The tale originates from the legend of Urashimako (Urashima no ko or Ura no Shimako) recorded in various pieces of literature dating to the 8th century, such as the &quot;Fudoki&quot; for Tango Province, &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, and the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;.

During the Muromachi to Edo periods, versions of &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; appeared in storybook form called the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;, made into finely painted picture scrolls and picture books or mass-printed copies. These texts vary considerably, and in some, the story ends with Urashima Tarō transforming into a crane.

Some iconic elements in the modern version are relatively recent. The portrayal of him riding a turtle dates only to the early 18th century, and while he is carried underwater to the Dragon Palace in modern tellings, he rides a boat to the princess&#x27;s world called Hōrai in older versions.

== Folktale or fairy tale ==

The Urashima Tarō tale familiar to most Japanese follows the storyline of children&#x27;s tale author in the Meiji period. A condensed version of Sazanami&#x27;s retelling then appeared in , Japan&#x27;s nationally designated textbook for elementary school, and became widely read by schoolchildren of the populace. Modern versions of Urashima Tarō, which are generally similar, are demonstrably based on the story from this nationally designated textbook series.

== Plot ==
One day, a young fisherman named Urashima Tarō is fishing when he notices a group of children torturing a small turtle. Tarō saves it and lets it go back to the sea. The next day, a huge turtle approaches him and tells him that the small turtle he had saved is the daughter of the Emperor of the Sea, Ryūjin, who wants to see him to thank him. The turtle magically gives Tarō gills and brings him to the bottom of the sea, to the Palace of the Dragon God (Ryūgū-jō). There, he meets the Emperor and the small turtle, who was now a lovely princess, Otohime. The palace had a view to the four seasons, a different one on each side. Tarō stays there with Otohime for three days, but soon wants to go back to his village and see his aging mother, so he requests permission to leave. The princess says she is sorry to see him go, but wishes him well and gives him a mysterious box called &quot;tamatebako&quot; which will protect him from harm but which she tells him never to open. Tarō grabs the box, jumps on the back of the same turtle that had brought him there, and soon is at the seashore.

When he goes home, everything has changed. His home is gone, his mother has vanished, and the people he knew are nowhere to be seen. He asks if anybody knows a man called Urashima Tarō. They answer that they had heard someone of that name had vanished at sea long ago. He discovers that 300 years have passed since the day he left for the bottom of the sea. Struck by grief, he absent-mindedly opens the box the princess had given him, from which bursts forth a cloud of white smoke. He is suddenly aged, his beard long and white, and his back bent. From the sea comes the sad, sweet voice of the princess: &quot;I told you not to open that box. In it was your old age ...&quot;.

== Commonly known version ==
A summary of the Urashima tale from one of the nationalized textbooks () will be given below. The base text used will be &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; (うらしま太郎), from the 3rd edition of the or &quot;national language reader&quot;, a widely familiar textbook used during the 1918–1932 period. An English translation has been provided in Yoshiko Holmes&#x27;s thesis.

The story remained as one of the dozen tales included in the 4th edition of national language reader textbooks also known as used from 1933 to c. 1940, thus continuing to enjoy wide recognition; for this reason &quot;Urashima&quot; could be considered one of the core stories of the so-called Japanese &quot;national fairy tales&quot;.

== School song ==
A number of renditions exist, where they are set to music. Among the most popular is the school song &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; (浦島太郎) of 1911 which begins with the line &quot;&quot;Mukashi, mukashi Urashima wa, tasuketa kame ni tsurerarete&quot; (Long long ago was Urashima, by the turtle he rescued taken to the sea)&quot;, printed in the (1911). This song&#x27;s author was long relegated to anonymity, but the lyricist is now considered to be .

Another school song &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; (うらしまたろう, lyrics by and music by ) appeared in the &quot;Yōnen shōka&quot; (1900). Although written in stilted classical language, Miura considered this version the more familiar.

== Otogizōshi ==

Long before the versions in 19th century textbooks, there had been the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; versions from the Muromachi period. Conventionally, commentators using the term &quot;otogizōshi&quot; are referring by default to the text found in the &quot;Otogi Bunko&quot; (or &quot;Companion Library&quot;), since it was printed and widely disseminated.

=== Otogi Bunko ===
In the &quot;Otogi Bunko&quot; (or &quot;Companion Library&quot;) version, a young fisherman named Urashima Tarō catches a turtle on his fishing line and releases it. The next day, Urashima encounters a boat with a woman on it wishing to be escorted home. She does not identify herself, although she is the transformation of the turtle that was spared. When Urashima rows her boat to her magnificent residence, she proposes that they marry. The residence is the Dragon Palace, and on the four sides of the palace, each gardenscape is in a different season. Urashima decides to return to his home after three years and is given a in parting. He arrives in his hometown to find it desolate, and discovers 700 years have passed since he last left it. He cannot restrain his temptation to open the box which he was cautioned not to open, whereupon three wisps of purple cloud appear and turn him into an old man. It ends with Urashima Tarō transforming into a crane, and his wife reverting to the form of a turtle, the two thereafter revered as &quot;myōjin&quot; (Shinto deities).

=== Variants and groups ===
There are over 50 texts of the Urashima Tarō &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; extant. These variants fall into four broad groups, clustered by their similarity. The &quot;Otogi Bunko&quot; text belongs to Group IV.

=== Group closest to modern version ===
The &quot;Otogi Bunko&quot; version, despite its conventional status as the type text, differs considerably from the typical children&#x27;s storybook published in the modern day: the protagonist neither purchases the turtle from others to save it, nor rides the turtle.

Group I texts are more similar to the modern version, as it contains the element of Urashima purchasing the turtle to save it. Additionally, this group explicitly gives the princess&#x27;s name as Otomime (or &quot;Kame-no-Otohime&quot;) whereas she remains unnamed in the &quot;Otogi Bunko&quot; group. And the expression &quot;tamatebako&quot; or &quot;jeweled hand-box&quot; familiar to modern readers is also seen in the main text of Group I, and not the other groups (the interpolated poem excepted).

The picture scroll in the collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford University also belongs to Group I.

Hayashi Kouhei has highlighted the characteristics of the Group I texts as follows: 1) Urashima purchases a turtle caught by others, 2) Boat arrives to convey him to Horai, 3) The four seasons assuage rather than provoke his homesickness, 4) The villagers in recognition of his longevity give him proper cremation, 5) Smoke from the &quot;tamatebako&quot; reaches Horai and Princess Otohime is grief-stricken.

== Other modern versions ==
=== Seki&#x27;s version in English ===
The tale of &quot;Urashima Taro&quot; in Keigo Seki&#x27;s anthology (translated into English 1963), was a version told in Nakatado District, Kagawa. In this variant, Urashima is localized as being from &quot;Kitamae Oshima&quot;. It incorporates both the motif of the turtle being caught while fishing, and that of Urashima transforming into a crane at the end, which are found in the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;.

Here, it was a , that is to say, a stacked box that was given to Urashima. When he opened the lid, the first box (on the top) contained a crane&#x27;s feather, and the second a puff of white smoke that turned him into an old man, and the third a mirror, which made him see for himself that he had suddenly grown old. The feather from the first box then attached itself to his back, and Urashima flew up to the sky, encircling his mother&#x27;s grave.

=== Versions retold in English ===
The story entitled &quot;The Fisher-boy Urashima&quot; (1886) retold by Basil Hall Chamberlain, was number 8 in the &quot;Japanese Fairy Tale Series&quot;, printed by Hasegawa Takejirō, the issuer of many such &quot;chirimen-bon&quot; or &quot;crepe-paper books&quot;. Although the illustrations are not credited in the publication, they have been attributed to Kobayashi Eitaku.

There is no single base text in Japanese identifiable, although it has been conjectured that Chamberlain adapted from &quot;a popular version&quot; and not straying far from it except adding explanatory or instructive passages for young readers. Others have determined it must have been a composite consisting of older traditions from the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, combined with the near-modern Otogizōshi storybook plot, Chamberlain preferring to incorporate details from the ancient texts, while eschewing embellishment from the Otogizōshi. Chamberlain has also published a versified version of the tale.

In Chamberlain&#x27;s fairytale version, &quot;Urashima&quot; (not &quot;Tarō&quot;) catches a tortoise (&quot;sic&quot;) while fishing on his boat, and releases it. The tortoise reappears in her true form as the Sea-God&#x27;s daughter, and invites him to the Dragon Palace.

There the couple are married and live happily for 3 years, but Urashima misses seeing his parents and his brothers. The Dragon Princess reluctantly allows him to leave, giving him a box he is instructed never to open, for it will cause him never to be able to return to the palace. When he returns to his home village, his absence turns out to have been 400 years. Urashima now wishes to go back to the Dragon Palace but he does not know the means, and opens the box. He turns into a white-haired, wrinkled old man and dies. The ending by death concurs with older tradition, and not the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; storybook.

Lafcadio Hearn, who lived in Japan and translated or adapted many ghost stories from the country, rewrote the Urashima tale under the title &quot;The Dream of a Summer Day&quot; in the late 19th century, working off of a copy of Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Fairy Tale Series&quot; version.

=== Variations ===
As always with folklore, there are many different versions of this story.

There are other versions that add a further epilogue explaining the subsequent fate of Urashima Tarō after he turns into an old man. In one, he falls to dust and dies, in another, he transforms into a crane and flies up to the sky. In another, he grows gills and leaps into the sea, whereby he regains his youth.

In another version Urashima ate a magic pill that gave him the ability to breathe underwater. In another version, he is swept away by a storm before he can rescue the turtle.

In another version, Urashima does stay with Otohime and they conceive a child. 

== History ==
The full name Urashima Tarō was not given to the character until the 15th century (the Muromachi period), first appearing in a genre of illustrated popular fiction known as &quot;otogizōshi&quot;, and in the kyōgen play adaptation.

The story itself can be found in much older sources, dating to the 8th century (the Nara period), where the protagonist is styled either &quot;Urashima no ko&quot; or &quot;Ura (no) Shimako&quot;, attested in earlier sources such as the &quot;Fudoki&quot; for Tango Province () that survived in excerpts, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;.

More recent editions of these texts tend to favor the &quot;Ura (no) Shimako&quot; reading, although some consider this debatable.

It has also been proposed that it was not until the Heian Period that the misreading &quot;Urashima (no) ko&quot; became current, because names with the suffix &quot;-ko&quot; (&quot;child&quot;) came to be regarded as female, even though it once applied to either gender. When the texts were written for the kyōgen theatre, the character&#x27;s name underwent further change to Urashima Tarō, with &quot;-tarō&quot; (&quot;great youth&quot;) being a common suffix in male names. Or perhaps the name was borrowed from who is a stock character in kyōgen.

===Dragon Palace===
The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; ballad mentions not only the woman of the Immortal Land, but her father as the Sea God (Watatsumi). Although this Sea God cannot be automatically equated with the Dragon God or Dragon King, due to the influence of the Chinese mythology of Nine Offspring of the Dragon in the Tang period, it has been speculated that the turtle princess must have been the Dragon King&#x27;s daughter in even those early versions.

The otherworld Urashima visited was not the &quot;Dragon Palace&quot; (Ryūgū) until the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; versions appeared. The heroine then became Otohime, the younger daughter of the Dragon King.

===Relative dates===
As for the relative dating of these texts, an argument has been advanced that places the &quot;Fudoki&quot; version as the oldest. The argument dates the &quot;Tango fudoki&quot; to shortly after 715, but the compilers refer to an earlier record by , which was identical in content. It has even been suggested by Shūichi Katō that this Umakai originally adapted this tale into Japanese from a similar Chinese tale.

== Tango Fudoki ==

In this version, the protagonist is referred to as &quot;Urashimako of Mizunoe&quot; (or &quot;Urashimako of in Yosa-gun&quot;.

Urashimako catches a five-coloured turtle and keeps it in his boat, and during his sleep, the creature transforms into a beautiful woman. She identifies herself as someone from the household of immortals, and proposes to take him to the place of immortals, which may be Horaisan (Mount Penglai) or &quot;Tokoyo-no-kuni&quot; (&quot;Timeless Land&quot; or &quot;Land of Eternity&quot;).

They are greeted by first seven, then eight children, who represent the constellations of Pleiades and Taurus (or more precisely the Hyades cluster) who address him as the &quot;husband of Kame Hime (Princess Turtle)&quot;. The remainder is mostly the same as the typical tale.

After three years, the man develops a longing for his parents and homeland. The princess is saddened, but imparts him with a , forbidding him to open it if he wished ever to return to her. He returns and finds no trace of his home or family, except that he is remembered as a man who disappeared long ago, and would be over three hundred years old if still alive. Forgetting the promise, he opens the box, whereupon a beautiful figure like a fragrant orchid is carried away to the heavens with the clouds, and he realizes he can never meet the princess again. Still, the couple are somehow (supernaturally) able to exchange poems. These poems are recorded in phonetic &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;.

==&quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;==
In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Urashimako of Mizunoe is mentioned in the entry for Autumn, 7th month the 22nd year of reign of Emperor Yūryaku. Aston&#x27;s translation assigns this the year 478 A.D. The entry states that Urashimako (child Urashima, child of Urashima, etc.) of Mizunoe while fishing on a boat, caught a turtle which transformed into a woman. They went into the sea, and reached Mount Hōrai (glossed in &quot;kana&quot; as Tokoyo), where they saw .

As to the phrase that they go &quot;into the sea&quot; implies, the Mount Hōrai as conceived here may be a submarine island, a suggestion made by Japanese literature professor .

==Manyoshu==

A poem reflecting upon the legend of Urashima of Mizunoe occurs in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. The piece is ascribed to Takahashi no Mushimaro. Early translations include the prose rendition by Aston, and the ballad-form by Chamberlain.

In this version, the woman of the Immortal Land (Tokoyo) appears as the daughter of the Sea God (Watatsumi no kami).

==Localizations==

=== Yokohama ===
Basil Hall Chamberlain (1880) indicated the presence of a temple dedicated to Urashima at Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, which housed several relics such as Urashima&#x27;s fishing-line, and the casket (tamatebako). But when Ernest Satow went there with Chamberlain on 2 May 1880, there was nothing left to see except the statue of Kannon (Kanzeon), the bodhisattva of mercy.

Neither recorded the name to the temple, but Japanese sources write that the so-called Urashima-dera (Urashima Temple) used to be , until it burned down in 1868, and the temple, including the Kannon goddess statue got translated to in 1872.

The old Urashima-dera sat on a mountain top. There is a circulating pamphlet which shows the view of the harbor from this vantage point, depicting the fleet of Black Ships led by Commodore Perry&#x27;s fleet in 1852–1854.

Local legend also claims native ties to Urashima Tarō, claiming that his father Urashima Tayū was originally from somewhere not far from Yokohama, in Miura District, Kanagawa in Sagami Province. But the father moved to 
Tango Province. This legend adds that when Urashima Tarō returned from the Dragon Place, he was guided to seek his parents&#x27; grave in &quot;Shirahata, Musashi Province&quot; (in today&#x27;s Yokohama).

He finally found the grave, thanks to Princess Oto-hime who lit up an illuminating light on a pine branch. Tarō built a hut to live here, housing the goddess statue from the Dragon Palace. The hut later became Kampuku-ji temple.

=== Okinawa ===
Chamberlain noted the theory that the Dragon Palace might be a romanticized notion of Okinawa, since &quot;Ryūgū&quot; (Dragon Palace) and Ryūkyū (Okinawa) are near homophones.

Recorded in of the 18th century, Tale 103 &quot;A person of Yonaha village visits the Dragon Palace&quot; is considered analogous to Urashima Tarō. In it, a certain man of Yonaha village in Haebaru finds a lock of black hair and returns it to a beautiful maiden. She leads him to the Dragon Palace. Three months pass and the man wishes to return, but the goddess reveals 33 generations have already passed in his absence. The man receives a folded-up piece of paper he is forbidden from unwrapping, but he opens this packet and a piece of white hair clings to him, turning him into an old man, and he dies. He was enshrined at the place which was named Usani-daki, because the man had &quot;sat and reposed&quot; () in his despair.

Similar tales are found on Miyako-jima and other places. Yanagita Kunio felt that the notion of the Dragon Palace shared its origin with the concept of Niruya () in the southerly islands of Japan.

 also records a similar tale, number 42, about , which describes a man who, bidden by a mysterious woman appeared before him, carried a large turtle to his home, which bit and gave him a terrible wound so that he was buried. But he turned out not to have died a mortals death, and lived on.

=== Kiso, Nagano ===

Local legend has it that Urashima Tarō once dwelled in the mountains of Kiso, Nagano. This legend originated in near-modern times, from the late Muromachi to Edo periods.

Although a contrived piece of fiction, the old-style &quot;jōruri&quot; situates its story in the vicinity of this local legend, namely Agematsu-juku. Urashima Tarō appears here as a child born after a local couple prays to Togakushi Myōjin. He and Tamayori-hime fall in love. She is very much a mortal, but after she commits suicide in Ina River (tributary of Kiso River), she becomes transformed into a supernatural being serving the Dragon Palace. A scale cloak lets her transform into a turtle, in which guise, she is reunited with Urashima Tarō who is fishing in Ina River. Note the &quot;catching of the turtle&quot; scene is transposed from ocean to a river in the mountains.

== Comparative mythology ==
The story bears varying degrees of similarity to folktales from other cultures. &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; is the foremost familiar example, although strictly speaking this cannot be called a &quot;folktale&quot;, since it is a fictional work by Washington Irving loosely based on folklore. Nevertheless, Urashima has been labeled the &quot;Japanese Rip van Winkle&quot;, even in academic folkloristic literature. &quot;Urashima&quot; is also a Japanese metaphor similar to &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; for someone who feels lost in a world that has changed in their absence.

This pair of tales may not be the closest matching among the motif group. Writing in the 19th century, Lafcadio Hearn suggested that Irving wrote another piece called &quot;The Adelantado of the Seven Cities&quot;, based on Portuguese tradition, which bore an even stronger resemblance to Urashima. Japanese art collector William Anderson also wrote that a certain Chinese tale was closer to &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; than Urashima was.

That Chinese analogue is the anecdote of the woodcutter Wang Zhi, who after watching immortals playing a board game discovers many years have passed. The piece is a selection in the or &quot;Accounts of Strange Things&quot;, and is also known as the legend of Lankeshan or &quot;Rotten Axe Handle Mountain&quot;. Sometimes this Chinese tale is conjectured as a possible actual source for Urashima, but there is lack of consensus among folklorists regarding their interrelationship.

Other cognate tales include the Irish legend of Oisín who met Niamh and spent his life with her in Tír na nÓg, and the Vietnamese legend of Từ Thức, who aids a goddess arrested for plucking a peony flower during a festival. In both these cases, the hero is united with a goddess who dwells in a land beyond the sea. Từ Thức&#x27;s story is collected in &quot;Truyền kỳ mạn lục&quot; by Nguyễn Dữ.

The tale of Urashima Taro holds many similarities with tales of the international catalogue Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index, grouped under type ATU 681, &quot;The Relativity of Time&quot;. A similar story is &quot;The Marsh King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. However, Hiroko Ikeda&#x27;s Japanese index of folktales lists &quot;Urashima Taro&quot; as type 470*, &quot;The Dragon Palace&quot; or &quot;Urashima Taroo&quot;.

== Commemoration ==

A shrine on the western coast of the Tango Peninsula in northern Kyoto Prefecture, named Urashima Jinja, contains an old document describing a man, Urashimako, who left his land in 478 A.D. and visited a land where people never die. He returned in 825 A.D. with a Tamatebako. Ten days later he opened the box, and a cloud of white smoke was released, turning Urashimako into an old man. Later that year, after hearing the story, Emperor Junna ordered Ono no Takamura to build a shrine to commemorate Urashimako&#x27;s strange voyage, and to house the Tamatebako and the spirit of Urashimako.

== Adaptations ==
The animated adaptation &quot;Urashima Tarō&quot; of the tale, premiered in 1918, is among some of the oldest anime created in Japan, the same year that Oz author Ruth Plumly Thompson adapted it as &quot;Urashima and the Princess of the Sea&quot; for The Philadelphia Public Ledger.

The story influenced various works of fiction and a number of films. In 1945, Japanese writer Osamu Dazai published &quot;Otogizōshi&quot; (&quot;fairytale book&quot;), which includes a much expanded version of the story. Urashima&#x27;s tale, as the other three included in the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;, is used mostly as a platform for Dazai&#x27;s own thoughts and musings. Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s short story &quot;A Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot; (or &quot;Another Story&quot;, 1994) is a reception of the Urashima story set in the Ekumen or Hainish universe.

The story was adapted in Brazil in the 1960s for use in an advertising campaign by airline Varig to promote the first direct flights between Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. The campaign was produced by Lynxfilm and created by Ruy Perotti. The theme, sung by Rosa Miyake, became famous throughout the country.

The Ultra Q episode title &quot;Grow Up! Little Turtle&quot; is largely based on Urashima Tarō&#x27;s tale, along with elements of &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; and the original &quot;Gamera&quot; film. In it, Tarō is a schoolboy given to making up stories who is trying to grow a turtle to 99cm, at which point he believes it will take him to the Dragon Palace.

<doc id="168101" wikidata="Q2349495" url="?curid=168101" title="Japanese folktales">
<text>Japanese folktales are an important cultural aspect of Japan. In commonplace usage, they signify a certain set of well-known classic tales, with a vague distinction of whether they fit the rigorous definition of &quot;folktale&quot; or not among various types of folklore. The admixed impostors are literate written pieces, dating back to the Muromachi period (14th–16th centuries) or even earlier times in the Middle Ages. These would not normally qualify for the English description &quot;folktales&quot; (i.e., pieces collected from oral tradition among the populace).

In a more stringent sense, &quot;Japanese folktales&quot; refers to orally transmitted folk narrative. Systematic collection of specimens was pioneered by the folklorist Kunio Yanagita. Yanagita disliked the word , a coined term directly translated from &quot;folktale&quot; (Yanagita stated that the term was not familiar to actual old folk he collected folktales from, and was not willing to &quot;go along&quot; with the conventions of other countries). He therefore proposed the use of the term to apply to all creative types of folktales (i.e., those that are not &quot;legendary&quot; types which are more of a reportage).

==Overview==
A representative sampling of Japanese folklore would definitely include the quintessential Momotarō (Peach Boy), and perhaps other folktales listed among the so-called : the battle between &quot;The Crab and the Monkey&quot;, &quot;Shita-kiri Suzume&quot; (Tongue-cut sparrow), &quot;Hanasaka Jiisan&quot; (Flower-blooming old man), and &quot;Kachi-kachi Yama&quot;.

===History===
These stories just named are considered genuine folktales, having been so characterized by folklorist Kunio Yanagita. During the Edo period these tales had been adapted by professional writers and woodblock-printed in a form a called &quot;kusazōshi&quot; (cf. chapbooks), but a number of local variant versions of the tales have been collected in the field as well.

As stated above, non-genuine folktales are those already committed to writing long ago, the earliest being the tale of Princess Kaguya (or &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;), an example of the monogatari type of romance dated to as early as the 10th century, though extant manuscripts are much later. The text mentions, for example, the flame-proof &quot; (or salamander)&#x27;s fur robe,&quot; which attests to a considerable degree of book-knowledge and learning by its author.

Other examples of pseudo-folktales composed in the Middle Ages are the &quot;Uji Shūi Monogatari&quot; (13th century) that includes &quot;Kobutori Jīsan&quot; — the old man with the hump on his cheek — and &quot;Straw Millionaire&quot;. This and the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; (12th century) contain a number of a type of tales called &quot;setsuwa&quot;, a generic term for narratives of various nature, anything from moralizing to comical. Both works are divided into parts containing tales from India, tales from China, and tales from Japan. In the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; can be seen the early developments of the Kintarō legend, familiar in folktale-type form.

The Japanese word used to correspond to &quot;folktale&quot; has undergone development over the years. From the Edo period, the term used was , i.e., tales told by the &quot;otogii-shū&quot;, professional storytellers hired to entertain the daimyō lord at the bedside. That term remained in currency through the Meiji era (late 19th century), when imported terms such as &quot;minwa&quot; began to be used. In the Taishō era the word &quot;dōwa&quot; (lit. &quot;children&#x27;s story&quot;, a loan translation for fairy tales or &quot;&quot;) was used. Later Yanagita popularized the use of &quot;mukashi-banashi&quot; &quot;tales of long ago&quot;, as mentioned before.

Some Japanese ghost stories or &quot;kaidan&quot;, such as the story of the Yuki-onna (&quot;snow woman&quot;), might be considered examples of folktales, but even though some overlaps may exist, they are usually treated as another genre. The familiar forms of stories are embellished works of literature by gesaku writers, or retooled for the kabuki theater performance, in the case of the bakeneko or monstrous cat. The famous collection &quot;Kwaidan&quot; by Lafcadio Hearn also consists of original retellings. Yanagita published a collection, &quot; (1910), which featured a number of fantastical &quot;yōkai&quot; creatures such as Zashiki-warashi and kappa.
In the middle years of the 20th century storytellers would often travel from town to town telling these stories with special paper illustrations called kamishibai.

==List of Japanese folktales ==
Below is a list of well-known Japanese folktales:

===Animals in folklore===
Tongue-cut sparrow: A washer woman cut off the tongue of a sparrow that was pecking at her rice starch. The sparrow had been fed regularly by the washer woman&#x27;s neighbors, so when the sparrow didn&#x27;t come, they went in the woods to search for it. They found it, and after a feast and some dancing (which the sparrow prepared), the neighbors were given the choice between two boxes; one large and one small. The neighbors picked the small box, and it was filled with riches. The washer woman saw these riches and heard where they came from, so she went to the sparrow. She too was entertained and given the choice between two boxes. The washer woman picked the largest box and instead of gaining riches, she was devoured by devils.

Mandarin Ducks: A man kills a drake mandarin duck for food. That night he had a dream that a woman was accusing him of murdering her husband, and then told him to return to the lake. The man does this, and a female mandarin walks up to him and tears its chest open.

Tanuki and Rabbit: A man catches a tanuki and tells his wife to cook it in a stew. The tanuki begs the wife not to cook him and promises to help with the cooking if he is spared. The wife agrees and unties him. The tanuki then transforms into her and kills her, then cooks her in a stew. Disguised as the man&#x27;s wife, the tanuki feeds him his wife. Once he is done, the tanuki transforms back to his original form and teases the man for eating his wife. A rabbit that was friends with the family was furious, so he had the tanuki carry sticks and, while he wasn&#x27;t looking, set these sticks on fire. Then the rabbit treated the burn with hot pepper paste. Finally, the rabbit convinced the tanuki to build a boat of clay, and the rabbit followed in a sturdy boat. The clay boat began to sink, so the tanuki tried to escape, but then the rabbit hit him in the head with an oar, knocking him out and making him drown.

Badger and Fox cub: A badger, vixen, and the vixen&#x27;s cub lived in a forest that was running out of food, so they came up with the plan of one of them pretending to be dead, the other disguising as a merchant, and the “merchant” selling the “dead” animal to a human. Then they would have money to buy food. The vixen pretended to be dead while the badger was the merchant. While the transaction was happening however, the badger told the human that the vixen wasn&#x27;t actually dead, so the human killed her. This infuriated the cub, so he proposed a competition. They would both disguise as humans and go into the village at different times. Whoever guessed what “human” was the other first, wins. The cub walked towards the village first, but he hid behind a tree. The badger went into the village, and accused the governor of being the fox, so the bodyguards of the governor beheaded him.

==Theorized influences==

The folklore of Japan has been influenced by foreign literature as well as the kind of spirit worship prevalent all throughout prehistoric Asia.

The monkey stories of Japanese folklore have been influenced both by the Sanskrit epic Ramayana and the Chinese classic &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. The stories mentioned in the Buddhist Jataka tales appear in a modified form throughout the Japanese collection of popular stories.

Some stories of ancient India were influential in shaping Japanese stories by providing them with materials. Indian materials were greatly modified and adapted in such a way as would appeal to the sensibilities of common people of Japan in general, transmitted through China and Korea.

<text>Kensal Green Cemetery is a cemetery in the Kensal Green area of North Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in London, England. Inspired by Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, it was founded by the barrister George Frederick Carden. The cemetery opened in 1833 and comprises of grounds, including two conservation areas, adjoining a canal. The cemetery is home to at least 33 species of bird and other wildlife. This distinctive cemetery has memorials ranging from large mausoleums housing the rich and famous to many distinctive smaller graves and includes special areas dedicated to the very young. It has three chapels and serves all faiths. It is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London.

The cemetery was immortalised in the lines of G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rolling English Road&quot; from his book &quot;The Flying Inn&quot;:
Despite its Grecian-style buildings, the cemetery is primarily Gothic in character, due to the high number of private Gothic monuments. Due to this atmosphere, the cemetery was the chosen location of several scenes in movies, notably in &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;.

The cemetery is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It remains in use.

==Location==
The cemetery is in both the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. Its main entrance is on Harrow Road (west of where Ladbroke Grove and Chamberlayne Road meet). Its other entrance, Alma Place (the West Gate, almost opposite Greyhound Road) is also on the north side. Alma Place leads to the West London Crematorium (whose owner and operator is the same) and St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery, which are in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The cemetery lies between Harrow Road and the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal to the south which has long been separated by a wall.

A set of defunct gates is set in the southern wall which adjoins the canal where barges took a proportion of earth from excavating graves and occasionally coffins carried by barge were unloaded.

==History and description==
===Establishment and design===
George Frederick Carden had failed with an earlier attempt to establish a British equivalent to Paris&#x27;s Père Lachaise Cemetery in 1825, but a new committee established in February 1830, including Andrew Spottiswoode, MP for Saltash, sculptor Robert William Sievier, banker Sir John Dean Paul, Charles Broughton Bowman (first committee secretary), and architects Thomas Willson (who had previously proposed an ambitious Metropolitan Sepulchre project) and Augustus Charles Pugin, gained more financial, political and public support to fund the &quot;General Cemetery Company&quot;. Public meetings were held in June and July 1830 at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern, and George Carden was elected treasurer.

Paul, a partner in the London banking firm of Strahan, Paul, Paul and Bates, found and conditionally purchased the of land at Kensal Green for £9,500. Paul and Carden were already embroiled in a dispute regarding the design of the cemetery, where Paul favoured the Grecian style and Carden the Gothic style. A succession of architects were contemplated, including Benjamin Wyatt (who declined), Charles Fowler (proposal not taken up), Francis Goodwin, Willson, and a Mr Lidell, a pupil of John Nash, before an architectural competition was launched in November 1831. This attracted 46 entrants, and in March 1832 the premium was awarded, despite some opposition, for a Gothic Revival design by Henry Edward Kendall; this decision was eventually overturned.

On 11 July 1832, the Act of Parliament establishing a &quot;General Cemetery Company for the interment of the Dead in the Neighbourhood of the Metropolis&quot; gained Royal Assent. The Act authorised it to raise up to £45,000 in shares, buy up to 80 acres of land and build a cemetery and a Church of England chapel. Company directors appointed after the Bill received Royal Assent asserted their control and preference for a different style. One of the competition judges and a company shareholder, John Griffith of Finbury, who had previously produced working drawings for a boundary wall, ultimately designed the cemetery&#x27;s two chapels and the main gateway and 15,000 trees were supplied and planted by Hugh Ronalds from his nursery in Brentford. Founded as the General Cemetery of All Souls, Kensal Green, the cemetery was the first of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; garden-style cemeteries in London. It was consecrated on 24 January 1833 by Charles James Blomfield, the Bishop of London, receiving its first funeral the same month.
In the early 1850s, after a series of cholera epidemics in London caused an examination of London&#x27;s burial facilities, health commissioner Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery, north-west of the city, which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London. (A large tract of land on the Thames around south-east of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London.) The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick&#x27;s scheme would ever be financially viable, and it was widely unpopular. Although the (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 52) authorised the scheme, it was abandoned in 1852.

===Layout===

The overall layout is on an east–west axis, with a central path leading to a raised chapel toward the west. The entrance is to the north-east and the largest monuments line the central path to the chapel.

The Church of England was allotted 39 acres and the remaining 15, clearly separated, acres were given over to Dissenters, a distinction deemed crucial at the time. Originally there was a division between the Dissenters&#x27; part of the cemetery and the Anglican section. This took the form of a &quot;sunk fence&quot; from the canal to the gate piers on the path. There were also decorative iron gates. The small area designated for non-Anglican burials is approximately oval in shape and was formerly made prominent by a wider central axis path that terminated with the neo-classical chapel with curved colonnades. The Anglican Chapel dominates the western section of the cemetery, being raised on a terrace beneath that is an extensive catacomb; there is a hydraulic catafalque for lowering coffins into the catacomb.

It is still in operation today; burials and cremations take place daily, although cremations are now more common than interments. The cemetery is still run by the General Cemetery Company under its original Act of Parliament. This mandates that bodies there may not be exhumed and cremated or the land sold for development. Once the cemetery has exhausted all its interment space and can no longer function as a cemetery, the mandate requires that it shall remain a memorial park. The General Cemetery Company constructed and runs the West London Crematorium within the grounds of the cemetery.

While borrowing from the ideals established at Père Lachaise some years before, Kensal Green Cemetery contributed to the design and management basis for many cemetery projects throughout the British Empire of the time. In Australia, for example, the Necropolis at Rookwood (1868) and Waverley Cemetery (1877), both in Sydney, are noted for their use of the &quot;gardenesque&quot; landscape qualities and importantly self-sustaining management structures championed by the General Cemetery Company.

The cemetery is the burial site of approximately 250,000 individuals in over 65,000 graves, including upward of 500 members of the British nobility and 970 people listed in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Many monuments, particularly the larger ones, lean precariously as they have settled over time on the underlying London clay.

==Notable structures==
Many buildings and structures within Kensal Green are listed.

The Anglican Chapel is listed Grade I, while the Dissenters&#x27; Chapel, Kensal Green is listed Grade II* and the colonnade/catacomb and perimeter walls and railings are listed Grade II. Of the many tombs, memorials and mausoleums, eight are listed Grade II*, while The Reformers&#x27; Memorial is listed Grade II. The Tomb of Charles Spencer Ricketts is listed Grade II* and was designed by William Burges.

===Anglican Chapel===
The Anglican Chapel is at the centre of the cemetery, and contains several tombs. The chapel was damaged during the Second World War but was restored in 1954. Under the chapel is a catacomb, one of the few in London. The catacomb is currently not maintained but can be visited as part of a guided tour. It still has a working coffin-lift or catafalque, restored by The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery in 1997.

===Dissenters&#x27; Chapel===
Situated in the eastern corner of the cemetery this Greek Revival structure was for the use of all non-Anglican denominations and of non-believers. Only part of the cemetery was consecrated, and Dissenters could opt to be buried in the non-consecrated areas following a service here. The cemetery became favoured by nonconformists, free-thinkers, non-Christians and atheists, and thus this chapel became popular. The Dissenters&#x27; Chapel had become derelict and partly roofless, so in 1995 was leased to the Historic Chapels Trust who undertook £447,000 of restoration. The chapel currently serves as the office of The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery, but is also available for funeral services.


===Reformers&#x27; Memorial===
The Reformers&#x27; Memorial was erected in 1885. It was erected at the instigation of Joseph Corfield &quot;to the memory of men and women who have generously given their time and means to improve the conditions and enlarge the happiness of all classes of society&quot;. The monument has lists of names of reformers and radicals on its north and east sides (together with further names added in 1907 by Emma Corfield). It is paired with the Robert Owen memorial, and a second instance of a non-funerary memorial in the cemetery&#x27;s nonconformist section.

The memorial was amended to include Lloyd Jones to recognise his contribution.

==Catacombs==

The cemetery has three catacombs for the deposit of lead-sealed, triple-shelled coffins and cremated remains. Catacomb A, beneath the North Terrace Colonnade is now sealed. Catacomb Z, beneath the Dissenters&#x27; Chapel at the eastern end of the cemetery, suffered significant bomb damage during World War II, and is also closed to further deposits.
Catacomb B, beneath the Anglican Chapel in the centre of the cemetery, has space for some 4,000 deposits, and still offers both private loculi and shelves or vaults for family groups. The catacomb extends under the entire footprint of the chapel and its colonnades. There are six aisles, within which each vault is numbered, running consecutively to number 216 at the south-western end of aisle 6.

Deposit within the catacombs of Kensal Green has always been more expensive and prestigious than burial in a simple plot in the grounds of the cemetery, although less costly than a brick-lined grave or mausoleum. Without the further expense and responsibility of a monument above the grave, the catacombs have afforded a secure, dignified and exclusive resting place for the well-to-do, particularly the unmarried, the childless and young children of those without family plots or mausolea elsewhere.

==War graves==
The cemetery contains the graves of 473 Commonwealth service personnel of the First World War—half of whom form a war graves plot in the south-west corner, the remainder in small groups or individual graves scattered throughout the grounds—and 51 of the Second who are all dispersed. A distinct memorial list the names of Belgian soldiers who fell 1914-1918. 

In the First World War plot, at Section 213, a Screen Wall memorial lists casualties of both world wars whose graves could not be marked by headstones, besides five Second World War servicemen who were cremated at Kensal Green (also known as West London) Crematorium. The highest-ranking person buried here who is commemorated by the CWGC is General Sir Charles Douglas (1850–1914), Chief of the Imperial General Staff in early months of the First World War.

<doc id="168114" wikidata="Q7753128" url="?curid=168114" title="The Nation (Irish newspaper)">
<text>The Nation was an Irish nationalist weekly newspaper, published in the 19th century. &quot;The Nation&quot; was printed first at 12 Trinity Street, Dublin from 15 October 1842 until 6 January 1844. The paper was afterwards published at 4 D&#x27;Olier Street from 13 July 1844, to 28 July 1848, when the issue for the following day was seized and the paper suppressed. It was published again in Middle Abbey Street on its revival in September 1849 until 1900, when it merged with the &quot;Irish Weekly Independent&quot;.

==Background==
The founders of &quot;The Nation&quot; were three young men – two Catholics and one Protestant – who, according to the historian of the newspaper T. F. O&#x27;Sullivan, were all &quot;free from the slightest taint of bigotry, and were anxious to unite all creeds and classes for the country&#x27;s welfare.&quot;. They were Charles Gavan Duffy, its first editor; Thomas Davis, and John Blake Dillon. All three were members of Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Repeal Association, which sought repeal of the 1800 Act of Union between Ireland and Britain; this association would later be known as Young Ireland. The name suggested by Duffy for the paper was &quot;The National&quot;, but Davis disagreed, suggesting &quot;that the use of an adjective for such a purpose was contrary to the analogies of the English language&quot;. He suggested &quot;The Nation&quot;, which was assented to by all three. &quot;We desired to make Ireland a nation&quot;, Duffy wrote, &quot;and the name would be a fitting prelude to the attempt.&quot;. In due course and after many other consultations between the founders, the following announcement was made as to the date of publication, the name of the journal, and the contributors:.

On the first Saturday in October will be published the first number of a;
DUBLIN WEEKLY JOURNAL
TO BE CALLED
&quot;THE NATION&quot;,
for which the services of the most eminent political writers in the country have been secured.
It will be edited by
Charles Gavan Duffy, Editor of &quot;The Vindicator (Ulster Newspaper)&quot;, aided by the, following distinguished contributors:—
JOHN O&#x27;CONNELL, ESQ., M.P.;
Thomas Osborne Davis, Esq., Barrister-at-Law;
W. J. O&#x27;Neill Daunt, Esq., Author of &quot;The Green Book&quot;,
John B. Dillon, Esq., Barrister-at-Law
Clarence Mangan, Esq., Author of &quot;Anthologia Germanica&quot; and &quot;Litterae Orientales&quot;;
The Late Editor of the &quot;London Magazine&quot; and &quot;Charivari,&quot;
J. C. Fitzgerald, Editor of &quot;The True Sun&quot;,
And others whose names we are not at liberty
to publish.
The paper was first published on Saturday 15 October 1842.

==The Prospectus of &quot;The Nation&quot;==

In the Prospectus, which was written by Davis with the exception of one sentence, it was stated,

The projectors of the &quot;NATION&quot; have been told that there is no room in Ireland for another Liberal Journal; but they think differently. They believe that since the success of the long and gallant struggle which our fathers maintained against sectarian ascendancy, a NEW MIND has grown up amongst us, which longs to redress other wrongs and achieve other victories; and that this mind has found no adequate expression in the press.
The Liberal Journals of Ireland were perhaps never more ably conducted than at this moment; but their tone and spirit are not of the present but the past;—their energies are shackled by old habits, old prejudices, and old divisions; and they do not and cannot keep in the van of the advancing people.
The necessities of the country seem to demand a Journal able to aid and organise the new movements going on amongst us—to make their growth deeper, and their fruit &#x27;more racy of the soil&#x27;— and, above all, to direct the popular mind and the sympathies of educated men of all parties to the great end of nationality. Such a Journal should be free from the quarrels, the interests, the wrongs, and even the gratitude of the past. It should be free to apply its strength where it deems best— free to praise—free to censure; unshackled by sect or party; able, Irish, and independent.
Holding these views, the projectors of the &quot;Nation&quot; cannot think that a Journal, prepared to undertake this work, will be deemed superfluous; and as they labour, not for themselves but for their country, they are prepared, if they do not find a way open, to try if they cannot make one.
Nationality is their first object—a nationality which will not only raise our people from their poverty, by securing to them the blessings of a domestic legislature, but inflame and purify them with a lofty and heroic love of country—a nationality of the spirit as well as the letter—a nationality which may come to be stamped upon our manners, our literature, and our deeds—a nationality which may embrace Protestant, Catholic, and Dissenter, Milesian and Cromwellian, the Irishman of a hundred generations, and the stranger who is within our gates; not a nationality which would preclude civil war, but which would establish internal union and external independence—a nationality which would be recognised by the world, and sanctified by wisdom, virtue, and time.
As could be seen from the prospectus, as political objectives went, the programme was certain to be of immense assistance to Daniel O&#x27;Connell in his efforts to revive the agitation for Repeal, but O&#x27;Connell also knew and felt that he was receiving, for the present, a powerful support from them; but he knew also, that they were outside of his influence, and did not implicitly believe that Repeal would be yielded to &quot;agitation&quot;; that they were continually seeking, by their writings, to arouse a military spirit among the people; showing plainly, that while they helped the Repeal Association, they fully expected that the liberties of the country must be fought for in the end: it was in appearance only that they worked in harmony.
John Mitchel joined the staff of &quot;The Nation&quot; in the autumn of 1845. On Mitchel&#x27;s frequent trips from Banbridge, Co Down to Dublin, he had come in contact with the Repeal members who gathered about &quot;The Nation&quot; office and in the spring of 1843 he became a member of the Repeal Association. For the next two years Mitchel wrote political and historical articles and reviews for &quot;The Nation&quot;. He covered a wide range of subjects, including the Great Famine, on which he contributed some influential articles which attracted significant attention.

Mitchel resigned his position as leader writer on &quot;The Nation&quot;, he himself wrote years afterwards, because he came to regard as &quot;absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the English Government than that which William Smith O&#x27;Brien, Charles Gavan Duffy and other Young Ireland leaders were willing to pursue&quot;. In 1847, when he severed his connection with &quot;The Nation&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I had watched the progress of the famine policy of the Government, and could see nothing in it but a machinery, deliberately devised, and skillfully worked, for the entire subjugation of the island—the slaughter of portion of the people, and the pauperization of the rest&quot;, and he had therefore &quot;come to the conclusion that the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point, and the means for this would be extremely simple, namely, a combination among the people to obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of Irish provisions; to refuse all aid to its removal; to destroy the highways; to prevent everyone, by intimidation, from daring to bid for grain and cattle if brought to auction under &#x27;distress&#x27; (a method of obstruction which put an end to Church tithes before); in short, to offer a passive resistance universally; but occasionally, when opportunity served, to try the steel.&quot; To recommend such a course would be extremely hazardous, and was besides in advance of the revolutionary progress made up to that time by Mr. Duffy, the proprietor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, Mitchel therefore resigned from the journal, and started his own paper, &quot;The United Irishman&quot;.

Women wrote for the paper, and published under pseudonyms such as Mary (Ellen Mary Patrick Dowling); Speranza (Jane Elgee, Lady Wilde, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s mother), known universally as &quot;Speranza&quot; of &quot;The Nation&quot;; and Eva (Mary Eva Kelly, who would marry Kevin Izod O&#x27;Doherty). These three were known as the &quot;Three Graces&quot; of &quot;The Nation.&quot; Eithne (Marie Thompson), Finola (Elizabeth Willoughby Treacy), Ruby (Rose Kavanagh) and Thomasine (Olivia Knight) were others. In July 1848 Jane Wilde and Margaret Callan assumed editorial control of &quot;The Nation&quot; during Gavan Duffy&#x27;s imprisonment in Newgate.

The role played by some of its key figures in the paper in the ill-fated Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 cemented the paper&#x27;s reputation as the voice of Irish radicalism. Dillon was a central figure in the revolt and was sentenced to death, the sentence later commuted. He fled Ireland, escaping first to France and, eventually, to the United States, where he served the New York Bar.

Its triumvirate of founders followed differing paths. Davis died, aged 30, in 1845. Both Dillon and Duffy became Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Duffy emigrated to Australia where he became premier of the state of Victoria, later being knighted as a Knight Commander of St Michael and St George (KCMG). Dillon died in 1866. His son, John Dillon became leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party and his grandson, James Dillon, leader of Fine Gael.

Later political figures associated with the paper included TD Sullivan and JJ Clancy.

<doc id="168115" wikidata="Q315391" url="?curid=168115" title="Étienne-Louis Malus">
<text>Étienne-Louis Malus (; ; 23 July 1775 – 23 February 1812) was a French officer, engineer, physicist, and mathematician.

Malus was born in Paris, France and studied at the military engineering school at Mezires where he was taught by Gaspard Monge. He participated in Napoleon&#x27;s expedition into Egypt (1798 to 1801). He was also a member of the mathematics section of the Institut d&#x27;Égypte. Malus became a member of the Académie des Sciences in 1810. In 1810 the Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal.

His mathematical work was almost entirely concerned with the study of light. He studied geometric systems called &quot;ray systems&quot;, closely connected to Julius Plücker&#x27;s &quot;line geometry&quot;. He conducted experiments to verify Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s theories of light and rewrote the theory in analytical form. His discovery of the polarization of light by reflection was published in 1809 and his theory of double refraction of light in crystals, in 1810.

Malus attempted to identify the relationship between the polarising angle of reflection that he had discovered, and the refractive index of the reflecting material. While he deduced the correct relation for water, he was unable to do so for glasses due to the low quality of materials available to him (the refractive index of most glasses available at that time varied between the surface and the interior of the glass). It was not until 1815 that Sir David Brewster was able to experiment with higher quality glasses and correctly formulate what is known as Brewster&#x27;s law. This law was later explained theoretically by Augustin Fresnel, as a special case of his Fresnel equations.

Malus is probably best remembered for Malus&#x27;s law, giving the resultant intensity, when a polariser is placed in the path of an incident beam. A follower of Laplace, both his statement of the Malus&#x27;s law and his earlier works on polarisation and birefringence were formulated using the corpuscular theory of light.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.

== &quot;Discovery&quot; of polarization ==
In 1810, Malus, while engaged on the theory of double refraction, casually examined through a doubly refracting prism of quartz the sunlight reflected from the windows of the Luxembourg palace. He was surprised to find that the two rays alternately disappeared as the prism was rotated through successive right angles, in other words, that the reflected light had acquired properties exactly corresponding to those of the rays transmitted through Iceland spar. 

He named this phenomenon polarization, and thought it could not be explained by wave theory of light. Instead, he explained it by stating that light-corpuscules have polarity (like magnetic poles).

==Selected works==
* &quot;Mémoire sur la mesure du pouvoir réfringent des corps opaques&quot;. in Nouveau bulletin des sciences de la Société philomathique de Paris, 1 (1807), 77–81
* &quot;Mémoire sur de nouveaux phénomènes d’optique&quot;. ibid., 2 (1811), 291–295
* &quot;Traité d’optique&quot;. in Mémoires présentés à l’Institut des sciences par divers savants, 2 (1811), 214–302
* &quot;Théorie de la double réfraction de la lumière dans les substances cristallines&quot;. ibid., 303–508

==Work==

Malus mathematically analyzed the properties of a system of continuous light rays in three dimensions. He found the equation of caustic surfaces and the Malus theorem: Rays of light that are emitted from a point source, after which they have been reflected on a surface, are all normal to a common surface, but after the second refraction they no longer have this property. If the perpendicular surface is identified with a wave front, it is obvious that this result is false, which Malus did not realize because he adhered to Newton&#x27;s theory of light emission. Malus&#x27;s theorem was not proved until 1824 by W. R. Hamilton, with Adolphe Quetelet and Joseph Diez Gergonne giving a separate proof in 1825.

<doc id="168117" wikidata="Q1859473" url="?curid=168117" title="Maid Marian and Her Merry Men">
<text>Maid Marian and her Merry Men is a British children&#x27;s television series created and written by Tony Robinson and directed by David Bell. It began in 1989 on BBC1 and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially musical comedy retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an &#x27;incompetent&#x27; ex-tailor.

The programme has been likened to &quot;Blackadder&quot;, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson (as well as early, uncredited, script editing work being undertaken by Richard Curtis), but also for its comic style. Many of the show&#x27;s cast, such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, John Rapley, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne, had previously appeared in various episodes of &quot;Blackadder&quot; alongside Robinson.

The show&#x27;s success led to an adaptation produced for the stage and a cartoon strip by Paul Cemmick which was serialised in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s children&#x27;s paper &quot;The Young Telegraph&quot; (also available as a series of collections), and the programme was repeated on BBC One in 2001. Series 1 was released on video in 1990 and 1993, with three episodes each on four tapes, and all four series are available on DVD. It was repeated in April 2002 on the CBBC Channel and the first series was repeated in June 2007 at 12:30 on the CBBC Channel. During the summer of 2009, Gold repeated the entire 4 series.

Tony Robinson was in discussion about a revival in 2018, 2021 and 2022.

==Plot elements==
Many of the plots featured, included or revolved around spoofing particular things, including films such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;, and television programmes, including &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot; and the long-running televised fundraisers Children in Need and Comic Relief. There were also frequent references to other Robin Hood incarnations, most notably ITV&#x27;s &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (and in particular that series&#x27; theme song by Clannad, &quot;Robin (The Hooded Man)&quot; is lampooned in the episode &quot;The Whitish Knight&quot;) and the 1991 film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;. The latter actually features Howard Lew Lewis (Rabies) among its cast.

==Main characters==
===Protagonists===
* Maid Marian (Kate Lonergan): a passionate and idealistic freedom fighter and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the &quot;Merry Men&quot; (though this is never recognised by anyone outside the group). She is by far the most intelligent of the gang, but often lets her idealism blind her to reality, most notably the rest of the gang&#x27;s incompetence. She also is not very patient, but will always defend anyone who she feels is wronged. She often has mud in her hair.
* Robin of Kensington (Wayne Morris): an extremely vain tailor and a yuppie. Came to be seen as the leader of Marian&#x27;s gang by accident, and remains so because he sees it as a cool image to cultivate. His most significant contribution to the outlaws was nevertheless to insist that they all wear green &quot;to co-ordinate with the trees&quot;.
* Barrington (Danny John-Jules): the resident Rasta Merry Man, who would often rap during the episodes&#x27; songs. He sometimes acts as a kind of semi-omniscient narrator (in a similar manner to Alan-a-Dale in more traditional versions). Barrington&#x27;s name may be a reference to Jamaican musician Barrington Levy, due to his 1980 album titled Robin Hood. 
* Little Ron (Mike Edmonds): a very short, aggressive and violent Merry Man who usually faces the wrong way in ambushes. A parody of Little John. He is the second strongest Merry Man of the group, beaten only by Rabies.
* Rabies (Howard Lew Lewis): another Merry Man, very strong, and very stupid, although with his heart in the right place.

===Antagonists===
* King John (Forbes Collins): who also played John&#x27;s brother, Richard the Lionheart, in the episode &quot;The Whitish Knight&quot;, and Queen Eleanor, Guy of Gisbourne&#x27;s mother: a violent and unstable monarch. He is narcissistic and insecure, and becomes very angry at the thought of being unpopular with the peasants. His brother, who was thought to be a wise ruler who would bring England back to a Golden Age, is identical.
* The Sheriff of Nottingham (Tony Robinson): a devious plotter obsessed with collecting taxes. Given the first name &#x27;Arnold&#x27; in the episode &quot;Keeping Mum&quot;, ostensibly only to produce a later pun (Arnold being a suburb of Nottingham). While he is dedicated to stopping Marian, they sometimes find themselves in sympathy with each other regarding the complete stupidity of everyone else.
* Gary and Graeme (Mark Billingham and David Lloyd): guards of the King&#x27;s castle, and the Sheriff&#x27;s henchmen. They are &quot;bestest mates&quot; and extremely affable, but in the tradition of clever villains with idiot sidekicks, not very clever most of the time. They are often very friendly with the Merry Men, who tend to return the sentiment – except when Gary and Graeme are doing what they are paid for. Graeme has a (never seen) brother called Kevin. Graeme tends to enjoy things like torture and teasing the villagers more than Gary does, though Gary will challenge Graeme for the chance to do executions. Gary is shown as completely devoted to his job, to the point of obsession; when sacked, he refused to leave the Sheriff&#x27;s side and carried on as though he had not been fired.
* Guy of Gisbourne (Ramsay Gilderdale): King John&#x27;s wet-behind-the-ears nephew, who has come to live with him at the insistence of his mother, the king&#x27;s older sister, Queen Eleanor. A village idiot, and mummy&#x27;s boy, Guy is widely held in contempt by the heroes and villains alike. He is aged 27 but seems to have a mental age of about 5, and has an imaginary friend and occasionally dresses in a tutu. He is forever talking gibberish to himself and making irrelevant and meaningless interjections during the baddies&#x27; councils. King John does not want to be saddled with his nephew, but obeys his sister&#x27;s orders out of fear that she will &quot;do that nasty thing with the pencils&quot; to him, just as she used to when they were children.
* &quot;Rotten&quot; Rose Scargill (Siobhan Fogarty): rival to Maid Marian and both Marian&#x27;s best friend and worst enemy. She is Robin Hood&#x27;s biggest fan.

==Secondary characters==
* Gladys and Snooker (Hilary Mason and Robin Chandler): two villagers of Worksop. Gladys is an elderly (and extremely stupid) peasant, fond of telling stories and legends, and hanging out with Barrington. She is Worksop&#x27;s &quot;wise old woman&quot;, but admits to being underqualified. Snooker (who also gets called &quot;Stinker&quot;) is another extremely stupid peasant, who appears to be about 40. His greatest claim to fame is apparently inventing a game involving a long stick, a table, and a number of coloured balls. Together, they serve as the mouthpieces of the village, but are generally no more intelligent than the peasants they speak for.
* Nettle (Kerry Potter): a young female villager, who is definitely the equal of Marian in intelligence.
* Chickweed (Karen Salt): a very young peasant girl.
* Hayley (Carly Britnell): another young intelligent female villager. She had a comet named after her after she vomited as it shot across the sky. Her appearance is in &quot;Hayley&#x27;s Vomit&quot;.
* The Beast of Bolsover: a reference to the nickname of Dennis Skinner, then the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Bolsover and member of the Socialist Campaign Group. Tony Robinson is a well-known Labour Party supporter, and was elected to the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee in 2000.
* Eric &quot;The Newt&quot; Teasel: an archer, appearing in the episode &quot;Robert The Incredible Chicken&quot;. From Epping Forest.
* Cowpat: a pretty young village woman. She is a friend of Rose, and one of Robin&#x27;s many fans. She appeared in &quot;Rotten Rose (Part One)&quot;.
* Clough: a tall, red haired and bearded village man, from Nottingham forest and sometimes seen about Worksop. Participated in the archery contest. The character name is a reference to Brian Clough, manager of English football team Nottingham Forest at the time.
* Nigel Pargetter: semi-regularly appearing but uncredited peasant (actually Martin [Wills] O&#x27;Toole) who fell victim to a number of misfortunes, including being punched in the head several times, being crushed by a radiator during Bloopy, and having a large cucumber lodged in his head by Robin&#x27;s lookalike. He is named after a well-known character in long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera, &quot;The Archers&quot;.
* &quot;Little Girl&quot; (Kellie Bright): often found close to Gladys in the first series.
* &quot;Mad Prisoner&quot; (Christopher Nichol)

==Music==
The music and songs for &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot; were composed by Nick Russell-Pavier and David Chilton. Each episode contained either one or two songs, which were mostly originals but were sometimes parodies. According to commentaries on the DVDs, the actors were frequently dubbed in their singing voices, both by themselves and (more often) by professional singers in post-filming studio sessions. Gary, Graeme, Guy and Barrington almost always sing their own songs, however.

==Awards==
Maid Marian and her Merry Men won several awards, including the 1990 BAFTA for &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Programme (Entertainment/Drama)&quot;. It was also nominated for the same award in 1991, losing to &quot;Press Gang&quot;. The programme also won at least one award from the Royal Television Society, as well as the prestigious &quot;Prix Jeunesse Variety Award&quot; at the International Children&#x27;s Programme Festival in Munich.

==Locations==
The programme was set in the very real Nottinghamshire town of Worksop, which, along with Mansfield, is one of the two closest modern day towns to the Major Oak, although the whole show was shot in Somerset. The outside scenes were filmed in woods at Porlock, near Minehead, and the castle scenes were filmed in Cleeve Abbey. The beach at Porlock features in some of the episodes including The Whitish Knight.

==Other materials==
The programme was adapted for a stage musical by Tony Robinson, Mark Billingham and David Lloyd. It toured several British theatres. The theatre programme for the production at the Bristol Old Vic featured new artwork by Paul Cemmick, showing Tony Robinson dreaming the production after being hit in the head by a football. The script for this production was later published in book format by Longman literature in 1992, as part of a series of BBC TV (and radio) plays to be used in classrooms at Key Stage 3 level (roughly ages 11–14). The book includes support material and activities for this purpose.

<doc id="168118" wikidata="Q936117" url="?curid=168118" title="South Pole–Aitken basin">
<text>The South Pole–Aitken basin (SPA Basin, ) is an immense impact crater on the far side of the Moon. At roughly in diameter and between deep, it is one of the largest known impact craters in the Solar System. It is the largest, oldest, and deepest basin recognized on the Moon. It is estimated that it was formed approximately 4.2 to 4.3 billion years ago, during the Pre-Nectarian epoch (with radiometric dating of lunar zircons proposed to originate from the basin suggesting a precise age of 4.338 billion years). It was named for two features on opposite sides of the basin: the lunar South Pole at one end and the crater Aitken on the northern end. The outer rim of this basin can be seen from Earth as a huge mountain chain located on the Moon&#x27;s southern limb, sometimes informally called &quot;Leibnitz mountains&quot;.

On 3 January 2019, the Chang&#x27;e 4, a Chinese spacecraft, landed in the basin, specifically within a crater called Von Kármán. In May 2019, scientists announced that a large mass of material had been identified deep within the crater. Chang&#x27;e 6 aims to collect sample from this crater, specifically within the Apollo basin.
== Discovery ==
The existence of a giant far side basin was suspected as early as 1962 based on early Soviet probe images (namely Luna 3 and Zond 3), but it was not until wide-field photographs taken by the US Lunar Orbiter program became available in 1966-7 that geologists recognized its true size. Laser altimeter data obtained during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions showed that the northern portion of this basin was very deep, but since these data were only available along the near-equatorial ground tracks of the orbiting command and service modules, the topography of the rest of the basin remained unknown. The geologic map showing the northern half of this basin and with its edge depicted was published in 1978 by the United States Geological Survey. Little was known about the basin until the 1990s, when the spacecraft &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Clementine&quot; visited the Moon. Multispectral images obtained from these missions showed that this basin contains more FeO and TiO2 than typical lunar highlands, and hence has a darker appearance. The topography of the basin was mapped in its entirety for the first time using altimeter data and the analysis of stereo image pairs taken during the Clementine mission. Most recently, the composition of this basin has been further constrained by the analysis of data obtained from a gamma-ray spectrometer that was on board the Lunar Prospector mission.
== Physical characteristics ==
The South Pole–Aitken basin is the largest, deepest and oldest basin recognized on the Moon. The lowest elevations of the Moon (about −9000 m) are located within the South Pole–Aitken basin. The Moon&#x27;s tallest mountains are found around the basin&#x27;s rim – they have summit elevations of up to 8500 m and base-to-peak heights of up to 7000 m. Because of this basin&#x27;s great size, the crust at this locale is expected to be thinner than typical as a result of the large amount of material that was excavated due to an impact. Crustal thickness maps constructed using the Moon&#x27;s topography and gravity field imply a thickness of about 30 km beneath the floor of this basin, in comparison to 60–80 km around it and the global average of about 50 km.

The composition of the basin, as estimated from the &quot;Galileo&quot;, &quot;Clementine&quot;, and &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot; missions, appears to be different from typical highland regions. Most importantly, none of the samples obtained from the American Apollo and Russian Luna missions, nor the handful of identified lunar meteorites, have comparable compositions. The orbital data indicate that the floor of the basin has slightly elevated abundances of iron, titanium, and thorium. In terms of mineralogy, the basin floor is much richer in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene than the surrounding highlands, which are largely anorthositic. Several possibilities exist for this distinctive chemical signature: one is that it might simply represent lower crustal materials that are somewhat richer in iron, titanium and thorium than the upper crust; another is that the composition reflects the widespread distribution of ponds of iron-rich basalts, similar to those that make up the lunar maria; alternatively, the rocks in the basin could contain a component from the lunar mantle if the basin excavated all the way through the crust; and, finally, it is possible that a large portion of the lunar surface surrounding the basin was melted during the impact event, and differentiation of this impact melt sheet could have given rise to additional geochemical anomalies. Complicating the matter is the possibility that several processes have contributed to the basin&#x27;s anomalous geochemical signature. Ultimately, the origin of the anomalous composition of the basin is not known with certainty and will likely require a sample return mission to determine.
==Exploration==
China sent Chang&#x27;e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon. This is China&#x27;s second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang&#x27;e 5 from the lunar near side four years earlier. It also carried a Chinese rover called &quot;Jinchan&quot; to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged Chang&#x27;e 6 lander on lunar surface. The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024 at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon&#x27;s surface on 1 June 2024. The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024 at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, and later completed another robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed on Inner Mongolia on 25 June 2024, completing China&#x27;s far side extraterrestrial sample return mission.

== Origin ==

Simulations of near vertical impacts show that the bolide ought to have excavated vast amounts of mantle materials from depths as great as 200 km below the surface. However, observations thus far do not favor a mantle composition for this basin and crustal thickness maps seem to indicate the presence of about 10 kilometers of crustal materials beneath this basin&#x27;s floor. This has suggested to some that the basin was not formed by a typical high-velocity impact, but may instead have been formed by a low-velocity projectile around 200 km in diameter (compare to the 10 km diameter Chicxulub impactor) that hit at a low angle (about 30 degrees or less), and hence did not dig very deeply into the Moon. Putative evidence for this comes from the high elevations north-east of the rim of the South Pole–Aitken basin that might represent ejecta from such an oblique impact. The impact theory would also account for magnetic anomalies on the Moon.

<text>The Church of Ireland (, ; , ) is a Christian church in Ireland, and an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. It is organised on an all-Ireland basis and is the second-largest Christian church on the island after the Roman Catholic Church. Like other Anglican churches, it has retained elements of pre-Reformation practice, notably its episcopal polity, while rejecting the primacy of the pope.

In theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the Reformation, particularly those of the English Reformation, but self-identifies as being both Reformed and Catholic, in that it sees itself as the inheritor of a continuous tradition going back to the founding of Christianity in Ireland. As with other members of the global Anglican communion, individual parishes accommodate differing approaches to the level of ritual and formality, variously referred to as High and Low Church.

As of 2013, the Church of Ireland ranked &quot;second in the State in terms of the provision of primary schools with 174 schools under its Patronage.&quot; There were &quot;over 500 teachers and over 13,500 pupils in Church of Ireland Primary schools.&quot; There were at the time &quot;twenty post-primary schools in the State which are either affiliated with the Church of Ireland at diocesan level or&quot; are self-identified as Church of Ireland.

== Overview ==
The Church of Ireland sees itself as that &#x27;part of the Irish Church which was influenced by the Reformation, and has its origins in the early Celtic Church of St Patrick&#x27;. This makes it both catholic, as the inheritor of a continuous tradition of faith and practice, and protestant, since it rejects the authority of Rome and accepts changes in doctrine and liturgy caused by the Reformation.

Following the Synod of Ráth Breasail (also known as Rathbreasail) in 1111, Irish Catholicism transitioned from a monastic to a diocesan and parish-based mode of organisation and governance. Many Irish present-day dioceses trace their boundaries to decisions made at the synod. The work of organizing the Church was completed by the Synod of Kells which took place in 1152, under the presidency of Giovanni Cardinal Paparoni. Diocesan reform continued and the number of archbishoprics was increased from two to four. The synod granted the Primacy of Ireland to the Archdiocese of Armagh.

Some modern scholarship argues that early Irish Christianity was functionally separate from Rome but shared much of its liturgy and practice, and that this allowed both the Church of Ireland and Irish Catholicism to claim descent from Saint Patrick. It is also said that the Catholic Church in Ireland was jurisdictionally independent until 1155, when Pope Adrian IV purported to declare it a papal fief and granted Henry II of England the Lordship of Ireland in return for paying tithes; his right to do so has been disputed ever since.

In 1534, the English Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which broke communion with the papacy and recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England; two years later, the Irish Parliament followed suit by acknowledging him as head of the Irish church. Although many bishops and most of the clergy refused to conform, the Church of Ireland was left with diocesan buildings and lands, since under the feudal system bishops held that property as vassals of the Crown. Despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the new church, a large majority of the Irish remained loyal to the Church of Rome, while in Ulster the church was outnumbered by Presbyterians. However, it remained the established church of the whole of Ireland until the First Gladstone ministry&#x27;s Irish Church Act 1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 42) disestablished it, with effect from 1 January 1871.

The modern Church of Ireland is the second largest religious organisation in the Republic of Ireland, and the third largest in Northern Ireland, after the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches.

==History==
===Formation===

Christianity in Ireland is generally dated to the mid to late 5th century AD, when the Romano-British cleric Saint Patrick began his conversion mission, although the exact dates are disputed. Prior to the 12th century, the Irish church was independent of Papal control, and governed by powerful monasteries, rather than bishops. While the Kingdom of Dublin looked to the English Diocese of Canterbury for guidance, in 1005 AD Brian Ború made a large donation to the Monastery of Armagh and recognised its Archbishop as Primate of all Ireland in an attempt to secure his position as High King of Ireland.

Inspired by Máel Máedóc Ua Morgair, reformist head of Bangor Abbey, the 1111 Synod of Ráth Breasail sought to reduce the power of the monasteries by creating Dioceses headed by bishops, as was common outside Ireland. Under the 1152 Synod of Kells, the Irish church received its own archbishops, rather than being subject to Canterbury. Under the Laudabiliter in 1155, English-born Pope Adrian IV granted Henry II of England the Lordship of Ireland in return for paying tithes to Rome. His claim was based on the 4th-century Donation of Constantine, which allegedly gave the Papacy religious control over all Christian territories in the western Roman Empire. Its legality was disputed at the time, since Ireland had never been part of the empire, while the Donation itself was later exposed as a forgery.

Since Ireland was now considered a papal fief, its bishops were appointed by Rome but generally adopted English liturgy and saints, such as Edward the Confessor, and Thomas Becket. In 1536, the Irish Parliament followed their English colleagues by accepting Henry VIII of England as head of the church, rather than the Pope. This marks the founding of the reformed Church of Ireland, confirmed when Henry became King of Ireland in 1541. Largely restricted to Dublin, led by Archbishop George Browne, it expanded under Edward VI, until Catholicism was restored by his sister Mary I in 1553.

When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1558, only five bishops accepted her Religious Settlement, and most of the Irish clergy had to be deposed. This was hampered by the church&#x27;s relative poverty, while adapting to the changes of regime damaged the reputation of those who remained. Hugh Curwen was Dean of Hereford until 1555, when Mary made him Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, before returning to the reformed church in 1558. Despite accusations of &#x27;moral delinquency&#x27;, he remained Archbishop and Lord Chancellor until 1567, when he was appointed Bishop of Oxford.

The absence of Gaelic-speaking ministers led to the adoption of a gradualist policy, similar to that used in Catholic areas of Northern England. &#x27;Occasional conformity&#x27; allowed the use of pre-Reformation rites, combined with acceptance of the established Church; this practice persisted in both England and Ireland well into the mid-18th century.

Lack of Irish Gaelic literature was another restriction; shortly before his death in 1585, Nicholas Walsh began translation of the New Testament. Continued by John Kearny and Nehemiah Donnellan, it was finally printed in 1602 by William Daniel, who also translated the Book of Common Prayer, or BCP, in 1606. An Irish version of the Old Testament was published in 1685 by Narcissus Marsh, but the revised BCP was not available until 1712.

===17th century===
At the beginning of the 17th century, most native Irish were Catholic, with Protestant settlers in Ulster establishing an independent Presbyterian church. Largely confined to an English-speaking minority in The Pale, the most important figure of the Church&#x27;s development was Dublin-born theologian and historian, James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh from 1625 to 1656. In 1615, the Church of Ireland drew up its own confession of faith, similar to the English version, but more detailed, less ambiguous and often explicitly Calvinist. When the Thirty-Nine Articles were formally adopted by the Irish church in 1634, Ussher ensured they were in addition to the Irish Articles; however, they were soon superseded by the Thirty Nine Articles, which remain in use to the present day.

Under Charles I, the Church of Ireland claimed to be the original and universal church, while the Papacy was an innovation, thus vesting it with the supremacy of Apostolic succession. This argument was supported by Ussher, and Charles&#x27; former personal chaplain, John Leslie, a key supporter of Caroline reforms in Scotland, appointed bishop of Derry &amp; Raphoe in 1633. During the 1641–1653 Irish Confederate Wars, nearly two-thirds of Ireland was controlled by the largely Catholic Confederacy, and in 1644, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini became Papal Nuncio to Ireland. Irish Catholicism had developed greater tolerance for Protestants, while sharing their hostility to elaborate ritual. Rinuccini&#x27;s insistence on following Roman liturgy, and attempts to re-introduce ceremonies such as foot washing divided the Confederacy, and contributed to its rapid collapse in the 1649–1652 Cromwell&#x27;s re-conquest of Ireland.

The church was re-established after the 1660 Restoration of Charles II and in January 1661, meetings by &#x27;Papists, Presbyterians, Independents or separatists&#x27; were made illegal. In practice, the penal laws were loosely enforced and after 1666, Protestant Dissenters and Catholics were allowed to resume their seats in the Parliament of Ireland. In 1685, the Catholic James II became king with considerable backing in all three kingdoms; this changed when his policies seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and into an attack on the established church. His prosecution of the Seven Bishops in England for seditious libel in June 1688 destroyed his support base, while many felt James lost his right to govern by ignoring his coronation Oath to maintain the primacy of the Protestant religion.

This made oaths a high-profile issue, since ministers of the national churches of England, Scotland and Ireland were required to swear allegiance to the ruling monarch. When the 1688 Glorious Revolution replaced James with his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, Mary II and William III, a minority felt bound by their previous oath and refused to swear another. This led to the Non-Juring schism, although for the vast majority, this was a matter of personal conscience, rather than political support for James.

The Irish church was less affected by this controversy, although the Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh became a Non-Juror, as did a handful of the clergy, including Jacobite propagandist Charles Leslie. The Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland is traditionally viewed as beginning in 1691 when the Treaty of Limerick ended the 1689–1691 Williamite War. The Church re-established control and the 1697 Banishment Act expelled Catholic bishops and regular clergy from Ireland, leaving only the so-called secular clergy.

===18th century===

In 1704, the Test Act was extended to Ireland; this effectively restricted public office to members of the Church of Ireland and officially remained in place until the 1829 Catholic Relief Act. However, the practice of occasional conformity continued, while many Catholic gentry by-passed these restrictions by educating their sons as Protestants, their daughters as Catholics; Edmund Burke, who was raised Church of Ireland but whose parents simultaneously raised his sister Juliana Catholic, is one example.

It is estimated fewer than 15 – 20% of the Irish population were nominally members of the church, which remained a minority under pressure from both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists. The 1719 Toleration Act allowed Nonconformists freedom of worship, while the Irish Parliament paid their ministers a small subsidy known as the &#x27;regium donum.&#x27;

Although willing to permit a degree of flexibility, like their English counterparts, Irish bishops viewed their status as the national church to be non-negotiable and used their seats in the Irish House of Lords to enforce this. However, in 1725 Parliament passed the first in a series of &#x27;temporary&#x27; Indemnity Acts, which allowed office holders to &#x27;postpone&#x27; taking the oaths; the bishops were willing to approve these, since they could be repealed at any point.

In the 17th century, religious and political beliefs were often assumed to be the same; thus Catholics were considered political subversives, simply because of their religion. During the 18th century, sectarian divisions were replaced by a growing sense of Irish autonomy; in 1749, Bishop Berkeley issued an address to the Catholic clergy, urging them to work together with the church in the (Irish) national interest. After 1750, the government increasingly viewed Catholic emancipation as a way to reduce the power of Protestant nationalists like the United Irishmen; this had potential implications for the church since the requirement non-church members pay tithes was deeply resented. The movement ended after the 1798 Rebellion and Ireland&#x27;s incorporation with Britain.

===19th to 20th centuries===
Following the legal union of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain by the Act of Union 1800, the Church of Ireland was also united with the Church of England to form the United Church of England and Ireland. At the same time, one archbishop and three bishops from Ireland (selected by rotation) were given seats in the House of Lords at Westminster, joining the two archbishops and twenty-four bishops from the Church of England.

The Irish Church was over-staffed, with 22 bishops, including 4 archbishops, for an official membership of 852,000, less than that of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese of Durham. The Church Temporalities (Ireland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 37) reduced these to 12, as well as making financial changes. Part of a series of reforms by the 1830–1834 Whig government that included the Reform Act 1832, it caused deep political splits. The implications of government legislating church governance was a contributory factor in the Oxford Movement and had wide repercussions for the Anglican Communion.

Another source of resentment was the funding of the Church by tithes imposed on all Irish subjects, even though the majority were not members. This led to anomalies like the incumbent of a living near Bessborough, who in 1833 was receiving £1,000 per year, despite the fact the parish had no Protestants or even a church. The &quot;Tithe War&quot; of 1831–36 led to their replacement by the &quot;tithe rent charge&quot; but they did not entirely disappear until the Irish Church Act 1869.

The Act ended the Church&#x27;s status as a state organisation; its bishops were removed from the House of Lords and its property transferred to the government. Compensation was paid but in the immediate aftermath, parishes faced great difficulty in local financing after the loss of rent-generating lands and buildings.

==Governance==
The head of the Church of Ireland is, &quot;ex officio&quot;, the Archbishop of Armagh. In 1870, immediately prior to its disestablishment, the Church provided for its internal government, led by a General Synod, and with financial and administrative support by a Representative Church Body. Like other Irish churches, the Church of Ireland did not divide when Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s and it continues to be governed on an all-Ireland basis.

===Structure===

The polity of the Church of Ireland is episcopal church governance, as in other Anglican churches. The church maintains the traditional structure dating to pre-Reformation times, a system of geographical parishes organised into dioceses. There were more than 30 of these historically, grouped into four provinces; today, after consolidation over the centuries, there are eleven Church of Ireland dioceses or united dioceses, each headed by a bishop and belonging to one of two surviving provinces. In 2022 the diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry was merged with Limerick and Killaloe when both of the bishops of the separate dioceses retired and a new bishop was appointed for the combined diocese of Tuam, Limerick and Killaloe.

The leader of the southern province is the Archbishop of Dublin, at present Michael Jackson; that of the northern province is the Archbishop of Armagh, at present Francis John McDowell. These two archbishops are styled Primate of Ireland and Primate of All Ireland respectively, suggesting the ultimate seniority of the latter. Although he has relatively little absolute authority, the Archbishop of Armagh is respected as the church&#x27;s general leader and spokesman, and is elected in a process different from those for all other bishops.

===General synod and policy-making===
Doctrine, canon law, church governance, church policy, and liturgical matters are decided by the church&#x27;s general synod. The general synod comprises two houses, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. The House of Bishops includes the 10 diocesan bishops and two archbishops, forming one order. The House of Representatives is made up of two orders, clergy and laity. The order of clergy holds one third of the seats while the laity holds two-thirds of the seats. As of 2017, there are 216 clergy members and 432 lay members in the House of Representatives. The membership of the House of Representatives is made up of delegates from the dioceses, with seats allocated to each diocese&#x27;s clergy and laity in specific numbers; these delegates are elected every three years. The general synod meets annually, and special meetings can be called by the leading bishop or one third of any of its orders.

Changes in policy must be passed by a simple majority of both the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. Changes to doctrine, for example the decision to ordain women as priests, must be passed by a two-thirds majority of both Houses. The two sit together for general deliberations but separate for some discussions and voting. While the House of Representatives always votes publicly, often by orders, the House of Bishops has tended to vote in private, coming to a decision before matters reach the floor of the synod. This practice has been broken only once when, in 1999, the House of Bishops voted unanimously in public to endorse the efforts of the Archbishop of Armagh, the Diocese of Armagh and the Standing Committee of the General Synod in their attempts to resolve the crisis at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree near Portadown.

====Statutes and constitution====
The church&#x27;s internal laws are formulated as bills proposed to the Houses of the general synod, which when passed become Statutes. The church&#x27;s governing document, its constitution, is modified, consolidated and published by way of statute also, the most recent edition, the 13th, being published in 2003.

====Representative body====
The representative body of the Church of Ireland, often called the &quot;Representative Church Body&quot; (RCB), is the corporate trustee of the church, as established by law, and much of the church&#x27;s property is vested in it. The members of the RCB are the bishops plus diocesan delegates and twelve co-opted members, and it meets at least four times a year. The staff of the representative body are analogous to clerical civil servants, and among other duties they oversee property, including church buildings, cemeteries and investments, administer some salaries and pensions, and manage the church library. While parishes, dioceses, and other parts of the church structure care for their particular properties, this is often subject to RCB rules.

===Orders of ministry and positions===
The Church of Ireland embraces three orders of ministry: deacons, priests (or presbyters) and bishops. These orders are distinct from positions such as rector, vicar or canon.

===Diocesan governance===
Each diocese or united diocese is led by its Ordinary, one of the nine bishops and two archbishops, and the Ordinary may have one or more Archdeacons to support them, along with a Rural Dean for each group of parishes. There is a diocesan synod for each diocese; there may be separate synods for historic dioceses now in unions. These synods comprise the bishop along with clergy and lay representatives from the parishes, and subject to the laws of the church, and the work of the general synod and its committees and the representative body and its committees, oversee the operation of the diocese. Each diocesan synod in turn appoints a diocesan council to which it can delegate powers.

===Parochial governance===
Each parish has a presiding member of the clergy, assisted by two churchwardens and often also two glebewardens, one of each type of warden being appointed by the clerical incumbent, and one by popular vote. All qualified adult members of the parish comprise the general vestry, which meets annually, within 20 days each side of Easter, as the Easter Vestry. There is also a select vestry for the parish, or sometimes for each active church in a parish, comprising the presiding cleric and any curate assistants, along with relevant churchwardens and glebewardens and a number of members elected at the Easter Vestry meeting. The select vestry assists in the care and operation of the parish and one or more church buildings.

===Cathedral governance===
Special provisions apply to the management and operation of five key cathedrals, in Dublin (which contains two Church of Ireland cathedrals), Armagh, Down, and Belfast.

===Tribunals===
The church has disciplinary and appeals tribunals, and diocesan courts, and a court of the general synod.

==Present==
===Membership===
The Church of Ireland experienced a major decline in membership during the 20th century, both in Northern Ireland, where around 65% of its members live, and in the Republic of Ireland. The church is still the second-largest in the Republic of Ireland, with 126,414 members in 2016 (minus 2% compared to the 2011 census results) and the third-largest in Northern Ireland, with around 260,000 members. The most recently available figures published by the Church of Ireland, dating to 2013, found that average Sunday attendance across the church was 58,257, with 74 per cent of this attendance in the Province of Armagh. Attendance varied strongly across dioceses; the most-attended diocese was Down and Dromore, with 12,731 in average Sunday attendance, while the least-attended was Meath and Kildare with 1,463. Similarly, in 2016, a peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;Journal of Anglican Studies&quot; by Cambridge University Press found that the Church of Ireland has approximately 384,176 total members and 58,000 active baptised members.

===Cathedrals===
The Church of Ireland has two cathedrals in Dublin: within the line of the walls of the old city is Christ Church Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop of Dublin, and just outside the old walls is St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, which the church designated as the National Cathedral for Ireland in 1870. Cathedrals also exist in the other dioceses.

There is also the metropolitan cathedral church of Ireland, situated in Armagh, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. This cathedral is the seat of the archbishop and metropolitan, the Most Reverend John McDowell.

===Offices, training of priests and teachers===
The church&#x27;s central offices are in Rathmines, adjacent to the former Church of Ireland College of Education, and the church&#x27;s library is in Churchtown. Teacher training now occurs within the Dublin City University Institute of Education, overseen by the Church of Ireland Centre, based at the former All Hallows College. The church operates a seminary, the Church of Ireland Theological Institute, in Rathgar, in the south inner suburbs of Dublin. 

===Education of youth===
===Anglican Communion===

The churches of the Anglican Communion are linked by affection and common loyalty. They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury, in his person, is a unique focus of Anglican unity. He calls the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of Primates, and is President of the Anglican Consultative Council. The contemporary Church of Ireland, despite having a number of High Church (often described as Anglo-Catholic) parishes, is generally on the Low Church end of the spectrum of world Anglicanism. Historically, it had little of the difference in churchmanship between parishes characteristic of other Anglican provinces, although a number of markedly liberal, High Church or Evangelical parishes have developed in recent decades. It was the second province of the Anglican Communion after the Anglican Church of New Zealand (1857) to adopt, on its 1871 disestablishment, synodical government. It was also one of the first provinces to begin ordaining women to the priesthood (1991).

====Relation with the GAFCON movement====
GAFCON Ireland was launched on 21 April 2018, in Belfast, with 320 attendees from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. International speakers included Archbishops Peter Jensen (retired Archbishop of Sydney) and Gregory Venables (Primate of the Anglican Church of South America). The Church of Ireland was represented at GAFCON III, held on 17–22 June 2018 in Jerusalem, by a six-member delegation which included two bishops; Ferran Glenfield of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh and Harold Miller of Down and Dromore. Their participation was criticised by some members of the Church of Ireland. The Church of Ireland is not a member of GAFCON and the church communicated that attendance by clergy was unofficial in &quot;a personal capacity&quot; and the General Synod has voted against GAFCON&#x27;s statement on the Lambeth Conference. GAFCON supporters refuted their critics claims, saying that they endorse Lambeth 1.10 resolution on human sexuality, which is still the official stance of the Church of Ireland, but has been rejected by the liberal provinces of the Anglican Communion. The Rev. Charles Raven stated: &quot;the charge that GAFCON is a breakaway or separatist group is not supported by the evidence. It is a movement of reform and revitalisation which has enabled faithful Anglicans to remain within the Communion, especially in North America and Brazil. While being clear that participation in its common life is based upon fidelity to the biblical gospel, not merely upon historic ties, the Jerusalem Statement and Declaration of 2008 says quite unequivocally that &#x27;Our fellowship is not breaking away from the Anglican Communion&#x27;.&quot;

===Ecumenical relations===
Like many other Anglican churches, the Church of Ireland is a member of many ecumenical bodies, including the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, Churches Together in Britain and Ireland and the Irish Council of Churches. It is also a member of the Porvoo Communion.

===Flags===
In 1999, the church voted to prohibit the flying of flags other than St Patrick&#x27;s flag and the Flag of the Anglican Communion. However, the Union Flag continues to fly on many churches in Northern Ireland.

The church has an official website. Its journal is &quot;The Church of Ireland Gazette&quot;, which is editorially independent, but the governing body of which is appointed by the church. Many parishes and other internal organizations also produce newsletters or other publications, as well as maintaining websites.

==Doctrine and practice==
The centre of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s teaching is the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church include:
* Chalcedonian Christology; Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God in one person. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
* Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
* The Old and New Testaments of the Bible (&quot;God&#x27;s Word written&quot;) were written by people &quot;under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit&quot;. The Apocrypha are additional books that are to be read, but not to determine doctrine. The Apocrypha of the King James version of the Bible constitutes the books of the Vulgate version that are present neither in the Hebrew Old Testament nor the Greek New Testament.
* The &quot;two great and necessary&quot; sacraments are Baptism and the Eucharist (also called Holy Communion and the Lord&#x27;s Supper).
* Those &quot;commonly called Sacraments that are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel&quot; are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent and unction.
* Belief in heaven, hell and Jesus&#x27;s return in glory.

The 16th-century apologist, Richard Hooker, posits that there are three sources of authority in Anglicanism: scripture, tradition and reason. It is not known how widely accepted this idea is within Anglicanism. It is further posited that the three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. In Hooker&#x27;s model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine; things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.

===Modern doctrinal debates===
==== Ordination of women ====
In recent decades, the church has ordained women to all offices. In 1984, the General Synod approved the ordination of women to the diaconate and, in 1987, the first woman, Katherine Poulton, was ordained as a deacon. In 1990, the church began ordaining women to the priesthood. The first two women ordained were Kathleen Margaret Brown and Irene Templeton. In 2013, the church appointed its first female bishop, Pat Storey.

==== Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy ====
The church has been divided over aspects of human sexuality. In 2002, the issue became pertinent as a rector provided a blessing for a lesbian couple. The denomination announced a period of discernment to allocate time to the perspectives within the discussion. In 2010, a congregation was recognised by the church for receiving an LGBTI award for offering services for LGBTI people. The Church of Ireland canon defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman, and does not perform same-sex marriages, but the church also supported the legal right of same-sex couples to register a civil marriage.

Civil partnerships have been allowed since 2005. The church has no official position on civil unions. In 2008, &quot;the Church of Ireland Pensions Board ha[d] confirmed that it will treat civil partners the same as spouses.&quot; The General Synod adopted the Pensions Board&#x27;s policy in 2008. In 2011, a cleric in the Church of Ireland entered into a same-sex civil partnership with his bishop&#x27;s permission. Assurances of sexual abstinence were not required from the cleric. In 2012, the church&#x27;s Clergy Pension Fund continued to recognise that &quot;the pension entitlement of a member&#x27;s registered civil partner will be the same as that of a surviving spouse.&quot; Regarding cohabitation, the church said that &quot;any view of cohabitation has to be the intention of the couple to lifelong loyalty and faithfulness within their relationship.&quot; In 2004, then Archbishop John Neill said that the &quot;Church would support the extension of legal rights on issues such as tax, welfare benefits, inheritance and hospital visits to cohabiting couples, both same gender and others.&quot; The church recognises four general viewpoints within the denomination ranging from opposition to acceptance toward same-gender relationships.

Prior to the referendum on same-sex marriage, the church remained neutral on the issue. In 2015, the Bishop of Cork, the Rt. Rev. Paul Colton, Bishop Michael Burrows of Cashel, and two retired archbishops of Dublin endorsed same-sex marriage. While voting &quot;no&quot; on gay marriage, Bishop Pat Storey endorsed civil unions. Also, 55 clergy signed a letter supporting the blessing of same-sex couples. In its pastoral letter, the church reiterated that, presently, church marriages are only for heterosexual couples, but that clergy may offer prayers for same-sex couples. When asked about clergy entering into civil same-sex marriages, the letter stated that &quot;all are free to exercise their democratic entitlements once they are enshrined in legislation. However, members of the clergy, are further bound by the Ordinal and by the authority of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.&quot; Services of Thanksgiving for same-sex marriage have taken place in congregations; for example, St Audoen&#x27;s Church hosted &quot;a service of thanksgiving&quot; for same-sex marriage. LGBTI services are also allowed by the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.

REFORM Ireland, a conservative lobby, has criticised the official letter as &quot;a dangerous departure from confessing Anglicanism&quot; and continues to oppose same-sex marriage recognition. Reflecting division, the church deferred its report on same-sex marriage to listen to all voices. &quot;The Church of Ireland Gazette&quot;, although &quot;editorially independent&quot;, endorsed a blessing rite for same-sex couples. Many congregations, including cathedrals, have become publicly affirming of LGBTI rights. A church report has determined that &quot;the moral logic underpinning the negative portrayal of same-sex eroticism in Scripture does not directly address committed, loving, consecrated same-sex relationships today&quot;. In 2017, the General Synod considered a proposal to request for public services of thanksgiving for same-sex couples, but the proposal was not passed; the church&#x27;s select committee on human sexuality recommended that the bishops continue to study the issues. There were 176 votes against the motion to request public services, 146 in favour, and 24 abstentions. The Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, declared his support for same-sex marriage ceremonies in the Church of Ireland. Three dioceses, the United Diocese of Tuam, Limerick, and Killaloe, the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough, and the Diocese of Cashel, Ferns, and Ossory have voted to support the blessing of civil same-sex marriages, requesting that a motion be considered by the General Synod.

===Liturgical issues===
====Irish language====
The first translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Irish was published in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was published in 1712.

The Church of Ireland has its own Irish language body, &quot;Cumann Gaelach na hEaglaise&quot; (&quot;Irish Guild of the Church&quot;). This was founded in 1914 to bring together members of the Church of Ireland interested in the Irish language and Gaelic culture and to promote the Irish language within the Church of Ireland. The guild aims to link its programmes with the Irish language initiatives which have been centred round Christ Church Cathedral. It holds services twice a month in Irish.

From 1926 to 1995, the church had its own Irish-language teacher training college, &quot;Coláiste Moibhí&quot;. Today, there are a number of interdenominational &quot;Gaelscoileanna&quot; (schools where Irish-medium education is applied).

<text>Free sale, fixity of tenure, and fair rent, also known as the Three Fs, were a set of demands first issued by the Tenant Right League during their campaign for land reform in Ireland starting in the 1850s. They were:

* Free sale—meaning a tenant could sell the interest in their holding to an incoming tenant without landlord interference;
* Fixity of tenure—meaning that a tenant could not be evicted if the rent was paid;
* Fair rent—meaning rent control: for the first time in the United Kingdom, fair rent would be decided by land courts, not by the landlords.

Many historians contend that their absence contributed significantly to the Great Irish Famine (1846–49), as it enabled the mass eviction of starving tenants. The Three Fs were advocated by several political movements, notably the Independent Irish Party (1852–1858) and later the Irish Parliamentary Party during the Land War (from 1878). The British Government conceded to these demands through a series of Irish Land Acts enacted from the 1870s onward, with nearly full implementation in the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881.

<doc id="168154" wikidata="Q314917" url="?curid=168154" title="Daniel O'Connell">
<text>Daniel(I) O’Connell (; 6 August 1775 – 15 May 1847), hailed in his time as The Liberator, was the acknowledged political leader of Ireland&#x27;s Roman Catholic majority in the first half of the 19th century. His mobilisation of Catholic Ireland, down to the poorest class of tenant farmers, secured the final instalment of Catholic emancipation in 1829 and allowed him to take a seat in the United Kingdom Parliament to which he had been twice elected.

At Westminster, O&#x27;Connell championed liberal and reform causes (being internationally renowned as an abolitionist) but he failed in his declared objective for Irelandthe repeal of the Act of Union 1800 and the restoration of an Irish Parliament.

In 1843, a threat of military force induced O&#x27;Connell to call a halt to an unprecedented campaign of open-air mass meetings. The loss of prestige, combined with the perceived indifference of the Whigs he had supported in government to the Great Famine, dispirited and divided his following. In his final year, criticism of his political compromises and of his system of patronage split the national movement that he had singularly led.

Irish nationalists continued to dispute O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s legacy—honoured in 1922 in the renaming of Dublin&#x27;s principal thoroughfare. Biographers have suggested that his combination of confessional politics and liberal principle was a forerunner of European Christian democracy.

==Early and professional life==
===Kerry and France===
O&#x27;Connell was born at Carhan near Cahersiveen, County Kerry, to the O&#x27;Connells of Derrynane, a wealthy Roman Catholic family that, under the Penal Laws, had been able to retain land only through the medium of Protestant trustees and the forbearance of their Protestant neighbours. His parents were Morgan O&#x27;Connell and Catherine O&#x27;Mullane. The poet Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill was an aunt; and Daniel Charles, Count O&#x27;Connell, an Irish Brigade officer in the service of the King of France (and twelve years a prisoner of Napoleon), an uncle. O&#x27;Connell grew up in Derrynane House, the household of his bachelor uncle, Maurice &quot;Hunting Cap&quot; O&#x27;Connell (landowner, smuggler and justice of the peace) who made the young O&#x27;Connell his heir presumptive

In 1791, under his uncle&#x27;s patronage, O&#x27;Connell and his elder brother Maurice were sent to continue their schooling in France at the English Jesuit college of Saint-Omer. Revolutionary upheaval and their mob denunciation as &quot;young priests&quot; and &quot;little aristocrats&quot;, persuaded them in January 1793 to flee their Benedictine college at Douai. They crossed the English Channel with the brothers John and Henry Sheares who displayed a handkerchief soaked, they claimed, in the blood of Louis XVI, the late executed king. The experience is said to have left O&#x27;Connell with a lifelong aversion to mob rule and violence.

===1798 and legal practice===
After further legal studies in London, including a pupillage at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, O&#x27;Connell returned to Ireland in 1795. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793, while maintaining the Oath of Supremacy that excluded Catholics from parliament, the judiciary and the higher offices of state, had granted them the vote on the same limited terms as Protestants and removed most of the remaining barriers to their professional advancement. O&#x27;Connell, nonetheless, remained of the opinion that in Ireland the whole policy of the Irish Parliament and the London-appointed Dublin Castle executive, was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority.

On 19 May 1798, O&#x27;Connell was called to the Irish Bar. Four days later, the United Irishmen staged their ill-fated rebellion. Toward the end of his life, O&#x27;Connell claimed, belatedly, to have been a United Irishman. Asked how that could be reconciled with his membership of the government&#x27;s volunteer Yeomanry (the Lawyers Artillery Corps), he replied that in &#x27;98 &quot;the popular party was so completely crushed that the only chance of doing any good for the people was by affecting ultra loyalty.&quot; Whatever the case, O&#x27;Connell had little faith in the United Irish conspiracy or in their hopes of French intervention. He sat out the rebellion in his native Kerry. When in 1803, Robert Emmet faced execution for attempting to renew the insurrection against what was now a United Kingdom crown and parliament, of a O&#x27;Connell was scathing: as the cause of so much bloodshed Emmett had forfeited any claim to &quot;compassion&quot;.

In the decades that followed, O&#x27;Connell practised private law and, although invariably in debt, reputedly had the largest income of any Irish barrister. In court, he sought to prevail by refusing deference, showing no compunction in studying and exploiting a judge&#x27;s personal and intellectual weaknesses. He was long ranked below less accomplished Queen&#x27;s Counsels, a status not open to Catholics until late in his career. But when offered he refused the senior judicial position of Master of the Rolls.

===Family===
In 1802, O&#x27;Connell married his third cousin, Mary O&#x27;Connell. He did so in defiance of his benefactor, his uncle Maurice, who believed his nephew should have sought out an heiress. They had four daughters (three surviving), Ellen (1805–1883), Catherine (1808–1891), Elizabeth (1810–1883), and Rickarda (1815–1817) and four sons, Maurice (1803–1853), Morgan (1804–1885), John (1810–1858), and Daniel (1816–1897). In time, each of the boys was to join their father as Members of Parliament. Despite O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s early infidelities, the marriage was happy and Mary&#x27;s death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband is said never to have recovered.

== Political beliefs==
===Church and state===
O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s personal principles reflected the influences of the Enlightenment and of radical and democratic thinkers some of whom he had encountered in London and in masonic lodges. He was greatly influenced by William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; (public opinion the root of all power, civil liberty and equality the bedrock of social stability), and was, for a period, converted to Deism by his reading of Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;.

By 1809, he had returned to the Church, &quot;becoming thereafter more devout by the year&quot;. Yet in 1820s, he was still regarded by some as an &quot;English rationalist utilitarian&quot;, a &quot;Benthamite&quot;. For a time Jeremy Bentham and O&#x27;Connell did become personal friends as well as political allies.

At Westminster O&#x27;Connell played a major part in the passage of the Reform Act 1832 and in the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (an international cause in which he continued to campaign). He spoke in defence of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, censured flogging in the army and opposed the death penalty for all but murder. He welcomed the revolutions of 1830 in Belgium and France, and advocated &quot;a complete severance of the Church from the State&quot;. Such liberalism (as &quot;thorough&quot;, William Ewart Gladstone suggested, as that of an English liberal with &quot;no Ireland to think of&quot;) made all the more intolerable to O&#x27;Connell the charge that as &quot;Papists&quot; he and his co-religionists could not be trusted with the defence of constitutional liberties.

O&#x27;Connell protested that, while &quot;sincerely Catholic&quot;, he did not &quot;receive&quot; his politics &quot;from Rome&quot;. At the same time, he insisted on the political independence of the Church. In 1808 &quot;friends of emancipation&quot;, Henry Grattan among them, proposed that fears of Popery might be allayed if the Crown were accorded the same right exercised by continental monarchs, a veto on the confirmation of Catholic bishops. Even when, in 1814, the Curia itself (then in a silent alliance with Britain against Napoleon) proposed that bishops be &quot;personally acceptable to the king&quot;, O&#x27;Connell was unyielding in his opposition. Refusing any instruction from Rome as to &quot;the manner of their emancipation&quot;, O&#x27;Connell declared that Irish Catholics should be content to &quot;remain forever without emancipation&quot; rather than allow the king and his ministers &quot;to interfere&quot; with the Pope&#x27;s appointment of their senior clergy.

===Church and nation===
In his travels in Ireland in 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville remarked on the &quot;unbelievable unity between the Irish clergy and the Catholic population&quot;. The people looked to the clergy, and the clergy &quot;rebuffed&quot; by the &quot;upper classes&quot; (&quot;Protestants and enemies&quot;), had &quot;turned all its attention to the lower classes; it has the same instincts, the same interests and the same passions as the people; [a] state of affairs altogether peculiar to Ireland&quot;. Such was the unity, O&#x27;Connell argued, the bishops would have sacrificed had they agreed to Rome submitting their appointments for Crown approval. Licensed by the government they and their priests would have been as little regarded as the Anglican clergy of the Established Church.

In most districts of the country, the priest was the sole figure, standing independent of the Protestant landlords and magistrates, around whom a national movement could be reliably built. But for O&#x27;Connell a weakening of the bond between priests and their people would have represented more than a strategic loss. In &quot;the heat of combat&quot;, he would let slip his repeated emphasis on the inclusiveness of the Irish nation to suggest Catholicism itself as the nation&#x27;s defining loyalty. He declared not only that the Catholic Church in Ireland &quot;is a national Church&quot;, but &quot;if the people rally to me they will have a nation for that Church&quot;, and indeed that Catholics in Ireland are &quot;the people, emphatically the people&quot; and &quot;a nation&quot;. For O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Pilot&quot;, &quot;the distinction created by religion&quot; was the one &quot;positive and unmistakable&quot; mark of separating the Irish from the English.

In 1837, O&#x27;Connell clashed with William Smith O&#x27;Brien over the Limerick MP&#x27;s support for granting state payments to Catholic clergy. The Catholic Bishops came out in support of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s stance, resolving &quot;most energetically to oppose any such arrangement, and that they look upon those that labour to effect it as the worst enemies of the Catholic religion&quot;.

===Disavowal of violence===
Consistent with the position he had taken publicly in relation to the rebellions of 1798 and 1803, O&#x27;Connell focused on parliamentary representation and popular, but peaceful, demonstration to induce change. &quot;No political change&quot;, he offered, &quot;is worth the shedding of a single drop of human blood&quot;. His critics, however, were to see in his ability to mobilise the Irish masses an intimation of violence. It was a standing theme with O&#x27;Connell that if the British establishment did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the &quot;counsels of violent men&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell insisted on his loyalty, greeting George IV effusively on his visit to Ireland in 1821. In contrast to his later successor Charles Stewart Parnell (although like O&#x27;Connell, himself a landlord), O&#x27;Connell was also consistent in his defence of property. Yet he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes and of agrarian outrages. In his last notable court appearance, the Doneraile conspiracy trials of 1829, O&#x27;Connell saved several tenant Whiteboys from the gallows.

===Abandonment of the Irish language===
Irish was O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s mother tongue and that of the vast majority of the rural population. Yet he insisted on addressing his (typically open-air) meetings in English, sending interpreters out among the crowd to translate his words. At a time when &quot;as a cultural or political concept &#x27;Gaelic Ireland&#x27; found few advocates&quot;, O&#x27;Connell declared: I am sufficiently utilitarian not to regret [the] gradual abandonment [of Irish]... Although the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s &quot;indifference to the fate of the language&quot;, a decade before the Famine, was consistent with the policies of the Catholic Church (which under Paul Cardinal Cullen was to develop a mission to the English-speaking world) and of the government-funded National Schools. Together, these were to combine in the course of the century to accelerate the near-complete conversion to English.

There is no evidence to suggest that O&#x27;Connell saw &quot;the preservation or revival or any other aspect of &#x27;native culture&#x27; (in the widest sense of the term) as essential to his political demands&quot;. On the other hand, it may have been that &quot;O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s anchorage in Gaelic society was so firm and obvious . . . that there was simply no need for him to take up issues of cultural nationalism&quot;. As an &quot;Irish chieftain&quot;, he attracted an &quot;uniquely large amount&quot; of attention in ballads and the Gaelic oral tradition generally. 

==Emancipation and the agrarian crisis==
===The &quot;Liberator&quot;===

To broaden and intensify the campaign for emancipation, in 1823, O&#x27;Connell established the Catholic Association. For a &quot;Catholic rent&quot; of a penny a month (typically paid through the local priest), this, for the first time, drew the labouring poor into a national movement. Their investment enabled O&#x27;Connell (derided by his enemies as the &quot;King of Beggars&quot;) to mount &quot;monster&quot; rallies (crowds of over 100,000) that stayed in the hands of authorities and emboldened larger enfranchised tenants to vote for pro-Emancipation candidates in defiance of their landlords.

The government moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions but with limited success. Already in 1822 O&#x27;Connell had manoeuvred his principal foe, the Attorney General, William Saurin, into actions sufficiently intemperate to ensure his removal by the Lord Lieutenant. His confrontation with Dublin Corporation, equally unbending in its defence of the &quot;Protestant Constitution&quot;, took a more tragic turn.

Outraged at O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s refusal to retract his description of the corporation as &quot;beggarly&quot;, one of their number challenged O&#x27;Connell to a duel. John D&#x27;Esterre had thought O&#x27;Connell might back down, for he had earlier refused a challenge from an opposing lawyer. The former royal marine was in any case confident of his aim. Recognising that his reputation would never be safe if he again demurred, O&#x27;Connell accepted. The duel took place on 2 February 1815 at Bishopscourt, County Kildare. Both men fired. O&#x27;Connell, unharmed, mortally wounded D&#x27;Esterre. Distressed by the killing, O&#x27;Connell offered D&#x27;Esterre&#x27;s widow a pension. She consented to an allowance for her daughter and this O&#x27;Connell paid regularly for more than thirty years until his death.

Some months later, O&#x27;Connell was engaged to fight a second duel with the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Robert Peel, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s repeated references to him as &quot;Orange Peel&quot; (&quot;a man good for nothing except to be a champion for Orangeism&quot;) being the occasion. Only O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s arrest in London &quot;en route&quot; to their rendezvous in Ostend prevented the encounter, and the affair went no further. But in 1816, following his return to faithful Catholic observance, O&#x27;Connell made &quot;a vow in heaven&quot; never again to put himself in a position where he might shed blood. In &quot;expiation for the death D&#x27;Esterre&quot;, he is said thereafter to have accepted the insults of men whom he refused to fight &quot;with pride&quot;. (Thomas Moore privately proposed that &quot;removing, by his example, that restraint which the responsibility of one to another under the law of duelling imposed&quot;, was &quot;one of the worst things, perhaps, O&#x27;Connell had done for Ireland&quot;, and had given his penchant for personal abuse free rein).

In July 1828, O&#x27;Connell defeated a member of the British cabinet in a parliamentary by-election in County Clare. His triumph forced the issue of the Oath of Supremacythe requirement that MPs acknowledge the King as &quot;Supreme Governor&quot; of the Church and thus forswear the Roman communion. Peel and the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, recognised in O&#x27;Connell &quot;a vast demonstration of populist political organisation, and clerical power&quot; more challenging than a separatist conspiracy. Wellington proposed a new Oath of Allegiance unexceptional to Catholics, and forced the issue by threatening to resign. The Catholic Relief Act became law in April 1829. It was not made retroactive so O&#x27;Connell had to stand again for election. He was returned unopposed in July 1829.

Such was O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s prestige as &quot;the Liberator&quot; that George IV reportedly complained that while &quot;Wellington is the King of England&quot;, O&#x27;Connell was &quot;King of Ireland&quot;, and he, himself, merely &quot;the dean of Windsor&quot;. Some of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s younger lieutenants in the new struggle for Repealthe Young Irelanderswere critical of the leader&#x27;s acclaim. Michael Doheny noted that the 1829 act had only been the latest in a succession of &quot;relief&quot; measures dating back to the Papists Act 1778. Honour was due rather to those who had &quot;wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living, of worship, of enjoying property, and exercising the franchise&quot;.

===Tenant Disenfranchisement and the Tithe War===
Entry to parliament had not come without a price. With Jeremy Bentham, O&#x27;Connell had considered allowing George Ensor, a Protestant member of the Catholic Association, to stand as his running mate in the Clare election. But Ensor had objected to what he identified as the &quot;disenfranchisement project&quot; in the relief bill. Receiving its royal assent on the same day, the Parliamentary Elections (Ireland) Act 1829, brought the Irish franchise into line with England&#x27;s by raising the property threshold in county seats five-fold to ten pounds. This eliminated the middling tenantry (the Irish &quot;forty-shilling freeholders&quot;) who had risked much in defying their landlords on O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s behalf in the Clare election, and reduced the overall electorate in the country from 216,000 voters to just 37,000.

Rationalising the sacrifice of his freeholders, O&#x27;Connell wrote privately in March 1829 that the new ten-pound franchise might actually &quot;give more power to Catholics by concentrating it in more reliable and less democratically dangerous hands&quot;. The Young Irelander John Mitchel believed that this was the intent: to detach propertied Catholics from the increasingly agitated rural masses. Once in Parliament, however, O&#x27;Connell did speak in favour of parliamentary reform, invoking &quot;the great principle of democratic liberty&quot; in support of a broader franchise.

In a pattern that had been intensifying from the 1820s as landlords cleared land to meet the growing livestock demand from England, tenants had been banding together to oppose evictions, and to attack tithe and process servers. De Tocqueville recorded these Whiteboys and Ribbonmen protesting:The law does nothing for us. We must save ourselves. We have a little land which we need for ourselves and our families to live on, and they drive us out of it. To whom should we address ourselves?... Emancipation has done nothing for us. Mr. O&#x27;Connell and the rich Catholics go to Parliament. We die of starvation just the same. 

In 1830, discounting evidence that &quot;unfeeling men had given in favour of cultivating sheep and cattle instead of human beings&quot;, O&#x27;Connell sought repeal of the Sub-Letting Act which facilitated the clearings. In a &quot;Letter to the People of Ireland&quot; (1833) he also proposed a 20 per cent tax on absentee landlords for poor relief, and the abolition of tithes levied atop rents by the Anglican establishment&quot;the landlords&#x27; Church&quot;.

An initially peaceful campaign of non-payment of tithes turned violent in 1831 when the newly founded Irish Constabulary in lieu of payment began to seize property and conduct evictions. Although opposed not only to the use of force but to agrarian combinations in general, O&#x27;Connell defended those detained in the so-called Tithe War. For all eleven accused in the death of fourteen constables in the Carrickshock incident, O&#x27;Connell helped secure acquittals. Yet fearful of embarrassing his Whig allies (who had brutally suppressed tithe and poor law protests in England), in 1838 he rejected the call of the Protestant tenant-righter William Sharman Crawford for the complete elimination of the Church of Ireland levy. In its stead, O&#x27;Connell accepted the Tithe Commutation Act. This exempted the majority of cultivatorsthose who held land at will or from year to yearfrom the charge, while offering those still liable a 25 percent reduction and a forgiveness of arrears. It did not, as feared, lead to a general compensating increase in rents.

==Campaign for repeal of the Union==
===The meaning of Repeal===
O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s call for a repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, and for a restoration of the Kingdom of Ireland under the Constitution of 1782, which he linked (as he had with emancipation) to a multitude of popular grievances, may have been less a considered constitutional proposal than &quot;an invitation to treat&quot;.

The legislative independence won by Grattan&#x27;s Parliament in 1782 had left executive power in the hands of the London-appointed Dublin Castle administration. In declining to stand as a Repeal candidate, Thomas Moore (Ireland&#x27;s national bard) objected that with a Catholic Parliament in Dublin, &quot;which they would be sure to have out and out&quot;, this would be an arrangement impossible to sustain. Separation from Great Britain was its &quot;certain consequence&quot;, so that Repeal was a practical policy only if (in the spirit of the United Irishmen) Catholics were again &quot;joined by the dissenters&quot;the Presbyterians of the North.

But for O&#x27;Connell, the historian R.F. Foster suggests that &quot;the trick was never to define what the Repeal meantor did not mean&quot;. It was an &quot;emotional claim&quot;, an &quot;ideal&quot;, with which &quot;to force the British into offering &quot;something&quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Testing&quot; the Union===
O&#x27;Connell did prepare the ground for the Home Rule compromise, eventually negotiated between Irish-nationalists and British Liberals from the 1880s to 1914. He declared that while he would &quot;never ask for or work&quot; for anything less than an independent legislature, he would accept a &quot;subordinate parliament&quot; as &quot;an instalment&quot;. But for the predecessors to Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals, Lord Melbourne&#x27;s Whigs, with whom O&#x27;Connell sought accommodation in the 1830s, even an Irish legislature devolved &quot;within&quot; the United Kingdom was a step too far.

Having assisted Melbourne, through an informal understanding (the Lichfield House Compact), to a government majority, in 1835 O&#x27;Connell suggested he might be willing to give up the project of an Irish parliament altogether. He declared his willingness to &quot;test&quot; the Union: The people of Ireland are ready to become a portion of the empire, provided they be made so in reality and not in name alone; they are ready to become a kind of West Britons if made so in benefits and in justice, but if not, we are Irishmen again. Underscoring the qualifying clause&quot;if not we are Irishmen again&quot;historian J.C. Beckett proposes that the change was less than it may have appeared. Under the pressure of a choice between &quot;effectual union or no union&quot;, O&#x27;Connell was seeking to maximise the scope of shorter-term, interim, reforms.

O&#x27;Connell failed to stall the application to Ireland of the new English Poor Law system of Workhouses in 1837, the prospect of which, as de Tocqueville found, was broadly dreaded in Ireland.As an alternative to outdoor relief, the Workhouses made it easier for landlords to clear their estates in favour of larger English-export-oriented farms. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s objection was that the poor-law charge would ruin a great proportion of landowners, further reducing the wage fund and increasing the poverty of the country. That poverty was due not to exorbitant rents (which O&#x27;Connell compared to those in England without reference to Irish practice of sub-letting), but to lawsthe Penal Laws of the previous centurythat had prohibited the Catholic majority from acquiring education and property. The responsibility for its relief was therefore the government&#x27;s. To defray the cost O&#x27;Connell urged, in vain, a tax on &quot;absentee&quot; rents.

But as regards the general conduct of the Dublin Castle administration under the Whigs, Beckett concludes that &quot;O&#x27;Connell had reason to be satisfied, and &quot;the more so as his influence carried great weight in the making of appointments&quot;. Reforms opened the police and judiciary to greater Catholic recruitment, and measures were taken to reduce the provocations and influence of the pro-Ascendancy Orange Order.

In 1840 municipal government was reconstructed on the basis of a rate-payer franchise. In 1841, O&#x27;Connell became the first Roman Catholic Lord Mayor of Dublin since Terence MacDermott in the reign of James II. In breaking the Protestant monopoly of corporate rights, he was confident that town councils would become a &quot;school for teaching the science of peaceful political agitation&quot;. But the measure was less liberal than municipal reform in England, and left the majority of the population to continue under the landlord-controlled Grand Jury system of county government. In view of Thomas Francis Meagher, in return for damping down Repeal agitation, a &quot;corrupt gang of politicians who fawned on O&#x27;Connell&quot; were being allowed an extensive system of political patronage. The Irish people were being &quot;purchased back into factious vassalage.&quot;

===Northern opposition===

Conscious of their minority position in Ulster, Catholic support for O&#x27;Connell in the north was &quot;muted&quot;. William Crolly, Bishop of Down and Connor and later Archbishop of Armagh, was ambivalent, anxious lest clerical support for Repeal disrupt his &quot;carefully nurtured relationship with Belfast&#x27;s liberal Presbyterians&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell &quot;treasured his few Protestant Repealers&quot;. But to many of his contemporaries, he appeared &quot;ignorant&quot; of the Protestant (largely Presbyterian) majority society of the north-east, Ulster, counties. Here there was already premonition of future Partition. While protesting that its readers wished only to preserve the Union, in 1843 Belfast&#x27;s leading paper, the &quot;Northern Whig&quot;, proposed that if differences in &quot;race&quot; and &quot;interests&quot; argue for Ireland&#x27;s separation from Great Britain then &quot;the Northern &#x27;aliens&#x27;, holders of &#x27;foreign heresies&#x27; (as O&#x27;Connell says they are)&quot; should have their own &quot;distinct kingdom&quot;, Belfast as its capital.

O&#x27;Connell seemed implicitly to concede the separateness of the Protestant North. He spoke &quot;invading&quot; Ulster to rescue &quot;our Persecuted Brethren in the North&quot;. In the event, and in the face of the hostile crowds that disrupted his one foray to Belfast in 1841 (&quot;the Repealer repulsed!&quot;), he &quot;tended to leave Ulster strictly alone&quot;. The northern Dissenters were not redeemed, in his view, by their record as United Irishmen. &quot;The Presbyterians&quot;, he remarked, &quot;fought badly at Ballynahinch ... and as soon as the fellows were checked they became furious Orangemen&quot;.

Perhaps persuaded by their presence through much of the south as but a thin layer of officials, landowners and their agents, O&#x27;Connell proposed that Protestants did not have the staying power of true &quot;religionists&quot;. Their ecclesiastical dissent (and not alone their unionism) was a function, he argued, of political privilege. To Dr Paul Cullen (the future Cardinal and Catholic Primate of Ireland) in Rome, O&#x27;Connell wrote:The Protestants of Ireland... are political Protestants, that is, Protestants by reason of their participation in political power... If the Union were repealed and the exclusive system abolished, the great mass of the Protestant community would with little delay melt into the overwhelming majority of the Irish nation. Protestantism would not survive the Repeal ten years.

=== Exchange with Disraeli ===
In April 1835, O&#x27;Connell sparred with Benjamin Disraeli who, while campaigning as an English by-election, had reportedly branded the Irish leader &quot;an incendiary and a traitor&quot;. According to the extensive coverage of his response in &quot;The Times,&quot; having drawn attention to Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Jewish origin&quot;, in speech in Dublin O&#x27;Connell suggested that the young Peelite had, not only the &quot;perfidy, selfishness, depravity, and want of principle&quot; typical of a would-be Tory MP, but also the qualities of &quot;the impenitent thief on the cross . . . the blasphemous robber&quot;.

Notwithstanding that O&#x27;Connell had publicly criticised Pope Gregory XVI&#x27;s treatment of Jews in the Papal States and bragged of Ireland being the &quot;only Christian country ... unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews&quot;, his comments elicited charges of anti-Jewish slander.

Disraeli demanded &quot;satisfaction&quot;. As it was known that O&#x27;Connell had forsworn duelling following the death of D&#x27;Esterre, the challenge went to his duelling son, and fellow MP, Morgan O&#x27;Connell. Morgan, however, declined responsibility for his father&#x27;s controversial remarks.

The future Conservative Prime Minister did not prevail in his by-election against the incumbent Whig, but the dispute (which Disraeli recounted throughout his career) propelled him for the first time to general public notice.

===Conflict with the Chartists and trade unions===
In 1842, all eighteen of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s parliamentary &quot;tail&quot; at Westminster voted in favour of the Chartist petition which, along with its radical democratic demands, included Repeal. Their leader had declared himself &quot;a decided advocate of universal suffrage&quot; because no one could properly fix &quot;where the line should be drawn&quot; between servitude and liberty. But the Chartists in England, and in their much smaller number in Ireland, were also to accuse O&#x27;Connell of being unreliable and opportunistic in his drive to secure Whig favour.

When in 1831 workers in the Dublin trades created their own political association, O&#x27;Connell moved to pack it. The Trades Political Union (TPU) was swamped by 5,000 mostly middle-class repealers who by acclaim carried O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s resolution calling for the suppression of all secret and illegal combinations, particularly those &quot;manifested among the labouring classes&quot;. When in 1841 the Chartists held the first meeting of the Irish Universal Suffrage Association (IUSA), a TPU mob broke it up, and O&#x27;Connell denounced the association&#x27;s secretary, Peter Brophy as an Orangeman. From England, where the Irish-born leader of Chartism Fergus O&#x27;Connor had joined the IUSA in solidarity, Brophy denounced O&#x27;Connell in turn as the &quot;enemy of the unrepresented classes&quot;.

Ostensibly, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s objection to labour and Chartist agitation was the resort to intimidation and violence. But his flexibility with regard to principle alienated not only working-class militants but also middle-class reformers. There was also consternation when, in 1836 O&#x27;Connell voted for an amending bill that would have 12-year-olds from the protection of shorter hours under the Factories Regulation Act. While it is clear that O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s only purpose was to delay the return of a Tory ministry (in 1832 and 1833 he had intervened four times to raise the age, and was to do so again in 1839), his reputation suffered.

Karl Marx was of the view that O&#x27;Connell &quot;always incited the Irish against the Chartists&quot;, and did so &quot;because they too had inscribed Repeal on their banner&quot;. To O&#x27;Connell, he ascribed the fear that, drawing together national and democratic demands, the Chartist influence might induce his following to break &quot;the established habit of electing place-hunting lawyers&quot; and of seeking &quot;to impress English Liberals&quot;.

===The renewal of the campaign===
In April 1840, when it became clear that the Whigs would lose office, O&#x27;Connell relaunched the Repeal Association, and published a series of addresses criticising government policy and attacking the Union.

The &quot;people&quot;, the great numbers of tenant farmers, small-town traders and journeymen, whom O&#x27;Connell had rallied to the cause of Emancipation, did not similarly respond to his lead on the more abstract proposition of Repeal; neither did the Catholic gentry or middle classes. Many appeared content to explore the avenues for advancement emancipation had opened. The suspicion, in any case, was that O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s purpose in returning to the constitutional question was merely to disconcert the incoming Conservatives (under his old enemy Sir Robert Peel) and to hasten the Whigs return (entirely the view of Friedrich Engels: the only purpose of Repeal for the &quot;old fox&quot; was &quot;embarrass the Tory Ministers&quot; and to put his friends back into office).

Meanwhile, as a body, Protestants remained opposed to a restoration of a parliament the prerogatives of which they had once championed. The Presbyterians in the north were persuaded that the Union was both the occasion for their relative prosperity and a guarantee of their liberty.

In the June–July 1841 Westminster elections, Repeal candidates lost half their seats. In a contest marked by the boycott of Guinness as &quot;Protestant porter&quot;, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s son John, a brewer of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Ale, failed to hold his father&#x27;s Dublin seat.

 &quot;Population of Ireland, 1841 Census: 8.18 million.&quot;

Against a background of growing economic distress, O&#x27;Connell was nonetheless buoyed by Archbishop John McHale&#x27;s endorsement of legislative independence. Opinion among all classes was also influenced from October 1842 by Gavan Duffy&#x27;s new weekly &quot;The Nation&quot;. Read in Repeal Reading Rooms and passed from hand to hand, its mix of vigorous editorials, historical articles and verse, may have reached as many as a quarter of a million readers.

Breaking out of the very narrow basis for electoral politics (the vote was not restored to the forty-shilling freeholder until 1885), O&#x27;Connell initiated a new series of &quot;monster meetings&quot;. These were damaging to the prestige of the government, not only at home but abroad. O&#x27;Connell was becoming a figure of international renown, with large and sympathetic audiences in the United States, France and Germany. The Conservative government of Robert Peel considered repression, but hesitated, unwilling to tackle the Anti-Corn Law League which was copying O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s methods in England. Assuring his supporters that Britain must soon surrender, O&#x27;Connell declared 1843 &quot;the repeal year&quot;.

===Tara and Clontarf 1843===
At the Hill of Tara (by tradition the inaugural seat of the High Kings of Ireland), on the feast-day of the Assumption, 15 August 1843, O&#x27;Connell gathered a crowd estimated in the hostile reporting of The Times as close to one million. It took O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s carriage two hours to proceed through the throng, accompanied by a harpist playing Thomas Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Harp that once through Tara&#x27;s Halls&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell planned to close the campaign on 8 October 1843 with an even larger demonstration at Clontarf, on the outskirts of Dublin. As the site of Brian Boru&#x27;s famous victory over the Danes in 1014, it resonated with O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s increasingly militant rhetoric: &quot;the time is coming&quot;, he had been telling his supporters, when &quot;you may have the alternative to live as slaves or to die as freemen&quot;. Beckett suggests &quot;O&#x27;Connell mistook the temper of the government&quot;, never expecting that &quot;his defiance would be put to the test&quot;. When it waswhen troops occupied ClontarfO&#x27;Connell submitted at once. He cancelled the rally and sent out messengers to turn back the approaching crowds.

O&#x27;Connell was applauded by the Church, his more moderate supporters and English sympathisers. But many of the movement rank and file who had been fired by his defiant rhetoric were disillusioned. His loss of prestige might have been greater had the government not overplayed their own hand. They sentenced O&#x27;Connell and his son John to twelve months for conspiracy, and O&#x27;Connell was imprisoned at the Richmond Bridewell.

When released after three months, the charges quashed on appeal to the House of Lords, O&#x27;Connell was paraded in triumph through Dublin on a gilded chariot. But, approaching seventy years of age, O&#x27;Connell never fully recovered his former stature or confidence. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, and with his health failing, O&#x27;Connell had no plan and ranks of the Repeal Association began to divide.

==Break with Young Ireland==
===The Queen&#x27;s Colleges controversy===
In 1845, Dublin Castle proposed to educate Catholics and Protestants together in a non-denominational system of higher education. In advance of some of the Catholic bishops (Archbishop Daniel Murray of Dublin favoured the proposal), O&#x27;Connell condemned the &quot;godless colleges&quot;. (Led by Archbishop McHale, the bishops issued a formal condemnation of the proposed colleges as dangerous to faith and morals in 1850). The principle at stake, of what in Ireland was understood as &quot;mixed education&quot;, may already have been lost. When in 1830 the government proposed to educate Catholics and Protestants together at the primary level, it had been the Presbyterians (led by O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s northern nemesis, the evangelist Henry Cooke) who had scented danger. They refused to cooperate in National Schools unless they had the majority to ensure there would be no &quot;mutilating of scripture.&quot; But the vehemence of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s opposition to the colleges, was a cause of dismay among those O&#x27;Connell had begun to call Young Irelandersa reference to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s anti-clerical and insurrectionist Young Italy.

When the &quot;Nation&quot;&#x27;s publisher (and promoter of Irish in print) Thomas Davis, a Protestant, objected that &quot;reasons for separate education are reasons for [a] separate life&quot;. O&#x27;Connell declared himself content to take a stand &quot;for Old Ireland&quot;, and accused Davis of suggesting it was a &quot;crime to be a Catholic&quot;.

===Whigs and the Famine===
Grouped around &quot;The Nation&quot;, which had proposed as its &quot;first great object&quot; a &quot;nationality&quot; that would embrace as easily &quot;the stranger who is within our gates&quot; as &quot;the Irishman of a hundred generations,&quot; the dissidents suspected that in opposing the Colleges Bill O&#x27;Connell was also playing Westminster politics. O&#x27;Connell opposed the colleges bill to inflict a defeat on the Peel ministry and to hasten the Whigs&#x27; return to office.

The Young Irelanders&#x27; dismay only increased when at the end of June 1846 O&#x27;Connell appeared to succeed in this design. The new ministry of Lord John Russell deployed the Whigs&#x27; new laissez-faire (&quot;political economy&quot;) doctrines to dismantle the previous government&#x27;s limited efforts to address the distress of the emerging, and catastrophic, Irish Famine.

In February 1847 O&#x27;Connell stood for the last time before the House of Commons in London and pleaded for his country: &quot;She is in your handsin your power. If you do not save her, she cannot save herself. One-fourth of her population will perish unless Parliament comes to their relief&quot;. As &quot;temporary relief for destitute persons&quot;, the government opened soup kitchens. They were closed a few months later in August of the same year. The starving were directed to abandon the land and apply to the workhouses.

===Peace Resolutions===
After Thomas Davis&#x27;s death in 1845, Gavan Duffy offered the post of assistant editor on &quot;The Nation&quot; to John Mitchel. Mitchel brought a more militant tone. When the conservative &quot;Standard&quot; observed that the new Irish railways could be used to transport troops to quickly curb agrarian unrest, Mitchel replied combatively that railway tracks could be turned into pikes and that trains could be easily ambushed. O&#x27;Connell publicly distanced himself from &quot;The Nation&quot; setting Duffy up as editor for the prosecution that followed. When the courts absolved him, O&#x27;Connell pressed the issue.

In 1847 the Repeal Association tabled resolutions declaring that under no circumstances was a nation justified in asserting its liberties by force of arms. The Young Irelanders had not advocated physical force, but in response to the &quot;Peace Resolutions&quot; Meagher argued that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be a no less honourable course. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s son John forced the decision: the resolution was carried on the threat of the O&#x27;Connells themselves quitting the Association.

Meagher, Davis and other prominent dissidents, among them Gavan Duffy; Jane Wilde; Margaret Callan; William Smith O&#x27;Brien; and John Blake Dillon, withdrew and formed themselves as the Irish Confederation.

In the desperate circumstances of the Famine and in the face of martial-law measures that a number of Repeal Association MPs had approved in Westminster, Meagher and some Confederates did take what he had described as the &quot;honourable&quot; course. Their rural rising broke up after a single skirmish, the Battle of Ballingarry.

Some of the &quot;Men of 1848&quot; carried the commitment to physical force forward into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)Fenianism. Others followed Gavan Duffy in focussing on what they believed was a basis for a non-sectarian national movement, the struggle for tenant right.

In what Duffy hailed as a &quot;League of North and South&quot; in 1852 tenant protection societies helped return 50 MPs. The seeming triumph over &quot;O&#x27;Connellism&quot;, however, was short-lived. In the South Archbishop Cullen approved the Catholic MPs breaking their pledge of independent opposition and accepting government positions. In the North William Sharman Crawford and other League candidates had their meetings broken up by Orange &quot;bludgeon men&quot;.

==Opposition to slavery in the United States==
O&#x27;Connell championed the &quot;civil and religious liberties&quot; of people throughout the world including those of peasants in India, (subject, under the East India Company, to “a system of monstrous and perfect oppression”) Maoris in New Zealand, Aborigines in Australia and Jews in Europe. It was, however, his unbending abolitionism, and in particular, his opposition to slavery in the United States, that demonstrated commitments that transcended Catholic and national interests in Ireland.

For his Repeal campaign, O&#x27;Connell relied heavily on money from the United States, but he insisted that none should be accepted from those engaged in slavery (a ban extended from 1843 to all those emigrants to the American South who in daring to &quot;countenance the system of slavery&quot; he could &quot;recognise as Irish no longer&quot;). In 1829 he had told a large abolitionist meeting in London that &quot;of all men living, an American citizen, who is the owner of slaves, is the most despicable&quot;. In the same Emancipation year, addressing the Cork Anti-Slavery Society, he declared that, much as he longed to go to America, so long as it was &quot;tarnished by slavery&quot;, he would never &quot;pollute&quot; his foot &quot;by treading on its shores&quot;.

In 1838, in a call for a new crusade against &quot;the vile union&quot; in the United States &quot;of republicanism and slavery&quot;, O&#x27;Connell denounced the hypocrisy of George Washington and characterised the American ambassador, the Virginian Andrew Stevenson, as a &quot;slave-breeder&quot;. When Stevenson vainly challenged O&#x27;Connell to a duel, a sensation was created in the United States. On the floor of the House of Representatives the former U.S. president, John Quincy Adams spoke of a &quot;conspiracy against the life of Daniel O&#x27;Connell&quot;.

In both Ireland and America, the furore exasperated supporters. Young Irelanders took issue. Gavan Duffy believed the time was not right &quot;for gratuitous interference in American affairs&quot;. This was a common view. Attacks on slavery in the United States were considered &quot;wanton and intolerable provocation&quot;. In 1845 John Blake Dillon reported to Thomas Davis &quot;everybody was indignant at O&#x27;Connell meddling in the business&quot;: &quot;Such talk&quot; was &quot;supremely disgusting to the Americans, and to every man of honour and spirit&quot;. Mitchel took this dissent a step further: to Duffy&#x27;s disgust, Mitchel positively applauded black slavery. In the United States, fearful that it would further inflame anti-Irish nativist sentiment, Bishop John Hughes of New York urged Irish Americans not to sign O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s abolitionist petition (&quot;An Address of the People of Ireland to their Countrymen and Countrywomen in America&quot;).

O&#x27;Connell was entirely undaunted: crowds gathered to hear him on Repeal were regularly treated to excursions on the evils of human traffic and bondage. When in 1845, Frederick Douglass, touring Britain and Ireland following the publication of his &quot;Life of an American Slave&quot;, attended unannounced a meeting in Conciliation Hall, Dublin, he heard O&#x27;Connell explain to a roused audience:
I have been assailed for attacking the American institution, as it is called,Negro slavery. I am not ashamed of that attack. I do not shrink from it. I am the advocate of civil and religious liberty, all over the globe, and wherever tyranny exists, I am the foe of the tyrant; wherever oppression shows itself, I am the foe of the oppressor; wherever slavery rears its head, I am the enemy of the system, or the institution, call it by what name you will.

I am the friend of liberty in every clime, class and colour. My sympathy with distress is not confined within the narrow bounds of my own green island. Noit extends itself to every corner of the earth. My heart walks abroad, and wherever the miserable are to be succored, or the slave to be set free, there my spirit is at home, and I delight to dwell.

The black abolitionist, Charles Lenox Remond said that it was only on hearing O&#x27;Connell speak in London (the first international Anti-Slavery Convention, 1840) that he realised what being an abolitionist really meant: &quot;every fibre of my heart contracted [when I] listened to the scorching rebukes of the fearless O&#x27;Connell&quot;. In the United States William Lloyd Garrison published a selection of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s anti-slavery speeches, no man having &quot;spoken so strongly against the soul-drivers of this land as O&#x27;Connell&quot;. In the 1846, Margaret Fuller compared O&#x27;Connell in &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; to the biblical Daniel, able &quot;to brave the fiery furnace, and the lion&#x27;s den, and the silken lures of a court, and speak always with a poet&#x27;s power.&quot;

It was as an abolitionist that O&#x27;Connell was honoured by his favourite author, Charles Dickens. In &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, O&#x27;Connell is the &quot;certain Public Man&quot;, revealed as an abolitionist, whom otherwise enthusiastic friends of Ireland (the &quot;Sons of Freedom&quot;) in the United States decide they would have &quot;pistolled, stabbedin some way slain&quot;.

==Death, legacy and commemoration==
Following his last appearance in parliament, and describing himself &quot;oppressed with grief&quot;, his &quot;physical power departed&quot;, O&#x27;Connell travelled on a pilgrimage to Rome. He died, age 71, in May 1847 in Genoa, Italy of a softening of the brain (Encephalomalacia). In accord with his last wishes, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s heart was buried in Rome (at Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti, then the chapel of the Irish College), and the remainder of his body in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. His sons are buried in his crypt.

===Lack of a successor===
In leading the charge against the Young Irelanders within the Repeal Association, John O&#x27;Connell had vied for the succession. But Gavan Duffy records that the Liberator&#x27;s death left no one with &quot;acknowledged weight of character, or solidity of judgement&quot; to lead the diminished movement out beyond the Famine. Such, he suggests, was the &quot;inevitable penalty of the statesman or leader who prefers courtiers and lackeys to counsellors and peers&quot;.

John O&#x27;Connell opposed Duffy&#x27;s Tenant Right League, and eventually accepted, in 1853, a sinecure position as &quot;Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper&quot; at Dublin Castle.

===Reputation as a landlord===
An article appearing in &quot;The Times&quot; on Christmas Day, 1845 created an international scandal by accusing O&#x27;Connell of being one of the worst landlords in Ireland. His tenants were pictured as &quot;living in abject poverty and neglect&quot;. The Irish press, however, was quick to observe that this was a description of famine conditions and to dismiss the report as a politically motivated attack.

To manage his property O&#x27;Connell employed a kinsman, John Primrose, who had a reputation as a strict agent. But when cholera struck the Kerry coast in 1832, he instructed Primrose to &quot;be prodigal of relief out of my means--beef, bread, mutton, medicines, physician, everything you can think of&quot;. When the Great Famine hit in 1846, he wished his son Maurice &quot;to be as abundant to the people as you can&quot;, and was so intent on securing relief that he sought to buy the government food depot in Cahersiveen, an offer refused from the Treasury by Charles Edward Trevelyan.

===Eulogies and interpretation===

Calling O&#x27;Connell an &quot;incarnation of a people&quot;, Honoré de Balzac noted that for twenty years his name had filled the press of Europe as no man since Napoleon. Gladstone, an eventual convert to Irish Home Rule, described him as &quot;the greatest popular leader the world has ever seen&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell had his imitators. In the German states (where he counted Goethe and Ludwig I of Bavaria among his admirers), O&#x27;Connell became a &quot;folk hero&quot; among Catholics (his portrait hanging in many homes and taverns), particularly in the Rhineland where the Catholic majority grated upon their union with Lutheran Prussia. Beginning in 1848, his Catholic Association served as a model for the mass-membership &quot;Katholischer Verein Deutschland&quot;.

In France, Flora Tristan, mocked as &quot;O&#x27;Connell in petticoats&quot;, imitated the Liberator&#x27;s rhetorical flourishes and his policy of nominal subscriptions in support of a very different emancipatory project, her Chartist-inspired vision of a single &quot;Workers&#x27; Union&quot;.

Frederick Douglass said of O&#x27;Connell that his voice was &quot;enough to calm the most violent passion, even though it were already manifesting itself in a mob. There is a sweet persuasiveness in it, beyond any voice I ever heard. His power over an audience is perfect&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s oratory is a quality to which James Joyce (a distant relative) plays tribute in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: &quot;a people&quot;, he wrote, &quot;sheltered within his voice.&quot; Other Irish literary figures of the independence generation were critical. For W.B Yeats found O&#x27;Connell &quot;too compromised and compromising&quot; and his rhetoric &quot;bragging&quot;. Seán Ó Faoláin sympathised with the Young Irelanders but allowed that if the nation O&#x27;Connell helped call forth and &quot;define&quot; was Catholic and without the Protestant north it was because O&#x27;Connell was &quot;the greatest of all Irish realists&quot;.

In 1922, following the creation of the Irish Free State, O&#x27;Connell was honoured in the renaming of Dublin&#x27;s principal thoroughfare. Yet the chairman of the new government (until his assassination later in the year), Michael Collins, was damning in his assessment. O&#x27;Connell had been &quot;a follower and not a leader of the people&quot;. Urged on by &quot;the zeal of the people, stirred for the moment to national consciousness by the teaching of Davis, he talked of national liberty, but he did nothing to win it&quot;. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s aim had never risen above establishing the Irish people as &quot;a free Catholic community&quot;. Those who declared their continued fealty to the Republic that had been proclaimed in 1916 on what was now O&#x27;Connell Street, dismissed his legacy in similar terms.

The predominant interpretation of O&#x27;Connell in the last generation may be that of a liberal Catholic, as portrayed in Oliver MacDonagh&#x27;s 1988 biography. This builds on the view of the historian Michael Tierney who proposes O&#x27;Connell as a &quot;forerunner&quot; of a European Christian Democracy. His more recent biographer Patrick Geoghegan seeks to return O&#x27;Connell to the national story. Echoing a reassessment that was offered by Eamon De Valera, he has O&#x27;Connell forging &quot;a new Irish nation in the fires of his own idealism, intolerance and determination&quot; and becoming for a people &quot;broken, humiliated and defeated&quot; its &quot;chieftain&quot;.

===Memorials===

In 1855, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s plot at Glasnevin Cemetery was marked with a 55m-high Irish Round Tower. Shut in 1971 when damaged by a loyalist bomb (retaliation for the IRA&#x27;s destruction of Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in O&#x27;Connell Street), the tower was re-opened in 2018.

Sackville Street renamed O&#x27;Connell Street in 1922. His statue (the work of John Henry Foley erected in 1882) stands at one end of the boulevard, the figure of Charles Stewart Parnell at the other.

O&#x27;Connell Streets also exist in Athlone, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkee, Limerick, Sligo, and Waterford. A Daniel O&#x27;Connell Bridge, opened in 1880, spans the Manuherikia River at Ophir in New Zealand.

A set of Irish postage stamps depicting O&#x27;Connell were issued in 1929 to commemorate the centenary of Catholic emancipation.

There is a statue of O&#x27;Connell outside St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne, Australia. Derrynane House, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s home in Kerry, has been converted into a museum honouring the Liberator.

<text>Maurice Ernest Gibb (; 22 December 1949 – 12 January 2003) was a British musician and songwriter. He achieved worldwide fame as a member of the Bee Gees pop group. Although his elder brother Barry Gibb and twin brother Robin Gibb were the group&#x27;s main lead singers, most of their albums included at least one or two songs featuring Maurice&#x27;s lead vocals, including &quot;Lay It on Me&quot;, &quot;Country Woman&quot; and &quot;On Time&quot;. The Bee Gees are one of the most successful pop-rock groups of all time.

Gibb started his music career in 1955 in Manchester, England at the age of five joining the skiffle-rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes, which later evolved into the Bee Gees in 1958 after spending three years in Manchester when they moved to Australia. They returned to England, where they achieved worldwide fame. In 2002, the Bee Gees were appointed as CBEs for their &quot;contribution to music&quot;. Following Gibb&#x27;s unexpected death in 2003, his son collected his award at Buckingham Palace in 2004.

Maurice Gibb&#x27;s earliest musical influences included the Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard, and Paul Anka; the Mills Brothers and the Beatles were significant later influences. During the Bee Gees&#x27; temporary break-up in 1969–1970, Maurice released his first solo single, &quot;Railroad&quot;, but his first solo album, &quot;The Loner&quot;, has never been released.

== 1949–1958: early years and the Rattlesnakes ==
Maurice Ernest Gibb was born in Douglas, Isle of Man, on 22 December 1949, the son of Hugh Gibb, a drummer, and his wife Barbara (&quot;née&quot; Pass). He was the fraternal twin of Robin Gibb, and was the younger of the two by 35 minutes. At that time, he had one sister, Lesley, and one additional brother, Barry (another brother, Andy, would be born in 1958).

In January 1955, the Gibb family moved back to their hometown in Manchester, England. Around that time, Gibb and his brothers were heard harmonising by their parents. Also in 1955, he started his music career when he joined the skiffle/rock-and-roll group the Rattlesnakes with his brothers and two friends, Paul Frost and Kenny Horrocks, who were their neighbours. The group&#x27;s first major appearance was on 28 December 1957 when they performed at a local Gaumont cinema where children were invited to sing between films. They had planned to sing along to a 78 rpm record which Lesley had just been given as a Christmas present, but on the way Gibb dropped and broke it, so they sang live. The audience were pleased by their singing, which may have been the song &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; by the Everly Brothers.

== 1958–2003: Bee Gees ==
=== 1958–1969: a trio to a quintet, Robin&#x27;s absence and temporary breakup ===
When Gibb was eight years old, he emigrated to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, with his family. Shortly afterward, he and his brothers formed the Bee Gees. By January 1963, the Gibbs moved to Sydney. The group&#x27;s first single was &quot;The Battle of the Blue and the Grey&quot; but it failed to chart. Around 1963, the Gibb brothers worked with Judy Stone, Johnny Devlin and Jimmy Hannan. By 1964, Gibb made his first appearance as an instrumentalist on the beat-influenced &quot;Claustrophobia&quot;. Also in 1964, the Gibb brothers worked with Johnny Devlin and Trevor Gordon. Around 1965, the Gibb brothers worked with Trevor Gordon, Michelle Rae and Noeleen Batley.

In 1966, the three Gibb brothers wrote their first song, &quot;The Storm&quot;. Also that year, Gibb began his career as the guitarist and bassist for the band; at around the same time he recorded his first solo song, &quot;All by Myself&quot;, on which he also played guitar. Around 1966, the Gibb brothers worked with Bip Addison, Sandy Summers, Anne Shelton, Vince Melouney, April Bryon, MPD Ltd, Ray Brown and the Whispers, Ronnie Burns, Lori Balmer, Marty Rhone, Vyt, Python Lee Jackson, Dennis Knight, Barrington Davis, Jenene and Jon Blanchfield. Their second album, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; (1966), included &quot;Where Are You&quot;, Gibb&#x27;s first solo writing credit to be released.

In March 1967, the Gibb brothers worked with Billy J. Kramer recording &quot;Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1&quot;. Around the same time, Colin Petersen and Vince Melouney joined the Bee Gees. In the middle of 1967 &quot;Bee Gees&#x27; 1st&quot; was released. The album was praised by the critics who compared it to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; which was released weeks earlier. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder wrote that Gibb&#x27;s Mellotron on &quot;Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You&quot; &#x27;was close in the spirit of the Moody Blues and was opened by a Gregorian chant.&#x27; The band&#x27;s first number 1 single in the UK, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was released in September 1967. In early 1968, the &quot;Horizontal&quot; was released. In August 1968, the Marbles released their first and only successful hit &quot;Only One Woman&quot; a song co-written by Gibb. In the middle of 1968, the band&#x27;s third international LP &quot;Idea&quot; included the song &quot;Kitty Can&quot;, which features Gibb&#x27;s high harmony vocal, with Barry Gibb singing low harmony. In early 1969, they released &quot;Odessa&quot;, which features Gibb&#x27;s solo vocals on &quot;Suddenly&quot; and &quot;I Laugh in Your Face&quot;. On 19 March 1969, the same day that Robin Gibb announced his plans as a solo artist, Gibb and his bandmates recorded and later released &quot;Tomorrow Tomorrow&quot;.

Maurice and Barry alone comprised the Bee Gees on the 1969 album &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; during Robin&#x27;s absence as a soloist. They sang the hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Remember&quot; (which reached number two on the UK chart while Robin&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, also reached number two) and follow up singles; &quot;IOIO&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow, Tomorrow&quot; with Barry taking lead and Maurice providing harmony vocals, but the duo version of the group enjoyed dwindling success. A supergroup in 1969 called the Fut was formed at a Tin Tin session and they recorded &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot; while Gibb was still a Bee Gee, and released later as a single, the band consisting of Gibb on vocals/bass/guitar, Steve Kipner and Steve Groves on vocals with Billy Lawrie also providing background vocals. &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot; features Gibb impersonating John Lennon, and Beatles fans thought that it was a lost Beatles song which had not been previously released. In 1985, Yoko Ono attempted to register the song as a Lennon composition.

On 1 December 1969, Maurice and brother Barry announced to the world that the Bee Gees had broken up.

=== 1970–1979: first solo project and Bee Gees&#x27; reunion ===
In April 1970 Gibb released his first solo single, &quot;Railroad&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;ve Come Back&quot;. His debut solo album, &quot;The Loner&quot;, has not yet been released. All of the songs on the album feature guitar work by Stone the Crows&#x27; Leslie Harvey. In May 1970 the album &quot;Sing a Rude Song&quot; was released in the UK with Gibb singing lead vocals on the three songs on the album. By 1976, New Blood Records issued &quot;Bee Gees Information&quot; which was credited to Gibb and features four songs from &quot;The Loner&quot;, but was only a limited edition for fan club, although the EP has no title but the picture sleeve of that has the club name (&quot;Bee Gees Information&quot;) in large letters. In 1970, he formed a supergroup the Bloomfields with Billy Lawrie and they recorded a short version of &quot;The Loner&quot;, which was released as a single in 1972 on Pye Records and intended for the film &quot;Bloomfield&quot;.

The Bee Gees reunited on 21 August 1970. Maurice later began taking a few lead vocals on a Bee Gees tracks in the 70s such as &quot;Lay It on Me&quot;, &quot;Country Woman&quot;, &quot;On Time&quot; and &quot;You Know It&#x27;s For You&quot;.

=== 1980–2003: continuous solo works and later years ===
In 1981, he recorded some instrumental tracks for his unreleased instrumental album &quot;Strings and Things&quot;, including &quot;Image of Samantha&quot;, which seems refer to his daughter Samantha.

In 1982, Gibb appeared at the San Remo Festival and performed &quot;Wildflower&quot;, a Bee Gees&#x27; song on which he provided lead vocals from &quot;Living Eyes&quot;. In 1983, Gibb re-recorded &quot;On Time&quot; at the same time as &quot;Hold Her in Your Hand&quot;. By February 1984, he collaborated with arranger Jimmie Haskell for the film soundtrack of &quot;A Breed Apart&quot;, recorded at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles. By March, he recorded &quot;Miami, A Musical Score&quot;, this song was later used for a promotional film in Miami. His second single &quot;Hold Her in Your Hand&quot; was only issued in UK, Australia and South Africa. In September 1986, the Bee Gees began writing and recording songs for their upcoming album &quot;ESP&quot;. on which Maurice took lead vocal on the song &quot;Overnight&quot;.

Gibb wrote and recorded the instrumental &quot;The Supernaturals&quot; in July 1985; it was later dubbed on the film of the same name, and he also appeared on the film doing a cameo appearance. On 24 April 2001, The Bee Gees released their 23rd and final studio album, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;, which included his songs, &quot;Walking on Air&quot; and &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;.

== Death ==
Gibb died suddenly at the age of 53 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida, on 12 January 2003; he went into cardiac arrest prior to emergency surgery for a twisted intestine. His wife and children were with him when he died.

A private funeral was attended by about 200 family and friends, including Michael Jackson and Harry Wayne Casey. After the service, his body was cremated. Journalist and family friend Jennifer Valoppi said, &quot;It was emotional, there was humor. Everybody talked about how this was a man who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life.&quot; Nat Kipner, who managed the Bee Gees early in their career in Australia in 1966, also attended the service. Barry and Robin Gibb told the BBC about Maurice&#x27;s death, &quot;The fact that they had to operate on Maurice during the shock of cardiac arrest is very questionable.&quot; Barry said, &quot;None of the sequence of events have yet made sense to us.&quot;

Robin Gibb spoke to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine about Maurice&#x27;s death in 2003: &quot;We were kids together, and teenagers. We spent the whole of our lives with each other because of our music. I can&#x27;t accept that he&#x27;s dead. I just imagine he&#x27;s alive somewhere else.&quot; Barry and Robin ceased performing as a group for a time, but later decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner until Robin died at the age of 62, from liver and kidney failure from colorectal cancer, on 20 May 2012.

== Influences ==
Gibb&#x27;s influences were the Beatles, the Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard, Paul Anka and the Mills Brothers. According to Gibb, he listened to the Beatles&#x27; early records when he was a child and was later influenced by Paul McCartney&#x27;s bass guitar-playing. Talking about the song &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot; by the Fut, on which Gibb sang and played bass, he said that &quot;We were just getting ready to do some tracks and we were just doing nothing and I was fartin&#x27; around on the bass. I was a big Paul freak. He was a great teacher for me.&quot; Gibb added that &quot;I could play every bass lick he [McCartney] played&quot;, especially &quot;Michelle&quot;, saying that its bassline was &quot;really tasteful stuff, and way ahead, way ahead of his time&quot;.

== Musicianship ==

=== Recognition ===
DJ Paul Gambaccini said: &quot;Maurice was the talented multi-instrumentalist, I mean here is a guy who played keyboards, guitar, bass and percussion.&quot;

Bruce Eder of AllMusic declared the track &quot;Back Home&quot; had &quot;the loudest guitar ever heard on a Bee Gees record&quot;.

In the reunited Bee Gees from 1987 onward, Gibb was the group&#x27;s resident expert on all technical phases of recording, and co-ordinated musicians and engineers to create much of the group&#x27;s sound.

=== Instrumentalist ===
He contributed the electric and acoustic guitars and the Hammond organ on the debut Bee Gees album &quot;The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs&quot; (1965). After that, he commenced his bass playing on the following album &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; (1966). He focused on the bass and the keyboards after Vince Melouney had joined as the group&#x27;s lead guitarist in 1967.

In terms of his proficiency at the guitar, he played lead guitar on &quot;Country Woman&quot; (1971) and the three &quot;2 Years On&quot; (1970) tracks: 1. &quot;Back Home&quot;, 2. &quot;Lay It on Me&quot; and 3. &quot;Every Second, Every Minute&quot; in addition to rhythm guitar on Bee Gees tracks.

As for his experience as a keyboardist, he performed the piano or the keyboard during live performances besides studio recordings. The songs &quot;Words&quot; (1968), &quot;Lonely Days&quot; (1970) and &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; (1971) were the frequent numbers at Bee Gees concerts. Other keyboards such as the harpsichord on &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Nobody&quot; (1967), Mellotron on &quot;Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You&quot; (1967) and Moog synthesizer on &quot;Sweet Song of Summer&quot; (1972) were the evidence to prove his technical-savvy talent for different keyboards.

From 1966 to 1974, his main instrument was the guitar, the bass and the piano or the keyboard. From 1975 to 1979, he primarily played the bass for an experiment in creating distinctive syncopated funk bass lines for the foundation of Bee Gees&#x27; driving disco sound. Meanwhile, he often performed the guitar during live performances. From 1987 onwards, he preferred the keyboards or the synthesisers more than the guitar or the bass.

His first and only drumming for the Bee Gees was on the &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; track &quot;My Thing&quot; (1969).

He once used the guitar given by John Lennon on the song &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; (2001). In a continuity link for the song on the Top Of The Pops 2 special, in support of the album &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; Robin mentioned Lennon&#x27;s guitar and Maurice confirmed it was his Epiphone. Some articles say it was Lennon&#x27;s acoustic guitar on the song &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;.

=== Vocals ===
On average, Maurice sang lead on one or two songs for each album and he was the lead vocalist on some Bee Gees tracks including &quot;On Time&quot;, &quot;Lay It on Me&quot;, &quot;Closer Than Close&quot;, and his last song &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;. His first composition is &quot;All by Myself&quot; recorded in 1966 but not released until 1970 on &quot;Inception/Nostalgia&quot;. On the Bee Gees&#x27; live performances of &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;, Maurice sang falsetto rather than Barry who originally sang falsetto on the studio recording. He also showcases his vocal talent on his unreleased LP &quot;The Loner&quot;.

His comic personality shone on stage during Bee Gees concerts when the brothers would perform an acoustic medley. Many times, Maurice would mock Robin while he was singing or pretend he was bored during the song &quot;Holiday&quot; (Maurice did not sing on the original record), among other things.

=== Songwriting ===
As a songwriter, Gibb contributed primarily to melody, with his brothers writing the lyrics that they would sing on the finished song (for the most part). It is difficult to identify his contributions because the songs were so shaped to the singer, but his brothers&#x27; continued writing collaboration with him on solo projects shows how much they relied on him. He was sometimes known as &quot;the quiet one&quot; for his less obvious contributions to the group, but privately he was a good teller of stories, who immensely enjoyed talking with fans. His reputation as a mild-mannered, stabilising influence with two very ambitious brothers continued through his life.

=== Studio collaborations ===
In 1966, Gibb became a session musician in Australia for other artists including Bip Addison, Anne Shelton, April Bryon, Barrington Davis and singer Jon. Around 1969, Gibb worked with his next-door neighbour, Beatle Ringo Starr, and the result was the track &quot;Modulating Maurice&quot; but it was not released. Gibb played piano on the track &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; as well as bass on &quot;Mother and Jack&quot; both songs performed by Robin Gibb for his first solo album.

Around 1970, Gibb played piano on George Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; as a part of his first triple solo album, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. In the recording studio he met Genesis&#x27; Phil Collins, Phil Spector, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and Harrison. In 1971, he produced Lulu&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Everybody Clap&quot;, which features Gibb on guitar, Leslie Harvey on guitar, former Manfred Mann and Cream member Jack Bruce on bass, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Bonham on drums. Bonham and his wife, Pat Philips became friends with Gibb and Lulu. Also in that year, he played bass on Billy Lawrie&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;Freedom&quot;. Future Wings and former Thunderclap Newman guitarist Jimmy McCulloch played guitar on that song, and McCulloch suggests that it was recorded at around the same time as Lulu&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Clap&quot;, with Stone the Crows&#x27; Maggie Bell providing backing vocals. On 17 January 1972, Gibb produced, with Billy Lawrie, &quot;Baby Come on Home&quot;, released as a single also in that year. In April 1972, Gibb produced Jimmy Stevens&#x27; album &quot;Don&#x27;t Freak Me Out&quot; (called &quot;Paid My Dues&quot; in US). The same year, Gibb produced &quot;Drift Away&quot;, an album released by Bob Saker and Mike Berry; it includes a cover version of &quot;On Time&quot;. In 1973, Gibb produced and played bass on Jimmy Stevens&#x27; unreleased numbers with musicians Alan Kendall, Jimmy McCulloch, Pete Willsher, Zoot Money and singer Paul Jones. In August 1973, Gibb participated on Andy Gibb&#x27;s first recording session, performing two new songs.

In 1978, Gibb produced with Steve Klein the Osmonds&#x27; album &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, which features a cover version of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Rest Your Love on Me&quot;. Also in 1978, Gibb composed &quot;The Love That Was Lost&quot;, with Blue Weaver on keyboard and arranged by Mike Lewis, who also arranged for the disco group KC and the Sunshine Band. In 1980, Gibb co-wrote with Tim Rice &quot;Last Affair of the Heart&quot;, which was recorded by Elaine Paige at AIR Studios in London along with &quot;Secrets&quot; and &quot;Carried Away&quot;. In 1982, Gibb took part in Barry&#x27;s original demo recording of the song &quot;Eyes That See in the Dark&quot;, a song intended for Kenny Rogers&#x27; album of the same name. In August 1982, Gibb wrote and recorded &quot;Spirit of the Snow&quot; and intended for the film &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Gibb worked with Robin on his three albums &quot;How Old Are You?&quot; (1983), &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1984) and &quot;Walls Have Eyes&quot; (1985). Gibb co-wrote &quot;Shine, Shine&quot; with his brother Barry and keyboardist George Bitzer, the song later became a Top 40 for Barry in the US. In 1985, Gibb sang background vocals on Larry Gatlin&#x27;s songs &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, available on Gatlin&#x27;s album &quot;Smile&quot; with Gatlin and Roy Orbison on lead vocals; another track &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Call It (Falling in Love)&quot; was not released. In 1986, Gibb produced Carola&#x27;s album &quot;Runaway&quot;. Also in 1986, Gibb participated on the Bunbury songs &quot;Up the Revolution&quot;, &quot;Fight (No Matter How Long)&quot;, &quot;Bunbury Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Seasons&quot;.

One of Gibb&#x27;s last recordings was on the demo of &quot;I Cannot Give You My Love&quot; on which he played keyboards with his brother Barry taking the lead vocals. The song was intended for Cliff Richard.

== Personal life ==

Gibb met Scottish pop singer Lulu through Colin Petersen in 1967. Lulu recalls about Maurice, &quot;I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, &#x27;In that case, tell him to stop talking about me and take me out&#x27;, He did just that, I never expected much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite the wrong way to describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other&quot;. According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London on 1 October 1967. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: &quot;Lulu and I met on the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month&quot;.

Later in 1968, Lulu was seen in public with Davy Jones of the Monkees; Jones was also a friend of Maurice. As Gibb recalled, &quot;Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said &#x27;I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball&#x27; and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry&quot;. Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology. &quot;We just grew up, that&#x27;s all,&quot; Maurice admitted. &quot;We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn&#x27;t want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she&#x27;d call me back. We used to make about 90-minute calls&quot;.

In the same year, Gibb was seen in public with Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: &quot;I&#x27;m not a Casanova and it&#x27;s all most unfortunate. I&#x27;ve never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, &#x27;Oh, we won&#x27;t bother about Maurice because he&#x27;s always got a steady girl&#x27;.

Gibb and Lulu married on 18 February 1969 and separated in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless. Gibb later said they both drank: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have any responsibilities, we&#x27;d just party.&quot;

In her autobiography, Barbara Windsor claimed to have had a brief affair with him.

=== Family ===
He married his second wife, Yvonne Spenceley Gibb, on 17 October 1975. They had two children. Their marriage lasted until his death. Maurice&#x27;s alcoholic nadir came in 1991, when he pulled a gun on his wife and children after a month-long bender. They left him and immediately went to brother Barry&#x27;s house, refusing to come back until he had done something about his drinking. Maurice went into rehab, calling Yvonne and telling her he was going to stay because he wanted to stop drinking. She said that that was the call she had been waiting for.

=== Substance abuse and recovery ===
Gibb said he had &quot;battled the booze&quot; since the 1970s. John Lennon introduced him to his favourite drink, scotch and coke: &quot;If he had given me cyanide, I would have drunk the cyanide, I was so in awe of the man.&quot; He would go out drinking with his neighbour, Ringo Starr. According to Barry, it got to the point where he became unreliable, and he would have to feel his way along the wall prior to going onstage. One factor in Maurice&#x27;s recovery was the active intervention of his brothers, who had recently lost their youngest brother Andy. In an interview, Maurice acknowledged that his final years of alcohol abuse had been driven by his failure to reach Andy before his death, and his subsequent guilt. After rehab, Maurice started to rediscover his family again, spending quality time with them. To celebrate this, he and Yvonne renewed their wedding vows in 1992. The ceremony was attended not only by many members of their families but many of the friends Gibb made while at the rehabilitation centre. Maurice would remain sober until his death.

== Legacy ==
Maurice Gibb was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 as a member of The Bee Gees.

Wyclef Jean recorded &quot;Jive Talkin&#x27;&quot; in 2005 and Sheryl Crow recorded &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; in 2005 as a tribute for him. A novel entitled &quot;Souls Stick Around: A Tale of the Black Hills and Maurice Gibb&quot;, was published in March 2012 by Bee Gees fan and author Dawnette Owens.

A recording studio at Chorlton High School, one of the schools the brothers attended, commemorates Gibb. In honouring Gibb, his brother Barry Gibb noted: &quot;Mo was a real McCartney bass freak, as a lot of us were. He would pick up on all the things that McCartney would [do]. Maurice was very good on different instruments, you know. Good lead guitarist, good bass player, good keyboard player. He was versatile. He loved playing bass more than anything else, I think, at that time.&quot;

===Australian Songwriters Hall of Fame===
The Australian Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 2004 to honour the lifetime achievements of some of Australia&#x27;s greatest songwriters.

<doc id="168166" wikidata="Q12081974" url="?curid=168166" title="Ski cap">
<text>The ski cap is a type of field cap used by several German-speaking or German-influenced armed forces since the late 19th century. The design originates from imperial Austria-Hungary, but is best known for its widespread use as M43 field cap () used by the German Wehrmacht and SS during World War II. A similar design is used in Germany as the distinguishing headgear of the , the only differences being the bill was slightly extended and the top panel of the hat had a smaller circumference, giving it slightly sloped-in sides. The design and its successors still in use today are the German counterparts to the American patrol cap or utility cover.

==Variants==
There are several variants of the ski cap, starting with the &#x27;s ski cap. This was the first in the family of caps, and was recognized by a high peak, a teardrop shaped top, a short bill, and a small skirt that folds down to protect the ears in cold. All had a small edelweiss or a grouping of leaves, depending on the unit. During the Second World War, the ski cap was generally made of field grey or field blue wool, depending on whether it was used by the Heer, SS, or the Luftwaffe.


The precursor to the German was a service cap first issued to Austrian Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops in 1906. During World War I, this cap was made of (pike grey) wool and had a turn-down brim to cover the wearer&#x27;s ears in cold weather. German mountain troops, who initially wore a grey peakless forage cap resembling a sailor cap, adopted the in 1915 as a gesture of solidarity with their Austrian allies. Both the German and Austrian bore edelweiss insignia, the mark of an experienced mountain climber, but, unlike the leather peaks of the Austrian caps, the peak of the German cap was covered with slate grey wool.

The sides of the stand almost straight up, due to the wide top sewn onto the cap. The skirt that surrounds the cap is made in the same wool as the cap, and is double layered in the rear three quarters of the skirt, enabling it to be folded down over the ears. The skirt has a small dip in the front quarter with a divide secured by two small buttons in order to get the skirt around the bill. The small section in the front quarter was built shorter to show the insignia, and cover the wearer&#x27;s chin or mouth, without disturbing breathing by covering the nose.

==Use of similar headwear in Finland==
The ski cap -like design was introduced in the Finnish Army and Finnish Air Force in the field uniform of model 1936, which was based on contemporary German models.

The cap was used by all ranks during the Second World War and long afterwards. As with all caps of the Finnish Defence Forces, rank-and-file and junior NCOs wore the cap with a roundel-type cockade of white-blue-white, while officers and senior NCOs wore a red cockade featuring a golden lion of Finland. The cap was finally phased out in 2014.

==Modern use==

Mountain units () of the Bundeswehr still wear M43-style field caps, and are still referred to as . The caps have the fold mentioned above, and are issued in medium grey for enlisted personnel and a lighter grey with silver piping around the brim for officers. The Edelweiss is still on the left side of the cap above the ear, and the cockade and crossed-swords insignia are present on the front above the bill. Most modern M43 field caps are of a slightly different cut than the original M43, with a wider top, but still very similar to the of World War II. Many modern German police units also use a variant of the M43. Additionally, all other army units wear a simplified version of the M43 cap, without the fold-down ear flaps, in standard camouflage with a BeVo cockade on the front. This is generally worn in the field instead of the Beret. There is also a version of lighter cloth in the desert variant of for use in tropical climates. The Bergmütze is also part of the formal uniform of the civil Austrian volunteer Fire Fighting services.

<doc id="168171" wikidata="Q189454" url="?curid=168171" title="Helena Blavatsky">
<text>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (; – 8 May 1891), often known as Madame Blavatsky, was a Russian and American mystic and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. She gained an international following as the primary founder of Theosophy as a belief system.

Born into an aristocratic family in Yekaterinoslav, Blavatsky traveled widely around the empire as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in Western esotericism during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1849 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She also claimed that during this period she encountered a group of spiritual adepts, the &quot;Masters of the Ancient Wisdom&quot;, who sent her to Shigatse, Tibet, where they trained her to develop a deeper understanding of the synthesis of religion, philosophy, and science.

Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period in Europe. By the early 1870s, Blavatsky was involved in the Spiritualist movement; although defending the genuine existence of Spiritualist phenomena, she argued against the mainstream Spiritualist idea that the entities contacted were the spirits of the dead. Relocating to the United States in 1873, she befriended Henry Steel Olcott and rose to public attention as a spirit medium, attention that included public accusations of fraudulence.

In 1875, New York City, Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society with Olcott and William Quan Judge. In 1877, she published &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;, a book outlining her Theosophical world-view. Associating it closely with the esoteric doctrines of Hermeticism and Neoplatonism, Blavatsky described Theosophy as &quot;the synthesis of science, religion and philosophy&quot;, proclaiming that it was reviving an &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot; which underlay all the world&#x27;s religions. In 1880, she and Olcott moved to India, where the Society tried to make allies to the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reform movement. On March 26, 1882 Maharishi Dayananda spoke about the &quot;Humbuggery of the Theosophists&quot;. That same year, while in Ceylon, she and Olcott became the first people from the United States to formally convert to Buddhism.

Although opposed by the British colonial administration, Theosophy spread rapidly in India but experienced internal problems after Blavatsky was accused of producing fraudulent paranormal phenomena. In ailing health, in 1885 she returned to Europe, establishing the Blavatsky Lodge in London. There she published &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, a commentary on what she claimed were ancient Tibetan manuscripts, as well as two further books, &quot;The Key to Theosophy&quot; and &quot;The Voice of the Silence&quot;. She died of influenza in 1891.

Blavatsky was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened sage and derided as a charlatan by critics. Her Theosophical doctrines influenced the spread of Hindu and Buddhist ideas in the West as well as the development of Western esoteric currents like Ariosophy, Anthroposophy, and the New Age Movement.

== Early life ==
Developing a reliable account of Blavatsky&#x27;s life has proved difficult for biographers because in later life she deliberately provided contradictory accounts and falsifications about her own past. Furthermore, very few of her own writings written before 1873 survive, meaning that biographers must rely heavily on these unreliable later accounts. The accounts of her early life provided by her family members have also been considered dubious by biographers.

=== Childhood: 1831–1849 ===
==== Birth and family background ====
Blavatsky was born as Helena Petrovna Hahn von Rottenstern in the town of Yekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine). Her birth date was 12 August 1831, although according to the Julian calendar used in 19th-century Russia it was 31 July. Immediately after her birth, she was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church. At the time, Yekaterinoslav was undergoing a cholera epidemic, and her mother contracted the disease shortly after childbirth; despite the expectations of their doctor, both mother and child survived the epidemic.

Blavatsky&#x27;s family was aristocratic. Her mother was Helena Andreyevna Hahn von Rottenstern (Russian: Елена Андреевна Ган, 1814–1842; née Fadeyeva), a self-educated 17-year-old who was the daughter of Princess Yelena Pavlovna Dolgorukaya, a similarly self-educated aristocrat. Blavatsky&#x27;s father was Pyotr Alexeyevich Hahn von Rottenstern (Russian: Пётр Алексеевич Ган, 1798–1873), a descendant of the German Hahn aristocratic family, who served as a captain in the Russian Royal Horse Artillery, and would later rise to the rank of colonel. Pyotr had not been present at his daughter&#x27;s birth, having been in Poland fighting to suppress the November Uprising against Russian rule, and first saw her when she was six months old. As well as her Russian and German ancestry, Blavatsky could also claim French heritage, for a great-great grandfather had been a French Huguenot nobleman who had fled to Russia to escape persecution, there serving in the court of Catherine the Great.

As a result of Pyotr&#x27;s career, the family frequently moved to different parts of the Empire, accompanied by their servants, a mobile childhood that may have influenced Blavatsky&#x27;s largely nomadic lifestyle in later life. A year after Pyotr&#x27;s arrival in Yekaterinoslav, the family relocated to the nearby army town of Romankovo. When Blavatsky was two years old, her younger brother, Sasha, died in another army town when no medical help could be found. In 1835, mother and daughter moved to Odessa, where Blavatsky&#x27;s maternal grandfather Andrei Fadeyev, a civil administrator for the imperial authorities, had recently been posted. It was in this city that Blavatsky&#x27;s sister Vera Petrovna was born.

==== St. Petersburg, Poltava, and Saratov ====

After a return to rural Ukraine, Pyotr was posted to Saint Petersburg, where the family moved in 1836. Blavatsky&#x27;s mother liked the city, there establishing her own literary career, penning novels under the pseudonym of &quot;Zenaida R-va&quot; and translating the works of the English novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton for Russian publication. When Pyotr returned to Ukraine , she remained in the city. After Fadeyev was assigned to become a trustee for the Kalmyk people of Central Asia, Blavatsky and her mother accompanied him to Astrakhan, where they befriended a Kalmyk leader, Tumen. The Kalmyks were practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism, and it was here that Blavatsky gained her first experience with the religion.

In 1838, Blavatsky&#x27;s mother moved with her daughters to be with her husband at Poltava, where she taught Blavatsky how to play the piano and organized for her to take dance lessons. As a result of her poor health, Blavatsky&#x27;s mother returned to Odessa, where Blavatsky learned English from a British governess. They next moved to Saratov, where a brother, Leonid, was born in June 1840. The family proceeded to Poland and then back to Odessa, where Blavatsky&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis in June 1842, aged 28.

The three surviving children were sent to live with their maternal grandparents in Saratov, where their grandfather Andrei had been appointed Governor of Saratov Governorate. The historian Richard Davenport-Hines described the young Blavatsky as &quot;a petted, wayward, invalid child&quot; who was a &quot;beguiling story-teller&quot;. Accounts provided by relatives reveal that she socialized largely with lower-class children and that she enjoyed playing pranks and reading. She was educated in French, art, and music, all subjects designed to enable her to find a husband. With her grandparents she holidayed in Tumen&#x27;s Kalmyk summer camp, where she learned horse riding and some Tibetan.

She later claimed that in Saratov she discovered the personal library of her maternal great-grandfather, Prince Pavel Vasilevich Dolgorukov (d. 1838); it contained a variety of books on esoteric subjects, encouraging her burgeoning interest in it. Dolgorukov had been initiated into Freemasonry in the late 1770s and had belonged to the Rite of Strict Observance; there were rumors that he had met both Alessandro Cagliostro and the Count of St. Germain. She also later stated that at this time of life she began to experience visions in which she encountered a &quot;Mysterious Indian&quot; man, and that in later life she would meet this man in the flesh. Many biographers have considered this to be the first appearance of the &quot;Masters&quot; in her life story.

According to some of her later accounts, in 1844–45 Blavatsky was taken by her father to England, where she visited London and Bath. According to this story, in London she received piano lessons from the Bohemian composer Ignaz Moscheles, and performed with Clara Schumann. However, some Blavatsky biographers believe that this visit to Britain never took place, particularly as no mention of it is made in her sister&#x27;s memoirs. After a year spent living with her aunt, Yekaterina Andreyevna Witte, mother of the future first Prime Minister of the Russian Empire, Sergei Witte, she moved to Tiflis, Georgia, where her grandfather Andrei had been appointed director of state lands in Transcaucasia. Blavatsky claimed that here she established a friendship with Alexander Vladimirovich Golitsyn, a Russian Freemason and member of the Golitsyn family who encouraged her interest in esoteric matters. She would also claim that at this period she had further paranormal experiences, astral traveling and again encountering her &quot;mysterious Indian&quot; in visions.

=== World travels: 1849–1869 ===

At age 17, she agreed to marry Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky, a man in his forties who worked as Vice Governor of Erivan Province. Her reasons for doing so were unclear, although she later claimed that she was attracted by his belief in magic. Although she tried to back out shortly before the wedding ceremony, the marriage took place on 7 July 1849. Moving with him to the Sardar Palace, she made repeated unsuccessful attempts to escape and return to her family in Tiflis, to which he eventually relented. The family sent her, accompanied by a servant and maid, to Odessa to meet her father, who planned to return to Saint Petersburg with her. The escorts accompanied her to Poti and then Kerch, intending to continue with her to Odessa. Blavatsky claimed that, fleeing her escorts and bribing the captain of the ship that had taken her to Kerch, she reached Constantinople. This marked the start of nine years spent traveling the world, possibly financed by her father.

She did not keep a diary at the time, and was not accompanied by relatives who could verify her activities. Thus, historian of esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke noted that public knowledge of these travels rests upon &quot;her own largely uncorroborated accounts&quot;, which are marred by being &quot;occasionally conflicting in their chronology&quot;. For religious studies scholar Bruce F. Campbell, there was &quot;no reliable account&quot; for the next 25 years of her life. According to biographer Peter Washington, at this point &quot;myth and reality begin to merge seamlessly in Blavatsky&#x27;s biography&quot;.

She later claimed that in Constantinople she developed a friendship with a Hungarian opera singer named Agardi Metrovitch, whom she first encountered when saving him from being murdered. It was also in Constantinople that she met the Countess Sofia Kiselyova, who she would accompany on a tour of Egypt, Greece, and Eastern Europe. In Cairo, she met the American art student Albert Rawson, who later wrote extensively about the Middle East, and together they allegedly visited a Coptic magician, Paulos Metamon. In 1851, she proceeded to Paris, where she encountered the mesmerist, Victor Michal, who impressed her. From there, she visited England, and would claim that it was here that she met the &quot;mysterious Indian&quot; who had appeared in her childhood visions, a Hindu whom she referred to as the Master Morya. While she provided various conflicting accounts of how they met, locating it in both London and Ramsgate according to separate stories, she maintained that he claimed that he had a special mission for her, and that she must travel to Tibet.

She made her way to Asia via the Americas, heading to Canada in autumn 1851. Inspired by the novels of James Fenimore Cooper, she sought out the Native American communities of Quebec in the hope of meeting their magico-religious specialists, but was instead robbed, later attributing these Natives&#x27; behavior to the corrupting influence of Christian missionaries. She then headed south, visiting New Orleans, Texas, Mexico, and the Andes, before transport via ship from the West Indies to Ceylon and then Bombay. She spent two years in India, allegedly following the instructions found in letters that Morya had sent to her. She attempted to enter Tibet, but was prevented from doing so by the British colonial administration.

She later claimed that she then headed back to Europe by ship, surviving a shipwreck near to the Cape of Good Hope before arriving in England in 1854, where she faced hostility as a Russian citizen due to the ongoing Crimean War between Britain and Russia. It was here, she claimed, that she worked as a concert musician for the Royal Philharmonic Society. Sailing to the U.S., she visited New York City, where she met up with Rawson, before touring Chicago, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco, and then sailing back to India via Japan. There, she spent time in Kashmir, Ladakh, and Burma, before making a second attempt to enter Tibet. She claimed that this time she was successful, entering Tibet in 1856 through Kashmir, accompanied by a Tartar shaman who was attempting to reach Siberia and who thought that as a Russian citizen, Blavatsky would be able to aid him in doing so. According to this account, they reached Leh before becoming lost, eventually joining a traveling Tartar group before she headed back to India. She returned to Europe via Madras and Java.

After spending time in France and Germany, in 1858 she returned to her family, then based in Pskov. She later claimed that there she began to exhibit further paranormal abilities, with rapping and creaking accompanying her around the house and furniture moving of its own volition. In 1860, she and her sister visited their maternal grandmother in Tiflis. It was there that she met up with Metrovitch, and where she reconciled with Nikifor in 1862. Together they adopted a child named Yuri, who would die aged five in 1867, when he was buried under Metrovitch&#x27;s surname.
In 1864, while riding in Mingrelia, Blavatsky fell from her horse and was in a coma for several months with a spinal fracture. Recovering in Tiflis, she claimed that upon awaking she gained full control of her paranormal abilities. She then proceeded to Italy, Transylvania, and Serbia, possibly studying the Cabalah with a rabbi at this point. In 1867, she proceeded to the Balkans, Hungary, and then Italy, where she spent time in Venice, Florence, and Mentana, claiming that in the latter she had been injured fighting for Giuseppe Garibaldi at the Battle of Mentana.

==== Tibet ====

She claimed to have then received a message from Morya to travel to Constantinople, where he met her, and together they traveled overland to Tibet, going through Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and then into India, entering Tibet via Kashmir. There, they allegedly stayed in the home of Morya&#x27;s friend and colleague, Master Koot Hoomi, which was near to Tashilhunpo Monastery, Shigatse. According to Blavatsky, both Morya and Koot Hoomi were Kashmiris of Punjabi origin, and it was at his home that Koot Hoomi taught students of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Koot Hoomi was described as having spent time in London and Leipzig, being fluent in both English and French, and like Morya was a vegetarian.

She claimed that in Tibet, she was taught an ancient, unknown language known as Senzar, and translated a number of ancient texts written in this language that were preserved by the monks of a monastery; she stated that she was, however, not permitted entry into the monastery itself. She also claimed that while in Tibet, Morya and Koot Hoomi helped her develop and control her psychic powers. Among the abilities that she ascribed to these &quot;Masters&quot; were clairvoyance, clairaudience, telepathy, and the ability to control another&#x27;s consciousness, to dematerialize and rematerialize physical objects, and to project their astral bodies, thus giving the appearance of being in two places at once. She claimed to have remained on this spiritual retreat from late 1868 until late 1870. Blavatsky never claimed in print to have visited Lhasa, although this is a claim that would be made for her in various later sources, including the account provided by her sister.

Many critics and biographers have expressed doubt about the veracity of Blavatsky&#x27;s claims regarding her visits to Tibet, which rely entirely on her own claims, lacking any credible independent testimony. It has been highlighted that during the nineteenth century, Tibet was closed to Europeans, and visitors faced the perils of bandits and a harsh terrain; the latter would have been even more problematic if Blavatsky had been as stout and unathletic as she would be in later life. However, as several biographers have noted, traders and pilgrims from neighboring lands were able to access Tibet freely, suggesting the possibility that she would have been allowed to enter accompanied by Morya, particularly if she had been mistaken for an Asian. Blavatsky&#x27;s eyewitness account of Shigatse was unprecedented in the West, and one scholar of Buddhism, D. T. Suzuki, suggested that she later exhibited an advanced knowledge of Mahayana Buddhism consistent with her having studied in a Tibetan monastery. Lachman noted that had Blavatsky spent time in Tibet, then she would be &quot;one of the greatest travelers of the nineteenth century&quot;, although he added – &quot;in all honesty I do not know&quot; if Blavatsky spent time in Tibet or not. Biographer Marion Meade commented on Blavatsky&#x27;s tales of Tibet and various other adventures by stating that &quot;hardly a word of this appears to be true&quot;.

== Later life ==

=== Embracing Spiritualism and establishing Theosophy: 1870–1878 ===

==== Arriving in New York City ====

Blavatsky alleged that she departed Tibet with the mission of proving to the world that the phenomena identified by Spiritualists were objectively real, thus defending Spiritualism against accusations of fraud. However, she also stated that the entities being contacted by Spiritualist mediums were not the spirits of the dead, as the Spiritualist movement typically alleged, but instead either mischievous elementals or the &quot;shells&quot; left behind by the deceased. She proceeded via the Suez Canal to Greece, where she met with another of the Masters, Master Hilarion. She set sail for Egypt aboard the , but in July 1871 it exploded during the journey; Blavatsky was one of only 16 survivors. Reaching Cairo, she met up with Metamon, and with the help of a woman named Emma Cutting established a &quot;société spirite&quot;, which was based largely on Spiritism, a form of Spiritualism founded by Allan Kardec which professed a belief in reincarnation, in contrast to the mainstream Spiritualist movement. However, Blavatsky believed that Cutting and many of the mediums employed by the society were fraudulent, and she closed it down after two weeks. In Cairo, she also met with the Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, and another of the Masters, Serapis Bey. It was also here that she met up with Metrovitch, although he soon died of typhoid, with Blavatsky claiming to have overseen the funeral.

Leaving Egypt, she proceeded to Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, there encountering members of the Druze religion. It was during these travels that she met with the writer and traveler Lidia Pashkova, who provided independent verification of Blavatsky&#x27;s travels during this period. In July 1872 she returned to her family in Odessa, before departing in April 1873. She spent time in Bucharest and Paris, beforeaccording to her later claimsMorya instructed her to go to the United States. Blavatsky arrived in New York City on 8 July 1873. There, she moved into a women&#x27;s housing cooperative on Madison Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, earning a wage through piece work sewing and designing advertising cards. It was here that she attracted attention, and was interviewed by the journalist Anna Ballard of the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;; this interview was the earliest textual source in which Blavatsky claimed to have spent time in Tibet. Indeed, it was while in New York that &quot;detailed records&quot; of Blavatsky&#x27;s life again become available to historians. Soon after, Blavatsky received news of her father&#x27;s death, thus inheriting a considerable fortune, allowing her to move into a lavish hotel. In December 1874, Blavatsky met the Georgian Mikheil Betaneli. Infatuated with her, he repeatedly requested that they marry, to which she ultimately relented; this constituted bigamy, as her first husband was still alive. However, as she refused to consummate the marriage, Betaneli sued for divorce and returned to Georgia.

==== Meeting Henry Steel Olcott and the foundation of the Theosophical Society ====

Blavatsky was intrigued by a news story about William and Horatio Eddy, brothers based in Chittenden, Vermont, who it was claimed could levitate and manifest spiritual phenomena. She visited Chittenden in October 1874, there meeting the reporter Henry Steel Olcott, who was investigating the brothers&#x27; claims for the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot;. Claiming that Blavatsky impressed him with her own ability to manifest spirit phenomena, Olcott authored a newspaper article on her. They soon became close friends, giving each other the nicknames of &quot;Maloney&quot; (Olcott) and &quot;Jack&quot; (Blavatsky). He helped attract greater attention to Blavatsky&#x27;s claims, encouraging the Daily Graphic&#x27;s editor to publish an interview with her, and discussing her in his book on Spiritualism, &quot;People from the Other World&quot; (1875), which her Russian correspondent Alexandr Aksakov urged her to translate into Russian.
She began to instruct Olcott in her own occult beliefs, and encouraged by her he became celibate, tee-totaling, and vegetarian, although she herself was unable to commit to the latter. In January 1875 the duo visited the Spiritualist mediums Nelson and Jennie Owen in Philadelphia; the Owens asked Olcott to test them to prove that the phenomena that they produced were not fraudulent, and while Olcott believed them, Blavatsky opined that they faked some of their phenomena in those instances when genuine phenomena failed to manifest.

Drumming up interest for their ideas, Blavatsky and Olcott published a circular letter in Eldridge Gerry Brown&#x27;s Boston-based Spiritualist publication, &quot;The Spiritual Scientist&quot;. There, they named themselves the &quot;Brotherhood of Luxor&quot;, a name potentially inspired by the pre-existing Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. They began living together in a series of rented apartments in New York City, which they decorated with taxidermied animals and images of spiritual figures; their life was funded largely by Olcott&#x27;s continued work as a lawyer. Their last such apartment came to be known as the Lamasery. Allegedly encouraged by the Masters, Blavatsky and Olcott established the Miracle Club, through which they facilitated lectures on esoteric themes in New York City. It was through this group that they met an Irish Spiritualist, William Quan Judge, who shared many of their interests.

At a Miracle Club meeting on 7 September 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Judge agreed to establish an esoteric organization, with Charles Sotheran suggesting that they call it the Theosophical Society. The term &quot;theosophy&quot; came from the Greek &quot;theos&quot; (&quot;god(s)&quot;) and &quot;sophia&quot; (&quot;wisdom&quot;), thus meaning &quot;god-wisdom&quot; or &quot;divine wisdom&quot;. The term was not new, but had been previously used in various contexts by the Philaletheians and the Christian mystic, Jakob Böhme. Theosophists would often argue over how to define Theosophy, with Judge expressing the view that the task was impossible. Blavatsky however insisted that Theosophy was not a religion in itself. Lachman has described the movement as &quot;a very wide umbrella, under which quite a few things could find a place&quot;.
On foundation, Olcott was appointed chairman, with Judge as secretary, and Blavatsky as corresponding secretary, although she remained the group&#x27;s primary theoretician and leading figure. Prominent early members included Emma Hardinge Britten, Signor Bruzzesi, C.C. Massey, and William L. Alden; many were prominent and successful members of the establishment, although not all would remain members for long.

==== &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; ====

In 1875, Blavatsky began work on a book outlining her Theosophical worldview, much of which would be written during a stay in the Ithaca home of Hiram Corson, a Professor of English Literature at Cornell University. Although she had hoped to call it &quot;The Veil of Isis&quot;, it would be published as &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;. While writing it, Blavatsky claimed to be aware of a second consciousness within her body, referring to it as &quot;the lodger who is in me&quot;, and stating that it was this second consciousness that inspired much of the writing. In &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;, Blavatsky quoted extensively from other esoteric and religious texts, although her contemporary and colleague Olcott always maintained that she had quoted from books that she did not have access to. Writing more than a century after her death Lachman conjectured that if this had been the case, then she had had an eidetic memory, such that, while relying on earlier sources, the book represented an original synthesis that connected disparate ideas not brought together before.

Revolving around Blavatsky&#x27;s idea that all the world&#x27;s religions stemmed from a single &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot;, which she connected to the Western esotericism of ancient Hermeticism and Neoplatonism, it also articulated her thoughts on Spiritualism, and provided a criticism of Darwinian evolution, stating that it dealt only with the physical world and ignored the spiritual realms.
The book was edited by Professor of Philosophy Alexander Wilder and published in two volumes by J.W. Bouton in 1877. Although facing negative mainstream press reviews, including from those who highlighted that it extensively quoted around 100 other books without acknowledgement, it proved to be such a commercial success, with its initial print run of 1,000 copies selling out in a week, that the publisher requested a sequel, although Blavatsky turned down the offer.
While &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; was a success, the Society remained largely inactive, having fallen into this state in autumn 1876. This was despite the fact that new lodges of the organization had been established throughout the U.S. and in London, and prominent figures like Thomas Edison and Abner Doubleday had joined. In July 1878, Blavatsky gained U.S. citizenship.

=== India: 1879–1885 ===

The Theosophical Society established links with an Indian Hindu reform movement, the Arya Samaj, which had been founded by the Swami Dayananda Saraswati; Blavatsky and Olcott believed that the two organizations shared a common spiritual world-view. Unhappy with life in the U.S., Blavatsky decided to move to India, with Olcott agreeing to join her, securing work as a U.S. trade representative to the country. In December, the duo auctioned off many of their possessions, although Edison gifted them a phonograph to take with them to India. They left New York City aboard the &quot;Canada&quot;, which took them to London. After meeting with well-wishers in the capital, they traveled to Liverpool, there setting sail aboard the &quot;Speke Hall&quot;, arriving in Bombay in February 1879. In the city, they were greeted with celebrations organized by Arya Samaj member Hurrychund Chintamon before obtaining a house in Girgaum Road, part of Bombay&#x27;s native area.

Associating largely with Indians rather than the governing British elite, Blavatsky took a fifteen-year-old Gujarati boy, Vallah &quot;Babula&quot; Bulla, as her personal servant. Many educated Indians were impressed with the Theosophists championing of Indian religions, coming about during a period &quot;of [India&#x27;s] growing self-assertion against the values and beliefs&quot; of the British Empire. Her activity in the city was monitored by British intelligence services, who suspected that she was working for Russia.
In April, Blavatsky took Olcott, Babula, and their friend Moolji Thackersey to the Karla Caves, announcing that they contained secret passages that led to an underground place where the Masters assembled. Then claiming that the Masters were telepathically commanding her to head to Rajputana in the Punjab, she and Olcott headed north. At the Yamuna river, they met the sannyasin Babu Surdass, who had sat in the lotus position for 52 years, and in Agra saw the Taj Mahal. In Saharanpur they met with Dayananda and his Arya Samajists, before returning to Bombay.
In July 1879, Blavatsky and Olcott began work on a monthly magazine, &quot;The Theosophist&quot;, with the first issue coming out in October. The magazine soon obtained a large readership, with the management being taken over by Damodar K. Mavalankar, a Theosophist who introduced the idea of referring to the Masters as &quot;mahatmas&quot;. In December, Blavatsky and Olcott traveled to Allahabad, there visiting Alfred Percy Sinnett, the editor of &quot;The Pioneer&quot; and keen Spiritualist. A.O. Hume was also a guest at the Sinnett&#x27;s home, and Blavatsky was encouraged to manifest paranormal phenomena in their presence. From there, they traveled to Benares, where they stayed at the palace of the Maharaja of Vizianagram. Blavatsky and Olcott were then invited to Ceylon by Buddhist monks. There they officially converted to Buddhism – apparently the first from the United States to do so. – taking the Five Precepts in a ceremony at Ramayana Nikayana in May 1880. Touring the island, they were met by crowds intrigued by these unusual Westerners who embraced Buddhism rather than proselytizing Christianity. Their message proved a boost to Sinhalese nationalist self-esteem, and they were invited to see the Buddha&#x27;s Tooth in Kandy.

Upon learning that old comrade Emma Coulomb (née Cutting) and her husband had fallen into poverty in Ceylon, Blavatsky invited them to move into her home in Bombay. However, the Coulombs annoyed Rosa Bates and Edward Winbridge, two American Theosophists who were also living with Blavatsky; when Blavatsky took the side of the Coulombs, Bates and Winbridge returned to the U.S. Blavatsky was then invited to Simla to spend more time with Sinnett, and there performed a range of materializations that astounded the other guests; in one instance, she allegedly made a cup-and-saucer materialize under the soil during a picnic. Sinnett was eager to contact the Masters himself, convincing Blavatsky to facilitate this communication, resulting in the production of over 1400 pages allegedly authored by Koot Hoomi and Morya, which came to be known as the Mahatma Letters. Sinnett summarised the teachings contained in these letters in his book &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; (1883), although scholars of Buddhism like Max Müller publicly highlighted that the contents were not Buddhist, and Blavatsky herself disliked the misleading title. Since the book&#x27;s publication, there has been much debate as to the authenticity of the letters, with some arguing that they were written by Blavatsky herself, and others believing that they were written by separate individuals. According to Meade, &quot;there can be no reasonable doubt that Helena was their author&quot;.

Theosophy was unpopular with both Christian missionaries and the British colonial administration, with India&#x27;s English-language press being almost uniformly negative toward the Society. The group nevertheless proved popular, and branches were established across the country. While Blavatsky had emphasized its growth among the native Indian population rather than among the British elite, she moved into a comfortable bungalow in the elite Bombay suburb of Breach Candy, which she said was more accessible to Western visitors. Olcott had decided to establish the Buddhist Education Fund to combat the spread of the Christian faith in Ceylon and encourage pride and interest in Buddhism among the island&#x27;s Sinhalese population. Although Blavatsky initially opposed the idea, stating that the Masters would not approve, Olcott&#x27;s project proved a success, and she changed her opinion about it.
Blavatsky had been diagnosed with Bright&#x27;s disease and hoping the weather to be more conducive to her condition she took up the offer of the Society&#x27;s Madras Branch to move to their city. However, in November 1882 the Society purchased an estate in Adyar, which became their permanent headquarters; a few rooms were set aside for Blavatsky, who moved into them in December. She continued to tour the subcontinent, claiming that she then spent time in Sikkim and Tibet, where she visited her teacher&#x27;s ashram for several days. With her health deteriorating, she agreed to accompany Olcott on his trip to Britain, where he was planning to argue the case for Ceylonese Buddhism and sort out problems with the Society&#x27;s London Lodge.

Sailing to Marseille, France, in March 1883, she spent time in Nice with the founder of the Theosophical Society&#x27;s French branch, the Countess of Caithness (widow of James Sinclair, 14th Earl of Caithness), with whom she continued to Paris. In London, she appeared at the lodge&#x27;s meeting, where she sought to quell arguments between Sinnett on the one hand and Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland on the other. Unsatisfied, Kingsfordwhom Blavatsky thought &quot;an unbearable snobbish woman&quot;split from the Theosophical Society to form the Hermetic Society. In London, Blavatsky made contact with the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) through Frederic W. H. Myers. She complied with their request to undertake a study of her and the paranormal abilities that she claimed to possess, although wasn&#x27;t impressed by the organization and mockingly referred to it as the &quot;Spookical Research Society&quot;.

With Blavatsky in Europe, trouble broke out at the society&#x27;s Adyar headquarters in what became known as the Coulomb Affair. The society&#x27;s Board of Control had accused Emma Coulomb of misappropriating their funds for her own purposes, and asked her to leave their center. She and her husband refused, blackmailing the society with letters that they claimed were written by Blavatsky and which proved that her paranormal abilities were fraudulent. The society refused to pay them and expelled them from their premises, at which the couple turned to the Madras-based &quot;Christian College Magazine&quot;, who published an exposé of Blavatsky&#x27;s alleged fraudulence using the Coulombs&#x27; claims as a basis. The story attracted international attention and was picked up by London-based newspaper, &quot;The Times&quot;. In response, in November 1884 Blavatsky headed to Cairo, where she and Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater searched for negative information on Emma Coulomb, discovering stories of her alleged former history of extortion and criminality. Internally, the Society was greatly damaged by the Coulomb Affair, although it remained popular in India, as did Blavatsky herself.

=== Final years in Europe: 1885–1891 ===

Worsening health led Blavatsky to contemplate a return to the milder climate of Europe, and resigning her position as corresponding secretary of the society, she left India in March 1885. By 1885, the Theosophical Society had experienced rapid growth, with 121 lodges having been chartered across the world, 106 of which were located in India, Burma, and Ceylon. Initially, each lodge was chartered directly from the Adyar headquarters, with members making democratic decisions by vote. However, over the coming years the lodges were organized into national units with their own ruling councils, resulting in tensions between the different levels of administration.

Settling in Naples, Italy, in April 1885, she began living off of a small Society pension and continued working on her next book, &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. She then moved to Würzburg in the Kingdom of Bavaria, where she was visited by a Swedish Theosophist, the Countess Constance Wachtmeister, who became her constant companion throughout the rest of her life. In December 1885, the SPR published their report on Blavatsky and her alleged phenomena, authored by Richard Hodgson. In his report, Hodgson accused Blavatsky of being a spy for the Russian government, further accusing her of faking paranormal phenomena, largely on the basis of the Coulomb&#x27;s claims. The report caused much tension within the Society, with a number of Blavatsky&#x27;s followersamong them Babaji and Subba Rowdenouncing her and resigning from the organization on the basis of it.

Blavatsky wanted to sue her accusers, although Olcott advised against it, believing that the surrounding publicity would damage the Society. In private letters, Blavatsky expressed relief that the criticism was focused on her and that the identity of the Masters had not been publicly exposed. For decades after, Theosophists criticized Hodgson&#x27;s methodology, arguing that he set out to disprove and attack Blavatsky rather than conduct an unbiased analysis of her claims and abilities. In 1986 the SPR admitted this to be the case and retracted the findings of the report. However, Johnson has commented &quot;Theosophists have overinterpreted this as complete vindication, when in fact many questions raised by Hodgson remain unanswered.&quot;

In 1886, by which time she was using a wheelchair, Blavatsky moved to Ostend in Belgium, where she was visited by Theosophists from across Europe. Among them was the doctor William Ashton Ellis, who treated her during a near-fatal illness in March 1887; Blavatsky credited him with saving her life. Supplementing her pension, she established a small ink-producing business. She received messages from members of the Society&#x27;s London Lodge who were dissatisfied with Sinnett&#x27;s running of it; they believed that he was focusing on attaining upper-class support rather than encouraging the promotion of Theosophy throughout society, a criticism Blavatsky agreed with. She arrived in London in May 1887, initially staying in the Upper Norwood home of Theosophist Mabel Collins. In September, she moved into the Holland Park home of fellow Theosophists, Bertram Keightley and his nephew Archibald Keightley.

In London, she established the Blavatsky Lodge as a rival to that run by Sinnett, draining much of its membership. Lodge meetings were held at the Keightleys&#x27; house on Thursday nights, with Blavatsky also greeting many visitors there, among them the occultist and poet W. B. Yeats. In November 1889 she was visited by the Indian lawyer Mohandas Gandhi, who was studying the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; with the Knightleys. He became an associate member of Blavatsky&#x27;s Lodge in March 1891, and would emphasize the close connection between Theosophy and Hinduism throughout his life. In 1888, Blavatsky established the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society, a group under her complete control for which admittance was restricted to those who had passed certain tests. She identified it as a place for &quot;true Theosophists&quot; who would focus on the system&#x27;s philosophy rather than experiment with producing paranormal phenomena.

=== Publishing ===
In London, Blavatsky founded a magazine, controversially titling it &quot;Lucifer&quot;; in this Theosophical publication she sought to completely ignore claims regarding paranormal phenomena, and focus instead on a discussion of philosophical ideas. Blavatsky also finished writing &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, which was then edited by the Keightleys. As a commercial publisher willing to publish the approximately 1,500-page work could not be found, Blavatsky established the Theosophical Publishing Company, who brought out the work in two volumes, the first published in October 1888 and the second in January 1889. Blavatsky claimed that the book constituted her commentary on the &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot;, a religious text written in Senzar which she had been taught while studying in Tibet. Buddhologist David Reigle claimed that he identified &quot;Books of Kiu-te&quot;, including Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot; as a first volume, as the Tantra section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon. However, most scholars of Buddhism to have examined &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; have concluded that there was no such text as the &quot;Book of Dzyan&quot;, and that instead it was the fictional creation of Blavatsky&#x27;s. In the book, Blavatsky outlined her own cosmogonical ideas about how the universe, the planets, and the human species came to exist. She also discussed her views about the human being and their soul, thus dealing with issues surrounding an afterlife.

== Annie Besant ==
The two-volume book was reviewed for the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; by the social reformer Annie Besant; impressed by it, Besant met with Blavatsky and joined the Theosophists. In August 1890, Blavatsky moved in to Besant&#x27;s large house at 19 Avenue Road in St. John&#x27;s Wood.

She appointed Besant to be the new head of the Blavatsky Lodge, and in July 1890 inaugurated the new European headquarters of the Theosophical Society in Besant&#x27;s house. There, she authored a book containing questions and corresponding answers, &quot;The Key to Theosophy&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Voice of the Silence&quot;, a short devotional text which she claimed was based on a Senzar text known as &quot;The Book of the Golden Precepts&quot;. As with &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, most scholars of Buddhism have doubted that this latter text was an authentic Tibetan Buddhist document. She continued to face accusations of fraud; U.S. newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; published a July 1890 article based on information provided by an ex-member of the Society, Elliott Coues. Blavatsky sued the newspaper for libel, and they publicly retracted their accusations in September 1892.

== Death ==
That winter, Britain had been afflicted by an influenza epidemic (the global 1889–1890 flu pandemic), with Blavatsky contracting the virus. It led to her death on the afternoon of 8 May 1891, in Besant&#x27;s house. The date would come to be commemorated by Theosophists ever since as White Lotus Day. Her body was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 11 May.

== Personal life ==
The biographer Peter Washington described Blavatsky as &quot;a short, stout, forceful woman, with strong arms, several chins, unruly hair, a determined mouth, and large, liquid, slightly bulging eyes&quot;. She had distinctive azure-colored eyes, and was overweight throughout her life. According to the biographer Marion Meade, Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;general appearance was outrageously untidy&quot;. In later life, she was known for wearing loose robes, and wore many rings on her fingers. She was a heavy cigarette smoker throughout her life, and was known for smoking hashish at times. She lived simply and her followers believed that she refused to accept monetary payment in return for disseminating her teachings. Blavatsky preferred to be known by the initialism &quot;HPB&quot;, a sobriquet applied to her by many of her friends which was first developed by Olcott. She avoided social functions and was scornful of social obligations. She spoke Russian, Georgian, English, French, Italian, Arabic, and Sanskrit.

Meade referred to her as &quot;an eccentric who abided by no rules except her own&quot;, someone who had &quot;utter disregard for the Victorian code of morality&quot;. Meade believed that Blavatsky perceived herself as a messianic figure whose purpose was to save the world by promoting Theosophy. Lachman stated that Blavatsky exhibited what he referred to as &quot;Russian traitsan intense devotion to spiritual truth, combined with a profound contradictory character.&quot; Washington expressed the view that she was &quot;a persuasive story-teller power to fascinate others&quot; although noted that she was also &quot;self-absorbed and egotistical&quot;. For Meade, Blavatsky had a &quot;vivid imagination&quot; and a &quot;propensity for lying&quot;. Godwin noted that Blavatsky had &quot;a fearsome temper&quot;. The religious studies scholar Bruce F. Campbell noted that she had been a &quot;strong-willed, independent child&quot;, and that the harsh environment of her childhood might have resulted in her &quot;difficulty in controlling her temper and ... her tendency to swear&quot;. In his opinion, she represented &quot;an archetypal charismatic leader&quot;.
Anthropologist Leo Klejn claimed that Blavatsky&#x27;s indefatigability and energy were surprising. The Indologist Alexander Senkevich stated that Blavatsky&#x27;s charisma exerted influence on Charles Massey and Stainton Moses.

Blavatsky&#x27;s sexuality has been an issue of dispute; many biographers believed that she remained celibate throughout her life, with Washington believing that she &quot;hated sex with her own sort of passion&quot;. In later life she stated that she was a virgin, although she had been married to two men during her lifetime. Throughout its early years, the Theosophical Society promoted celibacy, even within marriage. Some have suggested that she may have been a lesbian or transvestite, due to early accounts in which she traveled while dressed in masculine attire. Meade thought that Blavatsky had, with a few exceptions, been &quot;contemptuous&quot; of other women, suggesting that while this may have been the result of general societal misogyny, it may have reflected that Blavatsky had been jilted by another woman.

=== Socio-political beliefs ===

Godwin suggested that Blavatsky&#x27;s life work was &quot;not only spiritual but socially idealistic and fiercely political&quot;. He suggested that her &quot;emotional fuel&quot; was partly &quot;a hatred of oppression&quot;, which Godwin claimed was either through the intellectual domination of Christianity or British colonial rule in India. Conversely, Meade thought Blavatsky to be &quot;basically a non-political person&quot;.

Blavatsky&#x27;s social and political beliefs, like much else in her life, are not always consistent, though reflect what she felt she could reveal of a larger vision. That was, more than anything else, the vision of the succession of root races. These races were a flexible category, cultural as well as physiological, with races often combining in the course of history. Moreover, inspired by recent acrimonious debates over evolution, they are also dynamic, emergent forces. Gary Lachman wrote, &quot;Although few historians have noted it, in Isis Unveiled (1877), Blavatsky presented the first major intellectual – not religious – criticism of evolution.&quot; {Lachman 2012, 159–60} Blavatsky held that Darwinism explained human physical evolution, while spirituality followed another developmental pattern.

The scholar of religion Olav Hammer noted that &quot;on rare occasions&quot; Blavatsky&#x27;s writings are &quot;overtly racist&quot;, adding that her antisemitism &quot;derives from the unfortunate position of Judaism as the origin of Christianity&quot; and refers to &quot;the intense dislike she felt for Christianity&quot;.

== Theories and doctrines ==

According to Meade, Blavatsky assembled her theories and doctrines gradually, in a piecemeal fashion. Blavatsky claimed that these Theosophical doctrines were not her own invention, but had been received from a brotherhood of secretive spiritual adepts whom she referred to as the &quot;Masters&quot; or &quot;Mahatmas&quot;.

=== Theosophy, the Masters, and the &quot;Ancient Wisdom&quot; ===

Blavatsky was the leading theoretician of the Theosophical Society, responsible for establishing its &quot;doctrinal basis&quot;. The ideas expounded in her published texts provide the basis from which the Society and wider Theosophical movement emerged. Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophical ideas were a form of &quot;occultism&quot;. She subscribed to the anti-Christian current of thought within Western esotericism which emphasized the idea of an ancient and universal &quot;occult science&quot; that should be revived. Blavatsky stated that the Theosophical teachings were passed on to her by adepts, who lived in various parts of the world.

Fundamentally, the underlying concept behind Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy was that there was an &quot;ancient wisdom religion&quot; which had once been found across the world, and which was known to various ancient figures, such as the Greek philosopher Plato and the ancient Hindu sages.
Blavatsky connected this ancient wisdom religion to Hermetic philosophy, a worldview in which everything in the universe is identified as an emanation from a Godhead. Blavatsky believed that all of the world&#x27;s religions developed from this original global faith.
Blavatsky understood her Theosophy to be the heir to the Neoplatonist philosophers of Late Antiquity, who had also embraced Hermetic philosophy. Blavatsky claimed that due to Christianization in Europe, this magical tradition was lost there, but it persisted in modified form in India and Africa, promoting a self-consciously magical disenchantment narrative. In turn, Blavatsky believed that the Theosophical movement&#x27;s revival of the &quot;ancient wisdom religion&quot; would lead to it spreading across the world, eclipsing the established world religions.
Thus, in bringing these Theosophical ideas to humanity, Blavatsky viewed herself as a messianic figure.

According to Goodrick-Clarke, the Theosophical Society &quot;disseminated an elaborate philosophical edifice involving a cosmogony, the macrocosm of the universe, spiritual hierarchies, and intermediary beings, the latter having correspondences with a hierarchical conception of the microcosm of man.&quot;
Officially, the Society-based itself upon the following three objectives:

# To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color.
# To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy, and Science.
# To investigate the unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man.

Washington believed that the purpose of these three precepts was to lead to the &quot;discovery of the powers latent in man through the occult study of science, philosophy and religion [which] shall be the preferred route to the social harmony and equality which will prefigureand perhaps becomethe divine harmony.&quot;

While living in New York City, Blavatsky had referred to herself as a &quot;Buddhist&quot;, although officially embraced Buddhism only while in Ceylon. However, Lachman stated that her Buddhism was &quot;highly eccentric and had little to do with the Buddhism of scholars like Müller or that of your average Buddhist&quot;. Blavatsky argued that The Buddha had sought to return to the teachings of the Vedas, and that Buddhism therefore represented a more accurate survival of ancient Brahmanism than modern Hinduism.
Although critical of Catholicism and Protestantism, and opposing their growth in Asia, throughout her life she remained highly sympathetic to the Russian Orthodox Church, commenting that &quot;with the faith of the Russian Church I will not even compare Buddhism&quot;.

G. R. S. Mead proclaimed, &quot;Two things in all the chaos of her cosmos stood firm in every moodthat her Teachers existed and that she had not cheated.&quot;

=== Theology, cosmogony, and the place of humanity ===

Blavatsky expounded what has been described as a &quot;monotheistic, immanentist, and mystical cosmology&quot;.
Blavatsky was a pantheist, and emphasized the idea of an impersonal divinity, referring to the Theosophical God as a &quot;universal Divine Principle, the root of All, from which all proceeds, and within which all shall be absorbed at the end of the great cycle of being&quot;. She was dismissive of the Christian idea of God in the Western world, describing it as &quot;a bundle of contradictions and a logical impossibility.&quot; She stated that the universe emanated from this Divine Principle, with each particle of matter being infused with a spark of the divine. Lower Orders emanated from higher ones, before becoming increasingly dense and being absorbed back into the Divine Principle.
This cosmology exhibited commonalities with the scientific discoveries of geology and biological evolution, both of which had been revealed by scientific inquiry during the 19th century.

In &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, Blavatsky articulated the belief that in the beginning of time there was absolute nothingness. This primordial essence then separated itself into seven Rays, which were also intelligent beings known as the Dhyan Chohans; these Seven Rays then created the universe using an energy called &quot;Fohat&quot;. The Earth was created and underwent seven Rounds, in each of which different living beings were created.

Blavatsky advocated the idea of &quot;Root Races&quot;, each of which was divided into seven Sub-Races.
In Blavatsky&#x27;s cosmogony, the first Root Race were created from pure spirit and lived on a continent known as the &quot;Imperishable Sacred Land&quot;. The second Root Race, known as the Hyperboreans, were also formed from pure spirit and lived on a land near to the North Pole, which then had a mild climate. The third lived on the continent of Lemuria, which Blavatsky alleged survives today as Australia and Rapa Nui. Blavatsky alleged that during the fourth Round of the Earth, higher beings descended to the planet, with the beginnings of human physical bodies developing and the sexes separating. At this point, the fourth Root Race appeared, living on the continent of Atlantis; they had physical bodies but also psychic powers and advanced technology. She claimed that some Atlanteans were giants and built such ancient monuments as Stonehenge in southern England and that they also mated with &quot;she-animals&quot;, resulting in the creation of gorillas and chimpanzees. The Atlanteans were decadent and abused their power and knowledge, so Atlantis sunk into the sea, although various Atlanteans escaped and created new societies in Egypt and the Americas.

The fifth Root Race to emerge was the Aryans and was found across the world at the time she was writing. She believed that the fifth Race would come to be replaced by the sixth, which would be heralded by the arrival of Maitreya, a figure from Mahayana Buddhist mythology. She further believed that humanity would eventually develop into the final, seventh Root Race.
Lachman suggested that by reading Blavatsky&#x27;s cosmogonical claims as a literal account of history, &quot;we may be doing it a disservice.&quot; He instead suggested that it could be read as Blavatsky&#x27;s attempt to formulate &quot;a new myth for the modern age, or as a huge, fantastic science fiction story&quot;.

Blavatsky taught that humans composed of three separate parts: a divine spark, an astral fluid body, and the physical body. Later Blavatsky proclaimed the septenary of Man and Universe. According to Blavatsky, man is composed of seven parts: Atma, Buddhi, Manas, Kama rupa, Linga sharira, Prana, and Sthula sharira. In &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;, Blavatsky denied that humans would be reincarnated back on the Earth after physical death. However, by the time that she had authored &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, she had changed her opinion on this issue, likely influenced by her time in India. Here, she stated that the law of reincarnation was governed by karma, with humanity&#x27;s final purpose being the emancipation of the soul from the cycle of death and rebirth. She believed that knowledge of karma would ensure that human beings lived according to moral principles, arguing that it provided a far greater basis for moral action than that of the Christian doctrine.
Blavatsky wrote, in &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;, that Spiritualism &quot;alone offers a possible last refuge of compromise between&quot; the &quot;revealed religions and materialistic philosophies&quot;. While she acknowledged that fanatic believers &quot;remained blind to its imperfections&quot;, she wrote that such a fact was &quot;no excuse to doubt its reality&quot; and asserted that Spiritualist fanaticism was &quot;itself a proof of the genuineness and possibility of their phenomena&quot;.

Goodrick-Clarke noted that Blavatsky&#x27;s cosmology contained all four of the prime characteristics of Western esotericism that had been identified by the scholar Antoine Faivre: &quot;(a) correspondences between all parts of the universe, the macrocosm and microcosm; (b) living nature as a complex, plural, hierarchical, and animate whole; (c) imagination and mediations in the form of intermediary spirits, symbols, and mandalas; and (d) the experience of transmutation of the soul through purification and ascent.&quot;

== Controversy ==

Various authors, including William Emmette Coleman and others, have questioned the authenticity of her writings by citing evidence that they are heavily plagiarized from older esoteric sources, pronouncing her claim of the existence of masters of wisdom to be utterly false, and accusing her of being a charlatan, false medium, and falsifier of letters. Eastern literature scholar Arthur Lillie published a list of extracts from mystic works next to extracts from Blavatsky&#x27;s writings purporting to show her extensive plagiarism in his book &quot;Madame Blavatsky and her Theosophy&quot;. Lillie also analyzed the Mahatma letters and asserted, based on peculiarities of expression and spelling, that they had been written by Blavatsky.

The Traditionalist School writer René Guénon wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy in which he claimed that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books rather than supernatural so-called &quot;masters&quot;. Carl Jung virulently criticized her work, and Agehananda Bharati dismissed it as &quot;a melee of horrendous hogwash and of fertile inventions of inane esoterica&quot;. Mircea Eliade suggested that her theory of spiritual evolution contradicts the entire spirit of Eastern tradition, which is &quot;precisely an anti-evolutionist conception of the spiritual life&quot;. After her death, Blavatsky continued to be accused of having fraudulently produced paranormal phenomena by skeptics such as John Nevil Maskelyne, Robert Todd Carroll, and James Randi.

Peter Washington notes that Blavatsky&#x27;s beliefs clashed with both Christianity and science, Darwinism in particular. Furthermore, Washington claims that Blavatsky&#x27;s supporters argued against any criticisms of her as slander by Christians and Darwinians, conceiving her as a martyr.

== Influence ==

According to religious studies scholar Mark Bevir, Blavatsky &quot;adapted the occult tradition to meet the challenge of Victorian science and morality&quot;.
Historian Ronald Hutton described Blavatsky as &quot;one of the century&#x27;s truly international figures&quot; whose ideas gained &quot;considerable popularity&quot;.
Various biographers have noted that, by the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Blavatsky was little-known among the general public. In 2006, scholar James A. Santucci nevertheless noted that she was &quot;as visible today as any modern trend-setting guru, and she will most likely remain the most memorable and innovative esotericist of the 19th century.&quot;

Some scholars have suggested that Blavatsky sometimes spoke and/or wrote while in altered states of consciousness. wrote about Blavatsky, &quot;I know no one who detested, more than she did, any attempt to hero-worship herselfshe positively physically shuddered at any expression of reverence to herselfas a spiritual teacher; I have heard her cry out in genuine alarm at an attempt to kneel to her made by an enthusiastic admirer.&quot; Leo Klejn wrote about Blavatsky: &quot;Indefatigability and energy of this woman were surprising. She had a revolutionary&#x27;s merits.&quot; Mabel Collins, an associate and publisher of &quot;Lucifer&quot; between 1887 and 1889, believed Blavatsky&#x27;s influence to be derived largely from a talent for manipulation. After leaving the Theosopical movement, Collins said that &quot;she taught me one great lesson. I learned from her how foolish, how &#x27;gullible&#x27;, how easily flattered human beings are, taken &quot;en masse&quot;. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom she thought to be her enemies, a greater disrespect for &quot;les convenances&quot;, a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings than I had ever supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not.&quot;

Blavatsky presented her book, &quot;The Voice of the Silence&quot;, to Leo Tolstoy. In his works, Tolstoy used the &quot;dicta&quot; from &quot;&quot;, a Theosophical journal. In his 12 February 1903, diary entry, Tolstoy wrote: &quot;I am reading a beautiful theosophical journal and find many commonalities with my understanding.&quot;

=== Theosophical movement ===

According to Kalnitsky, the Theosophical movement of the nineteenth century was created and defined in the main through the astuteness and conceptual ideas provided by H.P. Blavatsky. He stated that &quot;without her charismatic leadership and uncompromising promotion of the Theosophical agenda, it appears unlikely that the movement could have attained its unique form.&quot; By the time of her death in 1891 she was the acknowledged head of a community numbering nearly 100,000, with journalistic organs in London, Paris, New York and Madras. Her writings have been translated and published in a wide range of European and Asian languages.

Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy redirected the interest in Spiritualism toward a more coherent doctrine that included cosmology with theory of evolution in an understanding of humanity&#x27;s spiritual development. Further, it took the traditional sources of Western esotericism and globalized them by restating many of their ideas in terminology adopted from Asian religions. Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy was able to appeal to women by de-emphasizing the importance of gender and allowing them to take on spiritual leadership equal to that of men, thus allowing them a greater role than that permitted in traditional Christianity.

Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.
During the 1920s the Theosophical Society Adyar had around 7,000 members in the U.S. There also was a substantial following in Asia. According to a Theosophical source, the Indian section in 2008 was said to have around 13,000 members while in the US the 2008 membership was reported at around 3,900.

=== Western esotericism ===

Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy has been described as representing &quot;a major factor in the modern revival&quot; of Western esotericism. Godwin deemed there to be &quot;no more important figure in modern times&quot; within the Western esoteric tradition than Blavatsky. For Johnson, Blavatsky was &quot;a central figure in the nineteenth-century occult revival&quot;. Lachman claimed that &quot;practically all modern occultism and esotericism&quot; can trace its origins back to her influence. Blavatsky&#x27;s published Theosophical ideas, particularly those regarding Root Races, have been cited as an influence on Ariosophy, the esoteric movement established in late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany and Austria by Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels. Hannah Newman stated that via Ariosophy, Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophical ideas &quot;contributed to Nazi ideology&quot;. Nevertheless, Lachman has asserted that Blavatsky should not be held accountable to any of the antisemitic and racist ideas that the Ariosophists promoted, commenting that were she alive to witness the development of Ariosophy she probably would have denounced its ideas regarding race. Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophical ideas regarding Root Races have also been cited as an influence on Anthroposophy, the esoteric movement developed by Rudolf Steiner in early 20th-century Germany, with Steiner&#x27;s Anthroposophical Society being termed a &quot;historical offshoot&quot; of the Theosophical Society.

Blavatsky&#x27;s Theosophy has been cited as an influence on the New Age Movement, an esoteric current that emerged in Western nations during the 1970s.
&quot;No single organization or movement has contributed so many components to the New Age Movement as the Theosophical Society. ... It has been the major force in the dissemination of occult literature in the West in the twentieth century.&quot;
Other organizations loosely based on Theosophical texts and doctrines include the Agni Yoga, and a group of religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings: the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, Universal Medicine and The Summit Lighthouse, which evolved into the Church Universal and Triumphant.

=== Linguistics ===
American scholar of religion Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Blavatsky and her Theosophical Society influenced late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century academic linguistics. Josephson-Storm notes that Blavatsky&#x27;s linguistic theories and typologies were widely circulated in Europe, and that influential linguists such as Émile-Louis Burnouf and Benjamin Lee Whorf either practiced Theosophy as promoted by the Theosophical Society or publicly defended its doctrines. Ferdinand de Saussure is also known to have attended séances and wrote a lengthy analysis of the Theosophical claims about linguistics and India, &quot;la théosophie brahmanique (Brahamanic Theosophy)&quot; while delivering his Cours de linguistique générale.

=== South Asian religion and politics ===

Hutton suggested that Blavatsky had a greater impact in Asia than in the Western world. Blavatsky has been cited as having inspired Hindus to respect their own religious roots.
The Theosophical Society influenced the growth of Indian national consciousness, with prominent figures in the Indian independence movement, among them Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, being inspired by Theosophy to study their own national heritage.
The Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism and Hindu reform movements, while Blavatsky and Olcott took part in Anagarika Dharmapala&#x27;s revival of Theravada Buddhism in Ceylon.

Meade stated that &quot;more than any other single individual&quot;, Blavatsky was responsible for bringing a knowledge of Eastern religion and philosophy to the West. Blavatsky believed that Indian religion offered answers to problems then facing Westerners; in particular, she believed that Indian religion contained an evolutionary cosmology which complemented Darwinian evolutionary theory, and that the Indian doctrine of reincarnation met many of the moral qualms surrounding vicarious atonement and eternal damnation that preoccupied 19th-century Westerners.
In doing so, Meade believed that Blavatsky paved the way for the emergence of later movements such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Transcendental Meditation movement, Zen Buddhism, and yoga in the West. Hutton believed that the two greatest achievements of Blavatsky&#x27;s movement were in popularizing belief in reincarnation and in a singular divine world soul within the West.

Blavatsky &quot;both incorporated a number of the doctrines of eastern religions into her occultism, and interpreted eastern religions in the light of her occultism&quot;, in doing so extending a view of the &quot;mystical East&quot; that had already been popularized through Romanticist poetry.
Max Müller scathingly criticized Blavatsky&#x27;s Esoteric Buddhism. Whilst he was willing to give her credit for good motives, at least at the beginning of her career, in his view she ceased to be truthful both to herself and to others with her later &quot;hysterical writings and performances&quot;. There is a nothing esoteric or secretive in Buddhism, he wrote, in fact the very opposite. &quot;Whatever was esoteric was &quot;ipso facto&quot; not Buddha&#x27;s teaching; whatever was Buddha&#x27;s teaching was &quot;ipso facto&quot; not esoteric&quot;. Blavatsky, it seemed to Müller, &quot;was either deceived by others or carried away by her own imaginations.&quot;
Blavatsky responded to those academic specialists in Indian religion who accused her of misrepresenting it by claiming that they understood only the exoteric nature of Hinduism and Buddhism and not the inner esoteric secrets of these faiths, which she traced back to the ancient Vedas.
