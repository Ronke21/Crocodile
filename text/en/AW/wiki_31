<text>The Beatles&#x27; bootleg recordings (also known as Beatlegs) are recordings of performances by the Beatles that have attained some level of public circulation without being available as a legal release. The term most often refers to audio recordings, but also includes video performances. Starting with vinyl releases in the 1970s, through CD issues in the late 1980s, and continuing with digital downloads starting in the mid-1990s, the Beatles have been, and continue to be, among the most bootlegged artists.

Bootleg recordings arise from a multitude of sources, including radio and TV broadcast performances, live shows, studio outtakes and session tapes, alternate mixes, test discs, and home demos. The largest single source of Beatles bootleg material is the set of Nagra audio tapes from the 1969 filming of the &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; rehearsal and recording sessions.

==Historical overview==
The 1970s saw the first Beatle bootlegs issued on vinyl records. The first Beatles bootleg was &quot;Kum Back&quot;, issued around January 1970 in a plain white sleeve with plain white labels and no mention of a record company. This vinyl bootleg was based on an acetate of one of the early rough mixes by Glyn Johns of the &quot;Get Back&quot; album (which would later become &quot;Let It Be&quot;). John Lennon may have been the unintentional source for one of the &quot;Get Back&quot; bootlegs; Lennon said: &quot;They say it came from an acetate that I gave to someone who then went and broadcast it as being an advance pressing or something.&quot;

Other notable bootlegs to appear in the early 1970s were &quot;Yellow Matter Custard&quot;, containing 14 BBC Radio performances from 1963, (originally these tracks were thought to be from the Decca audition of January 1962, and Lennon himself told McCartney about the album) and &quot;Sweet Apple Trax&quot;, a two-volume four-disc collection of songs and jams from the &quot;Get Back&quot; rehearsal sessions first issued in 1974. In 1977, a copy of the Beatles&#x27; Decca audition tape was bought by a collector, who released the songs over a series of seven 45 rpm singles pressed on coloured vinyl with full colour picture sleeves. Bootleggers of this era often copied and repackaged each other&#x27;s releases, so popular titles often appeared from more than one bootleg label. The biggest labels for Beatles material in the 1970s were Kornyfone (TAKRL), ContraBand, Trademark of Quality and Wizardo.

EMI had planned to release an album of alternate takes and previously unreleased songs by the Beatles in 1985 called &quot;Sessions&quot;, but the Beatles objected after it had been compiled; by the end of the year, bootleg copies were widely available. During the cataloguing and review of the EMI archives in the early 1980s in preparation for the &quot;Sessions&quot; album and a multimedia show given at Abbey Road Studios, it is suspected that high quality copies of some of the material were surreptitiously made. This may have been the source for the &quot;Ultra Rare Trax&quot; CD series from Swingin&#x27; Pig that started appearing in 1988, which provided takes never previously bootlegged in clarity that rivalled official releases.

The late 1980s also saw the emergence of Yellow Dog, a label specialising in Beatles studio outtakes, who released the CD series &quot;Unsurpassed Masters&quot; in quality similar to &quot;Ultra Rare Trax&quot;; Yellow Dog, like Swingin&#x27; Pig&#x27;s parent company Perfect Beat, was registered in Luxembourg, which had the most liberal copyright laws among EU countries. Yellow Dog released &quot;Unsurpassed Demos&quot; in 1991, featuring 22 songs from the 1968 Kinfauns (Esher) demos, only some of which had been previously made public during the radio series &quot;The Lost Lennon Tapes&quot; that debuted in 1988.

In 1993, a nine CD box set of the Beatles&#x27; BBC radio performances was released in Italy by Great Dane. The official &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; and &quot;Anthology&quot; releases in 1994–1996 covered much of the highlights of previously bootlegged material, in sound quality that most bootlegs could not match. However, new bootlegs continued to appear, with bootleggers including the word &quot;anthology&quot; in the title of many of their collections. Starting in 1999, Silent Sea issued a series of CD-Rs, featuring recompiled studio outtakes with commercial-quality packaging and liner notes. In 2000, the Vigotone label followed up their earlier eight-CD package of &quot;Get Back&quot; session recordings with a seventeen-CD collection called &quot;Thirty Days&quot;. In the early 2000s, the DVD format enhanced the availability of Beatles bootleg videos, covering filmed concerts, TV appearances, promotional films, and even rare clips and outtakes. The six-volume &quot;The Lost Album&quot; series, published between 2017 and 2021, was an attempt to bring together almost all of the Beatles&#x27; unpublished or never officially released recordings.

The availability of high-speed Internet has transformed the bootlegging industry. The Purple Chick label has assembled and digitally fine-tuned many comprehensive themed packages, including individual studio album sessions, the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, and the BBC performances, all distributed free through various fan trading sites online. Author Richie Unterberger noted that it is &quot;now theoretically possible to assemble a complete collection of the circulating unreleased Beatles recordings without ever buying a bootleg.&quot;

==Commonly bootlegged material==
Several books have been devoted to comprehensively documenting Beatles bootlegs; the following is a list of some of the most common or notable bootlegged recordings by the Beatles.

===The Quarrymen / Silver Beatles era (1957–1960)===
Other than the commercially released songs with Tony Sheridan issued on &quot;In the Beginning (Circa 1960)&quot;, only three recordings made by the group prior to 1962 have become public.

* The Quarrymen show, 6 July 1957. The Quarrymen played a show for the Woolton fête at St Peter&#x27;s Parish Church, notable as the day that Paul McCartney was first introduced to Lennon by a mutual friend, Ivan Vaughan. In 1994, Bob Molyneux, a retired policeman, rediscovered a reel-to-reel tape he had made of the show while experimenting with a Grundig portable tape recorder. The tape contained a poor quality recording of the Quarrymen performances of Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Style&quot; and Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;. A thirty-second excerpt of &quot;Putting on the Style&quot; was released to promote the tape&#x27;s auction at Sotheby&#x27;s later that year; the tape was bought by EMI for £78,500, becoming the most expensive recording ever sold at auction. EMI decided the recording was not of sufficient quality to include in &quot;Anthology&quot;. After extensive audio restoration, excerpts from both songs were included in the BBC radio documentary &quot;The Day John Met Paul&quot;, broadcast on 26 June 2007.
* The Quarrymen acetate, 1958. on 12 July 1958, The Quarrymen paid to record themselves at Phillips&#x27; Sound Recording Services in Liverpool, performing &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; and &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot;. These were included on &quot;Anthology 1&quot;, although the latter song was edited.
* Home rehearsals, 1960. More than one hour of the band&#x27;s home rehearsals from 1960 have appeared on bootlegs, although the recording&#x27;s date and location are uncertain. McCartney once said that it was taped at his home in April 1960; the recording may also originate from two separate sessions a few months apart. Three of the songs were included on &quot;Anthology 1&quot;. The recording also featured early versions of songs that the Beatles would later record in the studio (&quot;Matchbox&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow the Sun&quot;). Other songs that were recorded during these rehearsals include &quot;Well, Darlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s When Your Heartaches Begin&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Some Days&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;, &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;, &quot;You Must Write Every Day&quot;, &quot;Movin&#x27; and Groovin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Ramrod&quot;.

A collection of all these recordings were released on the bootleg recording &quot;Lapis Lazuli&quot;, featuring a longer version of &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Style&quot; and all of the Beatles home recordings made in early 1960.

===Decca audition (1962)===

The Beatles performed fifteen songs that were recorded at their audition for Decca Records on 1 January 1962 (three Lennon–McCartney compositions and twelve cover versions). Five of these songs were included on &quot;Anthology 1&quot;.

Fourteen of the fifteen tracks appeared on a series of coloured vinyl singles with picture sleeves, released in 1978 on the Deccagone label through &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, Joe Pope&#x27;s fanzine. The following year, all fifteen tracks appeared on the Circuit Records bootleg album &quot;The Decca Tapes&quot;.

Due to the questionable copyright status of these performances (recorded prior to the group&#x27;s EMI contract), the Decca audition was commercially distributed in various configurations starting in 1981; some of these &quot;grey market&quot; albums omitted the three Lennon–McCartney songs. By the late 1980s, legal action by the Beatles had halted commercial availability of the albums. In addition to continued inclusion on bootlegs, a small US record label issued the songs on CD through mail order in 2007 as &quot;The Lost Decca Sessions&quot;, which it described as legal and licensed.

===Cavern Club rehearsals and TV shoot (1962)===
Sometime between August and December 1962, the Beatles recorded themselves rehearsing at the Cavern Club, performing &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot; (two versions), and &quot;Catswalk&quot; (two versions).

On 22 August 1962, a crew from Granada Television shot footage of the band performing live at the Cavern for use in the television show &quot;Scene at 6:30&quot;; the crew filmed two takes of the band performing &quot;Some Other Guy.&quot; The following month, on 5 September, a Granada sound crew returned to capture better audio of the band to sync to the film footage, as they felt the audio from the original shoot was not of satisfactory quality. A new recording of &quot;Some Other Guy&quot; and a recording of &quot;Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!&quot; come from this performance. The shoot constitutes the earliest professional film footage of the Beatles, and would have been the Beatles&#x27; first appearance on television, but the footage was shelved for over a year, and was first broadcast after the Beatles had achieved nationwide success. Instead, Grenada booked the group for a live, in-studio performance on 17 October 1962. The Cavern footage has been seen on &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; and other documentary sources, and audio from both dates have circulated amongst bootleggers.

===Star-Club performances (1962)===

As the Beatles were concluding their final two-week Hamburg engagement in late December 1962, portions of their performances were taped by Star-Club stage manager Adrian Barber; the tapes were acquired by Ted &quot;Kingsize&quot; Taylor, the leader of KingsizeTaylor and The Dominoes at the club. Eventually Taylor sold the tapes, which formed the basis of the double album &quot;Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962&quot;, released in 1977 by Lingasong Records.

The liner notes for the initial release falsely implied that the recordings had been made in the spring of 1962, prior to the Beatles&#x27; EMI contract, on a night when Ringo Starr happened to be sitting in for Pete Best. In commentary for a lawsuit to block the album&#x27;s release, John Lennon wrote, &quot;the sleeve note, apart from being inaccurate, seems to have been written with a court case in mind.&quot; The Beatles lost their case, so the album was viewed as a legitimate release. The thirty songs contained on the initial releases were re-licensed over the following two decades to multiple record labels, most notably Sony Music, which packaged the songs in CD form in 1991 (although the product was withdrawn the following year as legal action was pending from the Beatles). After another lawsuit by the Beatles, Lingasong agreed in 1998 to hand over the original tapes and stop all sales.

Compared with a properly recorded live concert, the sound quality of the tape is poor, with the vocals in particular sounding &quot;muffled and distant&quot; at best. But for a recording made with 1 mic from the audience with a home-use reel-to-reel, the quality is very good. The Beatles display a rawness that matches the raucous Hamburg atmosphere. While the Beatles would later record many of the thirty songs in the studio or perform them for the BBC, nine of the songs would never be officially released in another version.

Additional material from the Star-Club tapes has been bootlegged, including &quot;Road Runner&quot;, &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; (with Tony Sheridan singing lead), and a full version of &quot;Red Hot&quot;, and alternate performances of several songs.

===The BBC sessions (1962–1965)===

The Beatles performed for fifty-two BBC Radio programmes, beginning with an appearance on the series &quot;Teenager&#x27;s Turn—Here We Go&quot;, recorded on 7 March 1962, and ending with the special &quot;The Beatles Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride&quot;, recorded on 26 May 1965; in total, 275 performances of 88 different songs were broadcast. Early bootlegs of some of the performances were based on low-quality home recordings of the broadcasts from the radio. It was not the BBC&#x27;s practice to archive either the session tapes or the shows&#x27; master tapes, but many good quality distribution copies were found in various BBC departments during research for BBC radio specials produced in the 1980s.

Increasingly comprehensive collections of the BBC performances were bootlegged in the 1980s and early 1990s. The most notable of these was &quot;The Complete BBC Sessions&quot;, a nine CD box set released in 1993 by Great Dane in Italy, where copyright protection for the broadcasts had expired; The widespread availability of good quality bootlegs prompted Apple&#x27;s own release of BBC performances in 1994, the two CD set &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;. The set included 30 of the 36 songs that the Beatles never performed on their studio albums, plus 26 other songs and dialogue among the group members and the radio hosts. In 1999, a 10-CD box set &quot;The Complete BBC Sessions 1962-1966&quot; was released in Japan by Secret Trax which was soon followed by 3-CD set &quot;Attack of the Filler BEEBS&quot;! on the same label featuring additions to the box set.

Starting in the 2000s, the popularity of digital downloads through BitTorrent made it possible to replace physical media with virtual box sets of BBC material provided by fans for fans made available free of charge. In 2004, Purple Chick released &quot;The Complete BBC Sessions Upgraded&quot; as a digital set of ten audio CDs plus one multimedia CD. In 2010, Hobnail released a virtual 13 disc release &quot;Unsurpassed Broadcasts&quot;. 2015 saw the release of &quot;The BBC Archives&quot;, by an anonymous source. This set of 23 virtual CDs and one virtual DVD contains all of the available BBC material in the best quality, as well as some previously unreleased radio shows and upgraded material.

===Studio outtakes and alternate mixes (1962–1970)===
A large number of Beatles studio outtakes are available on bootlegs, ranging from complete session tapes—for example, the morning sessions for the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album—to more fragmentary samplings, or alternate mixes and performances derived from acetates. The first studio outtake to appear on bootleg was the white album outtake &quot;What&#x27;s The New Mary Jane&quot; in 1972, which fell into the hands of bootleggers via an acetate that Lennon had traded to a friend. In 1977, rough mixes from acetates of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; appeared on bootlegs after being played on a Radio Luxembourg broadcast.

After the Beatles&#x27; EMI contract expired in 1976, the company began assessing the band&#x27;s unreleased material for a future release. The first batch of songs to leak came from an in-house compilation cassette that contained &quot;Leave My Kitten Alone&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot; (from 1963), &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got Trouble&quot;, &quot;Christmas Time (Is Here Again)&quot;, &quot;That Means a Lot&quot;, &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; (unedited version), and two medleys from the &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions: &quot;Rip It Up / Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; and &quot;Not Fade Away / Bo Diddley&quot;.

In 1981, in-house engineer John Barrett was given the task of cataloguing the complete collection of tapes from the band&#x27;s seven-year career with EMI. This led to two projects: a public audio-visual presentation at Abbey Road Studios called &quot;The Beatles Live at Abbey Road&quot; (which opened on 18 July 1983) and a planned outtakes album which was to be called &quot;Sessions&quot;. In addition to some of the songs included on the previously leaked compilation tape, &quot;Sessions&quot; added &quot;Not Guilty&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot;, &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;, &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot;, &quot;Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (demo), and early takes of &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;. Shortly before the album&#x27;s scheduled 1985 release, it was vetoed by the surviving members of the band; but both audience recordings of the Abbey Road presentation and the leaked promos of &quot;Sessions&quot; became available to bootleggers. These songs appeared on bootleg series such as &quot;Ultra-Rare Trax&quot; and &quot;Unsurpassed Masters&quot;, along with other material presumably copied while preparing these projects. Most of the aforementioned tracks were officially released on the &quot;Anthology&quot; albums in 1995 and 1996.

New Beatles studio outtakes continue to occasionally appear; in February 2009, a complete 10:46 recording of “Revolution 1 (Take 20)” from &quot;The Beatles&quot; sessions was released on the bootleg &quot;Revolution: Take... Your Knickers Off!&quot;. This version begins with Lennon jokingly counting that way.

===Live concerts (1963–1966)===
Many of the Beatles&#x27; concert performances have appeared on bootleg albums. The earliest relatively complete concert recording is from the 7 December 1963 show at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; contained video clips from several concerts, some of which are available in complete form on bootleg video. The following are some of the most notable concerts on bootleg releases.

* Washington Coliseum, 1964. The Beatles&#x27; first US concert, on 11 February 1964 in Washington, D.C., was captured on black-and-white video for later closed-circuit presentations in cinemas. Some of the video was included in &quot;Anthology&quot; and in &quot;The Beatles: The First US Visit&quot;, and most of it was included in the 2003 DVD &quot;The Beatles in Washington D.C.&quot; from Passport Video. The entire video was released on the grey market DVD &quot;Beatles Around the World&quot;. All video releases suffer from &quot;dark, grainy, and flickery&quot; image quality; a report of a 2005 auction of the original master tape gives the possibility of a better quality release in the future. In 2010 the Beatles at last came to iTunes and along with their back catalogue they brought with them a video of this show. The video was made available with the purchase of the iTunes version of &quot;The Beatles Stereo Box Set&quot; simply called &quot;The Beatles Box Set&quot; where all albums were released as iTunes LP&#x27;s featuring on-screen album artwork and the Mini Documentaries from the DVD in the physical release.
* Hollywood Bowl, 1964 and 1965. &quot;The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, an official release by EMI in 1977, contained selections from the Beatles&#x27; three Hollywood Bowl shows professionally recorded in August 1964 and August 1965. An authorized CD of the remixed 1977 album with 4 bonus tracks was released in September 2016. Bootleg needle drop copies are available, as well as bootleg compilations of the three performances in their entirety.
* Palais des Sports, 1965. The Beatles performed two shows on 20 June 1965 at the Palais des Sports in Paris. Both were broadcast over French radio, resulting in bootleg recordings of decent quality; video of the second show also exists.
* Shea Stadium, 1965. The Beatles&#x27; concert at Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 was filmed for a television special, &quot;The Beatles at Shea Stadium&quot;. The programme and its soundtrack have been bootlegged in various formats. One song, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Trying to Be My Baby&quot;, was officially released on &quot;Anthology 2&quot;. A thirty-minute reissue of the footage of the concert was remastered and issued simultaneously with the release of the Ron Howard film &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days a Week&quot; on 15 September 2016.
* Budokan, 1966. The Beatles performed for three days at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo beginning 30 June 1966, with the first two concerts (30 June 1966 and the afternoon show on 1 July) filmed in colour for Japanese television. The first night&#x27;s concert video was officially released by Apple in Japan only as &quot;Beatles Concert at Budokan 1966&quot;. Excerpts from both shows (along with silent colour footage of the first show on 2 July) were included in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;.
* Candlestick Park, 1966. Notable as the Beatles&#x27; final paid concert performance, the 29 August 1966 show at Candlestick Park in San Francisco was taped by press officer Tony Barrow on a portable recorder at the request of McCartney; the tape ran out before the last few minutes of the show.

===Television performances (1963–1968)===
The Beatles performed on various television programmes; excerpts from many of these were shown in the &quot;Anthology&quot; documentary, and bootleg video exists of many of the shows in their entirety. The most famous of these were the four appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964 and 1965; after many years circulating on bootlegs, these received official DVD release in 2003 as &quot;The Four Complete Historic Ed Sullivan Shows Featuring The Beatles&quot;.

Other notable television performances that have appeared on bootleg video include the Swedish show &quot;Drop In&quot; from October 1963 (four songs); the April 1964 UK special &quot;Around the Beatles&quot; (six songs mimed to new recordings); the June 1964 Australian special &quot;The Beatles Sing for Shell&quot; (seven songs survived in complete form, plus fragments of two others); and a September 1968 appearance on &quot;Frost on Sunday&quot; (new vocals for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; over studio backing tracks, plus brief improvisations), for which multiple takes are available.

===Home demos (1963–1969)===
The individual Beatles sometimes recorded basic performances at home of their new compositions, either for copyright purposes (to be sent to Dick James Music publishing affiliate Northern Songs), to later play for the other Beatles, or to give to other artists who would be recording the songs.

Many of Lennon&#x27;s demos that appeared on bootlegs were first heard on the radio series &quot;The Lost Lennon Tapes&quot;. Some of the Lennon demos available include &quot;Bad to Me&quot; (1963, given to Billy J. Kramer), &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; (1963, given to The Fourmost [although some scholars date this as a late seventies piano rendition]), &quot;If I Fell&quot; (1964), and &quot;Everyone Had A Hard Year&quot; (1968, later incorporated into &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;). There are also Lennon demos available of songs that would develop into &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, and two songs he would later record after the Beatles, &quot;Oh My Love&quot; and &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s home recordings of &quot;Bad to Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; were briefly released on iTunes in December 2013 in order to extend the copyright terms of the tracks.

McCartney&#x27;s demos include &quot;One and One Is Two&quot; (1964, eventually an uncharted single for The Strangers with Mike Shannon), &quot;Step Inside Love&quot; (1968, given to Cilla Black), &quot;Spiritual Regeneration Song&quot; from India, &quot;Goodbye&quot; (1969, given to Mary Hopkin), &quot;Come and Get it&quot; (1969, given to Badfinger), and early versions of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; (partially taped over by Lennon) and &quot;Michelle&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s 1963 demo for &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot; has also been bootlegged.

===Christmas recordings (1963–1969)===

Every year from 1963 through to 1969, the Beatles recorded a flexi disc of comedy and music that was sent to members of their fan club. In 1970, these recordings were compiled onto an LP released via their fan club called &quot;From Then to You&quot; (US title: &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Christmas Album&quot;). Since these singles or compilation album had no official general-public release prior to 2017, all have been frequently bootlegged, some with additional outtakes from Christmas recording sessions, and some supplemented with Christmas themed BBC recordings. A portion of one song recorded for the 1967 Christmas flexi disc, &quot;Christmas Time (Is Here Again)&quot;, was officially released as an additional track on the 1995 &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; single. Part of the 1963 track is featured as an unlockable special feature on &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot;. In 2017, Apple released &quot;The Christmas Records&quot; as a box set of seven 7&quot; 45 rpm records pressed on coloured vinyl in replica sleeves.

===&quot;The Beatles&quot; (Esher) demos (1968)===
In May 1968, the Beatles met at Kinfauns, the Esher home of George Harrison, to review and record demos of songs under consideration for their next album; 27 songs, mostly acoustic, have become public from this session. Seven of these songs were released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, including &quot;Junk&quot;, a song McCartney would later record for his first solo album. Of the 20 demo songs not officially released, 15 would be recorded and released on &quot;The Beatles&quot;, while &quot;Not Guilty&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot; would be recorded for the album but not make the final line-up. The recordings included on the Anthology series were of a significantly higher fidelity (they came from George&#x27;s original stereo reels of the demo sessions, and processed at Abbey Road Studios) than the bootlegged recordings (which probably came from John&#x27;s mono copy of the tapes), raising the possibility that there were higher-quality versions of all 27 songs. In 2018, all 27 original Esher demos were released in high-quality as part of the deluxe 50th Anniversary reissue of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, taken from Harrison&#x27;s original 4-track master tapes. Giles Martin described the tapes as: &quot;To me, it is like the Beatles unplugged. These are demos but they are good: they double-tracked themselves&quot;.

Three additional songs would never be recorded in the studio by the Beatles:
* &quot;Child of Nature&quot;, later released by Lennon, with different lyrics, as &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; on &quot;Imagine&quot;.
* &quot;Circles&quot;, released by Harrison on his 1982 album &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;.
* &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;, a Harrison song given to Jackie Lomax and released in August 1968 as one of the first Apple Records singles.
Also not the same version from bootlegs.

===&quot;Get Back / Let It Be&quot; sessions (1969)===

In January 1969, the Beatles got together with director Michael Lindsay-Hogg to film the rehearsals for the group&#x27;s proposed first live concert since 1966. This project would concentrate on new material, and was intended to form the basis for both a television documentary and a new album, which were given the title of &quot;Get Back&quot;. But disagreements and a general lack of enthusiasm within the group led to much of the project never being fully completed. However, a one-off live performance was filmed and recorded on the rooftop of Apple Records on 30 January 1969, and the title song &quot;Get Back&quot; was released as a single in April 1969. After essentially being abandoned by the Beatles for more than a year, the project was eventually renamed and released in May 1970; with the film footage now becoming a feature film, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and the new songs becoming an album of the same name.

The rehearsals and recordings took place at Twickenham Film Studios (2–16 January) and then at Apple (20–31 January), with more than one hundred hours captured on film and the corresponding Nagra tape recorders used for the film&#x27;s audio track. These Nagra tapes are the source for most, but not all, of the bootlegs from these sessions. In addition to songs that would later be released by the group, the Beatles played hundreds of cover versions and original compositions. However, many of the performances were brief (some lasting less than ten seconds), and many of the original compositions are undeveloped ideas or improvisations that have been described as the audio equivalent of doodling. A sampling of the rehearsals was officially issued as a bonus disc with &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;.

Among the more complete rehearsed songs that have been featured on bootlegs are &quot;Watching Rainbows&quot;, &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, Suzy&#x27;s Parlour (published under the name Suzy Parker), and &quot;The Palace of the King of the Birds&quot; (later recorded but not released by McCartney as &quot;Castle of the King of the Birds&quot;); &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, &quot;Let It Down&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot; and &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;, later released by Harrison; &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; and &quot;Oh My Love&quot;, later released by Lennon; and &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; and &quot;Hot as Sun&quot;, later released by McCartney.

Portions of the rooftop concert were seen in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film and the &quot;Anthology&quot; documentary, and three tracks were used for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, while the complete recording has been bootlegged. The performance consisted of a short take of &quot;Get Back&quot; played as part of the preliminary sound check, &quot;Get Back&quot; (first and second versions), &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot;, &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (a brief version played while the audio tape reel was changed), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; (second version), &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; (second version), and &quot;Get Back&quot; (third version).

On 30 January 1969, Glyn Johns compiled some performances he had been mixing, and made acetate copies for the Beatles. In addition to songs that would eventually appear on &quot;Let It Be&quot;, this set included &quot;Teddy Boy&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot;, by Jimmy McCracklin, and a rock and roll medley that included songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, an early Fats Domino song, and &quot;Shake Rattle and Roll&quot;, by Big Joe Turner. This was the first version that leaked out and broadcast on multiple radio stations starting in September 1969, and formed the basis for the bootleg &quot;Kum Back&quot; that appeared near the end of 1969. Johns started working in earnest on compiling an album in March 1969, and a test acetate from this period eventually surfaced on a poor quality bootleg called &quot;O.P.D&quot;..

Johns later made two &quot;official&quot; attempts at compiling the &quot;Get Back&quot; album, with both versions widely bootlegged. The 28 May 1969 compilation by Johns contained the following line-up: &quot;One After 909&quot;, &quot;Rocker&quot;, &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;For You Blue&quot;, &quot;Teddy Boy&quot;, &quot;Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, &quot;Dig It&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, and &quot;Get Back (Reprise)&quot;. The main changes made for the 5 January 1970 compilation were the removal of &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; and the additions of &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.

One of the myriad &quot;Get Back&quot; session compilation bootlegs was &quot;The Black Album&quot;, a three-LP set from the 1980s in a memorable package (although the material has since been bootlegged in superior sound quality). In the early 2000s, Yellow Dog Records created &quot;Day by Day&quot;, a 38-part CD series containing almost all of the &quot;Camera A&quot; Nagra tape recordings, with improved audio quality compared to earlier releases.
Around the same time, the bootleg label &quot;Unicorn&quot; started releasing the &quot;Camera B&quot; tapes, in other smaller CD series, such as &quot;Twelve Days at Twickenham&quot;. In January 2003, nearly 500 (with 40 still missing as of December 2022) of the original Nagra tapes were recovered by police in England and the Netherlands, with five people arrested.

Even after the raid, bootlegging of the material continued. In 2004, the Purple Chick label released &quot;A/B Road&quot;, an 81-CD set compiling all of the Nagra material leaked by that time (albeit with a few flaws), and by 2008, every available Nagra tape recording was shared in one way or another.

===Studio album needle drops===

Starting in 1987, Apple began officially reissuing the Beatles catalogue on CD. However, as digital remastering was still in its infancy, many fans and audiophiles were disappointed with the sound quality of the official reissues, preferring the &quot;warmth&quot; of the vinyl releases. Many fans also clamoured for the digital release of the original Beatles Capitol albums as they contained many unique mixes different from the UK releases. Several bootleggers stepped in to fill this void by offering digital copies of their own needle drops of the entire Beatles catalogue, typically using premium vinyl pressings played and digitised with high-end audio equipment. While these unauthorized copies are not bootlegs as commonly defined, their creation and distribution channels overlap with bootleg products.

Some of the widely distributed collections are the &quot;BEAT/Red Robin&quot;, &quot;Dr. Ebbetts&quot;, and &quot;Millennium Remasters&quot; series and the Beatles&#x27; remasters on &quot;DLH Records.&quot; The official remastering of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue in stereo and mono, released by Apple in September 2009 on both CD and vinyl, has largely made these bootleg remasters obsolete; however, collectors in search of authentic original (and in some cases unique) mixes still find them of historical interest. The Beatles&#x27; official catalogue of their original stereo studio albums has since been issued via digital download through iTunes.

==Material not bootlegged==
A considerable amount of additional never-circulated Beatles material is believed to exist, either in private possession or studio vaults, as mentioned in documents and recollections.

From the group&#x27;s early years, it has been reported that additional songs exist from the 1960 Quarrymen rehearsal tapes, including a Lennon–McCartney instrumental &quot;Winston&#x27;s Walk&quot; and early versions of &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot;. Another recording of considerable interest is a tape of 18 songs from a Beatles show in mid-1962 at the Cavern Club, recorded from the audience. The tape includes several cover versions of songs not available elsewhere by the Beatles, including the Bruce Channel number one &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;, James Ray&#x27;s &quot;If You Gotta Make a Fool of Somebody&quot;, and the Bobby Vee hit &quot;Sharing You&quot;. McCartney bought the tape at a 1985 auction, and since none of it was used for &quot;Anthology&quot;, it has been assumed to be of poor sound quality.

Many demo recordings are known to have been made by the individual Beatles but have yet to become public. Lennon&#x27;s uncirculated demos include &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;, &quot;No Reply&quot; (pre-dating the one on &quot;Anthology&quot;), &quot;In My Life&quot;, and &quot;Good Night&quot;. McCartney&#x27;s uncirculated demos include &quot;A World Without Love&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Etcetera&quot; (a 1968 song intended for Marianne Faithfull), and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. However, a small portion of &quot;World Without Love&quot; made its public debut in January 2013 during a series of Peter Asher concerts and has subsequently appeared in full elsewhere. Also the Daily Express announced, on 20 July 2016, the original acetate of &quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot; demo featuring Paul&#x27;s voice (it was discovered among other demos in Cilla Black&#x27;s collection and was proposed for auction). Portions of these two demos, &quot;A World Without Love&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot;, were made available on Beatles bootleg &quot;The Lost Album&quot; in 2017.

Between the official &quot;Anthology&quot; releases and the numerous outtakes that have been bootlegged, many of the Beatles&#x27; most interesting studio recordings are available in some form. Nevertheless, there are still recordings known to be in EMI&#x27;s archives that have generated particular interest in their eventual release. One is &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, an improvised 14-minute vocal and sound collage that the Beatles created in early 1967 for an art festival; the recording was under consideration for &quot;Anthology&quot;, and McCartney has been an advocate for its release. Another is take 3 of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; from 18 July 1968, renowned for its length of twenty-seven minutes. &quot;Anthology 3&quot; included only a 4:38 edit of the 12:35 take 2 from that day&#x27;s work on the song; asked why a longer version wasn&#x27;t issued, George Martin explained: &quot;I think it gets boring.&quot; The full 12 minutes of take 2 were eventually released in 2018 for the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Beatles&quot;.

Some recordings may no longer exist, if they ever existed originally. A Quarrymen rehearsal that was recorded at Colin Hanton&#x27;s home was taped over. BBC documentation shows that &quot;Sheila&quot; and two versions of &quot;Three Cool Cats&quot; were recorded and never broadcast, but the tapes were likely reused or discarded, a fate shared by some of the Beatles&#x27; studio session tapes prior to late 1963. Carl Perkins said that he joined the Beatles in the studio for a late night jam session on 1 June 1964, but this was probably not taped. Several Lennon–McCartney titles were mentioned in a 1960 letter from McCartney, including &quot;Looking Glass&quot;, &quot;Years Roll Along&quot;, and &quot;Keep Looking That Way&quot;, but there is no evidence that tapes were ever made of those songs during rehearsals from that era.

One final source of uncirculated recordings is the set of sessions held in 1994–1995 for the &quot;Anthology&quot; project. In addition to the two songs released, two other Lennon demos (which have been bootlegged) became the basis for additional work by the other three Beatles: &quot;Now and Then&quot; and &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot;. &quot;Now and Then&quot; was close to being the third new song for &quot;Anthology&quot;, but it needed more work than the two released songs and was left unfinished; McCartney indicated an interest in completing the song with Starr. A new song composed by McCartney and Harrison, &quot;All for Love&quot;, was also reportedly recorded by the three ex-Beatles at the sessions but never finished. Starr released a version of &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot; in 2019 with McCartney on bass and backing vocals, while &quot;Now and Then&quot; was later released on 2 November 2023, with AI demixing technology utilized to isolate Lennon&#x27;s vocals.

==Fake or disputed bootleg songs==
A number of songs have been incorrectly claimed by bootleggers to be unreleased Beatles songs. Some originated as spoofs or parodies: &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; (&quot;Nice Time&quot; by Kenny Everett), &quot;Cheese and Onions&quot; (The Rutles), &quot;Magical Misery Tour&quot; (National Lampoon featuring Tony Hendra). Some were by obscure artists whose names were subject to misinterpretation, such as John and Paul (&quot;People Say&quot; / &quot;I&#x27;m Walking&quot;), John Lennon and the Bleechers (&quot;Ram You Hard&quot;) and Jock Lemmon (&quot;Idle Sock&quot;). Some were by groups with a (sometimes intentional) Beatlesque style, such as The Fourmost (&quot;I Love You Too&quot;), The Gants (&quot;I Wonder&quot;), The End (&quot;Shades of Orange&quot; / &quot;Loving Sacred Loving&quot;), The Brittles (&quot;Ballyhoo&quot;), Lavender Circus (&quot;N. Bourbaki&#x27;s Multicoloured Jam&quot;), and Smyle (&quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot;); or with a lead vocalist sounding like one of the Beatles, as on &quot;We Are the Moles&quot; (Simon Dupree and the Big Sound as The Moles).

A few &quot;outfakes&quot; have been labelled as Beatles tracks many times:
* &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot;. This song was credited to The Fut, and it was rumoured to include some of the Beatles playing with some of the Bee Gees. The actual participants in the 1969 recording were Maurice Gibb, the duo Tin Tin, and Billy Laurie. The recording was so plausible as a Lennon song that Yoko Ono tried to copyright its lyrics as a Lennon composition after his death.
* &quot;The L.S. Bumble Bee&quot;. Peter Cook and Dudley Moore combined psychedelic music with lyrics spoofing LSD. It was rumoured that Lennon was somehow involved, perhaps as a rebuttal to the controversy about possible drug references in songs like &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, but Moore has denied this; the song actually predates &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, having been released in January 1967.
* &quot;Oh, I Need You&quot; (also identified as &quot;Oh, I Want You&quot;). This song was purported to have been recorded during early sessions for &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The artist has not been determined with certainty, but it is often attributed to the band Mortimer, who signed with Apple Records in 1968.
*&quot;Peace of Mind / The Candle Burns&quot;. The song was reportedly found in the Apple trash in 1970, but the true origin is still unknown. Some claim it to be an actual Beatles home demo from around 1967, though the lack of any corroborating evidence and the unfamiliar voices on the record have left Beatles experts convinced that it too is a fake. There is a theory that the tape &quot;was&quot; found at Apple, but was one of the countless demos sent in by aspiring artists looking for a break with the label. In 2011, a YouTuber named &quot;waltonjones3&quot; claimed that he wrote the song and that &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; was the correct title. He also stated that none of the Beatles were involved with the song. 
*&quot;Colliding Circles&quot;, &quot;Left Is Right (And Right Is Wrong)&quot;, &quot;Pink Litmus Paper Shirt&quot; and &quot;Deck Chair&quot;. In 1971, humorist Martin Lewis compiled a Beatles bootleg discography for &quot;Disc&quot; magazine, inserting four song titles he&#x27;d simply made up: the John Lennon polemic &quot;Left Is Right (And Right Is Wrong),&quot; George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Pink Litmus Paper Shirt,&quot; a Paul McCartney vaudeville-style number &quot;Deck Chair,&quot; and another supposed Lennon track, &quot;Colliding Circles&quot;. These spurious tunes were then picked up by other compilers who have continued to propagate them ever since, despite the complete lack of any evidence for their existence. (Outsider musician R. Stevie Moore has since written and recorded tunes entitled &quot;Pink Litmus Paper Shirt&quot; and &quot;Colliding Circles&quot;, making them real songs—just not real &quot;Beatles&quot; songs. In addition, The Brittles, a Beatles pastiche band, has recorded &quot;Left is Right (and Right is Wrong)&quot; and &quot;Deck Chair&quot;). Musician Neil Innes, a Bonzo Dog Band member and Monty Python associate/friend of Martin Lewis, incorporated all four bogus song titles into the song &quot;Unfinished Words&quot;, recorded by The Rutles, and released on their album &quot;Archeology&quot;.

<text>The Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change is a statement made in 1995, seeking to refute the fact that there is a scientific consensus on the global warming issue.
It was issued in an updated form in 1997 and revised again in 2005, claiming to have been signed by 80 scientists and 25 television news meteorologists while the posting of 33 additional signatories was pending verification that those 33 additional scientists still agreed with the statement. 
All versions of the declaration, which asserts that there is no scientific consensus about the importance of global warming and opposes the recommendations of the Kyoto Protocol, were penned by Fred Singer&#x27;s Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP).

The first declaration was based on a 9–10 November 1995 conference, organized by Helmut Metzner in Leipzig, Germany. The second declaration was additionally based on a successor conference in Bonn, Germany on 10–11 November 1997. The conferences were cosponsored by SEPP and the European Academy for Environmental Affairs and titled &quot;International Symposium on the Greenhouse Controversy&quot;.

Today, the declaration is regarded as disinformation campaign, exercised by the climate change denial movement using the fake-expert-strategy, to cast doubt on the scientific consensus about global warming.

== Versions ==
=== The 1995 Declaration ===

The 1995 declaration asserts: &quot;There does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, most scientists now accept the fact that actual observations from earth satellites show no climate warming whatsoever.&quot; The latter statement was broadly accurate at the time, but with additional data and correction of errors, all analyses of satellite temperature measurements now show statistically significant warming.

The declaration also criticised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, saying: &quot;Energy is essential for all economic growth, and fossil fuels provide today&#x27;s principal global energy source. In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. For this reason, we consider &#x27;carbon taxes&#x27; and other drastic control policies ... to be ill-advised, premature, wrought with economic danger, and likely to be counterproductive.&quot;

==== Signatures ====

According to the SEPP website, there were 79 signatures to the 1995 declaration, including Frederick Seitz: the current SEPP chair. Perhaps the most prominent signatory to the declaration was Dr. Robert E. Stevenson, a former research scientist for NASA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The signature list was last updated on 16 July 1996. Of these 79, 33 failed to respond when SEPP asked them to sign the 1997 declaration. SEPP calls the signatories &quot;nearly 100 climate experts&quot;.

The signatures to the 1995 declaration were disputed by David Olinger of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;. In an article on 29 July 1996, he revealed that many signers, including Chauncey Starr, Robert Balling, and Patrick Michaels, have received funding from the oil industry, while others had no scientific training or could not be identified.

The 1995 declarations begins: &quot;As scientists, we are intensely interested in the possibility that human activities may affect the global climate&quot;. However, those identified as scientists and climate experts include at least ten weather presenters, including Dick Groeber of Dick&#x27;s Weather Service in Springfield, Ohio. Groeber, who had not completed a university degree, labelled himself a scientist by virtue of his thirty to forty years of self-study.

In any case, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the list of signatures of the 1995 declaration, as the SEPP website provides no additional details about them except for their university, if they are professors.

=== The 1997 Declaration ===

The 1997 declaration updated the 1995 declaration in a number of ways. The most obvious difference was its focus on the Kyoto Protocol, as the Kyoto conference was in the process of being finalised. The declaration says:

: &quot;We believe the Kyoto Protocol -- to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community -- is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living. ... We consider the drastic emission control policies deriving from the Kyoto conference -- lacking credible support from the underlying science -- to be ill-advised and premature.&quot;

The 1997 declaration also updated its citations of evidence that appeared to run contrary to the consensus on global warming. For example, the 1995 declaration cites &quot;observations from earth satellites,&quot; where the 1997 declaration cites &quot;observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne radiosondes.&quot; As with satellite data, subsequent analysis of radiosondes has shown a statistically significant warming trend.

==== Signatures ====

The declaration begins: &quot;As independent scientists concerned with atmospheric and climate problems, we...&quot;. As with the 1995 declaration, questions have been raised about the scientific background of the signers, and others have questioned the degree to which they can be deemed to be independent. Because many of those who signed the 1997 declaration also signed the 1995 declaration, the concerns raised by David Olinger and others after the 1995 declaration are still relevant.

The signers are generally described by Fred Singer and his supporters as climate scientists, although the current signers also include 25 weather presenters. One key report opposing the scientific credentials of the signers was a Danish Broadcasting Company TV special by Øjvind Hesselager. 
Hesselager attempted to contact the declaration&#x27;s 33 European signers and found that four of them could not be located, twelve denied ever having signed, and some had not even heard of the Leipzig Declaration. Those who verified signing included a medical doctor, a nuclear scientist, and an entomologist. After discounting the signers whose credentials were inflated, irrelevant, false, or unverifiable, Hesselager claimed that only 20 of the names on the list had any scientific connection with the study of climate change, and some of those names were known to have obtained grants from the oil and fuel industry, including the German coal industry and the government of Kuwait (a major oil exporter). As a result of Hesselager&#x27;s report, Singer removed some, but not all, of the discredited signatures. The number of signatures on the document, according to SEPP&#x27;s own press releases, has declined from 140 (according to a December 1997 press release) to 105 ().

SEPP&#x27;s position is that &quot;a few of the original signers did not have the &#x27;proper&#x27; academic credentials - even though they understand the scientific climate issues quite well. To avoid this kind of smear, we want to restrict the Leipzig Declaration to signers with impeccable qualifications.&quot; To address the signer credibility issue, SEPP has provided considerably more information about each signer on their website and lists the weather presenters separately from the other signers.

=== 2005, revised ===
As of 2010, Singer&#x27;s SEPP website listed the &quot;2005, revised&quot; declaration (which still spoke of the 1997 Kyoto conference as a future event). This version included the claim: &quot;In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever&quot;.

== Use of the declarations ==

The declarations have been widely cited by some in the &quot;sound science&quot; movement. It has been cited by Fred Singer in editorial columns appearing in hundreds of websites and major publications, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, and the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;. Jeff Jacoby, a columnist with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, described the signers of the Leipzig Declaration as &quot;climate scientists&quot; that &quot;include prominent scholars.&quot; Think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation, The Heartland Institute, and Australia&#x27;s Institute for Public Affairs called them &quot;noted scientists.&quot; Both the Leipzig Declaration and Frederick Seitz&#x27;s Oregon Petition have been quoted as authoritative sources during deliberations in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

Although the key data on which the Leipzig declaration relied (such as satellite temperature measurements) has been invalidated by subsequent research, and much new evidence has accumulated, the declaration continues to be cited, along with the Oregon Petition, as evidence of the current views of scientists on climate change. Moreover, the organizers have not changed their stated position of rejecting global warming with human activity as primary driver.

<doc id="169303" wikidata="Q2306037" url="?curid=169303" title="The Far Side">
<text>The Far Side is a single-panel comic created by Gary Larson and syndicated by Chronicle Features and then Universal Press Syndicate, which ran from December 31, 1979, to January 1, 1995 (when Larson retired as a cartoonist). Its surrealistic humor is often based on uncomfortable social situations, improbable events, an anthropomorphic view of the world, logical fallacies, impending bizarre disasters, (often twisted) references to proverbs, or the search for meaning in life. Larson&#x27;s frequent use of animals and nature in the comic is popularly attributed to his background in biology. &quot;The Far Side&quot; was ultimately carried by more than 1,900 daily newspapers, translated into 17 languages, and collected into calendars, greeting cards, and 23 compilation books, and reruns are still carried in many newspapers. After a 25-year hiatus, in July 2020, Larson began drawing new &quot;Far Side&quot; strips offered through the comic&#x27;s official website.

Larson was recognized for his work on the strip with the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1985 and 1988, and with their Reuben Award for 1990 and 1994. &quot;The Far Side&quot; won the 2020 Webby People&#x27;s Voice Award for Humor in the category Web.

== History ==
===Creation (1979)===
&quot;The Far Side&quot; was created by Gary Larson, a cartoonist based in Seattle, Washington. Larson enjoyed drawing as a child but never thought he would become a cartoonist; thus, he never studied art in school outside of required classes. Larson had been inspired to draw comics when he was younger from the strip &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, and later drew further inspiration from &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; and the work of Don Martin. He also enjoys comics from Gahan Wilson, B. Kliban and George Booth where humor was derived more from the comics&#x27; composition than dialogue, which Larson considered &quot;something almost organic going on between the humor and the art that conveyed it&quot;.

In 1976, Larson was working as a cashier at a retail music store when he realized how much he hated his job. Two days into this &quot;career crisis&quot;, Larson sat down at his kitchen table and drew six cartoons. The next day, he showed the cartoons to an editor at the local magazine &quot;Pacific Search&quot;. The editor was impressed and paid him 90, so Larson quit his job to start cartooning and created &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot;, a single-panel comic strip that served as the basis for &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Larson showed &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; to the editor of the weekly newspaper &quot;Summer News Review&quot;, who began to publish it on a regular basis.

Although Larson was initially excited to be published, he was only paid 3 a cartoon. Eventually, he stopped and became an investigator for the local humane society. In 1979, a reporter for the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; who had met Larson while investigating &quot;pony abuse&quot; showed &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; to her editor. It was revived and began appearing in the Saturday edition of the paper. Larson was paid 15 a cartoon. After about a year, Larson took a vacation from his humane society work to drive to San Francisco at the encouragement of his girlfriend. In what he called a &quot;daring plan to expand this &#x27;publication empire&#x27;&quot;, Larson left a portfolio with his work at the headquarters of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. After several days, Larson was informed that editor Stan Arnold wanted to speak with him. Arnold was impressed by his work and mentioned that, should the &quot;Chronicle&quot; be interested in Larson&#x27;s work, it could become syndicated.

When Larson returned to Seattle, he received a letter informing him &quot;Nature&#x27;s Way&quot; had been canceled because it generated too many complaints; he attributes this to the fact it ran next to a crossword puzzle aimed at children. Larson believes had this happened a week before, he would not have gone to San Francisco. The next day, Arnold called Larson and told him the syndicate affiliate of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; decided to syndicate his work. The affiliate, Chronicle Features, coined the name &quot;The Far Side&quot;; Larson joked Chronicle &quot;could have called it ″&quot;Revenge of the Zucchini People&quot;″ for all I cared.&quot; Larson&#x27;s initial contract for &quot;The Far Side&quot; called for it to have a cast of recurring characters (like how &quot;Peanuts&quot; had Charlie Brown), because Chronicle believed newspaper comics needed familiar characters to be successful. However, Larson disagreed, feeling it would be limiting and diminish the humor of the strip. In his first month of syndication, Larson made about 100. The contract with Chronicle lasted four years. After it expired, Universal Press Syndicate picked up the syndication rights.

===Publication (1979–1995)===

&quot;The Far Side&quot; made its debut in the January 1, 1980, edition of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and a few months later, Chronicle Features began to offer it to other papers. While it was only in four papers by 1982, by 1983 that number had increased to eighty, and by 1985 it had reached two hundred. Initially, Larson drew six cartoons a week, which were sent to papers a few weeks in advance. By 1987, he was drawing seven cartoons a week. From October 1988 to January 1990, Larson took a hiatus from &quot;The Far Side&quot; to travel abroad and study jazz guitar with Jim Hall. When he resumed working on &quot;The Far Side&quot; in 1990, he negotiated an agreement in which he would only have to draw five cartoons a week. The final &quot;Far Side&quot; comic was run in newspapers on January 1, 1995. Larson wrote a letter to his followers in October 1994 that explained he was ending the series due to &quot;simple fatigue&quot; and avoid having &quot;The Far Side&quot; fall into the &quot;Graveyard of Mediocre Cartoons&quot; if he continued. Larson also later stated he wanted to pursue a career as a jazz guitarist.

During its 15-year run, Larson produced a total of 4,337 &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoons. By the time of its conclusion, the series was carried in more than 1,900 papers and translated into 17 languages. Universal briefly re-syndicated &quot;The Far Side&quot; for a three-month period in late 2003 to promote the release of the anthology &quot;The Complete Far Side: 1980–1994&quot;, and many newspapers still publish reprints.

=== Hiatus (1995–2019) ===
Larson has expressed disapproval of the distribution of his cartoons on the internet and has requested that fans do not do so; he wrote in a letter that his work is too personal and important to him to have others &quot;take control of it&quot;. For this reason, Universal&#x27;s online service GoComics does not offer &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoons. In at least one case, he had sent out a cease and desist letter to a comics-aggregation site for reproducing &quot;The Far Side&quot; online. While an official &quot;Far Side&quot; site existed, it only offered information related to the comic and published books, but did not offer any of the strips.

In 2003, Gary Larson drew a cover for the November 17 edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine (the Cartoon Issue), a prestigious offer he said he could not refuse.

=== Online revival (2019–present) ===
On September 13, 2019, the official &quot;Far Side&quot; site was updated with a major redesign, teasing that &quot;[a] new online era of &quot;The Far Side&quot;&quot; would be forthcoming. The full site was launched on December 17, 2019. It features a &quot;daily dose&quot; of several randomly selected &quot;Far Side&quot; comics, a weekly themed collection, and additional material including art from Larson&#x27;s sketchbooks. Larson wrote in an open letter announcing the site that he hoped that the official online presence of &quot;The Far Side&quot; would encourage sites presently hosting his comics to take them down and direct readers to the official site. Larson said that while he does not plan to draw regular &quot;Far Side&quot; comics, he may include new material every once in a while when updating the site.

On July 7, 2020, Larson released new &quot;Far Side&quot; strips for the first time in 25 years on the website. Unlike his previous work with pen and paper, Larson transitioned to using a graphics tablet for the comic. In an accompanying post, Larson explained that frustration with his pens clogging from disuse on the rare occasions when he drew following his retirement (primarily for his annual Christmas card) led him to try working on a digital tablet. The new freedom and possibilities offered by the digital medium meant that he soon found he &quot;was having fun drawing again&quot;. Larson made it clear that he was not resuming production of a daily cartoon, but was &quot;exploring, experimenting and trying stuff.&quot;

As of March 30, 2024, Larson has not uploaded any new work since December 7, 2023.

== Design and themes ==
&quot;The Far Side&quot; is primarily told through the use of a single, vertical, rectangular panel, occasionally split into small sections of four, six, or eight for storytelling purposes. A caption or dialogue usually appears under the panel as typed text, although speech balloons are sometimes used for conversations. Certain strips, mostly those published on Sundays, are double-sized, colored, and have handwritten captions. When Larson drew panels they were , he penciled until the image &quot;closely approximate[d]&quot; his vision, and then he would ink it. The caption was handwritten in pencil underneath the cartoon. When Universal received a cartoon, it would set the caption to the usual typeface and add copyright and publication dates.

The series is characterized by its unconventional, often surrealistic, style of humor. Brigham Young University professor Kerry Soper described it as &quot;an anomaly&quot; among other newspaper cartoons and &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; wrote it was &quot;surreal, random, and occasionally very dark&quot;. Larson was influenced by his family&#x27;s &quot;morbid&quot; sense of humor. His older brother Dan, who would often play pranks on him that took advantage of his fears, was a particular influence. He also drew inspiration from personal experience, &quot;Mad&quot;, and his favorite childhood book, &quot;Mr. Bear Squash-You-All-Flat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;20/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Larson sought to mock the human condition, often by placing animals in human positions. Fear is also recurring in the strip; &quot;The Far Side&quot; was produced in a time when horror comedy was becoming popular.

Recurring themes in &quot;The Far Side&quot; include people stranded on desert islands, aliens, Heaven, Hell, the life of cavemen, and medieval dungeons. Animals—especially cows—are also common. Larson focused on subjects he considered taboo because he wanted his cartoons to be personal statements. Larson&#x27;s editors refused to publish strips they found indecent, offensive, or hard to understand. Examples include cowboys roasting a horse over a fire because they are &quot;hungry enough to eat one&quot; and a bird eating scrambled babies. Generally, they also avoided publishing cartoons with scatological humor; Larson recalled that during the strip&#x27;s first few years he was not even allowed to draw an outhouse. Larson often disagreed with his editors&#x27; decisions and was sometimes successful in getting rejected cartoons published, although he does admit most of their decisions likely saved his career. Larson also says he never tried to intentionally offend readers.

While Larson frequently used the same stereotypical characters (such as a woman with a beehive hairdo), he purposely did not name his characters nor imply they were the same characters from cartoon to cartoon. He did not want to have a character-based series, as the characters were there to help serve the humor of the comic.

== Notable cartoons ==
=== &quot;Cow Tools&quot; ===

&quot;Cow Tools&quot; is the name of a 1982 &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon. It shows a cow standing behind a table with strange objects, with the cartoon&#x27;s caption &quot;Cow tools&quot;. While most of the displayed tools had no apparent function, one was similar to a saw. The cartoon has been described as &quot;arguably the most loathed&quot; Far Side strip, with Reddit posters calling it the series&#x27; &quot;notoriously confusing cartoon&quot;. Larson was frequently asked about the meaning of the cartoon by the media, and received numerous letters, some angry and questioning where the humor was in the comic. Larson said in &quot;Prehistory of the Far Side&quot; that he had so much mail from this strip he had to issue a press release to explain that there was nothing to explain about the &quot;Cow Tools&quot; comic.

=== Jane Goodall cartoon ===
One &quot;The Far Side&quot; cartoon shows two chimpanzees grooming. One finds a blonde human hair on the other and inquires, &quot;Conducting a little more &#x27;research&#x27; with that Jane Goodall tramp?&quot; Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the Jane Goodall Institute felt the cartoon was in bad taste; the organization had its lawyers draft a letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate, in which the cartoon was labeled an &quot;atrocity.&quot; These efforts were stymied by Goodall herself when she returned and saw the cartoon and stated that she found it amusing, commenting &quot;It all helps to put us humans in our place, and we desperately need putting in our place.&quot; Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to &quot;The Far Side Gallery 5&quot;, detailing her version of the controversy, and the institute&#x27;s letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete &quot;Far Side&quot; collection. She praised Larson&#x27;s creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals.

=== The Thagomizer ===

In 1982, Larson published a comic in which a prehistoric lecturer refers to the then previously unnamed tail spikes of the &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; as the &quot;thagomizer&quot; because, according to the prehistoric lecturer, a caveman called Thag Simmons had been killed by those spikes. The arrangement of spikes originally had no distinct name, but Larson&#x27;s neologism was adopted gradually by paleontologists, albeit only in a casual context.

===Protests against certain cartoons===
&quot;The Complete Far Side&quot; and &quot;The Prehistory of The Far Side&quot; include letters from angry readers alongside the comics that prompted them. The letters were written to newspaper publishers and often demanded the removal of &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Despite these protests, &quot;The Far Side&quot; remained popular and continued to run in many newspapers. Larson often laughs at the controversies as evidenced in &quot;The Prehistory of The Far Side&quot;, in which he writes that the people complaining have usually misunderstood the cartoon.

== Collected editions ==
There are 23 collected editions of &quot;The Far Side&quot;, which combined have sold over 45 million copies and have generated 70 million in revenue. The books are published by Andrews McMeel Publishing, an affiliate of Universal. Andrews McMeel acquired the rights to publish collected editions of the series in 1982, the year the first &quot;Far Side&quot; book was released. It was surprisingly successful, which influenced Larson&#x27;s decision to sign on with Universal after his contract with Chronicle expired. In January 1985, the four &quot;Far Side&quot; books out at the time—&quot;The Far Side&quot;, &quot;The Far Side Gallery&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Far Side&quot; and &quot;In Search of the Far Side&quot;—were simultaneous bestsellers; Jim Davis&#x27;s &quot;Garfield&quot; was the only newspaper comic that had previously accomplished this feat. New &quot;Far Side&quot; books continued to be published after the series concluded and remain in print and popular today.

During his 14-month hiatus, Larson produced &quot;The PreHistory of The Far Side: A 10th Anniversary Exhibit&quot;, a &quot;Far Side&quot; anthology that commemorates the series&#x27; 10th anniversary. It contains commentary on individual strips, letters from angry readers, unpublished cartoons, and some of Larson&#x27;s personal favorite &quot;Far Side&quot;s. In 2003, Andrews McMeel released the two-volume, twenty-pound anthology &quot;The Complete Far Side: 1980—1994&quot;. &quot;The Complete Far Side&quot; contains every &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon syndicated and, when it was initially published, retailed for 135. Larson spent three years working on it; the majority of work went into redrawing characters&#x27; eyeballs because he was unhappy how they looked when transferred digitally. It sold 350,000 copies and at the time was the most expensive &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. A new, lighter edition of &quot;The Complete Far Side&quot; was released in 2014.


==Merchandise and other media==
A large amount of &quot;Far Side&quot; merchandise was produced, ranging from greeting cards, posters, t-shirts, and mugs. For many years, Larson produced a yearly calendar that contained a &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon for each day of the year. He stopped making them annually in 2002, but created another edition in 2006; all proceeds from this edition went to Conservation International. In the years they were available, &quot;Far Side&quot; greeting cards and calendars sold 110 million and 45 million copies, respectively. Larson stated in 1987 he was personally embarrassed by how much money he made from &quot;Far Side&quot; merchandise.

== Television productions ==

In 1994, Larson produced an animated special, &quot;Tales from the Far Side&quot;, featuring his art style and gags from the strips. He produced a sequel in 1997.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1987, a special exhibit of 527 black and white &quot;Far Side&quot; panels was shown in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. 127 of the panels were originals, displayed in the rotunda on boards that held 50 panels each. Later the display became a traveling exhibit that was shown in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Orlando, Chicago, Toronto, New York City, Denver, and Los Angeles.

There was a &quot;Far Side&quot; gallery at the California Academy of Science that featured some of Larson&#x27;s panels. The exhibit included a giant microscope under which visitors could stand, based on one of Larson&#x27;s cartoons. Looking up through the objective lens revealed a giant blinking eyeball. The building was torn down and replaced and the exhibit is no longer in the new facility.

== Legacy ==
As described by Sarah Larson (who is unrelated to creator Gary Larson) for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Far Side&quot;″s initial run came at a time where newspaper comics were generally more grounded, such as &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot; and &quot;Doonesbury.&quot; The comic also helped introduce more modern and surreal humor into the comic pages that influence other strips such as &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and &quot;Bloom County&quot;; it also has brought nerd humor to the forefront, reflected in series like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

<doc id="169305" wikidata="Q209722" url="?curid=169305" title="Cognitive dissonance">
<text>In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is described as a mental phenomenon in which people unknowingly hold fundamentally conflicting cognitions. Being confronted by situations that challenge this dissonance may ultimately result in some change in their cognitions or actions to cause greater alignment between them so as to reduce this dissonance. Relevant items of cognition include peoples&#x27; actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance exists without signs but surfaces through psychological stress when persons participate in an action that goes against one or more of conflicting things. According to this theory, when an action or idea is psychologically inconsistent with the other, people automatically try to resolve the conflict, usually by reframing a side to make the combination congruent. Discomfort is triggered by beliefs clashing with new information or by having to conceptually resolve an issue that involves conflicting sides, whereby the individual tries to find a way to reconcile contradictions to reduce their discomfort.

In &quot;When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World&quot; (1956) and &quot;A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance&quot; (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance. They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance (rationalization), believing that “people get what they deserve” (just-world fallacy), taking in specific information while rejecting or ignoring others (selective perception), or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance (confirmation bias). Festinger explains avoiding cognitive dissonance as, &quot;Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.&quot;

== Founder ==
Leon Festinger, born in 1919 in New York City, was an American social psychologist whose contributions to psychology include the cognitive dissonance theory, social comparison theory, and the proximity effect.

Festinger graduated from the City College of New York in 1939; he then received his PhD in Child Psychology from the University of Iowa. He was initially inspired to enter the field of psychology by Kurt Lewin, known as the “father of modern social psychology,” and his work in Gestalt psychology. Studying under Kurt Lewin for most of his academic career, Festinger returned to collaborate with Lewin at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a 2002 American Psychological Association article, Festinger is cited as the fifth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century, just after B.F. Skinner, Jean Piaget, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Bandura, respectively. Festinger’s cognitive dissonance theory is still one of the most influential social theories in modern social psychology.

Throughout this research, Festinger noticed that people often like to stick to consistent habits and routines to maintain order within their lives. These habits may include everyday activities like preferring a specific seat during their daily commute or eating meals at consistent times. Any disturbance to this order can lead to mental unease, which may manifest in altered thought processes or beliefs. Festinger concluded that the sole means of alleviating this discomfort is by adjusting either their actions or beliefs to restore consistency.

Since his publication of &quot;A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance&quot; in 1957, Festinger’s findings have helped to understand peoples’ personal biases, how people reframe situations in their heads to maintain a positive self-image, and why one may pursue certain behaviors that misalign with their judgments as they seek out or reject certain information.

Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful, as it requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve the dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.

== Relations among cognitions ==
To function in the reality of society, human beings continually adjust the correspondence of their mental attitudes and personal actions; such continual adjustments, between cognition and action, result in one of three relationships with reality:
# Consonant relationship: A cognition or action consistent with the other, e.g., not wanting to become drunk when out for dinner and ordering water rather than wine
# Irrelevant relationship: A cognition or action unrelated to the other, e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out and wearing a shirt
# Dissonant relationship: A cognition or action inconsistent with the other, e.g. not wanting to become drunk when out, but then drinking more wine anyway

=== Magnitude of dissonance ===
The term &quot;magnitude of dissonance&quot; refers to the level of discomfort caused to the person. This can be caused by the relationship between two different internal beliefs, or an action that is incompatible with the beliefs of the person. Two factors determine the degree of psychological dissonance caused by two conflicting cognitions or by two conflicting actions:

# The importance of cognitions: the greater the personal value of the elements, the greater the magnitude of the dissonance in the relation. When the value of the importance of the two dissonant items is high, it is difficult to determine which action or thought is correct. Both have had a place of truth, at least subjectively, in the mind of the person. Therefore, when the ideals or actions now clash, it is difficult for the individual to decide which takes priority.
# Ratio of cognitions: the proportion of dissonant-to-consonant elements. There is a level of discomfort within each person that is acceptable for living. When a person is within that comfort level, the dissonant factors do not interfere with functioning. However, when dissonant factors are abundant and not enough in line with each other, one goes through a process to regulate and bring the ratio back to an acceptable level. Once a subject chooses to keep one of the dissonant factors, they quickly forget the other to restore peace of mind.

There is always some degree of dissonance within a person as they go about making decisions, due to the changing quantity and quality of knowledge and wisdom that they gain. The magnitude itself is a subjective measurement since the reports are self relayed, and there is no objective way as yet to get a clear measurement of the level of discomfort.

== Reduction==
Cognitive dissonance theory proposes that people seek psychological consistency between their expectations of life and the existential reality of the world. To function by that expectation of existential consistency, people continually reduce their cognitive dissonance in order to align their cognitions (perceptions of the world) with each other and their actions.

The creation and establishment of psychological consistency allows the person affected with cognitive dissonance to lessen mental stress by actions that reduce the magnitude of the dissonance, realized either by changing with or by justifying against or by being indifferent to the existential contradiction that is inducing the mental stress. In practice, people reduce the magnitude of their cognitive dissonance in four ways:
# Change the behavior or the cognition (&quot;I&#x27;ll eat no more of this doughnut.&quot;)
# Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition (&quot;I&#x27;m allowed to cheat my diet every once in a while.&quot;)
# Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions (&quot;I&#x27;ll spend thirty extra minutes at the gymnasium to work off the doughnut.&quot;)
# Ignore or deny information that conflicts with existing beliefs (&quot;This doughnut is not a high-sugar food.&quot;)

Three cognitive bias theories are proposed proponents of cognitive dissonance (&quot;Note: they are not distinct, they draw from each other&quot;): 1. Bias Blind Spot — the tendency to perceive oneself as less susceptible to biases than others, 2. The Better-Than-Average-Effect — the tendency to believe that one is overall superior to others in terms of ability and character, and Confirmation bias — the tendency to interpret and understand information in a way that supports preexisting beliefs, thoughts, feelings, etc.

Having congruent, or perceived as congruent cognition is required in order to function in the real world according to the results of &quot;The Psychology of Prejudice&quot; (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people.

Based on a brief overview of models and theories related to cognitive consistency from many different scientific fields, such as social psychology, perception, neurocognition, learning, motor control, system control, ethology, and stress, it has even been proposed that &quot;all behaviour involving cognitive processing is caused by the activation of inconsistent cognitions and functions to increase perceived consistency&quot;; that is, all behaviour functions to reduce cognitive inconsistency at some level of information processing. Indeed, the involvement of cognitive inconsistency has long been suggested for behaviors related to for instance curiosity, and aggression and fear, while it has also been suggested that the inability to satisfactorily reduce cognitive inconsistency may – dependent on the type and size of the inconsistency – result in stress.

=== Selective exposure ===
Another means to reduce cognitive dissonance is selective exposure. This theory has been discussed since the early days of Festinger&#x27;s proposal of cognitive dissonance. He noticed that people would selectively expose themselves to some media over others; specifically, they would avoid dissonant messages and prefer consonant messages. Through selective exposure, people actively (and selectively) choose what to watch, view, or read that fit to their current state of mind, mood or beliefs. In other words, consumers select attitude-consistent information and avoid attitude-challenging information. This can be applied to media, news, music, and any other messaging channel. The idea is, choosing something that is in opposition to how you feel or believe in will increase cognitive dissonance.

For example, a study was done in an elderly home in 1992 on the loneliest residents—those that did not have family or frequent visitors. The residents were shown a series of documentaries: three that featured a &quot;very happy, successful elderly person&quot;, and three that featured an &quot;unhappy, lonely elderly person.&quot; After watching the documentaries, the residents indicated they preferred the media featuring the unhappy, lonely person over the happy person. This can be attested to them feeling lonely, and experiencing cognitive dissonance watching somebody their age feeling happy and being successful. This study explains how people select media that aligns with their mood, as in selectively exposing themselves to people and experiences they are already experiencing. It is more comfortable to see a movie about a character that is similar to you than to watch one about someone who is your age who is more successful than you.

Another example to note is how people mostly consume media that aligns with their political views. In a study done in 2015, participants were shown &quot;attitudinally consistent, challenging, or politically balanced online news.&quot; Results showed that the participants trusted attitude-consistent news the most out of all the others, regardless of the source. It is evident that the participants actively selected media that aligns with their beliefs rather than opposing media.

In fact, recent research has suggested that while a discrepancy between cognitions drives individuals to crave for attitude-consistent information, the experience of negative emotions drives individuals to avoid counter attitudinal information. In other words, it is the psychological discomfort which activates selective exposure as a dissonance-reduction strategy.

==Paradigms==
There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people experienced when exposed to information that is inconsistent with their beliefs, ideals or values: Belief Disconfirmation, Induced Compliance, Free Choice, and Effort Justification, which respectively explain what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to their intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with contrary evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective.

===Belief disconfirmation===

The contradiction of a belief, ideal, or system of values causes cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing the challenged belief, yet, instead of affecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person by misperception, rejection, or refutation of the contradiction, seeking moral support from people who share the contradicted beliefs or acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.

The early hypothesis of belief contradiction presented in &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot; (1956) reported that faith deepened among the members of an apocalyptic religious cult, despite the failed prophecy of an alien spacecraft soon to land on Earth to rescue them from earthly corruption. At the determined place and time, the cult assembled; they believed that only they would survive planetary destruction; yet the spaceship did not arrive to Earth. The confounded prophecy caused them acute cognitive-dissonance: Had they been victims of a hoax? Had they vainly donated away their material possessions? To resolve the dissonance between apocalyptic, end-of-the-world religious beliefs and earthly, material reality, most of the cult restored their psychological consonance by choosing to believe a less mentally-stressful idea to explain the missed landing: that the aliens had given planet Earth a second chance at existence, which, in turn, empowered them to re-direct their religious cult to environmentalism and social advocacy to end human damage to planet Earth. On overcoming the confounded belief by changing to global environmentalism, the cult increased in numbers by proselytism.

The study of &quot;The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference&quot; (2008) reported the belief contradiction that occurred in the Chabad Orthodox Jewish congregation, who believed that their Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was the Messiah. When he died of a stroke in 1994, instead of accepting that their Rebbe was not the Messiah, some of the congregation proved indifferent to that contradictory fact, and continued claiming that Schneerson was the Messiah and that he would soon return from the dead.

===Induced compliance===
In the &quot;Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance&quot; (1959), the investigators Leon Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith asked students to spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. This procedure included seventy-one male students attending Stanford University. Students were asked to complete a series of repetitive, mundane tasks, then asked to convince a separate group of participants that the task was fun and exciting. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor) and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. Subjects of one group were paid twenty dollars ($20); those in a second group were paid one dollar ($1) and those in the control group were not asked to speak with the imposter-subject.

At the conclusion of the study, when asked to rate the tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20), and the first group (paid $20) rated the tasks just slightly more positively than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance between the conflicting cognitions. &quot;I told someone that the task was interesting&quot; and &quot;I actually found it boring.&quot; The subjects paid one dollar were induced to comply, compelled to internalize the &quot;interesting task&quot; mental attitude because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the &quot;interesting task&quot; mental attitude and experienced a lower degree of cognitive dissonance than did those only paid one dollar. They did not receive sufficient compensation for the lie they were asked to tell. Because of this insufficiency, the participants convinced themselves to believe that what they were doing was exciting. This way, they felt better about telling the next group of participants that it was exciting because, technically, they weren&#x27;t lying.

====Forbidden behavior paradigm====

In the &quot;Effect of the Severity of Threat on the Devaluation of Forbidden Behavior&quot; (1963), a variant of the induced-compliance paradigm, by Elliot Aronson and Carlsmith, examined self-justification in children. Children were left in a room with toys, including a greatly desirable steam shovel, the forbidden toy. Upon leaving the room, the experimenter told one-half of the group of children that there would be severe punishment if they played with the steam-shovel toy and told the second half of the group that there would be a mild punishment for playing with the forbidden toy. All of the children refrained from playing with the forbidden toy (the steam shovel).

Later, when the children were told that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite the removal of the threat of mild punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.

In &quot;The Efficacy of Musical Emotions Provoked by Mozart&#x27;s Music for the Reconciliation of Cognitive Dissonance&quot; (2012), a variant of the forbidden-toy paradigm, indicated that listening to music reduces the development of cognitive dissonance. Without music in the background, the control group of four-year-old children were told to avoid playing with a forbidden toy. After playing alone, the control-group children later devalued the importance of the forbidden toy. In the variable group, classical music played in the background while the children played alone. In the second group, the children did not later devalue the forbidden toy. The researchers, Nobuo Masataka and Leonid Perlovsky, concluded that music might inhibit cognitions that induce cognitive dissonance.

Music is a stimulus that can diminish post-decisional dissonance; in an earlier experiment, &quot;Washing Away Postdecisional Dissonance&quot; (2010), the researchers indicated that the actions of hand-washing might inhibit the cognitions that induce cognitive dissonance. That study later failed to replicate.

=== Free choice===
In the study &quot;Post-decision Changes in Desirability of Alternatives&quot; (1956) 225 female students rated domestic appliances and then were asked to choose one of two appliances as a gift. The results of the second round of ratings indicated that the women students increased their ratings of the domestic appliance they had selected as a gift and decreased their ratings of the appliances they rejected.

This type of cognitive dissonance occurs in a person who is faced with a difficult decision and when the rejected choice may still have desirable characteristics to the chooser. The action of deciding provokes the psychological dissonance consequent to choosing X instead of Y, despite little difference between X and Y; the decision &quot;I chose X&quot; is dissonant with the cognition that &quot;There are some aspects of Y that I like&quot;. The study &quot;Choice-induced Preferences in the Absence of Choice: Evidence from a Blind Two-choice Paradigm with Young Children and Capuchin Monkeys&quot; (2010) reports similar results in the occurrence of cognitive dissonance in human beings and in animals.

&quot;Peer Effects in Pro-Social Behavior: Social Norms or Social Preferences?&quot; (2013) indicated that with internal deliberation, the structuring of decisions among people can influence how a person acts. The study suggested that social preferences and social norms can explain peer effects in decision making. The study observed that choices made by the second participant would influence the first participant&#x27;s effort to make choices and that inequity aversion, the preference for fairness, is the paramount concern of the participants.

===Effort justification===

Cognitive dissonance occurs in a person who voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) unpleasant activities to achieve a goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In &quot;The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group&quot; (1956), to qualify for admission to a discussion group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation of varied psychological severity. The first group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words considered obscene; the second group of subjects were to read aloud twelve sexual words not considered obscene.

Both groups were given headphones to unknowingly listen to a recorded discussion about animal sexual behaviour, which the researchers designed to be dull and banal. As the subjects of the experiment, the groups of people were told that the animal-sexuality discussion actually was occurring in the next room. The subjects whose strong initiation required reading aloud obscene words evaluated the people of their group as more-interesting persons than the people of the group who underwent the mild initiation to the discussion group.

In &quot;Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing&quot; (2006), the results indicated that a person washing their hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance because the mental stress usually was caused by the person&#x27;s ethical–moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment.
The study &quot;The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making&quot; (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the names and paintings. To give meaning to the decisions, the participants were asked to select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, the participants were asked to base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.

The results indicated that when the decision is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based on their attitudes (positive, neutral or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session&#x27;s end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. The existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period and the participants experienced cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.

===Anticipatory Cognitive Dissonance===

Anticipatory Cognitive Dissonance (ACD) is a proposed extension of traditional cognitive dissonance theory, describing the psychological discomfort that arises not only in response to present contradictions between beliefs or behaviors but also in anticipation of future conflicts. In this framework, individuals may experience dissonance when they foresee that adopting a new idea or changing a long-held conviction could later generate internal conflict or regret—essentially, the mind preempts potential dissonance by resisting change before any overt contradiction occurs.

Proponents of ACD suggest that this anticipatory form of dissonance can trigger self-justification mechanisms even before the occurrence of disconfirming evidence. For example, a person may be reluctant to reconsider deeply ingrained religious, political, or philosophical beliefs not solely because of the immediate discomfort of contradiction but because of an expectation that the process of change will lead to a future sense of lost identity or regret over past investments of time and emotion. This anticipatory reaction is conceptually related to the sunk cost fallacy, in which past investments (be they emotional, intellectual, or material) are seen as reasons to maintain the status quo despite new information.

In this view, ACD may play a crucial role in decision-making processes and belief maintenance, acting as a pre-emptive defense mechanism. Individuals, aware that the transition to new viewpoints could be fraught with psychological strain, may engage in selective information processing or avoid situations that could force them to confront these anticipated discrepancies. By doing so, they strive to preserve a consistent self-concept and avoid the discomfort associated with future cognitive dissonance.

While traditional cognitive dissonance theory has focused on the resolution of dissonance after it is experienced, anticipatory cognitive dissonance shifts the focus to the pre-decisional phase—emphasizing the role of expectation and foresight in influencing attitudes and behaviors. Further empirical research is required to delineate the mechanisms of ACD and to determine how it interacts with established paradigms such as belief disconfirmation, induced compliance, free choice, and effort justification.

== Examples ==
===Meat-eating===
Meat-eating can involve discrepancies between the behavior of eating meat and various ideals that the person holds. Some researchers call this form of moral conflict the &quot;meat paradox&quot;. Hank Rothgerber posited that meat eaters may encounter a conflict between their eating behavior and their affections toward animals. This occurs when the dissonant state involves recognition of one&#x27;s behavior as a meat eater and a belief, attitude, or value that this behavior contradicts. The person with this state may attempt to employ various methods, including avoidance, willful ignorance, dissociation, perceived behavioral change, and do-gooder derogation to prevent this form of dissonance from occurring. Once occurred, they may reduce it in the form of motivated cognitions, such as denigrating animals, offering pro-meat justifications, or denying responsibility for eating meat.

The extent of cognitive dissonance with regard to meat eating can vary depending on the attitudes and values of the individual involved because these can affect whether or not they see any moral conflict with their values and what they eat. For example, individuals who are more dominance minded and who value having a masculine identity are less likely to experience cognitive dissonance because they are less likely to believe eating meat is morally wrong. Others cope with this cognitive dissonance often through ignorance (ignoring the known realities of their food source) or explanations loosely tied to taste. The psychological phenomenon intensifies if mind or human-like qualities of animals are explicitly mentioned.

===Smoking===
The study &quot;Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers: A Longitudinal Analysis from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey&quot; (2012) indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking it.

# Continuing smokers (Smoking and no attempt to quit since the previous round of study)
# Successful quitters (Quit during the study and did not use tobacco from the time of the previous round of study)
# Failed quitters (Quit during the study, but relapsed to smoking at the time of the study)

To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

# Functional beliefs (&quot;Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset.&quot;; &quot;Smoking helps me concentrate better.&quot;; &quot;Smoking is an important part of my life.&quot;; and &quot;Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize.&quot;)
# Risk-minimizing beliefs (&quot;The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated.&quot;; &quot;One has to die of something, so why not enjoy yourself and smoke?&quot;; and &quot;Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do.&quot;)

=== Littering ===
Disposing of trash outside, even when knowing this is against the law, wrong, and is harmful for the environment, is a prominent example of cognitive dissonance, especially if the person feels bad after littering but continues to do so.

Between November 2015 and March 2016, a study by Xitou Nature Education Area in Taiwan examined littering of tourists. Researchers analyzed the relationships between tourists&#x27; environmental attitudes, cognitive dissonance, and vandalism. In this study, 500 questionnaires were distributed and 499 questionnaires were returned. The results of this study indicate that older tourists had better attitudes towards the environment and cared more. The tourists who were older and cared more for outdoor activities were less likely to litter. On the other hand, the younger tourists littered more and experienced more cognitive dissonance. This study showed that younger tourists littered more as a whole and regretted or thought about it after.

=== Unpleasant medical screenings ===
In a study titled &quot;Cognitive Dissonance and Attitudes Toward Unpleasant Medical Screenings &quot; (2016), researchers Michael R. Ent and Mary A. Gerend informed the study participants about a discomforting test for a specific (fictitious) virus called the &quot;human respiratory virus-27&quot;. The study used a fake virus to prevent participants from having thoughts, opinions, and feeling about the virus that would interfere with the experiment. The study participants were in two groups; one group was told that they were actual candidates for the virus-27 test, and the second group were told they were not candidates for the test. The researchers reported, &quot;We predicted that [study] participants who thought that they were candidates for the unpleasant test would experience dissonance associated with knowing that the test was both unpleasant and in their best interest—this dissonance was predicted to result in unfavorable attitudes toward the test.&quot;

=== Related phenomena ===
Cognitive dissonance may also occur when people seek to explain or justify their beliefs, often without questioning the validity of their claims. After the earthquake of 1934, Bihar, India, irrational rumors based upon fear quickly reached the adjoining communities unaffected by the disaster because those people, although not in physical danger, psychologically justified their anxieties about the earthquake. The same pattern can be observed when one&#x27;s convictions are met with a contradictory order. In a study conducted among 6th grade students, after being induced to cheat in an academic examination, students judged cheating less harshly. Nonetheless, the confirmation bias identifies how people readily read information that confirms their established opinions and readily avoid reading information that contradicts their opinions. The confirmation bias is apparent when a person confronts deeply held political beliefs, i.e. when a person is greatly committed to their beliefs, values, and ideas.

If a contradiction occurs between how a person feels and how a person acts, one&#x27;s perceptions and emotions align to alleviate stress. The Ben Franklin effect refers to that statesman&#x27;s observation that the act of performing a favor for a rival leads to increased positive feelings toward that individual. It is also possible that one&#x27;s emotions be altered to minimize the regret of irrevocable choices. At a hippodrome, bettors had more confidence in their horses after the betting than before.

== Applications==
=== Education ===
The management of cognitive dissonance readily influences the apparent motivation of a student to pursue education. The study &quot;Turning Play into Work: Effects of Adult Surveillance and Extrinsic Rewards on Children&#x27;s Intrinsic Motivation&quot; (1975) indicated that the application of the effort justification paradigm increased student enthusiasm for education with the offer of an external reward for studying; students in pre-school who completed puzzles based upon an adult promise of reward were later less interested in the puzzles than were students who completed the puzzle-tasks without the promise of a reward.

The incorporation of cognitive dissonance into models of basic learning-processes to foster the students&#x27; self-awareness of psychological conflicts among their personal beliefs, ideals, and values and the reality of contradictory facts and information, requires the students to defend their personal beliefs. Afterwards, the students are trained to objectively perceive new facts and information to resolve the psychological stress of the conflict between reality and the student&#x27;s value system. Moreover, educational software that applies the derived principles facilitates the students&#x27; ability to successfully handle the questions posed in a complex subject. Meta-analysis of studies indicates that psychological interventions that provoke cognitive dissonance in order to achieve a directed conceptual change do increase students&#x27; learning in reading skills and about science.

=== Psychotherapy ===
The general effectiveness of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that the mental health of the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in the results of the study &quot;Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children&quot; (1983), wherein the children&#x27;s belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.

In the study &quot;Reducing Fears and Increasing Attentiveness: The Role of Dissonance Reduction &quot; (1980), people with ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) who invested much effort in activities of little therapeutic value for them (experimentally represented as legitimate and relevant) showed improved alleviation of the symptoms of their phobia. Likewise, the results of &quot;Cognitive Dissonance and Psychotherapy: The Role of Effort Justification in Inducing Weight Loss&quot; (1985) indicated that the patient felt better in justifying their efforts and therapeutic choices towards effectively losing weight. That the therapy of effort expenditure can predict long-term change in the patient&#x27;s perceptions.

=== Social behavior ===
Cognitive dissonance is used to promote social behaviours considered positive, such as increased condom use. Other studies indicate that cognitive dissonance can be used to encourage people to act pro-socially, such as campaigns against public littering, campaigns against racial prejudice, and compliance with anti-speeding campaigns. The theory can also be used to explain reasons for donating to charity.
Cognitive dissonance can be applied in social areas such as racism and racial hatred. Acharya of Stanford, Blackwell and Sen of Harvard state cognitive dissonance increases when an individual commits an act of violence toward someone from a different ethnic or racial group and decreases when the individual does not commit any such act of violence. Research from Acharya, Blackwell and Sen shows that individuals committing violence against members of another group develop hostile attitudes towards their victims as a way of minimizing cognitive dissonance. Importantly, the hostile attitudes may persist even after the violence itself declines (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen, 2015). The application provides a social psychological basis for the constructivist viewpoint that ethnic and racial divisions can be socially or individually constructed, possibly from acts of violence (Fearon and Laitin, 2000). Their framework speaks to this possibility by showing how violent actions by individuals can affect individual attitudes, either ethnic or racial animosity (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen, 2015).

=== COVID-19 ===
The COVID-19 pandemic, an extreme public health crisis, cases rose to the hundred million and deaths at nearly four million worldwide. Reputable health organizations such as Lyu and Wehby studied the effects of wearing a face mask on the spread of COVID-19. They found evidence that suggests that COVID patients were reduced by 2%, averting nearly 200,000 cases by the end of the following month. Despite this fact having been proven and encouraged by major health organizations, there was still a resistance to wearing the mask and keeping a safe distance away from others. When the COVID-19 vaccine was eventually released to the public, this only made the resistance stronger.

The Ad Council launched an extensive campaign advertising for people to follow the health guidelines established by the CDC and WHO and attempted to persuade people to become vaccinated eventually. After taking polls on public opinion about safety measures to prevent the spreading of the virus, it showed that between 80% and 90% of adults in the United States agree with these safety procedures and vaccines being necessary. The cognitive dissonance arose when people took polls on public behavior. Despite the general opinion that wearing a mask, social distancing, and receiving the vaccine are all things the public should be doing, only 50% of responders admitted to doing these things all or even most of the time. People believe that partaking in preventative measures is essential, but fail to follow through with actually doing them. To convince people to behave in line with their beliefs, it is essential to remind people of a fact that they believe is true, and then remind them of times in the past when they went against this. The hypocrisy paradigm is known for inconsistent cognition resolution through a change in behavior. Data were collected by participants that were asked to write statements supporting mask use and social distancing, which is something they agreed with. Then the participants were told to think about recent situations in which they failed to do this. The prediction was that the dissonance would be a motivating factor in getting people to be compliant with COVID-19 safety measures. After contacting participants one week later, they reported behaviors, including social distancing and mask-wearing.

=== Personal responsibility ===
A study conducted by Cooper and Worchel (1970) examined personal responsibility regarding cognitive dissonance. The goal was to investigate responsibility concerning foreseen consequences and how this might cause dissonance; 124 female participants were asked to complete problem-solving tasks while working with a partner. They had the option to either choose a partner with negative traits, or they were assigned one. A portion of the participants was aware of the negative traits their partner possessed; however, the remaining participants were unaware. Cooper hypothesized that if the participants knew about their negative partner beforehand, they would have cognitive dissonance; however, he also believed that the participants would be inclined to attempt to like their partners in an attempt to reduce this dissonance. The study shows that personal choice has the power to predict attitude changes.

===Consumer behavior===
Pleasure is one of the main factors in our modern culture of consumerism. Once a consumer has chosen to purchase a specific item, they often fear that another choice may have brought them more pleasure. Post-purchase dissonance occurs when a purchase is final, voluntary, and significant to the person. This dissonance is a mental discomfort arising from the possibility of dissatisfaction with the purchase, or the regret of not purchasing a different, potentially more useful or satisfactory good. Consequently, the buyer will &quot;seek to reduce dissonance by increasing the perceived attractiveness of the chosen alternative and devaluing the non chosen item, seeking out information to confirm the decision, or changing attitudes to conform to the decision.&quot; In other words, the buyer justifies their purchase to themselves in whatever way they can, in an attempt to convince themselves that they made the right decision and to diminish regret. Usually these feelings of regret are more prevalent after online purchases as opposed to in-store purchases. This happens because an online consumer does not have the opportunity to experience the product in its entirety, and must rely on what information is available through photos and descriptions. On the other hand, in-store shopping can sometimes be even more of an issue for consumers in regard to impulse buying. While the ease of online shopping proves hard to resist for impulse buyers, in-store shoppers may be influenced by who they are with. Shopping with friends increases the risk of impulse buying, especially compared to shopping with people such as one&#x27;s parents.

Post-purchase dissonance does not only affect the consumer; brands are dependent on customer loyalty, and cognitive dissonance can influence that loyalty. The more positive experiences and emotions that a customer associates with a specific brand, the more likely they are to buy from that brand in the future, recommend it to friends, etc. The opposite is also true, meaning any feelings of discomfort, dissatisfaction, and regret will weaken the consumer&#x27;s perception of the brand and make them less likely to return as a customer.

The study &quot;Beyond Reference Pricing: Understanding Consumers&#x27; Encounters with Unexpected Prices &quot; (2003), indicated that when consumers experience an unexpected price encounter, they adopt three methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: (i) Employ a strategy of continual information; (ii) Employ a change in attitude; and (iii) Engage in minimisation. Consumers employ the strategy of continual information by engaging in bias and searching for information that supports prior beliefs. Consumers might search for information about other retailers and substitute products consistent with their beliefs. Alternatively, consumers might change attitude, such as re-evaluating price in relation to external reference-prices or associating high prices and low prices with quality. Minimisation reduces the importance of the elements of the dissonance; consumers tend to minimise the importance of money, and thus of shopping around, saving, and finding a better deal.

=== Politics ===
Cognitive dissonance theory might suggest that since votes are an expression of preference or beliefs, even the act of voting might cause someone to defend the actions of the candidate for whom they voted, and if the decision was close then the effects of cognitive dissonance should be greater.

This effect was studied over the 6 presidential elections of the United States between 1972 and 1996, and it was found that the opinion differential between the candidates changed more before and after the election than the opinion differential of non-voters. In addition, elections where the voter had a favorable attitude toward both candidates, making the choice more difficult, had the opinion differential of the candidates change more dramatically than those who only had a favorable opinion of one candidate. What was not studied were the cognitive dissonance effects in cases where the person had unfavorable attitudes toward both candidates. The 2016 U.S. election held historically high unfavorable ratings for both candidates.

After the 2020 United States presidential election, which was won by Joe Biden, supporters of former President Donald Trump, who had lost the election to Biden, questioned the outcome of the election, citing voter fraud. This continued after such claims were dismissed as false by numerous judges, election officials, U.S. state governors, and federal government agencies. This was described as an example of Trump supporters experiencing cognitive dissonance.

=== Communication ===

Cognitive dissonance theory of communication was initially advanced by American psychologist Leon Festinger in the 1960s. Festinger theorized that cognitive dissonance usually arises when a person holds two or more incompatible beliefs simultaneously. This is a normal occurrence since people encounter different situations that invoke conflicting thought sequences. This conflict results in a psychological discomfort. According to Festinger, people experiencing a thought conflict try to reduce the psychological discomfort by attempting to achieve an emotional equilibrium. This equilibrium is achieved in three main ways. First, the person may downplay the importance of the dissonant thought. Second, the person may attempt to outweigh the dissonant thought with consonant thoughts. Lastly, the person may incorporate the dissonant thought into their current belief system.

Dissonance plays an important role in persuasion. To persuade people, you must cause them to experience dissonance, and then offer your proposal as a way to resolve the discomfort. Although there is no guarantee your audience will change their minds, the theory maintains that without dissonance, there can be no persuasion. Without a feeling of discomfort, people are not motivated to change. Similarly, it is the feeling of discomfort which motivates people to perform selective exposure (i.e., avoiding disconfirming information) as a dissonance-reduction strategy.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
It is hypothesized that introducing cognitive dissonance into machine learning may be able to assist in the long-term aim of developing &#x27;creative autonomy&#x27; on the part of agents, including in multi-agent systems (such as games), and ultimately to the development of &#x27;strong&#x27; forms of artificial intelligence, including artificial general intelligence.

== Alternative paradigms ==
=== Self-perception theory===
In &quot;Self-perception: An alternative interpretation of cognitive dissonance phenomena&quot; (1967), the social psychologist Daryl Bem proposed the self-perception theory whereby people do not think much about their attitudes, even when engaged in a conflict with another person. The Theory of Self-perception proposes that people develop attitudes by observing their own behaviour, and concludes that their attitudes caused the behaviour observed by self-perception; especially true when internal cues either are ambiguous or weak. Therefore, the person is in the same position as an observer who must rely upon external cues to infer their inner state of mind. Self-perception theory proposes that people adopt attitudes without access to their states of mood and cognition.

As such, the experimental subjects of the Festinger and Carlsmith study (&quot;Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance&quot;, 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: &quot;Did you find the task interesting?&quot;, the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is what they told the questioner. Their replies suggested that the participants who were paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.

The theory of self-perception (Bem) and the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger) make identical predictions, but only the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts the presence of unpleasant arousal, of psychological distress, which were verified in laboratory experiments.

In &quot;The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective&quot; (Aronson, Berkowitz, 1969), Elliot Aronson linked cognitive dissonance to the self-concept: That mental stress arises when the conflicts among cognitions threatens the person&#x27;s positive self-image. This reinterpretation of the original Festinger and Carlsmith study, using the induced-compliance paradigm, proposed that the dissonance was between the cognitions &quot;I am an honest person.&quot; and &quot;I lied about finding the task interesting.&quot;

The study &quot;Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle?&quot; (Tedeschi, Schlenker, etc. 1971) reported that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, is how a person protects their public self-image. Moreover, the results reported in the study &quot;I&#x27;m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors&quot; (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.

=== Balance theory===

Fritz Heider proposed a motivational theory of attitudinal change that derives from the idea that humans are driven to establish and maintain psychological balance. The driving force for this balance is known as the &quot;consistency motive&quot;, which is an urge to maintain one&#x27;s values and beliefs consistent over time. Heider&#x27;s conception of psychological balance has been used in theoretical models measuring cognitive dissonance.

According to balance theory, there are three interacting elements: (1) the self (P), (2) another person (O), and (3) an element (X). These are each positioned at one vertex of a triangle and share two relations:

:&quot;Unit relations&quot; – things and people that belong together based on similarity, proximity, fate, etc.
:&quot;Sentiment relations&quot; – evaluations of people and things (liking, disliking)

Under balance theory, human beings seek a balanced state of relations among the three positions. This can take the form of three positives or two negatives and one positive:

:&quot;P = you&quot;
:&quot;O = your child&quot;
:&quot;X = picture your child drew&quot;
::&quot;I love my child&quot;
::&quot;She drew me this picture&quot;
::&quot;I love this picture&quot;

People also avoid unbalanced states of relations, such as three negatives or two positives and one negative:

:&quot;P = you&quot;
:&quot;O = John&quot;
:&quot;X = John&#x27;s dog&quot;
::&quot;I don&#x27;t like John&quot;
::&quot;John has a dog&quot;
::&quot;I don&#x27;t like the dog either&quot;

===Cost–benefit analysis===
In the study &quot;On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works&quot; (1969), Jules Dupuit reported that behaviors and cognitions can be understood from an economic perspective, wherein people engage in the systematic process of comparing the costs and benefits of a decision. The psychological process of cost-benefit comparisons helps the person to assess and justify the feasibility (spending money) of an economic decision, and is the basis for determining if the benefit outweighs the cost, and to what extent. Moreover, although the method of cost-benefit analysis functions in economic circumstances, men and women remain psychologically inefficient at comparing the costs against the benefits of their economic decision.

===Self-discrepancy theory===

E. Tory Higgins proposed that people have three selves, to which they compare themselves:

# &quot;Actual self&quot; – representation of the attributes the person believes themself to possess (basic self-concept)
# &quot;Ideal self&quot; – ideal attributes the person would like to possess (hopes, aspiration, motivations to change)
# &quot;Ought self&quot; – ideal attributes the person believes they should possess (duties, obligations, responsibilities)

When these self-guides are contradictory psychological distress (cognitive dissonance) results. People are motivated to reduce self-discrepancy (the gap between two self-guides).

===Averse consequences vs. inconsistency===
In the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio argued that dissonance was caused by aversive consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when they believe they have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.

===Criticism of the free-choice paradigm===
In the study &quot;How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm&quot; (Chen, Risen, 2010) the researchers criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate for the study of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.

Although the results of some follow-up studies (e.g. &quot;Do Choices Affect Preferences? Some Doubts and New Evidence&quot;, 2013) presented evidence of the unreliability of the rank-choice-rank method, the results of studies such as &quot;Neural Correlates of Cognitive Dissonance and Choice-induced Preference Change&quot; (2010) have not found the Choice-Rank-Choice method to be invalid, and indicate that making a choice can change the preferences of a person.

===Action–motivation model===
Festinger&#x27;s original theory did not seek to explain how dissonance works. Why is inconsistency so aversive? The action–motivation model seeks to answer this question. It proposes that inconsistencies in a person&#x27;s cognition cause mental stress because psychological inconsistency interferes with the person&#x27;s functioning in the real world. Among techniques for coping, the person may choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent with their current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to make it consistent with a current behavior; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person&#x27;s cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, they are then obligated to commit to that course of behavior.

Cognitive dissonance produces a state of negative affect, which motivates the person to reconsider the causative behavior in order to resolve the psychological inconsistency that caused the mental stress. As the affected person works towards a behavioral commitment, the motivational process then is activated in the left frontal cortex of the brain.

===Predictive dissonance model===
The predictive dissonance model proposes that cognitive dissonance is fundamentally related to the predictive coding (or predictive processing) model of cognition. A predictive processing account of the mind proposes that perception actively involves the use of a Bayesian hierarchy of acquired prior knowledge, which primarily serves the role of predicting incoming proprioceptive, interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory inputs. Therefore, the brain is an inference machine that attempts to actively predict and explain its sensations. Crucial to this inference is the minimization of prediction error. The predictive dissonance account proposes that the motivation for cognitive dissonance reduction is related to an organism&#x27;s active drive for reducing prediction error. Moreover, it proposes that human (and perhaps other animal) brains have evolved to selectively ignore contradictory information (as proposed by dissonance theory) to prevent the overfitting of their predictive cognitive models to local and thus non-generalizing conditions. The predictive dissonance account is highly compatible with the action-motivation model since, in practice, prediction error can arise from unsuccessful behavior.

== Neuroscience findings ==
Technological advances are allowing psychologists to study the biomechanics of cognitive dissonance.

=== Visualization ===
The study &quot;Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance&quot; (Van Veen, Krug, etc., 2009) identified the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the fMRI scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the fMRI scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.

The results of the neural scan experiment support the original theory of Cognitive Dissonance proposed by Festinger in 1957; and also support the psychological conflict theory, whereby the anterior cingulate functions, in counter-attitudinal response, to activate the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insular cortex; the degree of activation of said regions of the brain is predicted by the degree of change in the psychological attitude of the person.
As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study &quot;How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome&quot; (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person&#x27;s new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as &quot;The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making&quot; (2010) and &quot;How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification&quot; (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.

&quot;The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making&quot; (Jarcho, Berkman, Lieberman, 2010) applied the free-choice paradigm to fMRI examination of the brain&#x27;s decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The results indicated that the active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-inferior frontal gyrus, in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the ventral striatum, and that neural activity decreased in the anterior insula. That the neural activities of rationalization occur in seconds, without conscious deliberation on the part of the person; and that the brain engages in emotional responses whilst effecting decisions.

=== Emotional correlations ===
The results reported in &quot;Contributions from Research on Anger and Cognitive Dissonance to Understanding the Motivational Functions of Asymmetrical Frontal Brain Activity&quot; (Harmon-Jones, 2004) indicate that the occurrence of cognitive dissonance is associated with neural activity in the left frontal cortex, a brain structure also associated with the emotion of anger; moreover, functionally, anger motivates neural activity in the left frontal cortex. Applying a directional model of Approach motivation, the study &quot;Anger and the Behavioural Approach System&quot; (2003) indicated that the relationship between cognitive dissonance and anger is supported by neural activity in the left frontal cortex that occurs when a person takes control of the social situation causing the cognitive dissonance. Conversely, if the person cannot control or cannot change the psychologically stressful stimulation, they are without a motivation to change the circumstance, then there arise other, negative emotions to manage the cognitive dissonance, such as socially inappropriate behavior.

The anterior cingulate cortex activity increases when errors occur and are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept as a form of higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required students to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counter-choice may affect a person&#x27;s ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it were their completely voluntary choice. The researchers use EEG to analyze students before they wrote the essay, as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results show that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the anterior cingulate cortex, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.

=== The psychology of mental stress ===
The results reported in &quot;The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys&quot; (Egan, Santos, Bloom, 2007) indicated that there might be evolutionary force behind the reduction of cognitive dissonance in the actions of pre-school-age children and Capuchin monkeys when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object. The resulting choices of the human and simian subjects concorded with the theory of cognitive dissonance when the children and the monkeys each chose the novel choice-object instead of the choice-object not chosen in the first selection, despite every object having the same value.

The hypothesis of &quot;An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes&quot; (Harmon-Jones, Levy, 2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts that interfere with a goal-driven behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, the name of the color was printed in a color different from the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.

The study &quot;Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude&quot; (Jankowski, Takahashi, 2014) identified neural correlations to specific social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) as a measure of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person&#x27;s self-concept was threatened or when the person experienced embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).

=== Body image and health intervention ===
Some school programs discuss body image and eating disorders of children and adolescents. Disordered eating behaviors include binge eating episodes, excessive fasting, vomiting, and diet pills. National data from 2017 and 2018 highlights that since starting college, approximately 50 percent of college students reported becoming increasingly concerned with their weight and body shape. Studies examining eating disorders (ED) symptoms in college students reported that only 20 percent of those with positive ED got help. Less than 10 percent were diagnosed with an ED. This Body Project (BP) is rooted in the theory of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance occurs when a discrepancy emerges between beliefs and actions. The idea is centered around the notion that if beliefs and actions are inconsistent, then the individual will create a change to align the beliefs and actions. The BP uses cognitive dissonance to target ED, for example, social pressure from peers or not being satisfied with your appearance, to bring awareness and for a healthy and positive change, thoughts toward body image.

===Modeling in neural networks===

Artificial neural network models of cognition provide methods for integrating the results of empirical research about cognitive dissonance and attitudes into a single model that explains the formation of psychological attitudes and the mechanisms to change such attitudes. Among the artificial neural-network models that predict how cognitive dissonance might influence a person&#x27;s attitudes and behavior, are:

* Parallel constraint satisfaction processes
* The meta-cognitive model (MCM) of attitudes
* Adaptive connectionist model of cognitive dissonance
* Attitudes as constraint satisfaction model

<text>Transkei ( , meaning &quot;the area beyond [the river] Kei&quot;), officially the Republic of Transkei (), was an unrecognised state in the southeastern region of South Africa from 1976 to 1994. It was, along with Ciskei, a Bantustan for the Xhosa people, and operated as a nominally independent parliamentary democracy. Its capital was Umtata (renamed Mthatha in 2004).

Transkei represented a significant precedent and historic turning point in South Africa&#x27;s policy of apartheid and &quot;separate development&quot;; it was the first of four territories to be declared independent of South Africa. Throughout its existence, it remained an internationally unrecognised, diplomatically isolated, politically unstable &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state, which at one point broke relations with South Africa, the only country that acknowledged it as a legal entity. In 1994, it was reintegrated into its larger neighbour and became part of the Eastern Cape province.

==History==
===Establishment===
The South African government set up the area as one of the two &quot;homelands&quot; for Xhosa-speaking people in Cape Province, the other being Ciskei; it was given nominal autonomy by Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd in 1963. Although the first election was contested and won by the Democratic Party, whose founder Chief Victor Poto was opposed to the notion of Bantustan independence, the government was formed by the Transkei National Independence Party. Of the 109 members in the regional parliament, 45 were elected and 64 were held by ex officio chiefs.

The entity became a nominally independent state in 1976 with its capital at Umtata (now Mthatha), although it was recognised only by South Africa and later by the other nominally independent republics within the TBVC-system. Chief Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima was Transkei&#x27;s Prime Minister until 1979, when he assumed the office of President, a position he held until 1986.

====International reaction====
South African prime minister B. J. Vorster justified the declaration of Transkei as an independent republic by referring to &quot;the right of every people to have full control over its own affairs&quot; and wished &quot;Transkei and its leaders God&#x27;s richest blessings on the road ahead.&quot;

A press release by the African National Congress at the time rejected the Transkei&#x27;s independence and condemned it as &quot;designed to consolidate the inhuman policies of apartheid&quot;. During its thirty-first session, in resolution A/RES/31/6 A, the General Assembly of the United Nations referred to Transkei&#x27;s &quot;sham independence&quot; as &quot;invalid,&quot; re-iterated its labelling of South Africa as a &quot;racist régime,&quot; and called upon &quot;all [g]overnments to deny any form of recognition to the so-called independent Transkei.&quot; An article published in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; opined that though Transkei declared independence theoretically as a &quot;free Black state&quot;, Matanzima ruled as the dictator of a one-party state. He banned local opposition parties and bought farmlands for himself and his family offered by the South African government at subsidised prices.

Matanzima published &quot;Independence my Way&quot; in 1976, a book in which he argued that true liberation could only be gained through a confederation of black states; he described Transkei as a positive precedent and maintained that the liberation struggle chosen by the African National Congress would not be successful.

The United Nations Security Council supported moves not to recognise Transkei, and in Resolution 402 (1976) condemned moves by South Africa to pressure Lesotho to recognise Transkei by closing its borders with the country.

===Troubled existence===
Throughout its existence, Transkei&#x27;s economy remained dependent on that of its larger neighbour, with the local population being recruited as workers into South Africa&#x27;s Rand mines.

Because of a territorial dispute, Matanzima announced on 10 April 1978 that Transkei would break all diplomatic ties with South Africa, including a unilateral withdrawal from the non-aggression pact between the two governments, and ordered that all South African Defence Force members seconded to the Transkei Defence Force should leave. This created the unique situation of a country refusing to deal with the only internationally recognised nation it was recognised by. Matanzima soon backed down in the face of Transkei&#x27;s dependence on South African economic aid.

During his rule, Matanzima arrested state officials and journalists at will; in late 1979, he detained the head of the newly formed &quot;Democratic Progressive Party&quot;, Sabata Dalindyebo, king of the Thembu people and vocal opponent of apartheid, for violating the dignity and injuring the reputation of the president. Dalindyebo went into exile in Zambia, a move that marked the end of official opposition politics in Transkei, and in the 1981 election, the ruling &quot;Transkei National Independence Party&quot; was re-elected, gaining 100% of all open seats.

On 20 February 1986, faced with South African evidence of corruption, Matanzima was forced to retire as president. He was succeeded by his brother George. Kaiser Matanzima was still described as Transkei&#x27;s effective leader for a time, but soon the two fell out and Kaiser was temporarily detained in the Transkei gaols in 1987; upon release, he was restricted to Qamata.

In 1987, Transkei, a larger, wealthier and more populous entity, had long sought the annexation of Ciskei, and had undertaken a series of military raids on Ciskei. This included an attack on leader Lennox Sebe&#x27;s compound, with the apparent goal of taking him hostage, in order to force a merger of the two Bantustans. The South African government intervened to warn the Transkei government off.

General Bantu Holomisa of the Transkei Defence Force forced the resignation and exile of Prime Minister George Matanzima in October 1987 and then overthrew Matanzima&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Stella Sigcau in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état in December 1987. Holomisa became the Head of State, and the Transkei was from that point onwards effectively in (often uneasy) alliance with the African National Congress and provided a relatively safe area for the ANC&#x27;s activities. In 1990, Holomisa himself evaded a failed attempt to be ousted from his post, and when asked about the fate of his opponents, he claimed that they had died in the ensuing battles with &quot;TDF&quot; soldiers. It was later found that those deemed responsible for the foiled coup had only suffered minor injuries, but were subsequently executed without trial.

===Dissolution===
The Transkei government was a participant in the CODESA negotiations for a new South Africa. The territory was reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994, and the area became part of the Eastern Cape province.

The Transkei Penal Code, 1983 still applies between the Kei River and the border with KwaZulu-Natal, and persons who are charged with crimes in that area are prosecuted under the code.

==Government and politics==
Nominally, the Republic of Transkei was a parliamentary democracy which allowed for a multi-party system. During its existence, six parties registered to compete in elections at different points of its history. Until the military coup of 1987, the Transkei National Independence Party remained the ruling party, while the Transkei People&#x27;s Freedom Party constituted the official opposition. Because its founder, Cromwell Diko, was a former member of the ruling party, and due to its continued support of President Matanzima&#x27;s policies, there is a widely held belief that it was actually initiated by Matanzima himself to give the impression of free elections when in fact there were none. Other parties that existed never gained any representation in parliament.

According to the Constitution of Transkei, parliament consisted of the president in joint session with the National Assembly and its laws and legislative decisions were immune to judicial review. Seventy-five of its members were elected by popular vote from the various districts Transkei&#x27;s territory was divided into. The remaining members were unelected Paramount Chiefs and ex officio chiefs whose number per district was enshrined in the constitution.

===Citizenship===

With the establishment of the republic, the citizenry consisted of all those who had been holding the citizenship of the former territory of Transkei. Individuals were given no choice in this matter as the Transkeian constitution was a legally binding act; for the future, it provided citizenship regulations based on both &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; and &quot;jus soli&quot;. Citizenship by descent was given along the paternal line, regardless of a person&#x27;s place of birth; in addition, any individual born within the republic&#x27;s territory was eligible for citizenship, excluding those whose father held diplomatic immunity or was deemed an illegal immigrant and whose mother was a non-citizen. Dual citizenship at birth was not permitted, and renunciation of one&#x27;s citizenship was legally possible, but rendered the individual stateless in most cases. In effect, the regulations thus created an almost homogeneous population of Xhosa ethnicity, though exceptions existed.

===Flag===
The flag of Transkei is a triband. The colours are (from the top down) ochre red, white, and green.

==Geography and demographics==

The Transkei consisted of three disconnected sections with a total area covering . The large main section was bordered by the Umtamvuna River in the north and the Great Kei River in the south. The Indian Ocean and the Drakensberg mountain range, including parts of the landlocked kingdom of Lesotho, served as the eastern and western frontiers. A further two small sections occurred as landlocked isolates within South Africa. One of these was in the north-west, along the Orange River adjoining south-western Lesotho, and the other in the uMzimkhulu area to the east, each reflecting colonially designated tribal areas where Xhosa speaking peoples predominated. A large portion of the area was mountainous and not suitable for agriculture.

The territorial dispute with South Africa that led to the break in relations was a patch of territory called East Griqualand (which was situated between the main and eastern segments of Transkei with its northern limit at the Lesotho border). South Africa put East Griqualand under the jurisdiction of the Cape Province instead of Transkei, thus making it an exclave of the Cape Province.

The majority of the population was Xhosa-speaking, and according to the &quot;Constitution of the Republic of Transkei,&quot; Xhosa was the sole official language, but laws had to be translated into Sotho and English in order for them to come into effect, and Afrikaans was permissible in court proceedings and for other administrative purposes. In addition, many thousands of northern Transkei residents spoke a small hybrid Nguni–Sotho language, called Phuthi.

Conflicting data exist about the number of inhabitants. According to the &quot;South African Encyclopaedia,&quot; the total population of the Transkei increased from 2,487,000 to 3,005,000 between 1960 and 1970. An estimate of 1982 puts the number at about 2.3 million, with approximately 400,000 citizens residing permanently outside the territory&#x27;s borders. Fewer than 10,000 individuals were of European descent, and the urbanisation-rate for the entire population was around 5%.

==Security forces==
The &quot;Transkei Defence Force (TDF)&quot; was formed in October 1976 and numbered about 2,000, including one infantry battalion and an air wing with two light transporters and two helicopters. By 1993, the number of troops had risen to 4,000. Initial training was provided by the South African Defence Force, and despite its diplomatic isolation, the government of Transkei received advice from and collaborated with Israeli counterinsurgency experts. Armscor/Krygkor was its main supplier of weaponry.

After breaking all diplomatic ties with South Africa, President Matanzima announced construction-plans for an international airport by an unnamed French consortium in order for &quot;arms and troops from other countries&quot; to be brought into Transkei without touching South African soil, but did not elaborate on where those resources would originate.

During its last days in 1994, the &quot;Transkei Police&quot; had 4,993 police officers, operating from 61 police stations throughout the territory.

With the dissolution of Transkei in 1994, the &quot;TDF&quot; and the &quot;Transkei Police&quot; were incorporated into the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, respectively.

<text>Vincent Andrew Schiavelli (; November 11, 1948 – December 26, 2005) was an American character actor noted for his work on stage, screen, and television. Described as an &quot;instantly recognizable sad-faced actor&quot;, he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in childhood.

Schiavelli gained fame as a character actor, mainly in supporting roles. He was a regular in the films of Miloš Forman including as Fredrickson in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), Salieri&#x27;s valet in &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984), Jean in &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989), Chester in &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; (1996), and ABC executive Maynard Smith in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999).

His other roles include Mr. Vargas in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), John O&#x27;Connor in &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; (1982), the Subway Ghost in &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990), Organ Grinder in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), Lanny in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Humbug&quot; (1995), Dr. Kaufman in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), and Buggy Ding Dong in &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; (2002). Schiavelli is the subject of the biographical film, &quot;Tanti Beddi Cosi&quot; (English, &quot;Many Beautiful Things&quot;) about his return to Polizzi Generosa, the historically significant ancestral village of his grandfather.

==Early life==
Schiavelli was born in Brooklyn, New York City to Sicilian-Americans John Schiavelli and Katherine Coco. He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn. He was raised in the large Sicilian neighborhood of Bushwick, Brooklyn; the stories and recipes of which he shared in his 1998 book &quot;Bruculinu, Remembrances of Sicilian American Brooklyn.&quot; He studied acting through the theatre program at New York University and began performing on stage in the 1960s.

==Career==
Schiavelli&#x27;s first film role occurred in Miloš Forman&#x27;s 1971 production &quot;Taking Off&quot;, where he played a counselor who taught parents of runaway teens to smoke marijuana to better understand their children&#x27;s experiences. Schiavelli&#x27;s aptitude and distinctive appearance soon provided him with a steady stream of supporting roles, often in Forman&#x27;s films, including &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot;, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, &quot;Valmont&quot;, and the 1999 biopic &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.

He played Mr. Vargas, the biology teacher, in the 1982 comedy &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, a role he reprised in the 1986 television spin-off &quot;Fast Times&quot;. He was cast in a similar role in &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; in which he played Mr. Kerber, a geometry teacher.

In 1987, he starred alongside Tim Conway in the short film comedy &quot;Dorf on Golf&quot;, and then &quot;Dorf and the First Games of Mount Olympus&quot; in 1988. In 1990, he played the Subway Ghost in &quot;Ghost&quot; and in 1992, he played in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman Returns&quot; as the &quot;Organ Grinder&quot;, one of the Penguin&#x27;s henchmen. He appeared as another villain in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), as a silent monk in &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979), and as John O&#x27;Connor, one of the evil Red Lectroids in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;. In 1994 he appeared in the music video for ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;, alongside Fairuza Balk and in 1997, was named one of America&#x27;s best character actors by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. He also made several voice appearances in the animated television show &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. In 2002, he played a children&#x27;s television show host turned heroin addict named Buggy Ding Dong in &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot;.

His first television role came in 1972 as Peter Panama in &quot;The Corner Bar&quot;, the first sustained portrayal of a gay character on American television. His other television credits include &quot;The Moneychangers&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Benson,&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot; as the priest who marries Latka and Simka. He appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Arsenal of Freedom&quot; as a holographic salesman, on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as a research scientist who conspires to steal a top-secret prototype weapon from his employer, and in an uncredited role in an episode of &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. In 1987 he appeared as Lyle, a gangster, in the &quot;MacGyver&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Soft Touch&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, he played Leo Atkins, a homeless Vietnam War veteran accused of murder in the Season 1 episode &quot;Innocent Man&quot;. In &quot;The X-Files&quot;, he played Lanny, a man with an underdeveloped conjoined twin in the Season 2 episode &quot;Humbug&quot;.

Schiavelli was honorary co-chair of the National Marfan Foundation, an organization that serves those affected by Marfan syndrome, a condition that Schiavelli had.

Schiavelli also performed in a few video games, including &quot;&quot; (as Harkonnen Mentat Yanich Kobal) and as Dr. Hellman in the video game &quot;Corpse Killer&quot;.

==Personal life==

Schiavelli was married twice. He and his first wife, actress Allyce Beasley, were married from 1985 to 1988. They appeared together in an episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, Beasley&#x27;s television series. They had one son, composer Andrea Schiavelli. Vincent Schiavelli then married harpist Carol Sue Mukhalian on October 23, 1992. They remained married until his death.

==Death==

Schiavelli died of lung cancer on December 26, 2005, at the age of 57 at his home in Polizzi Generosa, the Sicilian town where his grandfather Andrea Coco was born, and about which he wrote in his 2002 book &quot;Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa&quot; (). He was buried at Polizzi Generosa Cemetery near Palermo, Sicily.

<text>Dragan Marušič (born 1953, Koper, Slovenia) is a Slovene mathematician. Marušič obtained his BSc in technical mathematics from the University of Ljubljana in 1976, and his PhD from the University of Reading in 1981 under the supervision of Crispin Nash-Williams.

Marušič has published extensively, and has supervised seven PhD students (as of 2013). He served as the third rector of the University of Primorska from 2011 to 2019, a university he lobbied to have established in his home town of Koper. His research focuses on topics in algebraic graph theory, particularly the symmetry of graphs and the action of finite groups on combinatorial objects. He is regarded as the founder of the Slovenian school of research in algebraic graph theory and permutation groups.

==Education and career==
From 1968 to 1972 Marušič attended gymnasium in Koper. He studied undergraduate mathematics at the University of Ljubljana, graduating in 1976. He completed his PhD in 1981 in England, at the University of Reading under the supervision of Crispin Nash-Williams.

After completing a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Reading in 1983, Marušič spent a year teaching high school mathematics in Koper. He worked for one year at the University of Minnesota Duluth as an assistant professor, and then spent three years at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from 1985 to 1988. In 1988, he returned to Slovenia to work at the University of Ljubljana, where he rose quickly through the ranks, becoming a full professor in 1994. He also held the post of vice-rector of student affairs there from 1989 to 1991. In 1991-92 he spent a year as a Fulbright scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Marušič maintains his post at the University of Ljubljana, although he has also held an appointment at the University of Primorska since 2004, shortly after its founding. He has increasingly devoted his time to the newer university, where he established the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Information Technologies (UP FAMNIT). He served as the dean of that faculty from 2007 to 2011. He was elected in 2011 as the third rector of the University of Primorska, a position which he held until 2019.

Marušič has supervised seven PhD students, and has supervised or co-supervised six post-doctoral fellows, in addition to numerous master&#x27;s and honours students.
He is one of the two founding editors and editors-in-chief (with Tomaž Pisanski) of the journal &quot;Ars Mathematica Contemporanea&quot;.

==Achievements and honours==

Marušič is regarded as the founder of the Slovenian school of research in algebraic graph theory and permutation groups.

In 2002 he received the Zois Award, the highest scientific award in Slovenia, for his achievements in the field of graph theory and algebra. Since 2010, he has been a member of the committee that selects the Zois Award recipients, as well as the recipients of other scientific honours from the government of Slovenia.

==Research==

In his research, Marušič has focused on the actions of permutation groups on graphs. Some of his major contributions have been on the topics of the existence of semiregular automorphisms (see group action for an explanation of this) of vertex-transitive graphs, the existence of Hamiltonian paths and cycles in vertex-transitive graphs, and the structures of semi-symmetric graphs and half-transitive graphs. With co-authors, he proved that the Gray graph on 54 vertices is the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph.

He has well over 100 publications.

==Personal life==
Marušič is married and has two sons. His brother, Dorijan Marušič was the Minister of Health for Slovenia.

<doc id="169312" wikidata="Q10428" url="?curid=169312" title="Monoceros">
<text>Monoceros (Greek: , &quot;unicorn&quot;) is a faint constellation on the celestial equator. Its definition is attributed to the 17th-century cartographer Petrus Plancius. It is bordered by Orion to the west, Gemini to the north, Canis Major to the south, and Hydra to the east. Other bordering constellations include Canis Minor, Lepus, and Puppis.

== Features ==
===Stars===

Monoceros contains only a few fourth magnitude stars, making it difficult to see with the naked eye. Alpha Monocerotis has a visual magnitude of 3.93, while for Gamma Monocerotis it is 3.98.

Beta Monocerotis is a triple star system; the three stars form a fixed triangle. The visual magnitudes of the stars are 4.7, 5.2, and 6.1. William Herschel discovered it in 1781 and called it &quot;one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens&quot;.

Epsilon Monocerotis is a fixed binary, with visual magnitudes of 4.5 and 6.5.

S Monocerotis, or 15 Monocerotis, is a bluish white variable star and is located at the center of NGC 2264. The variation in its magnitude is slight (4.2–4.6). It has a companion star of visual magnitude 8.

V838 Monocerotis, a variable red supergiant star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased by a factor of 10,000 in one day. After the outburst was over, the Hubble Space Telescope was able to observe a light echo, which illuminated the dust surrounding the star.

Monoceros also contains Plaskett&#x27;s Star, a massive binary system whose combined mass is estimated, per 2008 calculations, to be almost 100 solar masses.

Monoceros is the location of the binary system Scholz&#x27;s Star, host to a red dwarf primary and brown dwarf secondary; the system performed a close flypast of the Solar System approximately 70,000 years ago, travelling within 120,000 astronomical units of the Sun within the Oort cloud.

One of the nearest known black holes to the Solar System is in this constellation. The binary star system A0620-00 in the constellation of Monoceros is at a distance of roughly 3,300 light-years (1,000 parsecs) away. The black hole is estimated to be 6.6 solar masses.

===Planets===
Monoceros contains two super-Earth exoplanets in one planetary system: CoRoT-7b was detected by the CoRoT satellite and CoRoT-7c was detected by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, CoRoT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth&#x27;s). Both planets in this system were discovered in 2009.

===Deep-sky objects===
Part of the galactic plane goes through Monoceros, so background galaxies are concealed by interstellar dust. Monoceros contains many clusters and nebulae; most notable among them are:
* Messier 50, an open cluster
* The Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237, 2238, 2239, and 2246) is a diffuse nebula in Monoceros. It has an overall magnitude of 6.0 and is 4900 light-years from Earth. The Rosette Nebula, over 100 light-years in diameter, has an associated star cluster and possesses many Bok globules in its dark areas. It was independently discovered in the 1880s by Lewis Swift (early 1880s) and Edward Emerson Barnard (1883) as they hunted for comets.
* The Christmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264) is another open cluster in Monoceros. Named for its resemblance to a Christmas tree, it is fairly bright at an overall magnitude of 3.9; it is 2400 light-years from Earth. The variable star S Monocerotis represents the tree&#x27;s trunk, while the variable star V429 Monocerotis represents its top.
* The Cone Nebula (NGC 2264), associated with the Christmas Tree Cluster, is a very dim nebula that contains a dark conic structure. It appears clearly in photographs, but is very elusive in a telescope. The nebula contains several Herbig–Haro objects, which are small irregularly variable nebulae. They are associated with protostars.
* NGC 2254 is an open cluster with an overall magnitude of 9.7, 7100 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class f and Trumpler class I 2 p cluster, meaning that it appears to be a fairly rich cluster overall, though it has fewer than 50 stars. It appears distinct from the background star field and is very concentrated at its center; its stars range moderately in brightness.
* Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula (NGC 2261) is a nebula with an approximate magnitude of 10, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is named for Edwin Hubble, and was discovered in 1783 by Herschel. Hubble&#x27;s Variable Nebula is illuminated by R Monocerotis, a young variable star embedded in the nebula; the star&#x27;s unique interaction with the material in the nebula makes it both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula. One hypothesis regarding their interaction is that the nebula and its illuminating star are a very early stage planetary system.
*IC 447, a reflection nebula.

== History ==

In Western astronomy, Monoceros is a relatively modern constellation, not one of Ptolemy&#x27;s 48 in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by the cartographer Petrus Plancius in 1612 or 1613 and it was later charted by German astronomer Jakob Bartsch as Unicornu on his star chart of 1624.

German astronomers Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers and Ludwig Ideler
indicate (according to Richard Hinckley Allen&#x27;s allegations) that the constellation may be older, quoting an astrological work
from 1564 that mentioned &quot;the second horse between the Twins and the Crab has many stars, but not very bright&quot;; these references may ultimately be due to the 13th century Scotsman Michael Scot, but refer to a horse and not a unicorn, and its position does not quite match. Joseph Scaliger (died 1609) is reported to have found Monoceros on an ancient Persian sphere. Astronomer Camille Flammarion (died 1925) believed that a former constellation, Neper (the &quot;Auger&quot;), occupied the part of that sky now deemed Monoceros and Microscopium, but this is disputed.

Chinese asterisms Sze Fūh, the Four Great Canals; Kwan Kew; and Wae Choo, the Outer Kitchen, all lay within the boundaries of Monoceros.

<doc id="169315" wikidata="Q913548" url="?curid=169315" title="Herbes de Provence">
<text>(; , ) is a mixture of dried herbs considered typical of the Provence region of southeastern France. Formerly simply a descriptive term, commercial blends started to be sold under this name in the 1970s. These blends often contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and more. Lavender leaves are also sometimes included, especially in North American formulations. The herb mixture is typically used with grilled foods, stews, and soups.

==History==

Provençal cuisine uses many herbs which are often characterized collectively as &quot;herbes de Provence&quot;, but not in specific combinations, and not sold as a mixture. It was in the 1970s that homogenised mixtures were formulated by spice wholesalers, including Ducros in France, which is now part of McCormick &amp; Company.

== Origin ==
The commercial name &quot;herbes de Provence&quot; has no Protected Geographical Status or other legal definition. Indeed, only 10% of &quot;herbes de Provence&quot; sold in France are produced in France; 95% come from Central European (especially Poland) and Eastern European (notably Albania) countries, the Maghreb, or China. &quot;Herbes de Provence&quot; are often sold in larger bags than other herbs, and the price in Provence is considerably lower than for other herbs.

==Herbs used==
These mixtures typically contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and other herbs. In the North American market, lavender leaves are also typically included, though lavender does not appear in the recipes in Jean-Baptiste Reboul&#x27;s 1910 compendium of Provençal cooking. The Label Rouge definition is 19% thyme, 27% rosemary, 27% savory, and 27% oregano. 

They may also contain other herbs such as basil, bay leaf, hyssop, tarragon, summer savory, parsley, fennel, and chervil.

==Uses==
&quot;Herbes de Provence&quot; are used to flavour grilled foods such as fish and meat, and vegetable stews. The mixture can be added to foods before, during, or after cooking, or mixed with cooking oil before cooking. They can also be sprinkled on raw foods such as vinaigrettes, salads or fresh cheese.

<doc id="169319" wikidata="Q875267" url="?curid=169319" title="Necessity and sufficiency">
<text>In logic and mathematics, necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe a conditional or implicational relationship between two statements. For example, in the conditional statement: &quot;If then &quot;, is necessary for , because the truth of is guaranteed by the truth of . (Equivalently, it is impossible to have without , or the falsity of ensures the falsity of .) Similarly, is sufficient for , because being true always implies that is true, but not being true does not always imply that is not true.

In general, a necessary condition is one (possibly one of several conditions) that must be present in order for another condition to occur, while a sufficient condition is one that produces the said condition. The assertion that a statement is a &quot;necessary &quot;and&quot; sufficient&quot; condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true, or simultaneously false.

In ordinary English (also natural language) &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;sufficient&quot; indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. For example, being a male is a necessary condition for being a brother, but it is not sufficient—while being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.
Any conditional statement consists of at least one sufficient condition and at least one necessary condition.

In data analytics, necessity and sufficiency can refer to different causal logics, where necessary condition analysis and qualitative comparative analysis can be used as analytical techniques for examining necessity and sufficiency of conditions for a particular outcome of interest.

==Definitions==

In the conditional statement, &quot;if &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;N&quot;, the expression represented by &quot;S&quot; is called the antecedent, and the expression represented by &quot;N&quot; is called the consequent. This conditional statement may be written in several equivalent ways, such as &quot;N&quot; if &quot;S&quot;, &quot;S&quot; only if &quot;N&quot;, &quot;S&quot; implies &quot;N&quot;, &quot;N&quot; is implied by &quot;S&quot;, , and &quot;N&quot; whenever &quot;S&quot;&quot;.

In the above situation of &quot;N whenever S,&quot; &quot;N&quot; is said to be a necessary condition for &quot;S&quot;. In common language, this is equivalent to saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent &quot;N&quot; &quot;must&quot; be true—if &quot;S&quot; is to be true (see third column of &quot;truth table&quot; immediately below). In other words, the antecedent &quot;S&quot; cannot be true without &quot;N&quot; being true. For example, in order for someone to be called Socrates, it is necessary for that someone to be Named. Similarly, in order for human beings to live, it is necessary that they have air.

One can also say &quot;S&quot; is a sufficient condition for &quot;N&quot; (refer again to the third column of the truth table immediately below). If the conditional statement is true, then if &quot;S&quot; is true, &quot;N&quot; must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or be false. In common terms, &quot;the truth of &quot;S&quot; guarantees the truth of &quot;N&quot;&quot;. For example, carrying on from the previous example, one can say that knowing that someone is called Socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a Name.

A necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications formula_1 and formula_2 (the latter of which can also be written as formula_3) hold. The first implication suggests that &quot;S&quot; is a sufficient condition for &quot;N&quot;, while the second implication suggests that &quot;S&quot; is a necessary condition for &quot;N&quot;. This is expressed as &quot;&quot;S&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;N&quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;S&quot; if and only if &quot;N&quot; &quot;, or formula_4.

==Necessity==

The assertion that &quot;Q&quot; is necessary for &quot;P&quot; is colloquially equivalent to &quot;&quot;P&quot; cannot be true unless &quot;Q&quot; is true&quot; or &quot;if Q is false, then P is false&quot;. By contraposition, this is the same thing as &quot;whenever &quot;P&quot; is true, so is &quot;Q&quot;&quot;.

The logical relation between &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is expressed as &quot;if &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;Q&quot; and denoted &quot;P&quot; ⇒ &quot;Q&quot; (&quot;P&quot; implies &quot;Q&quot;). It may also be expressed as any of &quot;P&quot; only if &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, if &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; whenever &quot;P&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; when &quot;P&quot;&quot;. One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition (i.e., individually necessary and jointly sufficient), as shown in Example 5.

;Example 1: For it to be true that &quot;John is a bachelor&quot;, it is necessary that it be also true that he is
:# unmarried,
:# male,
:# adult,
:since to state &quot;John is a bachelor&quot; implies John has each of those three additional predicates.

;Example 2: For the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.

;Example 3:Consider thunder, the sound caused by lightning. One says that thunder is necessary for lightning, since lightning never occurs without thunder. Whenever there is lightning, there is thunder. The thunder &quot;does not cause&quot; the lightning (since lightning causes thunder), but because lightning always comes with thunder, we say that thunder is necessary for lightning. (That is, in its formal sense, necessity doesn&#x27;t imply causality.)

;Example 4:Being at least 30 years old is necessary for serving in the U.S. Senate. If you are under 30 years old, then it is impossible for you to be a senator. That is, if you are a senator, it follows that you must be at least 30 years old.

;Example 5:In algebra, for some set &quot;S&quot; together with an operation formula_5 to form a group, it is necessary that formula_5 be associative. It is also necessary that &quot;S&quot; include a special element &quot;e&quot; such that for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, it is the case that &quot;e&quot; formula_5 &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; formula_5 &quot;e&quot; both equal &quot;x&quot;. It is also necessary that for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot; there exist a corresponding element &quot;x″&quot;, such that both &quot;x&quot; formula_5 &quot;x″&quot; and &quot;x″&quot; formula_5 &quot;x&quot; equal the special element &quot;e&quot;. None of these three necessary conditions by itself is sufficient, but the conjunction of the three is.

==Sufficiency==

If &quot;P&quot; is sufficient for &quot;Q&quot;, then knowing &quot;P&quot; to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that &quot;Q&quot; is true; however, knowing &quot;P&quot; to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that &quot;Q&quot; is false.

The logical relation is, as before, expressed as &quot;if &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;P&quot; ⇒ &quot;Q&quot;. This can also be expressed as &quot;P&quot; only if &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;Q&quot;&quot; or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition (i.e., individually sufficient and jointly necessary), as illustrated in example 5.

;Example 1:&quot;John is a king&quot; implies that John is male. So knowing that John is a king is sufficient to knowing that he is a male.

;Example 2:A number&#x27;s being divisible by 4 is sufficient (but not necessary) for it to be even, but being divisible by 2 is both sufficient and necessary for it to be even.

;Example 3: An occurrence of thunder is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of lightning in the sense that hearing thunder, and unambiguously recognizing it as such, justifies concluding that there has been a lightning bolt.

;Example 4:If the U.S. Congress passes a bill, the president&#x27;s signing of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the president did not sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential veto, does not mean that the bill has not become a law (for example, it could still have become a law through a congressional override).

;Example 5:That the center of a playing card should be marked with a single large spade (♠) is sufficient for the card to be an ace. Three other sufficient conditions are that the center of the card be marked with a single diamond (♦), heart (♥), or club (♣). None of these conditions is necessary to the card&#x27;s being an ace, but their disjunction is, since no card can be an ace without fulfilling at least (in fact, exactly) one of these conditions.

==Relationship between necessity and sufficiency==
A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other. For instance, &quot;being a mammal&quot; (&quot;N&quot;) is necessary but not sufficient to &quot;being human&quot; (&quot;S&quot;), and that a number formula_11 &quot;is rational&quot; (&quot;S&quot;) is sufficient but not necessary to formula_11 &quot;being a real number&quot; (&quot;N&quot;) (since there are real numbers that are not rational).

A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, &quot;today is the Fourth of July&quot; is a necessary and sufficient condition for &quot;today is Independence Day in the United States&quot;. Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix &quot;M&quot; is that &quot;M&quot; has a nonzero determinant.

Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are dual to one another. For any statements &quot;S&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, the assertion that &quot;&quot;N&quot; is necessary for &quot;S&quot; is equivalent to the assertion that &quot;S&quot; is sufficient for &quot;N&quot;&quot;. Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using &quot;and&quot;) of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using &quot;or&quot;) of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity. For a third facet, identify every mathematical predicate &quot;N&quot; with the set &quot;T&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) of objects, events, or statements for which &quot;N&quot; holds true; then asserting the necessity of &quot;N&quot; for &quot;S&quot; is equivalent to claiming that &quot;T&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is a superset of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), while asserting the sufficiency of &quot;S&quot; for &quot;N&quot; is equivalent to claiming that &quot;T&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is a subset of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;N&quot;).

Psychologically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are both key aspects of the classical view of concepts. Under the classical theory of concepts, how human minds represent a category X, gives rise to a set of individually necessary conditions that define X. Together, these individually necessary conditions are sufficient to be X. This contrasts with the probabilistic theory of concepts which states that no defining feature is necessary or sufficient, rather that categories resemble a family tree structure.

==Simultaneous necessity and sufficiency==
To say that &quot;P&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;Q&quot; is to say two things:
# that &quot;P&quot; is necessary for &quot;Q&quot;, formula_13, and that &quot;P&quot; is sufficient for &quot;Q&quot;, formula_14.
# equivalently, it may be understood to say that &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is necessary for the other, formula_15, which can also be stated as each &quot;is sufficient for&quot; or &quot;implies&quot; the other.

One may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement &quot;&quot;P&quot; if and only if &quot;Q&quot;&quot;, which is denoted by formula_16, whereas cases tell us that formula_16 is identical to formula_15.

For example, in graph theory a graph &quot;G&quot; is called bipartite if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; in such a way that every edge of &quot;G&quot; has one endpoint of each color. And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles. Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely. A philosopher might characterize this state of affairs thus: &quot;Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension, they have identical extension.

In mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form &quot;&quot;P&quot; is true if and only if &quot;Q&quot; is true&quot;. 

Because, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. formula_13 is equivalent to formula_20, if &quot;P&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;Q&quot;, then &quot;Q&quot; is necessary and sufficient for &quot;P&quot;. We can write formula_21 and say that the statements &quot;&quot;P&quot; is true if and only if &quot;Q&quot;, is true&quot; and &quot;&quot;Q&quot; is true if and only if &quot;P&quot; is true&quot; are equivalent.

<text>Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a tiny radio transponder called a tag, a radio receiver, and a transmitter. When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader. This number can be used to track inventory goods.

Passive tags are powered by energy from the RFID reader&#x27;s interrogating radio waves. Active tags are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader, up to hundreds of meters.

Unlike a barcode, the tag does not need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC).

RFID tags are used in many industries. For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line, RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses, and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals. Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.

Since RFID tags can be attached to physical money, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns. These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues.

In 2014, the world RFID market was worth US$8.89 billion, up from US$7.77 billion in 2013 and US$6.96 billion in 2012. This figure includes tags, readers, and software/services for RFID cards, labels, fobs, and all other form factors. The market value is expected to rise from US$12.08 billion in 2020 to US$16.23 billion by 2029.

==History==

In 1945, Leon Theremin invented the &quot;Thing&quot;, a listening device for the Soviet Union which retransmitted incident radio waves with the added audio information. Sound waves vibrated a diaphragm which slightly altered the shape of the resonator, which modulated the reflected radio frequency. Even though this device was a covert listening device, rather than an identification tag, it is considered to be a predecessor of RFID because it was passive, being energised and activated by waves from an outside source.

Similar technology, such as the Identification friend or foe transponder, was routinely used by the Allies and Germany in World War II to identify aircraft as friendly or hostile. Transponders are still used by most powered aircraft. An early work exploring RFID is the landmark 1948 paper by Harry Stockman, who predicted that &quot;Considerable research and development work has to be done before the remaining basic problems in reflected-power communication are solved, and before the field of useful applications is explored.&quot;

Mario Cardullo&#x27;s device, patented on January 23, 1973, was the first true ancestor of modern RFID, as it was a passive radio transponder with memory. The initial device was passive, powered by the interrogating signal, and was demonstrated in 1971 to the New York Port Authority and other potential users. It consisted of a transponder with 16 bit memory for use as a toll device. The basic Cardullo patent covers the use of radio frequency (RF), sound and light as transmission carriers. The original business plan presented to investors in 1969 showed uses in transportation (automotive vehicle identification, automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, vehicle routing, vehicle performance monitoring), banking (electronic chequebook, electronic credit card), security (personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history).

In 1973, an early demonstration of &quot;reflected power&quot; (modulated backscatter) RFID tags, both passive and semi-passive, was performed by Steven Depp, Alfred Koelle and Robert Freyman at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The portable system operated at 915 MHz and used 12-bit tags. This technique is used by the majority of today&#x27;s UHFID and microwave RFID tags.

In 1983, the first patent to be associated with the abbreviation RFID was granted to Charles Walton.

In 1996, the first patent for a batteryless RFID passive tag with limited interference was granted to David Everett, John Frech, Theodore Wright, and Kelly Rodriguez.

==Design==
A radio-frequency identification system uses &quot;tags&quot;, or &quot;labels&quot; attached to the objects to be identified. Two-way radio transmitter-receivers called &quot;interrogators&quot; or &quot;readers&quot; send a signal to the tag and read its response.

===Tags===
RFID tags are made out of three pieces: 
* a micro chip (an integrated circuit which stores and processes information and modulates and demodulates radio-frequency (RF) signals)
* an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal 
* a substrate

The tag information is stored in a non-volatile memory. The RFID tags includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.

RFID tags can be either passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an on-board battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive tag has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission.

Tags may either be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user. Field programmable tags may be write-once, read-multiple; &quot;blank&quot; tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user.

The RFID tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.

===Readers===
RFID systems can be classified by the type of tag and reader. There are 3 types:

* A Passive Reader Active Tag (PRAT) system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The reception range of a PRAT system reader can be adjusted from , allowing flexibility in applications such as asset protection and supervision.
* An Active Reader Passive Tag (ARPT) system has an active reader, which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.
* An Active Reader Active Tag (ARAT) system uses active tags activated with an interrogator signal from the active reader. A variation of this system could also use a Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag&#x27;s return reporting signal.

Fixed readers are set up to create a specific interrogation zone which can be tightly controlled. This allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone. Mobile readers may be handheld or mounted on carts or vehicles.

===Frequencies===
===Signaling===

Signaling between the reader and the tag is done in several different incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away. In this near field region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader&#x27;s interrogation signal.

An Electronic Product Code (EPC) is one common type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag contains a 96-bit string of data. The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages the data for this tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product. The last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a URL, the total electronic product code number can be used as a key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.

Often more than one tag will respond to a tag reader. For example, many individual products with tags may be shipped in a common box or on a common pallet. Collision detection is important to allow reading of data. Two different types of protocols are used to &quot;singulate&quot; a particular tag, allowing its data to be read in the midst of many similar tags. In a slotted Aloha system, the reader broadcasts an initialization command and a parameter that the tags individually use to pseudo-randomly delay their responses. When using an &quot;adaptive binary tree&quot; protocol, the reader sends an initialization symbol and then transmits one bit of ID data at a time; only tags with matching bits respond, and eventually only one tag matches the complete ID string.

Both methods have drawbacks when used with many tags or with multiple overlapping readers.

===Bulk reading===
&quot;Bulk reading&quot; is a strategy for interrogating multiple tags at the same time, but lacks sufficient precision for inventory control. A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. However, as tags respond strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater.

A group of tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility; if any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. The response conditions for inductively coupled HF RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.

Under operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management. However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, multiple RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a fuzzy method for process support. From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.

===Miniaturization===
RFID tags are easy to conceal or incorporate in other items. For example, in 2009 researchers at Bristol University successfully glued RFID micro-transponders to live ants in order to study their behavior. This trend towards increasingly miniaturized RFIDs is likely to continue as technology advances.

Hitachi holds the record for the smallest RFID chip, at 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm. This is 1/64th the size of the previous record holder, the mu-chip. Manufacture is enabled by using the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process. These dust-sized chips can store 38-digit numbers using 128-bit Read Only Memory (ROM). A major challenge is the attachment of antennas, thus limiting read range to only millimeters.

====TFID (Terahertz Frequency Identification)====
In early 2020, MIT researchers demonstrated a terahertz frequency identification (TFID) tag that is barely 1 square millimeter in size. The devices are essentially a piece of silicon that are inexpensive, small, and function like larger RFID tags. Because of the small size, manufacturers could tag any product and track logistics information for minimal cost.

==Uses==
An RFID tag can be affixed to an object and used to track tools, equipment, inventory, assets, people, or other objects.

RFID offers advantages over manual systems or use of barcodes. The tag can be read if passed near a reader, even if it is covered by the object or not visible. The tag can be read inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can be read hundreds at a time; barcodes can only be read one at a time using current devices. Some RFID tags, such as battery-assisted passive tags, are also able to monitor temperature and humidity.

In 2011, the cost of passive tags started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or withstand gamma sterilization, could cost up to US$5. Active tags for tracking containers, medical assets, or monitoring environmental conditions in data centers started at US$50 and could be over US$100 each. Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tags were in the US$3–10 range.

RFID can be used in a variety of applications, such as:
* Access management
* Tracking of goods
* Tracking of persons and animals
* Toll collection and contactless payment
* Machine readable travel documents
* Smartdust (for massively distributed sensor networks)
* Locating lost airport baggage
* Timing sporting events
* Tracking and billing processes
* Monitoring the physical state of perishable goods

In 2010, three factors drove a significant increase in RFID usage: decreased cost of equipment and tags, increased performance to a reliability of 99.9%, and a stable international standard around HF and UHF passive RFID. The adoption of these standards were driven by EPCglobal, a joint venture between GS1 and GS1 US, which were responsible for driving global adoption of the barcode in the 1970s and 1980s. The EPCglobal Network was developed by the Auto-ID Center.

===Commerce===
RFID provides a way for organizations to identify and manage stock, tools and equipment (asset tracking), etc. without manual data entry. Manufactured products such as automobiles or garments can be tracked through the factory and through shipping to the customer. Automatic identification with RFID can be used for inventory systems. Many organisations require that their vendors place RFID tags on all shipments to improve supply chain management. Warehouse Management System incorporate this technology to speed up the receiving and delivery of the products and reduce the cost of labor needed in their warehouses.

====Retail====
RFID is used for item-level tagging in retail stores. This can enable more accurate and lower-labor-cost supply chain and store inventory tracking, as is done at Lululemon, though physically locating items in stores requires more expensive technology. RFID tags can be used at checkout; for example, at some stores of the French retailer Decathlon, customers perform self-checkout by either using a smartphone or putting items into a bin near the register that scans the tags without having to orient each one toward the scanner. Some stores use RFID-tagged items to trigger systems that provide customers with more information or suggestions, such as fitting rooms at Chanel and the &quot;Color Bar&quot; at Kendra Scott stores.

Item tagging can also provide protection against theft by customers and employees by using electronic article surveillance (EAS). Tags of different types can be physically removed with a special tool or deactivated electronically when payment is made. On leaving the shop, customers have to pass near an RFID detector; if they have items with active RFID tags, an alarm sounds, both indicating an unpaid-for item, and identifying what it is.

Casinos can use RFID to authenticate poker chips, and can selectively invalidate any chips known to be stolen.

====Access control====

RFID tags are widely used in identification badges, replacing earlier magnetic stripe cards. These badges need only be held within a certain distance of the reader to authenticate the holder. Tags can also be placed on vehicles, which can be read at a distance, to allow entrance to controlled areas without having to stop the vehicle and present a card or enter an access code.

====Advertising====
In 2010, Vail Resorts began using UHF Passive RFID tags in ski passes.

Facebook is using RFID cards at most of their live events to allow guests to automatically capture and post photos.

Automotive brands have adopted RFID for social media product placement more quickly than other industries. Mercedes was an early adopter in 2011 at the PGA Golf Championships, and by the 2013 Geneva Motor Show many of the larger brands were using RFID for social media marketing.

====Promotion tracking====
To prevent retailers diverting products, manufacturers are exploring the use of RFID tags on promoted merchandise so that they can track exactly which product has sold through the supply chain at fully discounted prices.

===Transportation and logistics===
Yard management, shipping and freight and distribution centers use RFID tracking. In the railroad industry, RFID tags mounted on locomotives and rolling stock identify the owner, identification number and type of equipment and its characteristics. This can be used with a database to identify the type, origin, destination, etc. of the commodities being carried.

In commercial aviation, RFID is used to support maintenance on commercial aircraft. RFID tags are used to identify baggage and cargo at several airports and airlines.

Some countries are using RFID for vehicle registration and enforcement. RFID can help detect and retrieve stolen cars.
RFID is used in intelligent transportation systems. In New York City, RFID readers are deployed at intersections to track E-ZPass tags as a means for monitoring the traffic flow. The data is fed through the broadband wireless infrastructure to the traffic management center to be used in adaptive traffic control of the traffic lights.

Where ship, rail, or highway tanks are being loaded, a fixed RFID antenna contained in a transfer hose can read an RFID tag affixed to the tank, positively identifying it.

===Infrastructure management and protection===
At least one company has introduced RFID to identify and locate underground infrastructure assets such as gas pipelines, sewer lines, electrical cables, communication cables, etc.

===Passports===

The first RFID passports (&quot;E-passport&quot;) were issued by Malaysia in 1998. In addition to information also contained on the visual data page of the passport, Malaysian e-passports record the travel history (time, date, and place) of entry into and exit out of the country.

Other countries that insert RFID in passports include Norway (2005), Japan (March 1, 2006), most EU countries (around 2006), Singapore (2006), Australia, Hong Kong, the United States (2007), the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (2006), India (June 2008), Serbia (July 2008), Republic of Korea (August 2008), Taiwan (December 2008), Albania (January 2009), The Philippines (August 2009), Republic of Macedonia (2010), Argentina (2012), Canada (2013), Uruguay (2015) and Israel (2017).

Standards for RFID passports are determined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and are contained in ICAO Document 9303, Part 1, Volumes 1 and 2 (6th edition, 2006). ICAO refers to the ISO/IEC 14443 RFID chips in e-passports as &quot;contactless integrated circuits&quot;. ICAO standards provide for e-passports to be identifiable by a standard e-passport logo on the front cover.

Since 2006, RFID tags included in new United States passports store the same information that is printed within the passport, and include a digital picture of the owner. The United States Department of State initially stated the chips could only be read from a distance of , but after widespread criticism and a clear demonstration that special equipment can read the test passports from away, the passports were designed to incorporate a thin metal lining to make it more difficult for unauthorized readers to skim information when the passport is closed. The department will also implement Basic Access Control (BAC), which functions as a personal identification number (PIN) in the form of characters printed on the passport data page. Before a passport&#x27;s tag can be read, this PIN must be entered into an RFID reader. The BAC also enables the encryption of any communication between the chip and interrogator.

===Transportation payments===
In many countries, RFID tags can be used to pay for mass transit fares on bus, trains, or subways, or to collect tolls on highways.

Some bike lockers are operated with RFID cards assigned to individual users. A prepaid card is required to open or enter a facility or locker and is used to track and charge based on how long the bike is parked.

The Zipcar car-sharing service uses RFID cards for locking and unlocking cars and for member identification.

In Singapore, RFID replaces paper Season Parking Ticket (SPT).

===Animal identification===
RFID tags for animals represent one of the oldest uses of RFID. Originally meant for large ranches and rough terrain, since the outbreak of mad-cow disease, RFID has become crucial in animal identification management. An implantable RFID tag or transponder can also be used for animal identification. The transponders are better known as PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tags, passive RFID, or &quot;chips&quot; on animals. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency began using RFID tags as a replacement for barcode tags. Currently, CCIA tags are used in Wisconsin and by United States farmers on a voluntary basis. The USDA is currently developing its own program.

RFID tags are required for all cattle sold in Australia and in some states, sheep and goats as well.

===Human implantation===

Biocompatible microchip implants that use RFID technology are being routinely implanted in humans. The first-ever human to receive an RFID microchip implant was American artist Eduardo Kac in 1997. Kac implanted the microchip live on television (and also live on the Internet) in the context of his artwork &quot;Time Capsule&quot;.
A year later, British professor of cybernetics Kevin Warwick had an RFID chip implanted in his arm by his general practitioner, George Boulos. In 2004, the &#x27;Baja Beach Club&#x27; operated by Conrad Chase in Barcelona and Rotterdam offered implanted chips to identify their VIP customers, who could in turn use it to pay for service. In 2009, British scientist Mark Gasson had an advanced glass capsule RFID device surgically implanted into his left hand and subsequently demonstrated how a computer virus could wirelessly infect his implant and then be transmitted on to other systems.

The Food and Drug Administration in the United States approved the use of RFID chips in humans in 2004.

There is controversy regarding human applications of implantable RFID technology including concerns that individuals could potentially be tracked by carrying an identifier unique to them. Privacy advocates have protested against implantable RFID chips, warning of potential abuse. Some are concerned this could lead to abuse by an authoritarian government, to removal of freedoms, and to the emergence of an &quot;ultimate panopticon&quot;, a society where all citizens behave in a socially accepted manner because others might be watching.

On July 22, 2006, Reuters reported that two hackers, Newitz and Westhues, at a conference in New York City demonstrated that they could clone the RFID signal from a human implanted RFID chip, indicating that the device was not as secure as was previously claimed.

The UFO religion Universe People is notorious online for their vocal opposition to human RFID chipping, which they claim is a saurian attempt to enslave the human race; one of their web domains is &quot;dont-get-chipped&quot;.

===Institutions===

====Hospitals and healthcare====
Adoption of RFID in the medical industry has been widespread and very effective. Hospitals are among the first users to combine both active and passive RFID. Active tags track high-value, or frequently moved items, and passive tags track smaller, lower cost items that only need room-level identification. Medical facility rooms can collect data from transmissions of RFID badges worn by patients and employees, as well as from tags assigned to items such as mobile medical devices. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced plans to deploy RFID in hospitals across America to improve care and reduce costs.

Since 2004, a number of U.S. hospitals have begun implanting patients with RFID tags and using RFID systems; the systems are typically used for workflow and inventory management.
The use of RFID to prevent mix-ups between sperm and ova in IVF clinics is also being considered.

In October 2004, the FDA approved the USA&#x27;s first RFID chips that can be implanted in humans. The 134 kHz RFID chips, from VeriChip Corp. can incorporate personal medical information and could save lives and limit injuries from errors in medical treatments, according to the company. Anti-RFID activists Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre discovered an FDA Warning Letter that spelled out health risks. According to the FDA, these include &quot;adverse tissue reaction&quot;, &quot;migration of the implanted transponder&quot;, &quot;failure of implanted transponder&quot;, &quot;electrical hazards&quot; and &quot;magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] incompatibility.&quot;

====Libraries====

Libraries have used RFID to replace the barcodes on library items. The tag can contain identifying information or may just be a key into a database. An RFID system may replace or supplement bar codes and may offer another method of inventory management and self-service checkout by patrons. It can also act as a security device, taking the place of the more traditional electromagnetic security strip.

It is estimated that over 30 million library items worldwide now contain RFID tags, including some in the Vatican Library in Rome.

Since RFID tags can be read through an item, there is no need to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, and a stack of books can be read simultaneously. Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a conveyor belt, which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.
However, as of 2008, this technology remained too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period has been estimated at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of €50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off, but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation to compensate for the reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.

Privacy concerns have been raised surrounding library use of RFID. Because some RFID tags can be read up to away, there is some concern over whether sensitive information could be collected from an unwilling source. However, library RFID tags do not contain any patron information, and the tags used in the majority of libraries use a frequency only readable from approximately . Another concern is that a non-library agency could potentially record the RFID tags of every person leaving the library without the library administrator&#x27;s knowledge or consent. One simple option is to let the book transmit a code that has meaning only in conjunction with the library&#x27;s database. Another possible enhancement would be to give each book a new code every time it is returned. In future, should readers become ubiquitous (and possibly networked), then stolen books could be traced even outside the library. Tag removal could be made difficult if the tags are so small that they fit invisibly inside a (random) page, possibly put there by the publisher.

====Museums====
RFID technologies are now also implemented in end-user applications in museums. An example was the custom-designed temporary research application, &quot;eXspot&quot;, at the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco, California. A visitor entering the museum received an RF tag that could be carried as a card. The eXspot system enabled the visitor to receive information about specific exhibits. Aside from the exhibit information, the visitor could take photographs of themselves at the exhibit. It was also intended to allow the visitor to take data for later analysis. The collected information could be retrieved at home from a &quot;personalized&quot; website keyed to the RFID tag.

====Schools and universities====
In 2004, school authorities in the Japanese city of Osaka made a decision to start chipping children&#x27;s clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school. Later, in 2007, a school in Doncaster, England, piloted a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms. St Charles Sixth Form College in west London, England, starting in 2008, uses an RFID card system to check in and out of the main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance. Similarly, Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, England, uses RFID to track pupils and staff in and out of the building via a specially designed card. In the Philippines, during 2012, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books. Gates in those particular schools also have RFID scanners for buying items at school shops and canteens. RFID is also used in school libraries, and to sign in and out for student and teacher attendance.

===Sports===

RFID for timing races began in the early 1990s with pigeon racing, introduced by the company Deister Electronics in Germany. RFID can provide race start and end timings for individuals in large races where it is impossible to get accurate stopwatch readings for every entrant.

In races using RFID, racers wear tags that are read by antennas placed alongside the track or on mats across the track. UHF tags provide accurate readings with specially designed antennas. Rush error, lap count errors and accidents at race start are avoided, as anyone can start and finish at any time without being in a batch mode.
The design of the chip and of the antenna controls the range from which it can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe, or strapped to the ankle with . The chips must be about 400 mm from the mat, therefore giving very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (125mm square) antenna can be incorporated into the bib number worn on the athlete&#x27;s chest at a height of about .

Passive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as Orienteering, Enduro and Hare and Hounds racing. Riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.

RFID is being adapted by many recruitment agencies which have a PET (physical endurance test) as their qualifying procedure, especially in cases where the candidate volumes may run into millions (Indian Railway recruitment cells, police and power sector).

A number of ski resorts have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers hands-free access to ski lifts. Skiers do not have to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56MHz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix, use these systems.

The NFL in the United States equips players with RFID chips that measures speed, distance and direction traveled by each player in real-time. Currently, cameras stay focused on the quarterback; however, numerous plays are happening simultaneously on the field. The RFID chip will provide new insight into these simultaneous plays. The chip triangulates the player&#x27;s position within six inches and will be used to digitally broadcast replays. The RFID chip will make individual player information accessible to the public. The data will be available via the NFL 2015 app. The RFID chips are manufactured by Zebra Technologies. Zebra Technologies tested the RFID chip in 18 stadiums last year to track vector data.

===Complement to barcode===

RFID tags are often a complement, but not a substitute, for Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN) barcodes. They may never completely replace barcodes, due in part to their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically by e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline boarding passes. The new EPC, along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.

The storage of data associated with tracking items will require many terabytes. Filtering and categorizing RFID data is needed to create useful information. It is likely that goods will be tracked by the pallet using RFID tags, and at package level with UPC or EAN from unique barcodes.

The unique identity is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special choice of the numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current barcodes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location while being delivered to a person. This may help to combat theft and other forms of product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that is well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of persons after the sale.

===Waste management===
Since around 2007, there has been increasing development in the use of RFID in the waste management industry. RFID tags are installed on waste collection carts, linking carts to the owner&#x27;s account for easy billing and service verification. The tag is embedded into a garbage and recycle container, and the RFID reader is affixed to the garbage and recycle trucks. RFID also measures a customer&#x27;s set-out rate and provides insight as to the number of carts serviced by each waste collection vehicle. This RFID process replaces traditional &quot;pay as you throw&quot; (PAYT) municipal solid waste usage-pricing models.

===Telemetry===
Active RFID tags have the potential to function as low-cost remote sensors that broadcast telemetry back to a base station. Applications of tagometry data could include sensing of road conditions by implanted beacons, weather reports, and noise level monitoring.

Passive RFID tags can also report sensor data. For example, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform is a passive tag that reports temperature, acceleration and capacitance to commercial Gen2 RFID readers.

It is possible that active or battery-assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags could broadcast a signal to an in-store receiver to determine whether the RFID tag – and by extension, the product it is attached to – is in the store.

==Regulation and standardization==
To avoid injuries to humans and animals, RF transmission needs to be controlled.
A number of organizations have set standards for RFID, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), ASTM International, the DASH7 Alliance and EPCglobal.

Several specific industries have also set guidelines, including the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) for tracking IT Assets with RFID, the Computer Technology Industry Association CompTIA for certifying RFID engineers, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for luggage in airports.

Every country can set its own rules for frequency allocation for RFID tags, and not all radio bands are available in all countries. These frequencies are known as the ISM bands (Industrial Scientific and Medical bands). The return signal of the tag may still cause interference for other radio users.

* Low-frequency (LF: 125–134.2 kHz and 140–148.5 kHz) (LowFID) tags and high-frequency (HF: 13.56 MHz) (HighFID) tags can be used globally without a license.
* Ultra-high-frequency (UHF: 865–928 MHz) (Ultra-HighFID or UHFID) tags cannot be used globally as there is no single global standard, and regulations differ from country to country.

In North America, UHF can be used unlicensed for 902–928 MHz (±13 MHz from the 915 MHz center frequency), but restrictions exist for transmission power. In Europe, RFID and other low-power radio applications are regulated by ETSI recommendations EN 300 220 and EN 302 208, and ERO recommendation 70 03, allowing RFID operation with somewhat complex band restrictions from 865–868 MHz. Readers are required to monitor a channel before transmitting (&quot;Listen Before Talk&quot;); this requirement has led to some restrictions on performance, the resolution of which is a subject of current research. The North American UHF standard is not accepted in France as it interferes with its military bands. On July 25, 2012, Japan changed its UHF band to 920 MHz, more closely matching the United States&#x27; 915 MHz band, establishing an international standard environment for RFID.

In some countries, a site license is needed, which needs to be applied for at the local authorities, and can be revoked.

As of 31 October 2014, regulations are in place in 78 countries representing approximately 96.5% of the world&#x27;s GDP, and work on regulations was in progress in three countries representing approximately 1% of the world&#x27;s GDP.

Standards that have been made regarding RFID include:
* ISO 11784/11785 – Animal identification. Uses 134.2 kHz.
* ISO 14223 – Radiofrequency identification of animals – Advanced transponders
* ISO/IEC 14443: This standard is a popular HF (13.56 MHz) standard for HighFIDs which is being used as the basis of RFID-enabled passports under ICAO 9303. The Near Field Communication standard that lets mobile devices act as RFID readers/transponders is also based on ISO/IEC 14443.
* ISO/IEC 15693: This is also a popular HF (13.56 MHz) standard for HighFIDs widely used for non-contact smart payment and credit cards.
* ISO/IEC 18000: Information technology—Radio frequency identification for item management:
* ISO/IEC 18092 Information technology—Telecommunications and information exchange between systems—Near Field Communication—Interface and Protocol (NFCIP-1)
* ISO 18185: This is the industry standard for electronic seals or &quot;e-seals&quot; for tracking cargo containers using the 433 MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies.
* ISO/IEC 21481 Information technology—Telecommunications and information exchange between systems—Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol −2 (NFCIP-2)
* ASTM D7434, Standard Test Method for Determining the Performance of Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Transponders on Palletized or Unitized Loads
* ASTM D7435, Standard Test Method for Determining the Performance of Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Transponders on Loaded Containers
* ASTM D7580, Standard Test Method for Rotary Stretch Wrapper Method for Determining the Readability of Passive RFID Transponders on Homogenous Palletized or Unitized Loads
* ISO 28560-2— specifies encoding standards and data model to be used within libraries.

In order to ensure global interoperability of products, several organizations have set up additional standards for RFID testing. These standards include conformance, performance and interoperability tests.

===EPC Gen2===
EPC Gen2 is short for &quot;EPCglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2&quot;.

EPCglobal, a joint venture between GS1 and GS1 US, is working on international standards for the use of mostly passive RFID and the Electronic Product Code (EPC) in the identification of many items in the supply chain for companies worldwide.

One of the missions of EPCglobal was to simplify the Babel of protocols prevalent in the RFID world in the 1990s. Two tag air interfaces (the protocol for exchanging information between a tag and a reader) were defined (but not ratified) by EPCglobal prior to 2003. These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, saw significant commercial implementation in 2002–2005.

In 2004, the Hardware Action Group created a new protocol, the Class 1 Generation 2 interface, which addressed a number of problems that had been experienced with Class 0 and Class 1 tags. The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004. This was approved after a contention from Intermec that the standard may infringe a number of their RFID-related patents. It was decided that the standard itself does not infringe their patents, making the standard royalty free. The EPC Gen2 standard was adopted with minor modifications as ISO 18000-6C in 2006.

In 2007, the lowest cost of Gen2 EPC inlay was offered by the now-defunct company SmartCode, at a price of $0.05 apiece in volumes of 100 million or more.

==Problems and concerns==

===Data flooding===
Not every successful reading of a tag (an observation) is useful for business purposes. A large amount of data may be generated that is not useful for managing inventory or other applications. For example, a customer moving a product from one shelf to another, or a pallet load of articles that passes several readers while being moved in a warehouse, are events that do not produce data that are meaningful to an inventory control system.

Event filtering is required to reduce this data inflow to a meaningful depiction of moving goods passing a threshold. Various concepts have been designed, mainly offered as &quot;middleware&quot; performing the filtering from noisy and redundant raw data to significant processed data.

===Global standardization===
The frequencies used for UHF RFID in the USA are as of 2007 incompatible with those of Europe or Japan. Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as universal as the barcode. To address international trade concerns, it is necessary to use a tag that is operational within all of the international frequency domains.

===Security concerns===
A primary RFID security concern is the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised with respect to the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s recent adoption of RFID tags for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in general-use products. This is mostly as a result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped on, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distances.

A second method of prevention is by using cryptography. Rolling codes and challenge–response authentication (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader, as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag&#x27;s ID being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a cryptographically coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be symmetric, or may use public key cryptography.

While a variety of secure protocols have been suggested for RFID tags,
in order to support long read range at low cost, many RFID tags have barely enough power available
to support very low-power and therefore simple security protocols such as cover-coding.

Unauthorized reading of RFID tags presents a risk to privacy and to business secrecy. Unauthorized readers can potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, persons, carriers, or the contents of a package. Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption, as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002. There are also concerns that the database structure of Object Naming Service may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to denial-of-service attacks, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.

===Health===
Microchip–induced tumours have been noted during animal trials.

===Shielding===

In an effort to prevent the passive &quot;skimming&quot; of RFID-enabled cards or passports, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) issued a set of test procedures for evaluating electromagnetically opaque sleeves. For shielding products to be in compliance with FIPS-201 guidelines, they must meet or exceed this published standard; compliant products are listed on the website of the U.S. CIO&#x27;s FIPS-201 Evaluation Program. The United States government requires that when new ID cards are issued, they must be delivered with an approved shielding sleeve or holder. Although many wallets and passport holders are advertised to protect personal information, there is little evidence that RFID skimming is a serious threat; data encryption and use of EMV chips rather than RFID makes this sort of theft rare.

There are contradictory opinions as to whether aluminum can prevent reading of RFID chips. Some people claim that aluminum shielding, essentially creating a Faraday cage, does work. Others claim that simply wrapping an RFID card in aluminum foil only makes transmission more difficult and is not completely effective at preventing it.

Shielding effectiveness depends on the frequency being used. Low-frequency LowFID tags, like those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding, although thick metal foil will prevent most reads. High frequency HighFID tags (13.56 MHz—smart cards and access badges) are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when within a few centimetres of a metal surface. UHF Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2–4 cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the incident wave at the tag.

===Privacy===
The use of RFID has engendered considerable controversy and some consumer privacy advocates have initiated product boycotts. Consumer privacy experts Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre are two prominent critics of the &quot;spychip&quot; technology. The two main privacy concerns regarding RFID are as follows:
* As the owner of an item may not necessarily be aware of the presence of an RFID tag and the tag can be read at a distance without the knowledge of the individual, sensitive data may be acquired without consent.
* If a tagged item is paid for by credit card or in conjunction with use of a loyalty card, then it would be possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item contained in the RFID tag. This is a possibility if the person watching also had access to the loyalty card and credit card data, and the person with the equipment knows where the purchaser is going to be.

Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags affixed to products remain functional even after the products have been purchased and taken home; thus, they may be used for surveillance and other purposes unrelated to their supply chain inventory functions.

The RFID Network responded to these fears in the first episode of their syndicated cable TV series, saying that they are unfounded, and let RF engineers demonstrate how RFID works. They provided images of RF engineers driving an RFID-enabled van around a building and trying to take an inventory of items inside. They also discussed satellite tracking of a passive RFID tag.

The concerns raised may be addressed in part by use of the Clipped Tag. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase privacy for the purchaser of an item. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a person may tear off a portion of the tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range – less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.

However, read range is a function of both the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.

In January 2004, privacy advocates from CASPIAN and the German privacy group FoeBuD were invited to the METRO Future Store in Germany, where an RFID pilot project was implemented. It was uncovered by accident that METRO &quot;Payback&quot; customer loyalty cards contained RFID tags with customer IDs, a fact that was disclosed neither to customers receiving the cards, nor to this group of privacy advocates. This happened despite assurances by METRO that no customer identification data was tracked and all RFID usage was clearly disclosed.

During the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in November 2005, Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, protested the use of RFID security cards by covering his card with aluminum foil.

In 2004–2005, the Federal Trade Commission staff conducted a workshop and review of RFID privacy concerns and issued a report recommending best practices.

RFID was one of the main topics of the 2006 Chaos Communication Congress (organized by the Chaos Computer Club in Berlin) and triggered a large press debate. Topics included electronic passports, Mifare cryptography and the tickets for the FIFA World Cup 2006. Talks showed how the first real-world mass application of RFID at the 2006 FIFA Football World Cup worked. The group monochrom staged a &quot;Hack RFID&quot; song.

===Government control===
Some individuals have grown to fear the loss of rights due to RFID human implantation.

By early 2007, Chris Paget of San Francisco, California, showed that RFID information could be pulled from a US passport card by using only $250 worth of equipment. This suggests that with the information captured, it would be possible to clone such cards.

According to ZDNet, critics believe that RFID will lead to tracking individuals&#x27; every movement and will be an invasion of privacy. In the book &quot;SpyChips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Move&quot; by Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, one is encouraged to &quot;imagine a world of no privacy. Where your every purchase is monitored and recorded in a database and your every belonging is numbered. Where someone many states away or perhaps in another country has a record of everything you have ever bought. What&#x27;s more, they can be tracked and monitored remotely&quot;.

===Deliberate destruction in clothing and other items===
According to an RSA laboratories FAQ, RFID tags can be destroyed by a standard microwave oven; however, some types of RFID tags, particularly those constructed to radiate using large metallic antennas (in particular RF tags and EPC tags), may catch fire if subjected to this process for too long (as would any metallic item inside a microwave oven). This simple method cannot safely be used to deactivate RFID features in electronic devices, or those implanted in living tissue, because of the risk of damage to the &quot;host&quot;. However the time required is extremely short (a second or two of radiation) and the method works in many other non-electronic and inanimate items, long before heat or fire become of concern.

Some RFID tags implement a &quot;kill command&quot; mechanism to permanently and irreversibly disable them. This mechanism can be applied if the chip itself is trusted or the mechanism is known by the person that wants to &quot;kill&quot; the tag.

UHF RFID tags that comply with the EPC2 Gen 2 Class 1 standard usually support this mechanism, while protecting the chip from being killed with a password. Guessing or cracking this needed 32-bit password for killing a tag would not be difficult for a determined attacker.

<text>Carnegie Hall ( ) is a concert venue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is at 881 Seventh Avenue, occupying the east side of Seventh Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets. Designed by architect William Burnet Tuthill and built by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, it is one of the most prestigious venues in the world for both classical music and popular music. Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups.

Carnegie Hall has 3,671 seats, divided among three auditoriums. The largest one is the Stern Auditorium, a five-story auditorium with 2,804 seats. Also part of the complex are the 599-seat Zankel Hall on Seventh Avenue, as well as the 268-seat Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall on 57th Street. Besides the auditoriums, Carnegie Hall contains offices on its top stories.

Carnegie Hall, originally the Music Hall, was constructed between 1889 and 1891 as a venue shared by the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society. The hall was owned by the Carnegie family until 1925, after which Robert E. Simon and then his son, Robert E. Simon Jr., became owner. Carnegie Hall was proposed for demolition in the 1950s in advance of the New York Philharmonic relocating to Lincoln Center in 1962. Though Carnegie Hall is designated a National Historic Landmark and protected by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, it has not had a resident company since the New York Philharmonic moved out. Carnegie Hall was renovated multiple times throughout its history, including in the 1940s and 1980s.

== Site ==
Carnegie Hall is on the east side of Seventh Avenue between 56th Street and 57th Street, two blocks south of Central Park, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The site covers . Its lot is wide, covering the entire width of the block between 56th Street to the south and 57th Street to the north, and extends eastward from Seventh Avenue.

Carnegie Hall shares the city block with the Carnegie Hall Tower, Russian Tea Room, and Metropolitan Tower to the east. It is from the Osborne apartment building. It also faces the Rodin Studios and 888 Seventh Avenue to the west; Alwyn Court, The Briarcliffe, the Louis H. Chalif Normal School of Dancing, and One57 to the north; the Park Central Hotel to the southwest; and CitySpire and New York City Center to the southeast. Right outside the hall is an entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 57th Street–Seventh Avenue station, served by the .

Carnegie Hall is part of a former artistic hub around a two-block section of West 57th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway. The hub had been developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its opening in 1891 directly contributed to the development of the hub. The area contains several buildings constructed as residences for artists and musicians, such as 130 and 140 West 57th Street, the Osborne, and the Rodin Studios. In addition, the area contained the headquarters of organizations such as the American Fine Arts Society, the Lotos Club, and the American Society of Civil Engineers. By the 21st century, the artistic hub had largely been replaced with Billionaires&#x27; Row, a series of luxury skyscrapers around the southern end of Central Park.

== Architecture and venues ==

Carnegie Hall was designed by William Tuthill along with Richard Morris Hunt and Adler &amp; Sullivan. While the 34-year-old Tuthill was relatively unknown as an architect, he was an amateur cellist and a singer, which may have led to him getting the commission. Dankmar Adler of Adler &amp; Sullivan, on the other hand, was an experienced designer of music halls and theaters; he served as the acoustical consultant. Carnegie Hall was constructed with heavy masonry bearing walls, as lighter structural steel framework was not widely used when the building was completed. The building was designed in a modified Italian Renaissance style.

Carnegie Hall is composed of three structures arranged in an &quot;L&quot; shape; each structure contains one of the hall&#x27;s performance spaces. The original building, which houses the Isaac Stern Auditorium, is an eight-story rectangular building at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 57th Street, measuring along the street and along the avenue. The 16-story eastern wing contains the Weill Recital Hall and is located along 57th Street. The 13-story southern wing, at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street, contains Zankel Hall. Except at the eighth floor, all three structures have floor levels at different heights.

=== Facade ===
Carnegie Hall was designed from the outset with a facade of Roman brick. The facade was decorated with a large amount of Renaissance details. Most of the exterior walls are covered in reddish brown brick, though decorative elements such as band courses, pilasters, and arches are made of architectural terracotta originally by the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company. As originally designed, the terracotta and brick were both brown, and the pitched roof was made of corrugated black tile, but this was later replaced with the eighth floor.
The original section of the building is divided into three horizontal sections. The lowest section of the building comprises the first floor and the first-floor mezzanine, above which is a heavy cornice with modillions. The main entrance of Carnegie Hall is placed in what was originally the center of the primary facade on 57th Street. It consists of an arcade with five large arches, originally separated by granite pilasters. An entablature, with the words &quot;Music Hall Founded by Andrew Carnegie&quot;, runs across the loggia at the springing of the arches. The center three arches lead directly to the Stern Auditorium&#x27;s lobby, while the two outer arches lead to staircases to upper floors. On either side of the main entrance are smaller doorways (one on the west and two on the east), topped by blank panels at the mezzanine. There are five similar doorways on Seventh Avenue. The original backstage entrance is on 161 West 56th Street.

On the third and fourth floors, above the main entrance, is a two-and-a-half story arcade on 57th Street with five round-headed arches. A balcony with a balustrade is carried on console brackets in front of this arcade. Each arch has a horizontal terracotta transom bar above the third floor; two third-floor windows separated by a Corinthian column; and two fourth-floor windows separated by a pilaster. A broad terracotta frieze runs above the fourth floor, at the springing of the arches. To either side of the arcade, there are two tall round-arched windows on the second floor; those on the east flank a blind arch. There are pairs of pilasters on the fourth-floor mezzanine, above which is a string course. The Seventh Avenue facade is similar in design, but instead of window openings, there are blind openings filled with brick. Additionally, the arcade at the center of the Seventh Avenue facade has four arches instead of five.

The sixth floor, at the center of the 57th Street facade, contains five square openings, each with a pair of round-arched windows. On either side of these five openings, there are round-arched windows, arranged as in a shallow loggia. There are four arched windows on the eastern portion of the sixth floor, as well as two arches on the west portion, which flank a blind arch. A frieze and cornice run above this floor. The seventh floor was originally a mansard roof. As part of an 1890s alteration, the mansard was replaced with a vertical wall resembling a continuous arcade. The seventh floor is topped by balustrades with decorated columns. The flat roof was converted into a roof garden with kitchen and service rooms. Carnegie Hall was also extended to the corner of Seventh Avenue and 56th Street, where a 13-story addition was designed in a similar style as the original building. The top of this addition contains a main dome, as well as smaller domes at its four corners.

=== Venues ===

==== Main Hall (Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage) ====
The Stern Auditorium is six stories high with 2,804 seats on five levels. Originally known as the main auditorium, it was renamed after violinist Isaac Stern in 1997 to recognize his efforts to save the hall from demolition in the 1960s. The main auditorium was originally planned to fit 3,300 guests, including two tiers of boxes, two balconies, and a seating 1,200. The main hall accommodated the performances of the New York Philharmonic from 1892 to 1962, when the Philharmonic moved to Lincoln Center.

Its entrance is through the Box Office Lobby on 57th Street near Seventh Avenue. When planned in 1889, this entrance was designed with a marble and mosaic vestibule measuring high and long. The entrance lobby is three stories high and had an organ loft at the top, which was converted into a lounge area by the mid-20th century. The lobby ceiling was designed as a barrel vault, containing soffits with heavy coffers and cross-arches, and was painted white with gold decorations. At either end of the barrel vault were lunettes. The walls were painted salmon and had pairs of gray-marble pilasters supporting an entablature. The cross-arches had decorated cream-colored tympana. The lobby was originally several feet above street level, but it was lowered to street level in the 1980s. The rebuilt lobby contains geometric decorations evocative by the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as well as Corinthian-style capitals with lighting fixtures. The design also includes ticket windows on the south wall of the lobby. Past that, stairs on either side lead to the auditorium&#x27;s parquet level; previously, stairs continued straight from the lobby to the parquet level.

All but the top level can be reached by elevator; the top balcony is 137 steps above parquet level. The lowest level is the parquet level, which has twenty-five full rows of thirty-eight seats and four partial rows at stage level, for a total of 1,021 seats. The parquet was designed with eleven exits to a corridor that entirely surrounded it; the corridor, in turn, led to the main entrance vestibule on 57th Street. The first and second tiers consist of sixty-five boxes; the first tier has 264 seats, eight per box, and the second tier has 238 seats, six to eight per box. As designed, the first tier of boxes was entirely open, while the second tier was partially enclosed, with open boxes on either end. The third tier above the parquet is the Dress Circle, seating 444 in six rows; the first two rows form an almost-complete semicircle. The fourth and the highest tier, the balcony, seats 837. Although seats with obstructed views exist throughout the auditorium, only the Dress Circle level has structural columns. An elliptic arch rises from the Dress Circle level; along with a corresponding arch at the rear of the auditorium, it supports the ceiling.

The Ronald O. Perelman Stage is deep. It was originally designed with six tiers that could be raised and lowered hydraulically. The walls around the stage contain pilasters. The ceiling above the stage was designed as an ellipse, and the soffits of the ceiling were originally outfitted with lights. Originally, there were no stage wings; the backstage entrance from 56th Street led directly to a small landing just below the stage, while the dressing room was above the stage. During a 1980s renovation, a stage wing, orchestra room, and dressing rooms were added and the access to the stage was reconfigured.

==== Zankel Hall ====
Zankel Hall, on the Seventh Avenue side of the building, is named after Judy and Arthur Zankel, who funded a renovation of the venue. Originally called simply Recital Hall, this was the first auditorium to open to the public in April 1891. It had a balcony, elevated side galleries, a beamed ceiling, and removable seats. The space was an oratorio hall capable of accommodating over 1,000 people, and it could double as a banquet hall. There was a full kitchen service, as well as a dais on either side. The space was originally designed with dimensions of . Following renovations made in 1896, it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was leased to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1896, then converted into the Carnegie Hall Cinema in May 1961. The venue became a performance space in 1997.

The completely reconstructed Zankel Hall opened in September 2003. It is accessed from Seventh Avenue, where there is a marquee. Two escalators lead to the balcony and orchestra levels. The venue could be arranged with either a center stage, an end stage, or no stage. This is accomplished through the division of the floor into nine sections, each wide with a separate lift underneath. There are 599 seats in Zankel Hall, spread across two levels. The parterre level seats a total of 463 and the mezzanine level seats 136. Each level has several boxes perpendicular to the stage; there are 54 seats in six boxes on the parterre level and 48 seats in four boxes on the mezzanine level. The boxes on the parterre level are raised above the level of the stage. Zankel Hall is wheelchair-accessible. Its stage is wide and deep.

Due to the limited space available on the land lot, the construction of Zankel Hall required excavating of additional basement space, at some points only under the Stern Auditorium&#x27;s parquet level. The excavations descended up to below the original space&#x27;s floor and came as close as to the adjacent subway tunnel. This also required the removal of twelve cast-iron columns holding up the Main Hall. In its place, a temporary framework of steel pipe columns, supporting I-beam girders and thick Neoprene insulation pads, was installed. JaffeHolden Acoustics installed the soundproofing, which filters out noise from both the street and the subway. An elliptical concrete wall, measuring wide, surrounds Zankel Hall and supports the Stern Auditorium. The elliptical enclosure measures long and wide. The walls are sloped at a 7-degree angle and contain sycamore paneling. The lighting and sound equipment is mounted from twenty-one trusses.

==== Weill Recital Hall ====
The Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall is named after Sanford I. Weill, a former chairman of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s board, as well as his wife Joan. This auditorium, in use since the hall opened in 1891, was originally called Chamber Music Hall and was placed in the &quot;lateral building&quot; east of the main hall. The space later became the Carnegie Chamber Music Hall, and the name was changed to Carnegie Recital Hall in the late 1940s. The venue was renamed after Joan and Sanford I. Weill in 1986, reopening in January 1987.

The recital hall is served by its own lobby, which contains a pale color palette with red geometric metalwork. Prior to a 1980s renovation, it shared a lobby with the main auditorium. The Weill Recital Hall is the smallest of the three performance spaces, with a total of 268 seats. The orchestra level contains 196 seats in fourteen rows, while the balcony level contains 72 seats in five rows. The modern-day recital hall contains off-white walls and blue seats. In the mid-20th century, the recital hall was decorated with red and gold, which was replaced in the 1980s with Palladian arches similar to those in the hall&#x27;s original design. A proscenium arch made of plywood, as well as a paneled wall behind the stage, were installed after the recital hall&#x27;s completion but were removed in the 1980s to improve acoustics. The room has three chandeliers, which also amplify the room&#x27;s acoustics.

=== Other facilities ===
A boiler room was placed under the sidewalk on Seventh Avenue. A small electric generation plant for 5,300 lamps was also planned. At the ground level of the main hall was a lobby with gray marble pilasters and salmon-colored walls. Stores were added to the lobby in the 1940s. The storefronts, as well as a restaurant at the corner of 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, were removed in a 1980s renovation. Originally, there was a 150-seat dining room on the ground level below the Chamber Music Hall. Above the dining room, but below the venue itself, were parlors, cloak rooms, and restrooms.

Above the Chamber Music Hall was a large chapter-room, a meeting room, a gymnasium, and twelve short-term &quot;lodge rooms&quot; in the roof. The 56th Street side of Carnegie Hall was designed with rooms for the choruses, soloists, and conductors, as well as offices and lodge rooms. On the roof of the 56th Street section were janitors&#x27; apartments. Three elevators, two on the 57th Street side and one on the 56th Street side, originally served the building. The addition at the corner of 56th Street and Seventh Avenue was arranged with offices, studios, and private music rooms.

The eighth floor of the main hall, which contained studios, was installed after the complex was completed. There were a total of 133 or 150 studios, many of which doubled as living quarters. Over the years, personalities such as Leonard Bernstein, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and Norman Mailer lived in the studios. The spaces were designed for artistic work, with very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. Documents showed that Andrew Carnegie had always considered the spaces as a source of income to support the hall and its activities. After 1999, the space was re-purposed for music education and corporate offices. In 2007, the Carnegie Hall Corporation announced plans to evict the 33 remaining studio residents, including celebrity portrait photographer Editta Sherman and fashion photographer Bill Cunningham. The last resident, poet Elizabeth Sargent, moved out during 2010.

The building also contains the Carnegie Hall Archives, established in 1986, and the Rose Museum, which opened in 1991. The Rose Museum is east of the first balcony of the Stern Auditorium and has dark makore and light anigre paneling with brass edges, as well as columns with brass capitals, supporting a coffered ceiling. The Rose Museum space is separated from two adjacent rooms by sliding panels.

== History ==
The idea for what is now Carnegie Hall came from Leopold Damrosch, the conductor of Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society. The Oratorio Society had been looking for a permanent performance venue ever since it was founded in 1873. Though Leopold died in 1885, his son Walter Johannes Damrosch pursued his father&#x27;s vision for a new music hall. While studying music in Germany in 1887, the younger Damrosch was introduced to the businessman Andrew Carnegie, who served on the board of not only the Oratorio Society but also the New York Symphony. Carnegie was originally uninterested in funding a music hall in Manhattan, but he agreed to give $2 million after discussions with Damrosch. According to architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern, the Music Hall was &quot;unique in that it was free of commercial sponsorship and exclusively dedicated to musical performance&quot;. At the time, New York City&#x27;s performance halls were mainly clustered around 14th Street, as well as around Union Square and Herald Square. The area around 57th Street was still mostly residential.

=== Development and opening ===

In early March 1889, Morris Reno, director of the Oratorio and New York Symphony societies acquired nine lots on and around the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 57th Street. William Tuthill had been hired to design a &quot;great music hall&quot; on the site. The Music Hall, as it was called, would be a five-story brick and limestone building, containing a 3,000-seat main hall with and several smaller rooms for rehearsals, lectures, concerts, and art exhibitions. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;The location for the music hall is perhaps rather far uptown, but it is easily accessible from the &#x27;living&#x27; part of the city.&quot; The Music Hall Company was incorporated on March 27, 1889, with Carnegie, Damrosch, Reno, Tuthill, and Stephen M. Kneval as trustees. Originally, the Music Hall Company intended to limit its capital stock to $300,000, but this was increased before the end of 1889 to $600,000, of which Carnegie held five-sixths. The cost of the building was then projected to be $1.1 million, including the land.

By July 1889, Carnegie&#x27;s company had acquired additional land, with frontage of on 57th Street. The architectural drawings were nearly completed and excavations for the music hall had been completed. The Henry Elias Brewery owned the corner of Seventh Avenue and 56th Street and originally would not sell the land, as its proprietor believed the site had a good water source. Plans for the Music Hall were filed in November 1889. Carnegie&#x27;s wife Louise laid the cornerstone for the Music Hall on May 13, 1890. Andrew Carnegie said at the time that the venue was to not only be &quot;a shrine of the goddess of music&quot; but also a gathering hall. Isaac A. Hopper and Company was the contractor in charge of building the Music Hall. The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; praised the building&#x27;s design as &quot;harmonious, animated without restlessness, and quiet without dullness.&quot; In February 1891, Damrosch announced that he had created a subscription fund for a &quot;permanent orchestra&quot; that would perform mainly in the new Music Hall.

The Recital Hall opened in March 1891 for recitals of the New York Oratorio Society. It was around this time that tickets for the official opening of the Music Hall were being sold. The oratorio hall in the basement opened on April 1, 1891, with a performance by Franz Rummel. The Music Hall officially opened on May 5, 1891, with a rendition of the Old 100th hymn, a speech by Episcopal bishop Henry C. Potter, and a concert conducted by Walter Damrosch and Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. During the performance, Tuthill looked at the crowds on the auditorium&#x27;s top tiers and reportedly left the hall to consult his drawings. He was uncertain that the supporting columns would withstand the weight of the crowd in attendance, but the dimensions turned out to be sufficient to support the weight of the crowd. Tchaikovsky considered the auditorium &quot;unusually impressive and grand&quot; when &quot;illuminated and filled with an audience&quot;. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; praised the auditorium&#x27;s acoustical qualities, saying &quot;each note was heard&quot;. The Music Hall had cost $1.25 million to construct and was the second major performance hall in New York City, after the Metropolitan Opera House.

=== Late 19th to mid-20th century ===
==== 1890s to 1910s ====

Almost from the outset, scalpers resold tickets to the Music Hall&#x27;s shows at greatly inflated prices, and ushers began selling off tickets to unoccupied seats at the start of each concert. For an inflated fee, the ushers allowed latecomers to sit down during the middle of a show, to the consternation of existing ticket holders. In May 1892, the stockholders of the Music Hall Company of New York discussed expanding the Music Hall into the site of a brewery at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street, which they had purchased about three months previously. The Music Hall Company also discussed enlarging the main auditorium&#x27;s stage so it could accommodate operas. 

By September 1892, the Music Hall&#x27;s stockholders planned to enlarge the hall to accommodate operatic performances, following a fire that severely damaged the Metropolitan Opera House. At the time, Morris Reno said the stage could not be modified until at least early 1893. The Music Hall Company filed plans for alterations in December 1892. The plans called a tower of about at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 56th Street. In addition, the original building&#x27;s mansard roof would become a flat roof, and the seventh story would be converted into a full story. The Philharmonic Society moved into the Music Hall in November 1892, drawing further crowds. The studios atop the building were constructed shortly afterward, from 1894 to 1896. 

The American Academy of Dramatic Arts moved into the basement recital hall in 1896, leasing the basement recital hall for the next fifty-four years. Also during the mid-1890s, the Music Hall was renamed Carnegie Hall for its main benefactor. According to Carnegie Hall archivist Gino Francesconi, the renaming occurred &quot;so that it shouldn&#x27;t be confused by European artists with a vulgar music hall&quot;. During the early 20th century, Carnegie Hall accommodated many recitals and concerts because of its acoustic qualities.

==== 1920s to 1940s ====

Carnegie Hall officials renovated the building in 1920, replacing its porte-cochère, overhauling the Philharmonic Society&#x27;s office, and removing staircases for about $70,000. By late 1924, the Carnegie Foundation was considering selling the hall to a private developer because of increasing financial deficits, which amounted to $15,000 a year. At the time, the site was valued at $2.5 million, and another performance venue in midtown, Aeolian Hall, had been sold for redevelopment. In February 1925, Carnegie&#x27;s widow sold the hall to a real estate developer, Robert E. Simon. The sale agreement included a clause requiring that either Carnegie Hall would continue to operate as a performance venue for at least the next five years, or another performance venue would be erected on the site. Simon said the hall would continue to operate for as long as it was profitable, and he wished to restore the basement recital hall as well.

Under Simon&#x27;s ownership, a new organ was installed in Carnegie Hall and dedicated in December 1929. Robert Simon died in 1935. Murray Weisman succeeded Simon as president of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s board of directors, while the late owner&#x27;s son Robert E. Simon Jr. became the vice president. A bust of the senior Simon was installed in the lobby in 1936.

The main hall was modified around 1946 during filming for the movie &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;. A hole was made in the stage&#x27;s ceiling to allow the installation of ventilation and lights for the film. Canvas panels and curtains were placed over the hole, but the acoustics in the front rows became noticeably different. In 1947, Robert E. Simon Jr. renovated the hall to designs by Kahn and Jacobs.

=== Preservation ===
By the 1950s, changes in the music business prompted Simon to sell the hall. In April 1955, Simon negotiated with the New York Philharmonic, which booked a majority of the hall&#x27;s concerts each year. The orchestra intended to move to Lincoln Center once it had been built (at the time, plans to build it were still at an early stage). Simon notified the Philharmonic that he would terminate the lease by 1959 if it did not purchase Carnegie Hall. In mid-1955, longtime employee John Totten organized a fundraising drive to prevent the demolition of Carnegie Hall. Meanwhile, the Academy of Dramatic Arts had moved out of the basement recital hall in 1954. The Academy&#x27;s former space was rented for the time being to other tenants.

Simon sold the entire stock of Carnegie Hall, Inc., the venue&#x27;s legal owner, to a commercial developer, the Glickman Corporation, in July 1956 for $5 million. With the Philharmonic ready to move to Lincoln Center, the building was slated to be replaced by a 44-story skyscraper designed by Pomerance and Breines. The replacement tower would have had a red facade and would have been constructed on stilts, with art exhibits and other cultural facilities at the base. However, Glickman was unable to come up with the $22 million that the construction budget for the skyscraper called for. This, combined with delays in Lincoln Center&#x27;s construction, prompted Glickman to decline an option to buy the building itself in July 1958.

Meanwhile, soon after the sale, Simon started planning how to preserve the hall, and approached some of its resident artists-in-residence for help. Violinist Isaac Stern enlisted his friends Jacob M. and Alice Kaplan, as well as J. M. Kaplan Fund administrator Raymond S. Rubinow, for assistance in saving the hall. In 1959, two hundred residents of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s studios were asked if they wanted to buy the building. Stern, the Kaplans, and Rubinow ultimately decided that the best move would be for the city government to become involved. The move gained support from mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., who created a taskforce to save Carnegie Hall in early 1960, but Simon and his co-owners still filed eviction notices against some studio tenants. The same year, special legislation was passed allowing the city government to buy the site from Simon for $5 million, and Simon used the money to establish Reston, Virginia.

The city leased the hall to the Carnegie Hall Corporation, a nonprofit organization formed to run the venue. For 15 years, the Carnegie Hall Corporation paid the New York City government $183,600 in cash, Afterward, the corporation started paying the city through benefit concerts and outreach programs. Carnegie Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. The landmark status was certified in 1964, and a National Historic Landmark plaque was placed on the building. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission also designated Carnegie Hall as a city landmark in September 1967.

=== Deterioration and renovation ===

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
A minor renovation of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s interior, as well as a steam-cleaning of the facade, took place in mid-1960. The basement recital hall became a movie theater called the Carnegie Playhouse. A screen was installed at the front of the former stage, while the balconies and side galleries were sealed. The Carnegie Hall Cinema opened in May 1961 with a showing of the film &quot;White Nights&quot; by Luchino Visconti. Carnegie Hall received a concert organ from the Netherlands in 1965, although the stage had to be renovated before the organ could be installed. The installation of the organ was delayed several times, as opponents feared that the changes would damage the hall&#x27;s acoustics. Meanwhile, Carnegie Hall was profitable by the late 1960s, having consistently hosted about 350 shows a year during that decade.

Carnegie Hall became a more popular destination in the 1960s and 1970s, in part because of complaints over acoustics in the new Philharmonic Hall. The deficiencies with Carnegie Hall&#x27;s facilities became more prominent after the latter&#x27;s renovation. Carnegie Hall began to deteriorate due to neglect, and the corporation faced fiscal deficits. By the mid-1970s, the venue suffered from burst pipes and falling sections of the ceiling, and there were large holes in the balconies that patrons could put their feet through. At the same time, operating costs had increased from $3.5 million in 1977 to $10.3 million in 1984, and the deficits had also risen accordingly. Carnegie Hall&#x27;s equipment included a rundown air-conditioning system that did not work in the summer.

In 1977, the Carnegie Hall Corporation decided to stop allowing new residents for its upper-story studios; existing residents were allowed to continue living there. The studios were instead offered mainly to commercial tenants, who could afford to pay higher rents. This prompted protests from the existing tenants. In 1979, the board of Carnegie Hall Corporation hired James Stewart Polshek and his firm, Polshek Partnership, to create a master plan for Carnegie Hall&#x27;s renovation and expansion. Polshek found that Carnegie Hall&#x27;s electrical systems, exits, fire alarms, and other systems were not up to modern building codes. The next year, the Carnegie Hall Corporation and the New York City government signed a memorandum of understanding, which would permit the development of the adjacent site to the east, a parking lot. In 1981, the federal government gave Carnegie Hall $1.8 million for the renovation; the city and Astor Foundation had previously given $450,000.

==== 1980s ====
The first renovations started in February 1982 with the restoration and reconstruction of the recital hall and studio entrance. The lobby was lowered to street level, the box office was relocated behind the main auditorium, and two archways were added to the 57th Street facade. A new lobby and dedicated elevator for the recital hall was also created. The Carnegie Hall Corporation was also looking to develop a vacant lot immediately east of Carnegie Hall. The renovation was complicated by the fact that some parts of the original plans had been lost. A controversy also emerged when the Carnegie Hall Corporation started evicting longtime tenants of the upper-story studios, particularly those who refused to pay steeply increased rents. The first phase of the renovation was completed in September 1983 for $20 million. A second phase included upgrades to mechanical systems, such as air-conditioning and elevators.

As part of the third phase of renovations, a recording studio called the Alice and Jacob M. Kaplan Space was built within the old chapter room on the fifth floor, directly above the main hall. The Kaplan Space opened in March 1985. The corporation announced in May 1985 that the main hall and recital hall would be closed for several months. The corporation also started a fundraising drive to raise the $50 million needed to fund the renovation; more than half of the funding had already been raised at the time. A new structure designed by César Pelli, later to become the Carnegie Hall Tower, was planned for the lot immediately east of Carnegie Hall. Further upgrades, which required the main and recital halls&#x27; closure, included upgrades to both halls, the lobby, the facade, backstage areas, and offices. The lobby was lowered to street level and doubled in size.

The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the proposed renovation in July 1985. Renovation work began afterward. The project was complicated by the need to schedule construction around performances, the lack of a freight elevator, and the requirement that materials be replaced with close or exact replacements. In April 1986, Carnegie officials announced their intent to sublease the vacant lot to Rockrose Development for the construction of Carnegie Hall Tower. The following month, the hall closed completely for a seven-month renovation. The hall&#x27;s plaster decorations were restored, although the carpeting and seats were replaced. That November, Carnegie Hall announced it would rename the recital hall after Joan and Sanford I. Weill, who not only were major donors to the renovation but also enlisted other donors to fund the project. The Weill family had donated $2.5 million, more than any other donor in the hall&#x27;s history.

The main hall (including the Stern Auditorium) was reopened on December 15, 1986, with a gala featuring Zubin Mehta, Frank Sinatra, Vladimir Horowitz, and the New York Philharmonic. The Kaplan Rehearsal Space was also created in 1986, and the Weill Recital Hall opened in January 1987. A month after the main hall reopened, &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Bernard Holland criticized its acoustics, saying: &quot;The acoustics of this magnificent space are not the same.&quot; The Weill Recital Hall also received complaints about its acoustics, prompting Carnegie Hall officials to test out noise-absorbing panels in that space. Several noise-absorbing panels were installed in the main hall in 1988, but complaints continued for several years. Critics alleged there was concrete underneath the stage, but Carnegie Hall officials denied the allegations. Isaac Stern offered to disassemble the stage on the condition that the critics pay for the repairs if no concrete was found. Polshek Partners won the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Honor Award in 1988 for its renovation of the hall.

==== 1990s and early 2000s ====
During the late 1980s, Carnegie Hall had begun collecting items for the opening of a museum in the under-construction Carnegie Hall Tower. The Rose Museum was founded in April 1991, with its own entrance at 154 West 57th Street. The East Room and Club Room (later renamed Rohatyn Room and Shorin Club Room, respectively) were created the same year. Though the East and Club rooms were in Carnegie Hall Tower, they were connected to the original Carnegie Hall. This represented the first new space added to Carnegie Hall since the studios were added in the late 1890s. At the parquet level, Cafe Carnegie was also renovated.

The stage of the main hall had begun to warp by the early 1990s, and officials disassembled the stage in 1995, where they discovered a slab of concrete. John L. Tishman, president of Tishman Realty &amp; Construction, which had renovated the stage in 1986, alleged that the concrete was there before the renovation. The concrete was removed in mid-1995 while Carnegie Hall was closed for the summer; soon afterward, critics described a noticeable change in the acoustics.

In the basement, the Carnegie Hall Cinema operated separately from the rest of Carnegie Hall until 1997, when the hall&#x27;s management closed the cinema, along with two shops on Seventh Avenue. In late 1998, Carnegie Hall announced that it would turn the basement recital hall into another performance venue, designed by Polshek Associates. The project was to cost $50 million; the high cost was attributed to the fact that the work would require excavations under the basement while concerts and other events were ongoing. In recognition of a $10 million grant from Arthur and Judy Zankel, the new space was renamed after the Zankels in January 1999; the auditorium proper was named after Judith Arron, who donated $5 million. Construction took place without disrupting performances or the nearby subway tunnel. Zankel Hall had been planned to open in early 2003, but the opening date was postponed due to the city&#x27;s economic difficulties after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The excavations also raised the budget to $69 million.

=== 2000s to present ===

In June 2003, tentative plans were made for the Philharmonic to return to Carnegie Hall beginning in 2006, and for the orchestra to merge its business operations with those of the venue. However, the two groups abandoned these plans later that year. Zankel Hall opened in September 2003. Music critic Anthony Tommasini praised Zankel Hall&#x27;s flexibility, though he said &quot;the builders did not quite succeed in insulating the auditorium from the sounds of passing trains&quot;. Architecturally, the space was described by critic Herbert Muschamp as &quot;a luxury version of a black-box theater, the hall has the feel of a broadcasting studio, which it partly is&quot;. Though Zankel Hall&#x27;s large capacity was highly publicized, it was only reconfigured once in its first two and a half years of operation. The Stern Auditorium&#x27;s stage was renamed in March 2006 after Ronald Perelman, who had donated $20 million to Carnegie Hall.

At the end of 2005, Carnegie Hall formed a partnership with the neighboring City Center. The agreement would have allowed the venues to host each other&#x27;s dance, music, and theater programs; however, the partnership was canceled in early 2007. Carnegie Hall Corporation announced later in 2007 that it would evict all the remaining tenants of its upper-story studios so the corporation could convert the space into offices. By 2010, the last tenant had moved out. In 2014, Carnegie Hall opened its Judith and Burton Resnick Education Wing. The new wing houses 24 music rooms, one of which is large enough to hold an orchestra or a chorus. The $230 million project was funded with gifts from Joan and Sanford I. Weill and the Weill Family Fund, Judith and Burton Resnick, Lily Safra and other donors, as well as $52.2 million from the city, $11 million from the state, and $56.5 million from bonds issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York. The American Institute of Architects gave an architectural award to the project in 2017.

Carnegie Hall closed temporarily in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The hall reopened on October 6, 2021, with a performance by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Carnegie Hall returned to hosting a full schedule of programming during the 2022–2023 season. A new cafe at Carnegie Hall, the Weill Cafe, opened in January 2024.

== Events and performances ==
=== Orchestral performances ===
Symphony No. 9, opus 95, &quot;From the New World&quot; by Antonín Dvořák, performed on December 16, 1893, was the first world premiere at Carnegie Hall. By the 1900s, conductors such as Richard Strauss, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Camille Saint-Saëns, Alexander Scriabin, Edward Elgar, and Sergei Rachmaninoff were staging or performing their own music at Carnegie Hall. In its early years, Carnegie Hall hosted the New York Philharmonic and Symphony, as well as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Symphonic Orchestra, and other visiting orchestra companies. In particular, the Boston Symphony Orchestra regularly performed at Carnegie Hall after its first concert in 1893, and Leopold Stokowski of the Philadelphia Symphonic Orchestra regularly performed at the hall for six decades.

The hall also hosted recitals by solo performers such as pianists Arthur Rubinstein and Mieczysław Horszowski, who both debuted at Carnegie Hall in 1906 and continued performing there until 1976 and 1989, respectively.

The NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, frequently recorded in the Main Hall for RCA Victor. On November 14, 1943, the 25-year-old Leonard Bernstein had his major conducting debut when he had to substitute for a suddenly ill Bruno Walter in a concert that was broadcast by CBS. In late 1950, the NBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s weekly broadcast concerts were moved there, remaining until the orchestra disbanded following Toscanini&#x27;s retirement in April 1954.

=== Other concerts and recitals ===
Carnegie Hall was desegregated from its opening, in contrast to other music venues like the National Theatre, which remained segregated well into the 20th century. Sissieretta Jones became the first African-American to sing at Carnegie Hall on June 15, 1892, less than a year after the hall opened.

The hall was used for popular music as early as 1912, when James Reese Europe&#x27;s Clef Club Orchestra performed a &quot;proto-jazz&quot; concert there. Many jazz performers have also given performances at Carnegie Hall, including Benny Goodman, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Norman Granz, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Gil Evans, Nina Simone. Mary Lou Williams, Cecil Taylor, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, and Chucho Valdés. The Benny Goodman Orchestra gave a sold-out swing and jazz concert on January 16, 1938, with guest performers such as Count Basie and members of Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra.

Rock and roll music first came to Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley &amp; His Comets appeared in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their first trip to the United States. Promoter Sid Bernstein convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue &quot;would further international understanding&quot; between the United States and Great Britain. Two concerts by Led Zeppelin were performed on October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Some performers and bands had contracts that specified decibel limits for performances, an attempt to discourage rock performances at Carnegie Hall. Jethro Tull performed a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in November 1970, which was recorded and subsequently issued in several parts. Ike &amp; Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album &quot;What You Hear is What You Get&quot;. Chicago recorded its 4-LP box set &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; in 1971.

European folk dance music first came to Carnegie Hall when Tanec performed a concert on January 27, 1956, becoming the first dance company from Yugoslavia to perform in America. In 2024, Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen became the first reggaeton artist to headline a concert at the Carnegie Hall.

=== Other events ===
To celebrate the 125th anniversary of the hall, during the 2015–2016 season, Carnegie Hall officials commissioned 125 new works, with &quot;Fifty for the Future&quot; coming from Kronos (25 by female composers and 25 by male composers).

The hall has also been the site of lectures, including the Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture by Booker T. Washington, and the last public lecture by Mark Twain, both in 1906. The hall was also used for commencement ceremonies, including those of the City College of New York, the New York Law School, as well as the Juilliard School.

== Management and operations ==
, the Executive and Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall is Sir Clive Gillinson, formerly managing director of the London Symphony Orchestra. Gillinson started serving in that position in 2005. Robert F. Smith has been the chairman of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s board since 2016. As of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, the Carnegie Hall Corporation had $718,141,781 in assets, which includes about $185 million in liabilities, $112 million in net assets without donor restrictions, and $421 million in net assets with donor restrictions. During that year, the Carnegie Hall Corporation&#x27;s total operating revenue was about $74 million, while total expenses and losses were about $62 million.

== Carnegie Hall Archives ==
It emerged in 1986 that Carnegie Hall had never consistently maintained an archive. Without a central repository, a significant portion of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s documented history had been dispersed. In preparation for the celebration of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s centennial in 1991, the management established the Carnegie Hall Archives that year. The historical archival collections were renamed the Carnegie Hall Susan W. Rose Archives in 2021, after a longtime trustee and donor to the Archives and Rose Museum.

== Folklore ==
=== Famous joke ===
Rumor is that a pedestrian on Fifty-seventh Street, Manhattan, stopped Jascha Heifetz and inquired, &quot;Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Heifetz. &quot;Practice!&quot;

This joke has become part of the folklore of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. Although described in 1961 as an &quot;ancient wheeze&quot;, its earliest known appearances in print date from 1955. Attributions to Jack Benny are mistaken; it is uncertain if he ever used the joke. Alternatives to violinist Jascha Heifetz as the second party include an unnamed beatnik, bopper, or &quot;absent-minded maestro&quot;, as well as pianist Arthur Rubinstein and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Carnegie Hall archivist Gino Francesconi favors a version told by the wife of violinist Mischa Elman, in which her husband makes the quip when approached by tourists while leaving the hall&#x27;s backstage entrance after an unsatisfactory rehearsal. The joke is often reduced to a riddle with no framing story. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the joke &quot;shows how firmly the building [...] has lodged itself in American folklore&quot;.

=== Other lore ===
Other stories have been attributed to the folklore of Carnegie Hall. One such story concerns a performance on the unusually hot day of October 27, 1917, when Heifetz made his American debut in Carnegie Hall. After Heifetz had been playing for a while, fellow violinist Mischa Elman mopped his head and asked if it was hot in there. Pianist Leopold Godowsky, in the next seat, replied, &quot;Not for pianists.&quot;

While the Elman/Godowsky anecdote was confirmed to be true, other accounts about Carnegie Hall may have been apocryphal in nature. One such story involved violinist Fritz Kreisler and pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff, who were supposedly performing a Beethoven sonata when Kreisler lost track of what he was playing. After a few minutes of improvisation, Kreisler allegedly asked &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, Sergei, where am I?&quot;, to which Rachmaninoff was said to have responded, &quot;In Carnegie Hall.&quot;

<text>ANDOS is a Russian operating system for Electronika BK series computers: BK-0010, BK-0011, and BK-0011M. They were based on the PDP-11 architecture by Digital Equipment Corporation. ANDOS was created in 1990 and released first in 1992. Initially it was developed by Alexey Nadezhin (by whose name the system is named) and later also by Sergey Kamnev, who joined the project. It was the only widespread system on BK series computers that used MS-DOS-compatible file system format. ANDOS used the FAT12 file system on 800 Kb floppy disks. For Electronika BK-0011M and BK-0011, ANDOS could emulate a BK-0010 by loading a BK-0010 read-only memory (ROM) image into BK-0011(M) random-access memory (RAM). In minimal configuration, the system could occupy less than 4 Kb of RAM.

The system was able to support up to 64 disk drives (or hard disk drive partitions), and RAM disks in the computer&#x27;s memory and tape recording. It could also have read-only access to MicroDOS file system format disks, although in the last version, this function was transferred from system core to the file manager and became optional.

<text>In logic and mathematics, statements formula_1 and formula_2 are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in every model. The logical equivalence of formula_1 and formula_2 is sometimes expressed as formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, or formula_8, depending on the notation being used.
However, these symbols are also used for material equivalence, so proper interpretation would depend on the context. Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence, although the two concepts are intrinsically related.

==Logical equivalences==
In logic, many common logical equivalences exist and are often listed as laws or properties. The following tables illustrate some of these.

=== General logical equivalences ===
=== Logical equivalences involving conditional statements ===

:#formula_9
:#formula_10
:#formula_11
:#formula_12
:#formula_13
:#formula_14
:#formula_15
:#formula_16
:#formula_17

=== Logical equivalences involving biconditionals ===

:#formula_18
:#formula_19
:#formula_20
:#formula_21
:#formula_22
:#formula_23

Where formula_24 represents XOR.

==Examples==

=== In logic ===
The following statements are logically equivalent:

#If Lisa is in Denmark, then she is in Europe (a statement of the form formula_25).
#If Lisa is not in Europe, then she is not in Denmark (a statement of the form formula_26).

Syntactically, (1) and (2) are derivable from each other via the rules of contraposition and double negation. Semantically, (1) and (2) are true in exactly the same models (interpretations, valuations); namely, those in which either &quot;Lisa is in Denmark&quot; is false or &quot;Lisa is in Europe&quot; is true.

(Note that in this example, classical logic is assumed. Some non-classical logics do not deem (1) and (2) to be logically equivalent.)

==Relation to material equivalence==

Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence. Formulas formula_1 and formula_2 are logically equivalent if and only if the statement of their material equivalence (formula_29) is a tautology.

The material equivalence of formula_1 and formula_2 (often written as formula_29) is itself another statement in the same object language as formula_1 and formula_2. This statement expresses the idea &quot;&#x27;formula_1 if and only if formula_2&#x27;&quot;. In particular, the truth value of formula_29 can change from one model to another.

On the other hand, the claim that two formulas are logically equivalent is a statement in metalanguage, which expresses a relationship between two statements formula_1 and formula_2. The statements are logically equivalent if, in every model, they have the same truth value.

<text>Cheech &amp; Chong are a comedy duo founded in Vancouver and consisting of American Cheech Marin and Canadian Tommy Chong. The duo found commercial and cultural success in the 1970s and 1980s with their stand-up routines, studio recordings, and feature films, which were based on the hippie and free love era, and especially the drug and counterculture movements, most notably their love for cannabis.

==Career==

===Early years===

The duo met in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1969. Chong was a Canadian citizen, and Cheech had moved there from Southern California to avoid the draft at the height of the Vietnam War. Chong had formed an improv group called &quot;City Works&quot; after seeing Second City Improv while touring as a musician. City Works performed as part of a &quot;hippie burlesque&quot; at Shanghai Junk, a strip club owned by Chong&#x27;s family. Marin briefly joined City Works as a replacement for the original straight man.

According to Chong&#x27;s book &quot;The Unauthorized Autobiographyæ&quot;, the two came out one night to warm up the crowd for a new musical group of Chong&#x27;s, but never relinquished the stage due to the audience&#x27;s strong laughter. As the improv group had not been a financial success at the strip club—they drew a large but low-spending crowd—the two decided to form a comedy duo and play different venues. Successful as a duo, they eventually moved to Los Angeles.

===Mainstream success===

The pair performed stand-up shows, released many successful comedy record albums, and starred in a series of low-budget films. Some of their best-known comedy routines and songs include &quot;Earache My Eye&quot;, &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus and His Old Lady&quot;, and &quot;Sister Mary Elephant&quot;. Perhaps their most famous line is &quot;&quot;Dave&#x27;s not here&quot;,&quot; from their self-titled debut album.

Their early success culminated with the release of their first feature-length movie, &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;, in 1978. It became something of a cult classic, and was also successful enough at the box office (grossing over $44 million despite a low budget) to warrant two sequels: &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot; in 1980, and &quot;Nice Dreams&quot; in 1981. These were followed by the less successful &quot;Things Are Tough All Over&quot; (1982) and &quot;Still Smokin&quot; (1983). The pair attempted a departure from their stoner comedy with 1984&#x27;s &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s The Corsican Brothers&quot;. Their most recent starring vehicle as a duo was 2014&#x27;s &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Animated Movie&quot;.

Chong directed four of their films while co-writing and starring in all seven with Marin.

They also appeared in smaller supporting roles in Graham Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot;, as well as a Joni Mitchell song (&quot;Twisted&quot; on the album &quot;Court and Spark&quot;).

In 1985 the duo released their album &quot;Get Out of My Room&quot;, which included the novelty hit song &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot; (based on Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;). This song later served as the basis for 1987 film of the same title, in which Marin played the starring role. Immediately following the release of the album, Marin separated himself from the pair&#x27;s drug-inspired act by working on a solo career. 

===Reunion===
After their contentious parting in the 1980s, the duo spent years without working together. In 1992 the two worked together for the first time in several years, voicing characters in the animated film &quot;&quot;. In 1997, Chong made an appearance on Marin&#x27;s TV series &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, in an episode titled &quot;Wild Card,&quot; which contained a reference to their iconic &quot;Dave&quot; skit from their 1972 debut album. In 2000 both performers voiced characters in the animated television series &quot;South Park&quot; for the episode &quot;Cherokee Hair Tampons&quot;, but their voices were recorded separately. Both Marin and Chong indicated in a 2003 episode of &quot;Biography&quot; that they were willing to reunite.

The duo had plans to reunite for another film when Chong&#x27;s California-based company, Chong&#x27;s Glass, was raided by federal officials in February 2003, as part of a federal crackdown on &quot;drug-related paraphernalia&quot;. In a plea bargain which allowed his son and wife to remain out of jail, Chong pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to distribute drug paraphernalia in May, and in September 2003 was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, fined $20,000, and forced to forfeit $120,000 in assets. He was released in July 2004. His cellmate was Jordan Belfort.

With Chong released, the duo planned to resume production on a reunion film. A variety of titles were rumored, including &quot;Grumpy Old Stoners&quot;. But they announced in September 2005 that the reunion film had been canceled. Beginning in September 2008, Cheech and Chong reunited for the Light Up America comedy tour which opened in Ottawa, making a radio program appearance on &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot;. In March 2009, they recorded two shows at the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio for a DVD release of the reunion tour.

In 2011, both performers were guests stars on the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, on the episode &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Nice Dream&quot;. The episode focuses on a fictitious separation of the duo, with Homer taking Chong&#x27;s place.

In August 2012, Cheech &amp; Chong appeared at the 13th annual Gathering of the Juggalos in Cave-in-Rock, IL.

In February 2014, Cheech and Chong appeared on an episode of &quot;Tom Green Live&quot;.

In March 2014, they announced they were working on a new movie, with writer/director Jay Chandrasekhar.

==Additional notable media appearances==

In 1974, Cheech &amp; Chong contributed background voices on the song &quot;Twisted&quot;, on Joni Mitchell&#x27;s album &quot;Court and Spark&quot;.

In 1975, Cheech &amp; Chong featured on the Hoyt Axton track &quot;No No Song,&quot; on Axton&#x27;s album &quot;Southbound&quot;. They are credited with &quot;attempted temptation&quot; in the liner notes.

In 1979, Cheech &amp; Chong were given the Comedy Medal from Mira Costa College.

In 2007, Brett Harvey&#x27;s marijuana advocacy documentary &quot;The Union: The Business Behind Getting High&quot; starred Tommy Chong as a commentator about marijuana related issues and his drug paraphernalia charge in 2003. The film had many other notable names such as former Vancouver mayor Larry Campbell, Canadian marijuana seed retailer Marc Emery, Canadian baking marijuana icon &quot;Watermelon Girl&quot;, and other marijuana advocates like Author &amp; Former &#x27;Pot TV&#x27; Manager ChrBennett and former &quot;High Times&quot; editor Steve Bloom.

On November 5, 2008, Cheech and Chong reunited for a &quot;Funny or Die&quot; video titled &quot;Cheech and Chong Get Out the Vote!&quot; The video, which encouraged people to get out and vote, was released the day after the United States general election.

On November 30, 2008, Cheech &amp; Chong were honored during the roast special &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong: Roasted&quot; on TBS hosted by Brad Garrett which included other guests, among them Chong&#x27;s wife. The event was filmed at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas during The Comedy Festival.

On April 17, 2009, while on the Sydney leg of their &quot;Cheech and Chong Light Up Australia&quot; Tour, they had to delay the start of their show as it became the target of a drug operation by the New South Wales Police. About 25 police and four drug dogs were involved, searching around 50 people, with six people caught in possession of small amounts of cannabis.

On January 25, 2010, Cheech &amp; Chong appeared on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot;. During a singing segment they started to perform their song &quot;Mexican Americans&quot;, but it turned into &quot;Get It Legal&quot;, in reference to their current U.S. tour. On March 1, 2010, Cheech &amp; Chong were the guest hosts of WWE Raw in Oklahoma City. On April 20, 2010 (4/20) &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Hey, Watch This&quot;, the DVD filmed in San Antonio on March 14, 2009, was released.

In September 2011, Cheech &amp; Chong appeared in a viral video posted on YouTube which at first appeared to be a trailer for a (non-existent) upcoming movie titled &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Magic Brownie Adventure&quot;, but which at the end revealed itself to be a commercial for Fiber One 100-calorie snack brownies.

In 2012, Chong revealed to CNN&#x27;s Don Lemon that he was battling prostate cancer. It was unknown how this would affect any future projects.

On September 28, 2014, they were guests of Doug Benson on his podcast &quot;Getting Doug with High&quot;.

The pair appeared together on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; on April 23, 2018, in response to recent news that John Boehner had joined the board of a marijuana company. The pair expressed displeasure that marijuana was no longer rebellious, Cheech remarking that he could now buy weed &quot;from a store in a strip mall&quot; when before he could only buy it from &quot;behind a store in a strip mall&quot;. They then joked that they would no longer be doing stoner comedy and would do comedy about things that were still illegal, such as unpasteurized dairy products, importing exotic reptiles, taping and distributing football games without the consent of the NFL, and burning leaves without a permit.

Cheech &amp; Chong were selected by the Red Hot Chili Peppers to present to them the Global Icon Award at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2022.

On April 17, 2024, Cheech &amp; Chong were added to Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Modern Warfare III as a part of a purchasable bundle worth 3,000 CoD Points (equivalent to 30 USD). In this bundle, the player receives both Cheech &amp; Chong as playable characters, as well as three weapon blueprints with special &quot;Pain Puff Tracers&quot; and the &quot;Doobie Dismemberment&quot; effect upon killing an enemy, a unique execution, loading screen, weapon charms, and decals.

==Unproduced films==

In 1980, there were plans to make a film called &quot;Riding High with Cheech &amp; Chong&quot;.

Ivan Reitman conceived &quot;Stripes&quot; as a Cheech and Chong vehicle. Cheech and Chong&#x27;s manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control, so Reitman told the screenwriters to rewrite it for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis.

Screenwriter Tom McLoughlin also pitched a sequel to the slasher film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; in which Cheech and Chong, playing camp counselors, faced off against killer Jason Voorhees, as a comedy horror movie in the vein of &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;.

The hyenas Banzai and Shenzi in the 1994 animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; were storyboarded as being characters modeled after Cheech and Chong. Due to the duo not getting along with each other at the time, and Whoopi Goldberg taking interest in the role of Shenzi, Chong was not cast, but Cheech played the part of Banzai.

<text>The Electronika BK is a series of 16-bit PDP-11-compatible home computers developed under the Electronika brand by NPO Scientific Center, then the leading microcomputer design team in the Soviet Union. It is also the predecessor of the more powerful UKNC and DVK micros.

==Overview==
First released in 1985 (developed in 1983), they are based on the К1801ВМ1 (Soviet LSI-11-compatible CPU) and were the only &quot;official&quot; (government approved and accounted for in economic planning) Soviet home computer design in mass production.

They sold for about 600–650 roubles. This was costly, as the average Soviet monthly wage then was about 150 roubles. Despite their cost, they became one of the most popular home computer models in the Soviet Union. Later, in the 1990s, their powerful central processing unit (CPU) and straightforward, easy-to-program design made them popular as demoscene machines. &quot;BK&quot; (&quot;&quot;) is a Russian abbreviation for (bytovoy kompyuter) – domestic (or home) computer. The machines were also used for a short time as cash registers, for example, in the GUM department store.

==Software==
The BK series is a bare-bones machine, with no peripherals or programming tools. The only software available at the launch, except read-only memory (ROM) firmware, is an included magnetic tape with several programming examples (for the languages BASIC and FOCAL), and several tests. The ROM firmware includes a simple program to enter machine codes, BASIC and FOCAL interpreters.

While the BK is somewhat compatible with larger and more expensive DVK professional model microcomputers and industrial minicomputers like the SM EVM series, its 32 KiB memory, of which only 16 KiB is generally available to programmers (an extended memory mode supports 28 KiB, but limits video output to a quarter of the screen), generally precludes direct use of software for the more powerful machines. The DVK became a popular development platform for BK software, and most DVK software can be used directly with memory capacity extended to 128 KiB.
Hobbyist developers quickly filled this niche, porting several programming tools from DVK and UKNC. This led to an explosion of homebrew software, from text editors and databases to operating systems and video games. Most BK owners expanded the built-in RAM to at least 64 KiB, which allows easier software porting, and as these upgrades often include floppy drive controllers, individuals creating disk operating systems became something of a competitive sport in the BK scene. Games and demoscene communities also flourished, as its poor graphics are offset by a powerful CPU.

One of the operating systems was ANDOS, although officially the computer shipped with OS BK-11, a modification of RT-11.

==Hardware==
The machine is based on a 16-bit single-chip K1801VM1 CPU, clocked generally at 3 MHz. It is compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s LSI-11 line, though it lacks Extended Instruction Set (EIS) and further instruction set extensions. The manufacturer also closely copied the PDP-11&#x27;s internal architecture. Each model has one free card slot which is electrically, but not mechanically, compatible with Q-Bus. The first version features 32 KiB onboard DRAM, half of which is video memory. That is extended to 128 KiB in later models, with video memory extended to two 16 KiB pages.

Video output on all models is provided by the K1801VP1-037 VDC, a rather spartan chip. It is a standard 600 gate array, or &quot;uncommitted logic array&quot; (ULA), with a VDC program that allows for two graphic video modes, high-resolution (512×256, monochrome) and low-resolution (256×256, 4 colors), and supports hardware vertical scrolling. Later models have 16 hardwired 4-color sets selectable from 64 color palette. It does not support text modes, but simulates two via BIOS routines: 32×25 and 64×25. Some operating systems such as ANDOS have managed to output text in 80×25 mode when displaying documents imported from IBM PC, by placing characters more densely. Output is through two separate 5-pin DIN connectors for a monochrome TV or color TV/monitor. Sound on all models is initially through a simple programmable counter connected to an onboard piezo speaker. The General Instrument AY-3-8910 is a popular aftermarket addition.

All models also have a 16-bit universal parallel port with separate input and output buses for connecting peripherals such as printers (Eastern Bloc printers used the incompatible IFSP () interface instead of the IEEE 1284 (Centronics) port, so Centronics printers need an adapter), mouse or Covox digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for sound output, and tape recorder port for data storage. Later models include a manufacturer-supplied floppy drive controller (that can be plugged into a Q-Bus slot) by default. It is available for earlier models as an aftermarket part, but homebrew ones (that also often extends 16 KiB memory of original BK) are more popular.

===Versions===
====BK-0010====
The is the first model (originally released in 1983, serial production started in 1985). It has a pseudo-membrane keyboard (an array of mechanical microswitches without keycaps, covered by flexible overlay), 32 KiB RAM, 8 KiB ROM with BIOS (chip K1801RE2-017), 8 KiB ROM with FOCAL interpreter (K1801RE2-018), 8 KiB ROM with debugger (K1801RE2-019) and one free ROM slot, and its CPU is clocked at 3 MHz. A tape recorder is used for data storage in the factory configuration.

This model was criticized for its uncomfortable keyboard – while mechanical in nature, lack of keycaps lead to the same unsatisfactory tactile response, that was seen as unacceptable when the machine was used in home or educational settings, although such keyboard could be easily sealed fully, so this version found wide use as an industrial controller. Other points of criticism included the archaic FOCAL programming language supplied by default and the lack of peripherals and software. While all hardware was well-documented and easy to work with, the machine was delivered with no programming tools.

====BK-0010.01====
The follow-up version, БК-0010.01 (sometimes referred to as -0010-01), is essentially the same machine, but with a conventional full-travel keyboard and a Vilnius BASIC p-code compiler in the ROM, correcting the weakest points of its predecessor. While the BASIC dialect used is powerful and well-optimized (it is a scaled-down clone of MSX BASIC), the keyboard still has shortcomings. While it is much more comfortable to work with, the keys were prone to sticking, significant bounce and wore quickly, though a model with a further improved keyboard became available later. The FOCAL interpreter was not dropped but instead shipped on an external ROM cartridge that can be inserted into the Q-Bus slot.

====BK-0010Sh====
 is a model intended for school use. It can be either the −0010 or −0010.01 model but includes a special current loop network adapter rated at 19200 bits per second (bit/s), which can be inserted into the Q-Bus slot. Based on ULA chip K1801VP1-035 (and later on K1801VP1-065), the adapter is compatible with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) DL-11 and KL-11 serial interfaces, but without modem control bits. It also includes a monitor, usually a modified Yunost&#x27; compact TV for school settings.

====BK-0011====
BK-0011 was released in 1989. It has 128 KiB of RAM divided into 16 KiB pages; its CPU is clocked at 4 MHz by default. It includes a newer version of BASIC in ROM and 16 selectable video palettes, which were almost universally criticized by users for their odd color combinations. It has a floppy controller, with the drive available as an add-on.

====BK-0011M====
Some changes in the BK-0011, while minor, made it incompatible with earlier -0010 models. It cannot load 0010 programs from a cassette tape. Even if it could have loaded them, crucial subsystems, such as sound, are still incompatible. The manufacturer redesigned the machine, restoring compatibility with earlier models. The resulting model, the BK-0011M, quickly went into production, and most BK-0011 series computers are actually BK-0011Ms. Since the modifications were minor, most of the handful of -0011 models that made it to market have been upgraded to -0011M models by enthusiasts.

===Mods===
It is not uncommon among owners to install one or two mechanical switches that made using the computer more convenient. Some of the common mods were:

* Reset push-button. Programs often hang. Also, some games do not have a properly implemented Exit function. Without this button, the computer has to be reset by power cycling, which eventually leads to a worn out power switch on the external power supply. The reset interrupt can be caught by the operating system, so under such systems (for example, ANDOS, MK-DOS), the reset button exits to the OS&#x27;s file manager.
* Pause switch. This switch activates hardware suspension of instruction execution in the processor. The pause switch is useful for pausing games, most of which do not have a pause key. A few games, however, do not behave gracefully after being returned from suspension, because the programmable hardware timer built into the processor chip is still running while the instruction execution was suspended. The BK also has a software key combination for pause.
* Clock speed switch (&quot;turbo&quot; switch). This changes the processor clock speed from the standard 3 MHz (BK-0010* series) to 4 or 6 MHz, or from the standard 4 MHz (BK-0011* series) to 3 or 6 MHz. Not all processor samples work reliably at 6 MHz; the possibility of such overclocking has to be determined experimentally for each sample. Switching the clock speed changes the pace of dynamic games. The turbo switch usually has to be installed together with the pause switch, because the simplest circuit for switching the clock speed produces bad waveform shapes in the clock signal due to contact bounce in the mechanical switch, running the risk of hanging the software execution unless the processor is in the suspended state.
* Sound on/off switch, or sound volume knob, which adjusts the volume level of the internal piezoelectric speaker using a potentiometer. At this same time as adding this, the modder can replace the speaker with a louder one.

Enthusiasts also manage to connect more advanced devices to BK series computers: they developed a hard disk drive (HDD) controller, and 2.5&quot; HDDs have been successfully used with BK computers. Other popular enhancements are AY-3-8912 sound chips and Covox Speech Thing.

==Emulators==
There are various software emulators of BK for modern IBM PC compatible computers. An emulator is able to run at a much higher speed than the original BK.

There are also fairly complete re-implementations of the BK for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based systems, such as the MiST.

<doc id="169332" wikidata="Q3403228" url="?curid=169332" title="Capital of Wales">
<text>The current capital of Wales is Cardiff. Historically, Wales did not have a definite capital. In 1955, the Minister for Welsh Affairs informally proclaimed Cardiff to be the capital of Wales. Since 1964, Cardiff has been home to government offices for Wales, and since 1999 it has been the seat of the Senedd.

==History==
Between the end of Roman rule and the conquest by Edward I in the late 13th century, Wales was usually divided between four kingdoms. There were only brief periods where the land was dominated by a single ruler, most notably by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in the 11th century. Rather than being based in a fixed location, Welsh kings would maintain an itinerant court, as was the norm in medieval Europe.

In the past, multiple places have served as a seat of the government of Wales, including:
*Abergwyngregyn the seat of the Kingdom of Gwynedd
*Strata Florida Abbey, the Cistercian abbey where Llywelyn the Great held council in 1238. 
*Machynlleth, where Owain Glyndŵr held a parliament in 1404.
*Ludlow (Welsh &quot;Llwydlo&quot;, in Shropshire, England), seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches from 1473 to 1689.
The ecclesiastical capital of Wales is St Davids, the resting place of the country&#x27;s patron saint, Saint David.

In the 19th century, Cardiff grew to become the largest settlement in Wales, due to its role as a port for exporting coal from the South Wales Valleys. By 1881, it had overtaken both Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil to become the country&#x27;s most populous urban area, and in 1905, it received city status. In subsequent years, an increasing number of Welsh national institutions were founded in the city, including the National Museum of Wales (chartered in 1907), Welsh National War Memorial (unveiled 1928), and the Registry Building (1903) of the University of Wales. However, the National Library of Wales (chartered 1907) is located in Aberystwyth. This was partly because the library&#x27;s founder, Sir John Williams, did not think that Cardiff was a Welsh city in character. The investiture of the Prince of Wales, a ceremony revived in 1911, takes place within the shell of Caernarfon Castle in northwest Wales. Since 1920, the election of the Archbishop of Wales has taken place in Llandrindod Wells, chosen for its central location.

In the 20th century, Welsh local authorities debated where a new capital of Wales should be, with 76 out of 161 opting for Cardiff in a 1924 poll, organised by the &quot;South Wales Daily News&quot;. The authorities were mostly split between Cardiff and Caernarfon, with a smaller faction supporting Aberystwyth. The discussions stalled and progress was not made until 1950.

===Recognition of Cardiff===
The government of the Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, had not named a capital of Wales during his government. Attlee noted that a number of cities made claims to the status, and that the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire did not raise what he considered to be a &quot;domestic issue&quot; with the Government. In his inaugural speech as Lord Mayor of Cardiff, George Williams argued that Cardiff should be considered the capital of Wales. David Llewellyn was elected MP for Cardiff North in 1950 and also campaigned for recognising Cardiff. Campaigning for Cardiff stepped up and the city took steps to promote its &#x27;Welshness&#x27;. The stalemate over which city should be the new capital was broken when Cardiganshire County Council decided to support Cardiff and, in a 1955 poll of local authorities, 134 out of 161 voted for the city.

On 20 December 1955, Gwilym Lloyd-George, then Minister for Welsh Affairs and Home Secretary, proclaimed that Cardiff was the capital of Wales, in a reply to a Parliamentary question from David Llewellyn. Lloyd-George said that &quot;no formal measures are necessary to give effect to this decision&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia of Wales&quot; says that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales &quot;had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal Conservative constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have&quot;.

===Government institutions===
Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the Welsh Office in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the Welsh Development Agency, most of which were based in Cardiff.

In a 1997 referendum, Wales narrowly voted in favour of establishing the National Assembly for Wales (now known as the Senedd), although only 44% supported the proposal in Cardiff. Due to the relative lack of support for the Assembly locally, and disagreements between the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council over where it should sit, there was a brief period of speculation that the Assembly would be established elsewhere. However, the Assembly eventually located at Tŷ Hywel in Cardiff Bay in 1999. It has been based there ever since, moving to its present building in 2006.

<text>The capital of Germany is the City Land of Berlin. It is the seat of the Federal President of Germany, whose official residence is Bellevue Castle. The Federal Council is the representation of the Lands of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords. Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Although Berlin is officially the capital of Germany, 8,000 out of the 18,000 total officials employed at the federal bureaucracy still work in Bonn, about away from Berlin.

== History ==

=== Pre-1871 ===

Prior to 1871, Germany was not a unified nation-state, and had no capital city. The medieval German Holy Roman Empire used to have Aachen as its preferred seat of government during Charlemagne&#x27;s reign, and until 1531 it was the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans. The coronation later moved to Frankfurt. However, after Charlemagne, none of the subsequent Holy Roman Emperors moved to Aachen or Frankfurt, instead retaining their own original constituent kingdom or principality as base or moving into temporary Royal palaces dotted around the confederate realm known as Kaiserpfalz. The last imperial ruling house (the Habsburgs) had Vienna as its permanent seat of government.

After the Congress of Vienna created the formal German Confederation in 1815, a Federal Assembly convened at the Free City of Frankfurt, representing not the people of the individual German Lands but their sovereigns. Subsequently, Frankfurt briefly became the official German capital during the short-lived Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.

=== 1871–1945 ===

It was only during the 1871 unification of Germany that the newly unified German Reich was first assigned an official capital. Since Berlin was the capital of Prussia, the leading state of the new Reich, it became the capital of Germany as well. Berlin had been the capital of Prussia and its predecessor, Brandenburg (an der Havel), since 1518. Berlin remained the capital of the German Reich until 1945. However, for a period of a few months following the First World War, the national assembly met in Weimar because civil war was ravaging Berlin. After the capture of Berlin in 1945, Flensburg briefly served as capital. Germany was then occupied by the Allies as the outcome of World War II, and Berlin ceased to be the capital of a sovereign German state.

=== 1945–1990 ===

In 1949, with sovereignty regained the country split up into Germany (western) and East Germany. Berlin was also divided, into West Berlin and East Berlin. Originally, Frankfurt was to be the provisional capital of western Germany. However, the authorities of state intended to make Berlin the capital if Germany were ever reunified. They feared that since Frankfurt was a major city in its own right, it would ultimately be accepted as a permanent capital and weaken western German support for reunification. For this reason, the capital was located in the smaller university city of Bonn as a more obviously provisional solution. Another factor was that Bonn is close to Cologne, the hometown of Germany&#x27;s first Federal Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.

East Germany claimed all of Berlin as its capital, although the city as a whole was still legally occupied territory and would remain so for 41 years. In reality, the Soviet occupation sector of Berlin, East Berlin served as the East German capital.

=== 1990–present ===

In 1990, with the reunification of Germany, Berlin was also reunified and became the capital of the enlarged Germany. There was some debate, however, on whether the seat of government should move to Berlin. Many believed that Bonn should remain the seat of government – a situation analogous to that of the Netherlands, where Amsterdam is the capital but The Hague is the seat of government. In 1991, after an emotional debate, the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin by 1999. However, six ministries remained in Bonn, each with a second office in Berlin.

* Strict conditional or strict implication, a connective of modal logic that expresses necessity
* &quot;modus ponens&quot;, or implication elimination, a simple argument form and rule of inference summarized as &quot;p&quot; implies &quot;q&quot;; &quot;p&quot; is asserted to be true, so therefore &quot;q&quot; must be true&quot;

== Linguistics ==

<text>was a Japanese video game developer based in Tokyo responsible for the creation of a wide array of scrolling shooters and other arcade video games. The company was founded in 1979 but its gaming division was established in 1984 by former Orca and Crux employees, who wanted to make games, after both companies declared bankruptcy. Their first shoot &#x27;em up game, &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot; (1985) on arcades, was a success and helped establish Toaplan as a leading producer of shooting games throughout the 1980s and 1990s that would continue to characterize their output.

Though initially exclusive to arcades, they expanded with the Sega Genesis in 1990. The company ceased development of shoot &#x27;em up projects before declaring bankruptcy in 1994. Several offshoot developers such as Eighting, Tamsoft, CAVE, Gazelle, and Takumi Corporation were formed prior to and after the closure, while former members later joined to other studios such as Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Square Enix and Taito. Toaplan has since earned recognition from critics, being called one of the greatest and most influential Japanese shoot &#x27;em up developers and &quot;master&quot; of the scrolling shooter genre.

== History ==

Toaplan was established in April 1979 but its gaming division was established by former Orca and Crux members. &quot;Performan&quot; was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura.

In 1992, Yoshiyuki Kiyomoto stepped down from his position as CEO at Toaplan, with Taizo Hayashi now serving as the company&#x27;s president. Toaplan provided consultance and advising to Raizing (now Eighting) during the development of &quot;Sorcer Striker&quot;, as well as licensing their arcade board to the company, since the president of the latter company previously served as an employee of the former. &quot;Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves&quot; served as one of the final projects to be developed by Toaplan, as the company ceased development of shoot &#x27;em up games before their closure.

The company declared bankruptcy on March 31, 1994. Its closure led to the formation of several offshoot companies. Prior to Toaplan&#x27;s closure in 1994, several former employees formed or were involved with multiple companies, many of which were dedicated to arcade shooters: Eighting, Tamsoft, CAVE, Gazelle, and Takumi (who continued development of &quot;Twin Cobra II&quot; after Toaplan&#x27;s closure).

The rights to nearly every Toaplan IP are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Yuge. In 2019, Japanese company M2 announced that in 2020 they will release every game by Toaplan (excluding &quot;Mahjong Sisters&quot; and &quot;Enma Daiō&quot;) for consoles in Japan. In August 2022, Tatsujin was acquired by Embracer Group for a retro gaming focused operative group. In September 2023, close to Tokyo Game Show 2023, TATSUJIN announced new projects, such as &quot;Truxton Extreme&quot;, &quot;Snow Bros. Wonderland&quot; (both games being sequels to their respective series) and &quot;Amusement Arcade TOAPLAN&quot;, a compilation of 25 Arcade games for smartphones.

<doc id="169351" wikidata="Q16990" url="?curid=169351" title="Mount Etna">
<text>Mount Etna, or simply Etna ( or ; or ; ; and ), is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It is located above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe, and the tallest peak in Italy south of the Alps with a current height (September 2024) of , though this varies with summit eruptions. For instance, in 2021 the southeastern crater reached a height of 3,357 m, but was then surpassed by the Voragine crater after the summer 2024 eruptions.

Etna covers an area of with a basal circumference of . This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide on Tenerife in the Canary Islands surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region west of the Black Sea.

In Greek mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said also to be underneath it.

Mount Etna is one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils produced from this activity support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations. In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.


==Etymology and mythology==

One view is that the word &quot;Etna&quot; is from the Greek (), meaning &quot;I burn&quot;, through an iotacist pronunciation. Another view is that the name is derived from the Phoenician word &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;furnace&#x27; or &#x27;chimney&#x27;. In Classical Greek, it is called (), a name given also to Catania and the city originally known as Inessa. In Latin it is called . In Arabic, it is called (, &#x27;the Mountain of Fire&#x27;). According to both Roman and Greek mythology, Vulcan/Hephaestus, the god of blacksmithing, had his forge under mount Etna.

The volcano is also known as in Sicilian and in Italian, generally regarded as deriving from the Romance word / plus the Arabic word (), both meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;. According to another hypothesis, the term comes from the Latin (, &#x27;he who placates the fire&#x27;), one of the Latin names of the god Vulcan. Today, the name &quot;Mongibello&quot; is used for the area of Mount Etna containing the two central craters, and the craters located southeast and northeast of the volcanic cone.

The name &quot;Mongibel&quot; is found in Arthurian Romance, as the name of the otherworld castle (or realm) of Morgan le Fay and her half-brother, King Arthur, localised at Etna, according to traditions concerning them derived from the stories told by the Breton &quot;conteurs&quot; who accompanied the Norman occupiers of Sicily.
What were originally Welsh conceptions concerning a dwarf king of a paradisal, Celtic underworld became attached to the quasi-historic figure of Arthur as &quot;Ruler of the Antipodes&quot; and were then transplanted into a Sicilian milieu, by Bretons impressed by the already otherworldly associations of the great, volcanic mountain of their new home. Mediaevalist Roger Sherman Loomis quotes passages from the works of Gervase of Tilbury and Caesarius of Heisterbach (dating from the late twelfth century) featuring accounts of Arthur&#x27;s returning of a lost horse which had strayed into his subterranean kingdom beneath Etna. Caesarius quotes as his authority for the story a certain canon Godescalcus of Bonn, who considered it a matter of historical fact of the time of Emperor Henry&#x27;s conquest of Sicily &quot;circa&quot; 1194. Caesarius employs in his account the Latin phrase (&#x27;within Etna&#x27;) to describe the location of Arthur&#x27;s kingdom.

The &quot;Fada de Gibel&quot; of the Castle of &quot;Gibaldar&quot; (Fairy of Etna) appears in &quot;Jaufre&quot;, the only surviving Arthurian romance in the Occitan language, the composition of which is dated to between 1180 and 1230. However, in &quot;Jaufre&quot;, while it is clear from her name that the fairy queen in question is Morgan le Fay, the rich underworld queendom of which she is the mistress is accessed not through a fiery grotto on the slopes of Etna, but through a &#x27;fountain&#x27; (i.e., a spring) – a circumstance more in keeping with Morgan&#x27;s original watery, rather than fiery, associations, before her incorporation into the folklore of Sicily. Another Sicilian conception of the fairy realm or castle of Morgan le Fay is the Fata Morgana, an optical phenomenon common in the Strait of Messina.

==History of volcanic eruptions==
Eruptions of Etna follow multiple patterns. Most occur at the summit, where there are five distinct craters: the Northeast Crater, the Voragine, the Bocca Nuova, and two at the Southeast Crater Complex. Other eruptions occur on the flanks, which have more than 300 vents ranging in size from small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across. Summit eruptions can be highly explosive and spectacular but rarely threaten the inhabited areas around the volcano. In contrast, flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude, close to or even well within inhabited areas. Numerous villages and small towns lie around or on cones of past flank eruptions. Since the year AD 1600, at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century. Since 2000, Etna has had four flank eruptions – in 2001, 2002–2003, 2004–2005, and 2008–2009. Summit eruptions occurred in 2006, 2007–2008, January–April 2012, in July–October 2012, December 2018, and again in February 2021.

===Geological history===
Volcanic activity first took place at Etna about 500,000 years ago, with eruptions occurring beneath the sea off the ancient coastline of Sicily. About 300,000 years ago, volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit (centre top of the volcano), then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 years ago. Eruptions at this time built up the first major volcanic edifice, forming a stratovolcano in alternating explosive and effusive eruptions. The growth of the mountain was occasionally interrupted by major eruptions, leading to the collapse of the summit to form calderas.

From about 35,000 to 15,000 years ago, Etna experienced some highly explosive eruptions, generating large pyroclastic flows, which left extensive ignimbrite deposits. Ash from these eruptions has been found as far away as south of Rome&#x27;s border, to the north.

Thousands of years ago, the eastern flank of the mountain experienced a catastrophic collapse, generating an enormous landslide in an event similar to that seen in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The landslide left a large depression in the side of the volcano, known as &#x27;Valle del Bove&#x27; (Valley of the Ox). Research published in 2006 suggested this occurred around 8,000 years ago, and caused a huge tsunami, which left its mark in several places in the eastern Mediterranean.

The steep walls of the valley have suffered subsequent collapses on numerous occasions. The strata exposed in the valley walls provide an important and easily accessible record of Etna&#x27;s eruptive history.

The most recent collapse event at the summit of Etna is thought to have occurred about 2,000 years ago, forming what is known as the Piano Caldera. This caldera has been almost entirely filled by subsequent lava eruptions but is still visible as a distinct break in the slope of the mountain near the base of the present-day summit cone.

Mount Etna is moving towards the Mediterranean Sea at an average rate of per year, the massif sliding on an unconsolidated layer above the older sloping terrain.

===Historical eruptions===

The first known record of eruption at Etna is that of Diodorus Siculus.

In 396 BCE, an eruption of Etna reportedly thwarted the Carthaginians in their attempt to advance on Syracuse during the Second Sicilian War.

A particularly violent explosive (Plinian) summit eruption occurred in 122 BCE, and caused heavy tephra falls to the southeast, including the town of Catania, where many roofs collapsed. To help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption, the Roman government exempted the population of Catania from paying taxes for ten years.

The Roman poet Virgil gave what was probably a first-hand description of an eruption in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

During the first 1500 years CE, many eruptions went unrecorded (or records have been lost); among the more significant are: (1) an eruption in about 1030 CE near Monte Ilice on the lower southeast flank, which produced a lava flow that travelled about 10 km, reaching the sea north of Acireale; the villages of Santa Tecla and Stazzo are built on the broad delta built by this lava flow into the sea; (2) an eruption in about 1160 (or 1224), from a fissure at only elevation on the south-southeast flank near the village of Mascalucia, whose lava flow reached the sea just to the north of Catania, in the area now occupied by the portion of the city named Ognina.

Rabban Bar Sauma, a Chinese traveller to the West, recorded the eruption of Etna on 18 June 1287.

The 1669 eruption, Etna&#x27;s most destructive since 122 BCE, started on 11 March 1669 and produced lava flows that destroyed at least 10 villages on its southern flank before reaching the city walls of the town of Catania five weeks later, on 15 April. The lava was largely diverted by these walls into the sea to the south of the city, filling the harbour of Catania. A small portion of lava eventually broke through a fragile section of the city walls on the western side of Catania and destroyed a few buildings before stopping in the rear of the Benedictine monastery, without reaching the centre of the town. Contrary to widespread reports of up to 15,000 (or even 20,000) human fatalities caused by the lava, contemporaneous accounts written both in Italian and English mention no deaths related to the 1669 eruption (but give very precise figures of the number of buildings destroyed, the area of cultivated land lost, and the economic damage). Therefore, it is uncertain where the enormous number of fatalities can be attributed. One possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast Sicily (including Catania) 24 years later in 1693. A study on the damage and fatalities caused by eruptions of Etna in historical times reveals that only 77 human deaths are attributable with certainty to eruptions of Etna, most recently in 1987 when two tourists were killed by a sudden explosion near the summit.

Since 1750, seven of Etna&#x27;s eruptions have had durations of more than 5 years, more than any other volcano except Vesuvius.

===Modern-day eruptions (1923–present day)===
As &quot;Europe&#x27;s most active volcano&quot;, eruptions occur frequently (with as many as 16 eruptions taking place in 2001). However, several eruptions of note have occurred over the last century.
A major eruption took place in June 1923, lasting from 6 June until 29 June. A large lava flow from an eruption in 1928 led to the destruction of a population centre for the first time since the 1669 eruption. The eruption started high on Etna&#x27;s northeast flank on 2 November. Then new eruptive fissures opened at decreasing elevations down the flank of the volcano. The third and most vigorous of these fissures opened late on 4 November at an unusually low elevation, approximately above sea-level, in a zone known as Ripe della Naca. The village of Mascali, lying down-slope of the Ripe della Naca, was almost completely destroyed in two days. Only a church and a few surrounding buildings survived in the north part of the village, called Sant&#x27;Antonino or &quot;il quartiere&quot;. During the last days of the eruption, the flow interrupted the Messina-Catania railway line and destroyed the train station of Mascali. The event was used by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist regime for propaganda purposes, with the evacuation, aid, and rebuilding operations being presented as models of fascist planning. Mascali was rebuilt on a new site, and its church contains the Italian fascist symbol of the torch, placed above the statue of Jesus Christ.
Other major 20th-century eruptions occurred in 1949, 1971, 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1991–1993. In 1971, lava buried the Etna Observatory (built in the late 19th century), destroyed the first generation of the Etna cable-car, and seriously threatened several small villages on Etna&#x27;s east flank. In March 1981, the town of Randazzo on the northwestern flank of Etna narrowly escaped destruction by unusually fast-moving lava flows. That eruption was remarkably similar to one in 1928 that destroyed Mascali. The 1991–1993 eruption saw the town of Zafferana threatened by a lava flow, but successful diversion efforts saved the town with the loss of only one building a few hundred metres from the town&#x27;s margin. Initially, such efforts consisted of the construction of earth barriers built perpendicularly to the flow direction; it was hoped that the eruption would stop before the artificial basins created behind the barriers would be completely filled. Instead, the eruption continued, and lava surmounted the barriers, heading directly toward Zafferana. Engineers then decided to use explosives near the source of the lava flow, to disrupt a very efficient lava tube system through which the lava travelled for up to without losing significant heat or fluidity. The main explosion on 23 May 1992 destroyed the tube and forced the lava into a new artificial channel, far from Zafferana, and it would have taken months to re-establish a long lava tube. Shortly after the blasting, the rate of lava emission dropped, and during the remainder of the eruption (until 30 March 1993) the lava never advanced close to the town again.


Following six years (1995–2001) of unusually intense activity at the four summit craters of Etna, the volcano produced its first flank eruption since 1991–1993 in July–August 2001. This eruption, which involved activity from seven distinct eruptive fissures mostly on the south slope of the volcano, was well covered by the mass-media because it occurred at the height of the tourist season and numerous reporters and journalists were already in Italy to cover the G8 summit in Genoa. It also occurred close to one of the tourist areas on the volcano, and thus was easily accessible. Part of the &quot;Etna Sud&quot; tourist area, including the arrival station of the Etna cable car, were damaged by this eruption, which otherwise was a rather modest-sized event by Etna standards.

In 2002–2003, a much larger eruption threw up a huge column of ash that could easily be seen from space and fell as far away as Libya, south across the Mediterranean Sea. Seismic activity in this eruption caused the eastern flanks of the volcano to slip by up to two metres, and many houses on the flanks of the volcano experienced structural damage. The eruption also completely destroyed the tourist station Piano Provenzana, on the northeastern flank of the volcano, and part of the tourist station &quot;Etna Sud&quot; around the Rifugio Sapienza on the south flank. Footage from the eruptions was recorded by Lucasfilm and integrated into the landscape of the planet Mustafar in the 2005 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The Rifugio Sapienza is near the site of a cable car station which had previously been destroyed in the 1983 eruption; it has now been rebuilt. Following a slow and non-destructive lava outflow on the upper southeastern flank between September 2004 and March 2005, intense eruptions occurred at the Southeast Crater in July–December 2006. These were followed by four episodes of lava fountaining, again at the Southeast Crater, on 29 March, 11 April, 29 April and 7 May 2007. Ash emissions and Strombolian explosions started from a vent on the eastern side of the Southeast Crater in mid-August 2007.

On 4 September 2007, a major episode of lava fountaining occurred from the new vent on the east side of the Southeast Crater, also producing a plume of ash and scoriae which fell over the east flank of the volcano. A lava flow travelled about into the uninhabited Valle del Bove. This eruption was visible far into the plains of Sicily, ending the following morning between the hours of 5 to 7 a.m. local time. Catania-Fontanarossa Airport shut down operations during the night for safety precautions.

An eruption on the morning of 13 May 2008, immediately to the east of Etna&#x27;s summit craters was accompanied by a swarm of more than 200 earthquakes and significant ground deformation in the summit area. The eruption continued at a slowly diminishing rate for 417 days, until 6 July 2009, making this the longest flank eruption of Etna since the 1991–1993 eruption that lasted 473 days. Previous eruptions, in 2001, 2002–2003, and 2004–2005 had lasted 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Lava flows advanced 6.5 km during the first few days of this eruption but thereafter stagnated at many minor distances from the vents; during the last months of the eruption lava rarely advanced more than 1 km downslope.

Through January 2011 to February 2012, the summit craters of Etna were the site of intense activity. Frequent eruptions and ash columns forced the authorities to shut down the Catania airport on several occasions.

The July 2011 episode also endangered the Sapienza Refuge, the main tourist hub on the volcano, but the lava flow was successfully diverted. In 2014, a flank eruption started involving lava flows and strombolian eruptions. This was the first flank eruption since 2008–09.

On 3 December 2015, an eruption occurred which climaxed between 03:20 and 04:10 local time. The Voragine crater exhibited a lava fountain which reached in height, with an ash plume which reached in height. The activity continued on the following days, with an ash plume that reached in height that forced Catania airport to shut down for a few hours. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multi-component gas analyzer system, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

An eruption on 16 March 2017 injured 10 people, including a BBC News television crew, after magma exploded upon contact with snow.

An eruption on 24 December 2018, following a dyke intrusion at shallow depth, spewed ash into the air, forcing the closure of airspace around Mount Etna. Two days later, a magnitude 4.9 earthquake shook the town of Fleri and surrounding towns and hamlets in the Province of Catania, damaging buildings and injuring four people.

Beginning in February 2021, Mount Etna began a series of explosive eruptions, which have had an impact on nearby villages and cities, with volcanic ash and rock falling as far away as Catania. , the volcano has erupted 11 times in three weeks. The eruptions have consistently sent ash clouds over into the air, closing Sicilian airports. There have been no reports of injuries.

In February 2022 there were two eruptions. On 11 February 2022, at 6 pm, there were lava fountains from the Southeast Crater which became a single Strombolian eruption by 7 pm. Between 10 and 11 pm it had reached a height of almost 1,000 m and lava bombs were thrown at a considerable distance. Ash was blown west by the wind and then turned southeast. There was large lava flow in the western flank. On 19 February at 10.15 am there was an explosive eruption, again from the Southeast Crater, high lava fountains and lava flows, the longest of which went down the north-eastern flank towards the Bove Valley. 

On 29 May 2022 a sudden collapse of the Southeast Crater created a fracture on its northern flank at an elevation of circa 2,800 m (9,186 ft). A small lava flow emerged and headed in the direction of the Leone Valley, just above the much larger Bove Valley. It continued for three days and was accompanied by small and sporadic eruptions from two of the many vents at the top of this crater.

Etna erupted once again on 4 July 2024 causing the Catania Airport to close due to volcanic ash in the air. The airport reopened the next day. 

On August 14, 2024, Mt. Etna erupted violently sending an ash cloud 9.5km into the atmosphere. Catania Airport was forced to close the following day.

====Volcanic explosivity index of recent eruptions====

The Global Volcanism Program has assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) to all of Mount Etna&#x27;s eruptions since January 1955:

====Vortex rings====
In the 1970s Etna erupted vortex rings, one of the first recorded events of this type, which are extremely rare. This happened again in 2000. Video footage of 8 June 2000 event was captured. Another event occurred on 11 April 2013. Other similar events occurred during the summer of 2023 (see photo) and 2024.

==Geopolitical boundaries==
The borders of ten municipalities (Adrano, Biancavilla, Belpasso, Bronte (from two sides), Castiglione di Sicilia, Maletto, Nicolosi, Randazzo, Sant&#x27;Alfio, Zafferana Etnea) meet on the summit of Mount Etna, making this a multipoint of elevenfold complexity.

==Facilities==
Etna is one of Sicily&#x27;s main tourist attractions, with thousands of visitors every year. The most common route is through the road leading to Sapienza Refuge ski area, lying at the south of the crater at elevation of 1,910 m. From the Refuge, a cableway runs uphill to an elevation of 2,500 m, from where the crater area at 2,920 m is accessible.

Ferrovia Circumetnea – Round-Etna railway – is a narrow-gauge railway constructed between 1889 and 1895. It runs around the volcano in a 110-km long semi-circle starting in Catania and ending in Riposto 28 km north of Catania.

There are two ski resorts on Etna: one at the Sapienza Refuge, with a chairlift and three ski lifts, and a smaller one on the north, at Piano Provenzana near Linguaglossa, with three lifts and a chairlift.

Sapienza Refuge was the finish of Stage 9 of the 2011 Giro d&#x27;Italia and Stage 4 of the 2017 Giro.

<doc id="169358" wikidata="Q833585" url="?curid=169358" title="Foundations of mathematics">
<text>Foundations of mathematics are the logical and mathematical framework that allows the development of mathematics without generating self-contradictory theories, and, in particular, to have reliable concepts of theorems, proofs, algorithms, etc. This may also include the philosophical study of the relation of this framework with reality. 

The term &quot;foundations of mathematics&quot; was not coined before the end of the 19th century, although foundations were first established by the ancient Greek philosophers under the name of Aristotle&#x27;s logic and systematically applied in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. A mathematical assertion is considered as truth only if it is a &quot;theorem&quot; that is &quot;proved&quot; from true premises by means of a sequence of syllogisms (inference rules), the premises being either already proved theorems or self-evident assertions called axioms or postulates.

These foundations were tacitly assumed to be definitive until the introduction of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century. This new area of mathematics involved new methods of reasoning and new basic concepts (continuous functions, derivatives, limits) that were not well founded, but had astonishing consequences, such as the deduction from Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation that the orbits of the planets are ellipses. 

During the 19th century, progress was made towards elaborating precise definitions of the basic concepts of infinitesimal calculus, notably the natural and real numbers. This led, near the end of the 19th century, to a series of seemingly paradoxical mathematical results that challenged the general confidence in the reliability and truth of mathematical results. This has been called the foundational crisis of mathematics. 

The resolution of this crisis involved the rise of a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic that includes set theory, model theory, proof theory, computability and computational complexity theory, and more recently, parts of computer science. Subsequent discoveries in the 20th century then stabilized the foundations of mathematics into a coherent framework valid for all mathematics. This framework is based on a systematic use of axiomatic method and on set theory, specifically ZFC, the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.

It results from this that the basic mathematical concepts, such as numbers, points, lines, and geometrical spaces are not defined as abstractions from reality but from basic properties (axioms). Their adequation with their physical origins does not belong to mathematics anymore, although their relation with reality is still used for guiding mathematical intuition: physical reality is still used by mathematicians to choose axioms, find which theorems are interesting to prove, and obtain indications of possible proofs.

== Ancient Greece ==
Most civilisations developed some mathematics, mainly for practical purposes, such as counting (merchants), surveying (delimitation of fields), prosody, astronomy, and astrology. It seems that ancient Greek philosophers were the first to study the nature of mathematics and its relation with the real world.

Zeno of Elea (490 c. 430 BC) produced several paradoxes he used to support his thesis that movement does not exist. These paradoxes involve mathematical infinity, a concept that was outside the mathematical foundations of that time and was not well understood before the end of the 19th century.

The Pythagorean school of mathematics originally insisted that the only numbers are natural numbers and ratios of natural numbers. The discovery (around 5th century BC) that the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side is not the ratio of two natural numbers was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted. A testimony of this is the modern terminology of irrational number for referring to a number that is not the quotient of two integers, since &quot;irrational&quot; means originally &quot;not reasonable&quot; or &quot;not accessible with reason&quot;.

The fact that length ratios are not represented by rational numbers was resolved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (408–355 BC), a student of Plato, who reduced the comparison of two irrational ratios to comparisons of integer multiples of the magnitudes involved. His method anticipated that of Dedekind cuts in the modern definition of real numbers by Richard Dedekind (1831–1916); see .

In the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, Aristotle (384–322 BC) laid down the logic for organizing a field of knowledge by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry, and his logic served as the foundation of mathematics for centuries. This method resembles the modern axiomatic method but with a big philosophical difference: axioms and postulates were supposed to be true, being either self-evident or resulting from experiments, while no other truth than the correctness of the proof is involved in the axiomatic method. So, for Aristotle, a proved theorem is true, while in the axiomatic methods, the proof says only that the axioms imply the statement of the theorem.
Aristotle&#x27;s logic reached its high point with Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; (300 BC), a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms (though they do not always conform strictly to Aristotelian templates).
Aristotle&#x27;s syllogistic logic, together with its exemplification by Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece, and remained as the foundations of mathematics for centuries.

During Middle Ages, Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics, and philosophy of mathematics concentrated on the ontological status of mathematical concepts; the question was whether they exist independently of perception (realism) or within the mind only (conceptualism); or even whether they are simply names of collection of individual objects (nominalism). 

In &quot;Elements&quot;, the only numbers that are considered are natural numbers and ratios of lengths. This geometrical view of non-integer numbers remained dominant until the end of Middle Ages, although the rise of algebra led to consider them independently from geometry, which implies implicitly that there are foundational primitives of mathematics. For example, the transformations of equations introduced by Al-Khwarizmi and the cubic and quartic formulas discovered in the 16th century result from algebraic manipulations that have no geometric counterpart.

Nevertheless, this did not challenge the classical foundations of mathematics since all properties of numbers that were used can be deduced from their geometrical definition.

In 1637, René Descartes published &quot;La Géométrie&quot;, in which he showed that geometry can be reduced to algebra by means coordinates, which are numbers determining the position of a point. This gives to the numbers that he called real numbers a more foundational role (before him, numbers were defined as the ratio of two lengths). Descartes&#x27; book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus.

==Infinitesimal calculus==
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) in England and Leibniz (1646–1716) in Germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus for dealing with mobile points (such as planets in the sky) and variable quantities.

This needed the introduction of new concepts such as continuous functions, derivatives and limits. For dealing with these concepts in a logical way, they were defined in terms of infinitesimals that are hypothetical numbers that are infinitely close to zero. The strong implications of infinitesimal calculus on foundations of mathematics is illustrated by a pamphlet of the Protestant philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), who wrote &quot;[Infinitesimals] are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?&quot;.

Also, a lack of rigor has been frequently invoked, because infinitesimals and the associated concepts were not formally defined (lines and planes were not formally defined either, but people were more accustomed to them). Real numbers, continuous functions, derivatives were not formally defined before the 19th century, as well as Euclidean geometry. It is only in the 20th century that a formal definition of infinitesimals has been given, with the proof that the whole infinitesimal can be deduced from them.

Despite its lack of firm logical foundations, infinitesimal calculus was quickly adopted by mathematicians, and validated by its numerous applications; in particular the fact that the planet trajectories can be deduced from the Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation.

== 19th century ==
In the 19th century, mathematics developed quickly in many directions. Several of the problems that were considered led to questions on the foundations of mathematics. Frequently, the proposed solutions led to further questions that were often simultaneously of philosophical and mathematical nature. All these questions led, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, to debates which have been called the foundational crisis of mathematics. The following subsections describe the main such foundational problems revealed during the 19th century.

=== Real analysis === 
Cauchy (1789–1857) started the project of giving rigorous bases to infinitesimal calculus. In particular, he rejected the heuristic principle that he called the generality of algebra, which consisted to apply properties of algebraic operations to infinite sequences without proper proofs. In his &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot; (1821), he considered &quot;very small quantities&quot;, which could presently be called &quot;sufficiently small quantities&quot;; that is, a sentence such that &quot;if is very small must be understood as &quot;there is a (sufficiently large) natural number such that &quot;. In the proofs he used this in a way that predated the modern (ε, δ)-definition of limit.

The modern (ε, δ)-definition of limits and continuous functions was first developed by Bolzano in 1817, but remained relatively unknown, and Cauchy probably did know Bolzano&#x27;s work.

Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897) formalized and popularized the (ε, δ)-definition of limits, and discovered some pathological functions that seemed paradoxical at this time, such as continuous, nowhere-differentiable functions. Indeed, such functions contradict previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation or a smooth graph. 

At this point, the program of arithmetization of analysis (reduction of mathematical analysis to arithmetic and algebraic operations) advocated by Weierstrass was essentially completed, except for two points.

Firstly, a formal definition of real numbers was still lacking. Indeed, beginning with Richard Dedekind in 1858, several mathematicians worked on the definition of the real numbers, including Hermann Hankel, Charles Méray, and Eduard Heine, but this is only in 1872 that two independent complete definitions of real numbers were published: one by Dedekind, by means of Dedekind cuts; the other one by Georg Cantor as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. 

Several problems were left open by these definitions, which contributed to the foundational crisis of mathematics. Firstly both definitions suppose that rational numbers and thus natural numbers are rigorously defined; this was done a few years later with Peano axioms. Secondly, both definitions involve infinite sets (Dedekind cuts and sets of the elements of a Cauchy sequence), and Cantor&#x27;s set theory was published several years later.

The third problem is more subtle: and is related to the foundations of logic: classical logic is a first order logic; that is, quantifiers apply to variables representing individual elements, not to variables representing (infinite) sets of elements. The basic property of the completeness of the real numbers that is required for defining and using real numbers involves a quantification on infinite sets. Indeed, this property may be expressed either as &quot;for every infinite sequence of real numbers, if it is a Cauchy sequence, it has a limit that is a real number&quot;, or as &quot;every subset of the real numbers that is bounded has a least upper bound that is a real number&quot;. This need of quantification over infinite sets is one of the motivation of the development of higher-order logics during the first half of the 20th century.

=== Non-Euclidean geometries ===
Before the 19th century, there were many failed attempts to derive the parallel postulate from other axioms of geometry. In an attempt to prove that its negation leads to a contradiction, Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777) started to build hyperbolic geometry and introduced the hyperbolic functions and computed the area of a hyperbolic triangle (where the sum of angles is less than 180°). 

Continuing the construction of this new geometry, several mathematicians proved independently that if it is inconsistent, then Euclidean geometry is also inconsistent and thus that the parallel postulate cannot be proved. This was proved by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1826, János Bolyai (1802–1860) in 1832 and Carl Friedrich Gauss (unpublished).

Later in the 19th century, the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann developed Elliptic geometry, another non-Euclidean geometry where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180°. It was proved consistent by defining points as pairs of antipodal points on a sphere (or hypersphere), and lines as great circles on the sphere. 

These proofs of unprovability of the parallel postulate lead to several philosophical problems, the main one being that before this discovery, the parallel postulate and all its consequences were considered as &quot;true&quot;. So, the non-Euclidean geometries challenged the concept of mathematical truth.

=== Synthetic vs. analytic geometry ===

Since the introduction of analytic geometry by René Descartes in the 17th century, there were two approaches to geometry, the old one called synthetic geometry, and the new one, where everything is specified in terms of real numbers called coordinates.

Mathematicians did not worry much about the contradiction between these two approaches before the mid-nineteenth century, where there was &quot;an acrimonious controversy between the proponents of synthetic and analytic methods in projective geometry, the two sides accusing each other of mixing projective and metric concepts&quot;. Indeed, there is no concept of distance in a projective space, and the cross-ratio, which is a number, is a basic concept of synthetic projective geometry. 

Karl von Staudt developed a purely geometric approach to this problem by introducing &quot;throws&quot; that form what is presently called a field, in which the cross ratio can be expressed.

Apparently, the problem of the equivalence between analytic and synthetic approach was completely solved only with Emil Artin&#x27;s book &quot;Geometric Algebra&quot; published in 1957. It was well known that, given a field , one may define affine and projective spaces over in terms of -vector spaces. In these spaces, the Pappus hexagon theorem holds. Conversely, if the Pappus hexagon theorem is included in the axioms of a plane geometry, then one can define a field such that the geometry is the same as the affine or projective geometry over .

=== Natural numbers ===
The work of making rigorous real analysis and the definition of real numbers, consisted of reducing everything to rational numbers and thus to natural numbers, since positive rational numbers are fractions of natural numbers. There was therefore a need of a formal definition of natural numbers, which imply as axiomatic theory of arithmetic. This was started with Charles Sanders Peirce in 1881 and Richard Dedekind in 1888, who defined a natural numbers as the cardinality of a finite set. However, this involves set theory, which was not formalized at this time.

Giuseppe Peano provided in 1888 a complete axiomatisation based on the ordinal property of the natural numbers. The last Peano&#x27;s axiom is the only one that induces logical difficulties, as it begin with either &quot;if is a set then&quot; or &quot;if formula_1 is a predicate then&quot;. So, Peano&#x27;s axioms induce a quantification on infinite sets, and this means that Peano arithmetic is what is presently called a Second-order logic.

This was not well understood at that times, but the fact that infinity occurred in the definition of the natural numbers was a problem for many mathematicians of this time. For example, Henri Poincaré stated that axioms can only be demonstrated in their finite application, and concluded that it is &quot;the power of the mind&quot; which allows conceiving of the indefinite repetition of the same act. This applies in particular to the use of the last Peano axiom for showing that the successor function generates all natural numbers. Also, Leopold Kronecker said &quot;God made the integers, all else is the work of man&quot;. This may be interpreted as &quot;the integers cannot be mathematically defined&quot;.

===Infinite sets===
Before the second half of the 19th century, infinity was a philosophical concept that did not belong to mathematics. However, with the rise of infinitesimal calculus, mathematicians became accustomed to infinity, mainly through potential infinity, that is, as the result of an endless process, such as the definition of an infinite sequence, an infinite series or a limit. The possibility of an actual infinity was the subject of many philosophical disputes.

Sets, and more specially infinite sets were not considered as a mathematical concept; in particular, there was no fixed term for them. A dramatic change arose with the work of Georg Cantor who was the first mathematician to systematically study infinite sets. In particular, he introduced cardinal numbers that measure the size of infinite sets, and ordinal numbers that, roughly speaking, allow one to continue to count after having reach infinity. One of his major results is the discovery that there are strictly more real numbers than natural numbers (the cardinal of the continuum of the real numbers is greater than that of the natural numbers).

These results were rejected by many mathematicians and philosophers, and led to debates that are a part of the foundational crisis of mathematics.

The crisis was amplified with the Russel&#x27;s paradox that asserts that the phrase &quot;the set of all sets&quot; is self-contradictory. This condradiction introduced a doubt on the consistency of all mathematics.

With the introduction of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory () and its adoption by the mathematical community, the doubt about the consistency was essentially removed, although consistency of set theory cannot be proved because of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem.

=== Mathematical logic ===

In 1847, De Morgan published his laws and George Boole devised an algebra, now called Boolean algebra, that allows expressing Aristotle&#x27;s logic in terms of formulas and algebraic operations. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematization logic and the basis of propositional calculus

Independently, in the 1870&#x27;s, Charles Sanders Peirce and Gottlob Frege extended propositional calculus by introducing quantifiers, for building predicate logic.

Frege pointed out three desired properties of a logical theory:consistency (impossibility of proving contradictory statements), completeness (any statement is either provable or refutable; that is, its negation is provable), and decidability (there is a decision procedure to test every statement).

By near the turn of the century, Bertrand Russell popularized Frege&#x27;s work and discovered Russel&#x27;s paradox which implies that the phrase &quot;the set of all sets&quot; is self-contradictory. This paradox seemed to make the whole mathematics inconsistent and is one of the major causes of the foundational crisis of mathematics.

== Foundational crisis ==
The foundational crisis of mathematics
arose at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery of several paradoxes or counter-intuitive results. 

The first one was the proof that the parallel postulate cannot be proved. This results from a construction of a non-Euclidean geometry inside Euclidean geometry, whose inconsistency would imply the inconsistency of Euclidean geometry. A well known paradox is Russell&#x27;s paradox, which shows that the phrase &quot;the set of all sets that do not contain themselves&quot; is self-contradictory. Other philosophical problems were the proof of the existence of mathematical objects that cannot be computed or explicitly described, and the proof of the existence of theorems of arithmetic that cannot be proved with Peano arithmetic. 

Several schools of philosophy of mathematics were challenged with these problems in the 20th century, and are described below. 

These problems were also studied by mathematicians, and this led to establish mathematical logic as a new area of mathematics, consisting of providing mathematical definitions to logics (sets of inference rules), mathematical and logical theories, theorems, and proofs, and of using mathematical methods to prove theorems about these concepts. 

This led to unexpected results, such as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, which, roughly speaking, assert that, if a theory contains the standard arithmetic, it cannot be used to prove that it itself is not self-contradictory; and, if it is not self-contradictory, there are theorems that cannot be proved inside the theory, but are nevertheless true in some technical sense. 

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) is a logical theory established by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. It became the standard foundation of modern mathematics, and, unless the contrary is explicitly specified, it is used in all modern mathematical texts, generally implicitly.

Simultaneously, the axiomatic method became a de facto standard: the proof of a theorem must result from explicit axioms and previously proved theorems by the application of clearly defined inference rules. The axioms need not correspond to some reality. Nevertheless, it is an open philosophical problem to explain why the axiom systems that lead to rich and useful theories are those resulting from abstraction from the physical reality or other mathematical theory.

In summary, the foundational crisis is essentially resolved, and this opens new philosophical problems. In particular, it cannot be proved that the new foundation (ZFC) is not self-contradictory. It is a general consensus that, if this would happen, the problem could be solved by a mild modification of ZFC. 

=== Philosophical views ===
When the foundational crisis arose, there was much debate among mathematicians and logicians about what should be done for restoring confidence in mathematics. This involved philosophical questions about mathematical truth, the relationship of mathematics with reality, the reality of mathematical objects, and the nature of mathematics.

For the problem of foundations, there was two main options for trying to avoid paradoxes. The first one led to intuitionism and constructivism, and consisted to restrict the logical rules for remaining closer to intuition, while the second, which has been called formalism, considers that a theorem is true if it can be deduced from axioms by applying inference rules (formal proof), and that no &quot;trueness&quot; of the axioms is needed for the validity of a theorem.

==== Formalism ====
It has been claimed that formalists, such as David Hilbert (1862–1943), hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games. Hilbert insisted that formalism, called &quot;formula game&quot; by him, is a fundamental part of mathematics, but that mathematics must not be reduced to formalism. Indeed, he used the words &quot;formula game&quot; in his 1927 response to L. E. J. Brouwer&#x27;s criticisms:

Thus Hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an &quot;arbitrary&quot; game with &quot;arbitrary&quot; rules; rather it must agree with how our thinking, and then our speaking and writing, proceeds.

The foundational philosophy of formalism, as exemplified by David Hilbert, is a response to the paradoxes of set theory, and is based on formal logic. Virtually all mathematical theorems today can be formulated as theorems of set theory. The truth of a mathematical statement, in this view, is represented by the fact that the statement can be derived from the axioms of set theory using the rules of formal logic.

Merely the use of formalism alone does not explain several issues: why we should use the axioms we do and not some others, why we should employ the logical rules we do and not some others, why &quot;true&quot; mathematical statements (e.g., the laws of arithmetic) appear to be true, and so on. Hermann Weyl posed these very questions to Hilbert:

In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system &quot;S&quot; was consistent, based on principles &quot;P&quot; that only made up a small part of &quot;S&quot;. But Gödel proved that the principles &quot;P&quot; could not even prove &quot;P&quot; to be consistent, let alone &quot;S&quot;.

==== Intuitionism ====
Intuitionists, such as L. E. J. Brouwer (1882–1966), hold that mathematics is a creation of the human mind. Numbers, like fairy tale characters, are merely mental entities, which would not exist if there were never any human minds to think about them.

The foundational philosophy of &quot;intuitionism&quot; or &quot;constructivism&quot;, as exemplified in the extreme by Brouwer and Stephen Kleene, requires proofs to be &quot;constructive&quot; in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence. For example, as a consequence of this the form of proof known as reductio ad absurdum is suspect.

Some modern theories in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense. Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.

==== Logicism ====
Logicism is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are &#x27;logical&#x27; in nature. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory initiated by Gottlob Frege and influenced by Richard Dedekind.

==== Set-theoretic Platonism ====

Many researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic Platonism, exemplified by Kurt Gödel.

Several set theorists followed this approach and actively searched for axioms that may be considered as true for heuristic reasons and that would decide the continuum hypothesis. Many large cardinal axioms were studied, but the hypothesis always remained independent from them and it is now considered unlikely that CH can be resolved by a new large cardinal axiom. Other types of axioms were considered, but none of them has reached consensus on the continuum hypothesis yet. Recent work by Hamkins proposes a more flexible alternative: a set-theoretic multiverse allowing free passage between set-theoretic universes that satisfy the continuum hypothesis and other universes that do not.

==== Indispensability argument for realism ====

This argument by Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam says (in Putnam&#x27;s shorter words),

However, Putnam was not a Platonist.

==== Rough-and-ready realism ====
Few mathematicians are typically concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism or any other philosophical position. Instead, their primary concern is that the mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as ensured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy.

Such a view has also been expressed by some well-known physicists.

For example, the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman said

And Steven Weinberg:

Weinberg believed that any undecidability in mathematics, such as the continuum hypothesis, could be potentially resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.

==== Philosophical consequences of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem ====
Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models. Precisely, for any consistent first-order theory it gives an &quot;explicit construction&quot; of a model described by the theory; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable. However this &quot;explicit construction&quot; is not algorithmic. It is based on an iterative process of completion of the theory, where each step of the iteration consists in adding a formula to the axioms if it keeps the theory consistent; but this consistency question is only semi-decidable (an algorithm is available to find any contradiction but if there is none this consistency fact can remain unprovable).

=== More paradoxes ===
The following lists some notable results in metamathematics. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is the most widely studied axiomatization of set theory. It is abbreviated ZFC when it includes the axiom of choice and ZF when the axiom of choice is excluded.

*1920: Thoralf Skolem corrected Leopold Löwenheim&#x27;s proof of what is now called the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, leading to Skolem&#x27;s paradox discussed in 1922, namely the existence of countable models of ZF, making infinite cardinalities a relative property.
*1922: Proof by Abraham Fraenkel that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo set theory with urelements.
*1931: Publication of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, showing that essential aspects of Hilbert&#x27;s program could not be attained. It showed how to construct, for any sufficiently powerful and consistent recursively axiomatizable system such as necessary to axiomatize the elementary theory of arithmetic on the (infinite) set of natural numbers a statement that formally expresses its own unprovability, which he then proved equivalent to the claim of consistency of the theory; so that (assuming the consistency as true), the system is not powerful enough for proving its own consistency, let alone that a simpler system could do the job. It thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth cannot be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in Hilbert&#x27;s program. This dealt a final blow to the heart of Hilbert&#x27;s program, the hope that consistency could be established by finitistic means (it was never made clear exactly what axioms were the &quot;finitistic&quot; ones, but whatever axiomatic system was being referred to, it was a &#x27;weaker&#x27; system than the system whose consistency it was supposed to prove).
*1936: Alfred Tarski proved his truth undefinability theorem.
*1936: Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.
*1938: Gödel proved the consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum hypothesis.
*1936–1937: Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, respectively, published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible: the universal validity of statements in first-order logic is not decidable (it is only semi-decidable as given by the completeness theorem).
*1955: Pyotr Novikov showed that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable.
*1963: Paul Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable from ZFC. Cohen&#x27;s proof developed the method of forcing, which is now an important tool for establishing independence results in set theory.
*1964: Inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics, Gregory Chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory (measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics).
*1966: Paul Cohen showed that the axiom of choice is unprovable in ZF even without urelements.
*1970: Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem is proven unsolvable: there is no recursive solution to decide whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.
*1971: Suslin&#x27;s problem is proven to be independent from ZFC.

== Toward resolution of the crisis ==
Starting in 1935, the Bourbaki group of French mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory.

The intuitionistic school did not attract many adherents, and it was not until Bishop&#x27;s work in 1967 that constructive mathematics was placed on a sounder footing.

One may consider that Hilbert&#x27;s program has been partially completed, so that the crisis is essentially resolved, satisfying ourselves with lower requirements than Hilbert&#x27;s original ambitions. His ambitions were expressed in a time when nothing was clear: it was not clear whether mathematics could have a rigorous foundation at all.

There are many possible variants of set theory, which differ in consistency strength, where stronger versions (postulating higher types of infinities) contain formal proofs of the consistency of weaker versions, but none contains a formal proof of its own consistency. Thus the only thing we do not have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer, such as ZF.

In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of ZFC, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully.

The development of category theory in the middle of the 20th century showed the usefulness of set theories guaranteeing the existence of larger classes than does ZFC, such as Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory or Tarski–Grothendieck set theory, albeit that in very many cases the use of large cardinal axioms or Grothendieck universes is formally eliminable.

One goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of &quot;core mathematics&quot; in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis.

<doc id="169359" wikidata="Q5468528" url="?curid=169359" title="Foreign relations of Palau">
<text>Palau gained its independence October 1, 1994 with the entry into force of the Compact of Free Association with the United States. Palau was the last Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands territories to gain its independence. Under the Compact, the U.S. remains responsible for Palau&#x27;s defense for 50 years.

Palau is a sovereign nation and conducts its own foreign relations. From its independence until July 2019, Palau had established diplomatic relations with 101 countries. 

Palau was admitted to the United Nations on December 15, 1994, and has since joined several other international organizations. In 2004, Stuart Beck was appointed to serve as Palau&#x27;s first permanent representative to the United Nations. Along with the other former Trust Territories, Palau is one of a handful of countries that regularly votes with Israel in the United Nations General Assembly.

==Diplomatic relations==

==Military relations==
The Palau government has agreed to host a large United States Air Force high-frequency radar station in Palau, a Tactical Multi-Mission Over the Horizon Radar (TACMOR) system costing well over $100 million, which is expected to be operational in 2026.

Palau has participated in various U.S. military exercises over the years, including Exercise Valiant Shield. The first-launch in Palau of a Patriot surface-to-air missile by the U.S. took place in 2022 Valiant Shield, which also had the experimental deployment of A-10 Warthogs at Roman Tmetuchl International Airport.

<text>Doctor Snuggles is an animated children&#x27;s television series created by Jeffrey O&#x27;Kelly, based on original artwork by Nick Price, about a friendly and optimistic inventor who has unusual adventures with his friends. The show featured fantastical scenarios typically based on the outlandish inventions of Doctor Snuggles, supported by a variety of supporting characters including anthropomorphic animals and objects.

==Production==
The show was a co-production between British and Dutch producers. The animation was split by two studios: Topcraft in Japan (episodes 1–7, plus intro and ending) and DePatie-Freleng (episodes 8–13) from the United States with some minor differences in animation. All Topcraft episodes (with its unique sound effects) were directed by the prolific Tsuguyuki Kubo, who worked with Rankin/Bass (among others) on many of their features, movies (&quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;), and syndicated series (&quot;ThunderCats&quot;). English, Dutch, German, Swedish and Spanish language versions exist, among others. In the English-language version the title character was narrated by veteran actor Peter Ustinov, with Olwen Griffiths and John Challis. The show debuted in 1980 and consisted of thirteen half-hour episodes.

The show was based on original artwork by British illustrator Nick Price, original scripts and ideas by Jeffrey O&#x27;Kelly, and television scripts for each episode by Richard Carpenter and John Halas. Two episodes (#7 and #12) were written by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd, both dealing with ecological issues. Episode 9 was written by .

In the UK, the show featured as part of the &quot;Watch It!&quot; strand for children on the ITV network and later got repeated on Channel 4 as well as being broadcast on The Children&#x27;s Channel on cable and satellite television. In Canada, the series aired on TVO in Ontario and on Knowledge Network in British Columbia. It also aired on the ABC in Australia and ran from 1 March 1982 to 20 September 1991, M-Net and Bop TV in South Africa, RTB in Brunei, RTÉ in the Irish Republic where it began airing in 1989 and was shown a number of times up until 1998, PTV in Pakistan, syndication (distribution via Chicago-based Field Communications securing US distribution rights), Nickelodeon, and Nick Jr. Channel in the US, TV2 and TV3 in Malaysia, MediaCorp Channel 5 in Singapore and in New Zealand on TV1 and TV2.

The Dutch dubbing was directed by Frans Voordrecht, by with voices by Jules Croiset, Trudy Libosan, Dick Scheffer and Rupert van Woerkom.

A German dubbed version was also produced, starring Walter Jokisch as Doctor Snuggles, produced by the Bavaria Atelier GmbH, that premiered in June 1981.

The Swedish version features John Harryson and the French version Roger Carel as Doctor Snuggles.

Also, a comic series was produced, published in Germany and Sweden.

==Plot==
The show followed the adventures of Doctor Snuggles, a kind old gentleman who lives in a comfortable home with his elderly housekeeper, Miss Nettles. Doctor Snuggles spends most of his time inventing; across the series he creates robot Mathilda Junkbottom, a worm-mobile, a machine to restore the colours of the rainbow, a gadget to fight depression, a fire-proof lotion, and a time machine, amongst other inventions. Snuggles typically travels by means of a talking pogo-stick/umbrella and a wooden spacecraft called the &quot;Dreamy Boom Boom&quot;. Doctor Snuggles must also contend with the malevolent magician Professor Emerald, his arch enemy.

==Music==
Songs in the Finnish dub were sung by the actors of YLE Import re-using the De Angelis&#x27;s music but with new Finnish lyrics. In the Finnish dub some scenes are cut, which includes musical numbers in some episodes.

<doc id="169364" wikidata="Q131522" url="?curid=169364" title="Fluxbox">
<text>Fluxbox is a stacking window manager for the X Window System, which started as a fork of Blackbox 0.61.1 in 2001, with the same aim to be lightweight. Its user interface has only a taskbar, a pop-up menu accessible by right-clicking on the desktop, and minimal support for graphical icons. All basic configurations are controlled by text files, including the construction of menus and the mapping of key-bindings. Fluxbox has high compliance to the Extended Window Manager Hints specification.

Fluxbox is basic in appearance, but it can show a few options for improved attractiveness: colors, gradients, borders, and several other basic appearance attributes can be specified. Recent versions support rounded corners and graphical elements. Effects managers such as xcompmgr, cairo-compmgr and transset-df (deprecated) can add true transparency to desktop elements and windows. Enhancements can also be provided by using iDesk or fbdesk, SpaceFM, PCMan File Manager or the ROX Desktop. Fluxbox also has several features Blackbox lacks, including tabbed windows and a configurable titlebar.

Because of its small memory footprint and quick loading time, Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as GParted. It was the default window manager of Damn Small Linux and antiX, but was replaced with JWM in 2007 and 2009, respectively. It is currently the default window manager of PCFluxboxOS, a remaster of PCLinuxOS, and of Linux Mint Fluxbox CE. Fluxbuntu, an Ubuntu derivative with lightweight applications, was released in October 2007. 

On December 12, 2019, MX Linux released MX-fluxbox as a fully integrated overlay of MX Linux 19. Previously it had been available from 2014 onward through the Package Installer. A Fluxbox edition has been added to the MX-21 series with Fluxbox in use by default. Fluxbox is also a featured window manager on antiX.

The early versions of Lumina, a desktop environment created for TrueOS, were based on Fluxbox.

As of December 2021 there are 22 flavors of Linux using Fluxbox in some way.

==Features==
* Right-clicking on the desktop gives a root menu
* Customizable root menu
* Wallpapers
* Running applications appear in a taskbar
* Support for desktop themes
* Customizable keyboard shortcuts
* Window tabbing
* Slit for applications such as system monitors

==Customization==
Customization is done by editing configuration files in the .fluxbox subdirectory in the user&#x27;s home directory:

* Keyboard shortcuts are stored in the file.
* Menu layout is in the file.
* Everything that is run at startup is kept in the file.
* The fluxbox configuration file is held at .

<text>Novell, Inc. () was an American software and services company headquartered in Provo, Utah, that existed from 1980 until 2014. Its most significant product was the multi-platform network operating system known as Novell NetWare. Novell technology contributed to the emergence of local area networks, which displaced the dominant mainframe computing model and changed computing worldwide.

Under the leadership of chief executive Ray Noorda, NetWare became the dominant form of personal computer networking during the second half of the 1980s and first half of the 1990s. At its high point, NetWare had a 63 percent share of the market for network operating systems and by the early 1990s there were over half a million NetWare-based networks installed worldwide encompassing more than 50 million users. Novell was the second-largest maker of software for personal computers, trailing only Microsoft Corporation, and became instrumental in making Utah Valley a focus for technology and software development.

During the early to mid-1990s, Noorda attempted to compete directly with Microsoft by acquiring Digital Research, Unix System Laboratories, WordPerfect, and the Quattro Pro division of Borland. These moves did not work out, due to new technologies not fitting well with Novell&#x27;s existing user base or being too late to compete with equivalent Microsoft products. NetWare began losing market share once Microsoft bundled network services with the Windows NT operating system and its successors. Despite new products such as Novell Directory Services and GroupWise, Novell entered a long period of decline. Eventually Novell acquired SUSE Linux and attempted to refocus its technology base. Despite building or acquiring several new kinds of products, Novell failed to find consistent success and never regained its past dominance.

The company was an independent corporate entity until it was acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary by The Attachmate Group in 2011. Attachmate was subsequently acquired in 2014 by Micro Focus International which was acquired in turn by OpenText in 2023. Novell products and technologies are now integrated within various OpenText divisions.

== History ==
=== Origins as a hardware company ===

The company began as Novell Data Systems Inc. (NDSI), a computer systems company located in Orem, Utah that intended to manufacture and market small business computers, computer terminals, and other peripherals. It was co-founded by George Canova and Jack Davis, two experienced computer industry executives. While some later sources place the creation of Novell Data Systems as having happened in 1979, more contemporaneous sources are in accordance with it happening in August 1980. Canova became president of the new company and Davis was in charge of sales and marketing. The suggestion for the company&#x27;s name came from Canova&#x27;s wife, who thought it meant &quot;new&quot; in French (in fact the French word is either the masculine &quot;nouveau&quot; or the feminine &quot;nouvelle&quot;). While future Brigham Young University professor and Eyring Research Institute (ERI) figure Dennis Fairclough was not a founder of Novell Data Systems, he did work with the company from its early days.

A funding proposal was brought to Pete Musser, chairman of the board of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based, technology-focused venture capital firm that was an offshoot of the older Safeguard Business Systems. Safeguard Scientifics believed that a new computer systems company could help the Business Systems company automate their accounting systems. Accordingly, Safeguard Scientifics provided over $2 million in seed funding, and they became the majority owner of Novell Data Systems. Canova also owned a significant portion of the new company.

Novell Data Systems set up offices in a former carpet warehouse located in an obscure industrial park down the road from the largely vacant Geneva Steel works. By November 1980, they were placing display ads in the classifieds pages of Utah Valley newspapers, seeking to hire hardware and software engineers and other staff.

At first the company began to grow rapidly. By mid-1981 the company was selling two products, the Nexus Series microcomputer and the Image 800 dot matrix printer. Orders began shipping during the second half of 1981. The computer product was based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor and the CP/M operating system.

The company subsequently did not do well. The microcomputer produced by the company was late to an increasingly crowded market and was noncompetitive in terms of performance when it did arrive. According to one paraphrase of a Value Line report on Novell Data Systems as a whole during this period, their &quot;revenue was minimal, but expenses were tremendous.&quot; Davis was fired from Novell Data Systems in November 1981.

In order to compete on systems sales, Novell Data Systems planned a program to link more than one microcomputer to operate together. The current or former BYU students Drew Major, Dale Neibaur, and Kyle Powell, known as the SuperSet Software group, were hired to this task and began consulting for Novell during 1981. They developed a multiplayer video game, &quot;Snipes&quot;.

During the first calendar quarter of 1982, heavy costs continued to be incurred at Novell Data Systems, which resulted in management shuffles, organizational consolidations, and a significant layoff. Canova was fired and Jack Messman, representing Safeguard Scientifics, was named president. Seeing &quot;Snipes&quot; being played on three different types of personal computers persuaded Messman that SuperSet&#x27;s networking technology was valuable. The poor performance of Novell Data Systems resulted in losses being announced in April 1982 for the publicly-held Safeguard Scientifics and put pressure on that company&#x27;s stock price. However, by this point the computer-linking work that the SuperSet group had produced was drawing considerable interest and Novell Data Systems was describing themselves as a company that made not just stand-alone microcomputers but also products for local area networking (LAN). The dual emphasis on hardware and software products continued for several months but continued to have troubled results, and in July 1982 another round of layoffs took place which resulted in the employee count being reduced from 50 people to 30.

At that time Safeguard reported that it would be writing down $3.4 million in losses due to Novell Data Systems&#x27; switch from being a hardware company to a software company. Throughout 1982 there were further management shuffles with other people being named president of the company. Major, Neibaur, and Powell continued to support Novell through their SuperSet Software group. As Major later said, &quot;It was great that our hardware was so lousy because that gave us the idea that hardware wasn&#x27;t really where the value was.&quot;

Two other important NDSI employees were strategist Craig Burton and communications specialist Judith Clarke. Despite its struggles, Novell Data Systems had a presence at the COMDEX show in Las Vegas in November 1982; a man named Ray Noorda saw it and become interested in the company&#x27;s potential.

===Rise to networking dominance===
==== A new company ====

On January 25, 1983, the company was incorporated under the shortened name of Novell, Inc. In April 1983, the appointment of Noorda as president and CEO of Novell, Inc. was publicly announced. Noorda was a veteran executive of General Electric and the past CEO of several other companies and had garnered a reputation as a turn-around expert. Messman was chairman of the board and continued to represent the interests of Safeguard Scientifics, which was still majority owner in the new Novell.

The new Novell started with around 15 employees. Noorda emphasized that the file server product acquired from Novell Data Systems would be the heart of what the new Novell would be doing. Later that same year, the company introduced its most significant product, the multi-platform network operating system (NOS), Novell NetWare.

Funding for the new company was still an issue, and Musser contacted two Safeguard investors and brokers, Barry Rubenstein and Fred Dolan, who were with the Cleveland brokerage house Prescott, Ball and Turben, in these efforts. Rubenstein and Dolan eventually came up with the idea of a rights offering to Safeguard shareholders. Accordingly, in January 1985, Safeguard Scientifics made an initial offering of shares in Novell, Inc. to its own shareholders, at $2.50 a share. The sale brought Safeguard more than $5 million in cash, and Safeguard&#x27;s ownership in Novell went from 51 percent down to 24 percent. Novell, Inc. began trading as an over-the-counter stock.

==== NetWare ====
The first Novell product was a proprietary hardware server based on the Motorola 68000 processor and using a star topology. This, with the network operating system (NOS) on it, was known as Novell S-Net, or ShareNet, and it achieved some visibility; by April 1983, advertisements were seen in trade publications for third-party software products which stated they were compatible with Novell ShareNet.

The company realized that making a proprietary solution in this sense was disadvantageous and looked instead to the IBM PC as an alternative platform. Now called NetWare, the network operating system was ported to run on an IBM PC XT with an Intel 8086 processor and supported centralized, multitasking file and print services. By March 1984, Novell was putting out announcements about third-party products that worked with Novell NetWare.

NetWare came on the computing scene just as the IBM PC was emerging as a market force and applications such as the VisiCalc spreadsheet for the Apple II were showing what microcomputers could do for businesses. There was an immediate demand for local area networking that could make files and printers available across many PCs. In addition, the advent of the PC caused organizational changes within companies and enterprises and allowed Novell to find entryways into individual departments or regional facilities rather than having to convince upper management of the value of networking. Thus, Novell&#x27;s timing was spot on. As the &quot;New York Times&quot; subsequently wrote, &quot;Novell, in one of those instances of serendipity and visionary thinking that are the stuff of personal computer legend, found itself in the right place at the right time.&quot;

Partly in consequence of its design of running at kernel level ring 0 without regard for separate or protected address spaces, and thus not having the properties of a general-purpose operating system, NetWare was known for being very fast in operation. This trend continued into 1987 with the Advanced NetWare/286 release, which was well received within the industry. NetWare also excelled with respect to computer security considerations, supporting user- and group-based roles and volume- and file-level access restrictions, thus making it attractive to systems administrators.

Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems (XNS), and created its own standards which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). These protocols were based on a client–server model. File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP).

Starting in 1987, Novell began selling its own Ethernet-based network adapter cards. These included the 8-bit NE1000, and then in 1988, the 16-bit NE2000. They priced them lower than cards from competitors such as 3Com, whose card Novell had previously been distributing. By 1989, Novell&#x27;s cards were being sold at a rate of 20,000 per month, aggressively expanding Novell&#x27;s market presence. At that point, Novell transferred the NE1000/NE2000 business to Anthem Electronics, the firm that had actually been making them, but the cards remained branded as Novell products.

As author James Causey would later write, &quot;NetWare deserves the lion&#x27;s share of the credit for elevating PC-based local area networks from being cute toys to providing powerful, reliable, and serious network services. NetWare was the first Intel-based network operating system to provide a serious alternative to mainframe-based server networks, providing critical reliability and security features needed in the modern enterprise.&quot;

Novell acquired Kanwal Rekhi&#x27;s company Excelan in 1989; Excelan manufactured smart Ethernet cards and commercialized the Internet protocol TCP/IP, solidifying Novell&#x27;s presence in these areas. The acquisition combined Novell&#x27;s $281 million in annual revenue with Excelan&#x27;s $66 million. Rekhi became a high-ranking Novell executive, and played an influential strategic and managerial role with the company over the next several years. Excelan was based in San Jose, California, and they, along with a couple of prior Novell acquisitions, formed the basis for Novell&#x27;s presence in Silicon Valley going forward.

====NetWare 386====
A key software introduction came in 1989 with the release of NetWare 386, also known as NetWare 3.0, which gave NetWare more modern architectural qualities, in conjunction with new capabilities in the Intel 386 processor. All the while it maintained its character as a dedicated network operating system rather than containing network capabilities as part of a general-purpose operating system. The NetWare kernel&#x27;s ability to dynamically load and unload drivers was greatly appreciated by users and the ability to write NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) in the C programming language was also a significant benefit. NetWare 3 supported interactions with Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computers as well as with Unix-based workstations, thus enabling NetWare to expand upon file and print sharing towards accessing business-critical data within companies. This allowed NetWare to work with database products from companies such as Oracle Corporation and Sybase.

An analyst for Dataquest said that NetWare 386 &quot;is truly a blow-away-the-competition type product&quot;. Overall, NetWare 3 was the most significant rewrite that the product would ever get, and proved very successful. By 1990, Novell had an almost monopolistic position in NOS for any business requiring a network.

There were competitor companies in the same space, such as Corvus Systems, Banyan Systems, and LANtastic, but none of them made much of a dent in Novell&#x27;s business. Microsoft tried on two early occasions to take on Novell in networking, first with the MS-NET product and then with LAN Manager, but both failed badly. IBM similarly had limited success in this area. From 1988 to 1992, Novell&#x27;s revenues rose almost three-fold, to $933 million a year, with about half of Novell&#x27;s sales coming from North America and half from overseas. Earnings also rose to $249 million a year. From 1986 to 1991, Novell&#x27;s stock price climbed twelve-fold.

With this market leadership, Novell began to acquire and build services on top of its NetWare operating platform. These services extended NetWare&#x27;s capabilities with such products as NetWare for SAA and Novell multi-protocol router.

However, Novell was also diversifying, moving away from its smaller users to target large corporations and wide area networks. A marketing and development alliance with IBM announced in 1991 was part of this initiative. The company did later attempt to refocus with NetWare for Small Business. It reduced investment in research and was slow to improve the product administration tools, although it was helped by the fact its products typically needed little &quot;tweaking&quot; – they just ran.

====Corporate ethos and &quot;coopetition&quot;====
By early 1985, Novell was rapidly expanding, but many people were still unaware of either it or the role that local area networks could play, and consequently Noorda referred to Novell as &quot;the most misunderstood company in the world.&quot; Nonetheless, in 1986 &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; was hailing Novell as another Utah success story in technology, likely to follow in the footsteps of Evans &amp; Sutherland and Iomega. Novell was quickly outgrowing its original site in Orem, with some employees forced to work in trailers. A new, much larger site for the company was found in nearby Provo, Utah and construction was begun; by late 1986, employees were moving into the first building there while work on a second building was already underway. Eventually between 1986 and 1993 six buildings would be constructed for Novell&#x27;s use there.

Under Noorda, Novell embraced the notion of &quot;coopetition&quot;, or cooperative competition. The central idea was that whatever was good for networking in general would be good for Novell and took the form of encouraging the growth of an ecosystem composed of hundreds of suppliers of hardware and software networking products, even if some of those suppliers had products that competed with Novell&#x27;s. 3Com, who had been an early competitor of Novell&#x27;s, sold more instances of their Ethernet networking cards for use in conjunction with NetWare than they did for use with their own 3+Share network operating systems, and a similar situation existed for IBM and their Token Ring cards. It was due to this kind of industry vision that Noorda would become known as the &quot;Father of Network Computing&quot;.

From the first years of the new Novell&#x27;s success, Noorda was credited in the press with forging that path. The company reflected aspects of Noorda&#x27;s personal background, such as his Mormon religion, which brought about what was termed &quot;the Mormon work ethic&quot; at Novell. As one account later put it, Novell was &quot;reputedly staffed with lots of hard-selling but soft-drinking Mormons.&quot; Noorda himself was famous for his frugal ways and for working from a plain, small office.

In 1989 senior executives Craig Burton and Judith Clarke, whom many credited for much of Novell&#x27;s past success, left Novell. Burton had been seen as Noorda&#x27;s most likely successor while Judith Clarke had been instrumental in marketing and positioning Novell.

In April 1990, Novell and Lotus Development Corporation announced merger of equals based on a $1.5-billion stock swap that would have been the largest deal in the software industry to that time. But it collapsed the following month: when Lotus head Jim Manzi refused to give Novell an equal number of seats on the new board, Noorda pulled out shortly before the deal would have been completed.

At its high point around 1993, NetWare had a roughly two-thirds share of the market for network operating systems; one analysis put the figure at 63 percent. There were over half a million NetWare-based networks installed worldwide and some 55 million NetWare users on those networks. And networking itself was the fastest-growing segment of the computer market, increasing by 30 percent a year and reaching a $10 billion figure by 1993. Novell was the second largest maker of software for personal computers, trailing only Microsoft. Novell&#x27;s employee base, which had been around 15 when Noorda joined, had risen to 4,335 by the end of 1993. Besides Utah, Novell continued to grow in San Jose, where many of the sales, marketing, product management, and executive functions were located.

====Sales and channel practices====
Equally important as technological factors to NetWare&#x27;s growth was that Novell did not try to hire a large sales force to do direct sales of the product, but instead sold it through a broad channel of some 13,000 value-added resellers. Such resellers provided network education, installation, and subsequent maintenance, and included CompUSA and Egghead Software for very small businesses all the way up to sophisticated systems integrators like Andersen Consulting and Electronic Data Systems for enterprise-level projects. In this way Novell constructed a local area network franchise in literal terms, as Novell Authorized Education Centers were set up on a franchising basis. Credentialization programs were in place, such that becoming a Certified NetWare Engineer was an important step, one that could be furthered with levels such as Master Certified NetWare Engineer. As one industry analyst said, &quot;They&#x27;ve done a wonderful job of farming distribution out. They train people who go out and train other people, and every time somebody gets trained, they get another Netware bigot, and make another dollar. They are getting paid to have people go out and be evangelists.&quot; The partnering approach also worked well in overseas markets, such as in Japan where Novell set up a subsidiary that major Japanese electronics firms invested in, or in South America and Eastern Europe where Novell set up authorized distributors.

Under Ray Noorda&#x27;s leadership, Novell provided upgrades to resellers and customers in the same packaging as a newly purchased copy of NetWare, but at one third the cost, which created a gray market that allowed NetWare resellers to sell upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions at full price periodically, which Novell intentionally did not track. Noorda commented to several analysts that he devised this strategy to allow front line resellers to &quot;punch through&quot; the distributors like Tech Data and Ingram and acquire NetWare versions at a discounted rate, as Novell &quot;looked the other way&quot;; this helped fund the salaries of Novell Field Support Technicians, who for the most part were employees who worked for the front line resellers as Novell CNE (Certified NetWare Engineers).
Noorda commented that this strategy was one he learned as an executive at General Electric when competing against imported home appliances: allow the resellers to &quot;make more money off your product than someone else&#x27;s&quot;.

===Taking on Microsoft===
====Motivations====
Unusually for the CEO of a high-tech, emerging computer company, Noorda was nearing 70 years of age by the early 1990s. Furthermore, he was known for alienating high-level executives who might someday be in position to run the company. Stock market analysts were expressing concern that Noorda, whose personality was the basis for much of the company&#x27;s culture, had no succession plan in place. At the same time, Novell faced a looming challenge from Microsoft&#x27;s upcoming Windows NT operating system, which, after a huge investment of resources from Microsoft, featured bundled networking and more advanced OS capabilities and looked to be that company&#x27;s first offering that could seriously challenge Novell&#x27;s local area networking franchise.

Under Noorda, Novell made a series of acquisitions interpreted by many to be a direct challenge to Microsoft. Noorda was motivated in part by a realization that NetWare&#x27;s technology was not suitable as the basis for a full-fledged operating system and application platform. There was also enmity between the two companies and the two CEOs, stemming in part from merger talks between Noorda and Microsoft head Bill Gates that had begun in 1989 and been on-and-off for the next couple of years before breaking down for good. Subsequently, Novell had played a role in keeping the Federal Trade Commission investigation into Microsoft going.

Between 1991 and 1994, the Noorda-led Novell made this series of major acquisitions: Digital Research Inc., producer of DR-DOS, to compete with Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS; Unix System Laboratories, holder of Unix operating system technology, to improve Novell&#x27;s technology base versus Windows NT; Serius Corp., maker of an advanced application development tool; and WordPerfect Corporation and Quattro Pro from Borland to provide personal productivity and group collaboration products. In all, Noorda acquired ten companies within a four-year span. By September 1993, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; was writing, &quot;Of the many rivalries in the personal-computer industry, for sheer nastiness it&#x27;s hard to beat the one between Microsoft Corp. and Novell Inc.&quot; In November 1993, Noorda confirmed published reports that he had been suffering from some memory lapses and announced that he would be stepping down from the CEO position once a successor was found.

In April 1994, former HP executive Robert Frankenberg was announced as the new CEO of Novell, with Noorda remaining as chairman of the board of directors. By then the USL acquisition was already showing difficulties, while the WordPerfect acquisition was questioned even more. Nonetheless, Frankenberg said he was enthusiastic about it: &quot;For me, it was a pivotal item in my decision to join Novell because it makes possible an entirely new category of networked applications which no one else can provide.&quot; When the WordPerfect and Quattro Pro acquisitions closed in June 1994, it was the largest such deal in the software industry to that time; it made Novell the third-largest software company in the world, trailing only Microsoft and Computer Associates.

Noorda retired from the chairman position and left Novell completely in November 1994, although he was still the largest shareholder of the company. At that point in time, Frankenberg became chairman as well.

====Desktop OS and embedded systems: DOS, NEST, and Corsair====
Novell acquired Digital Research for in June 1991. The move was seen as a way for Novell to supply software for server-focused PCs in alternative to Microsoft. NetWare used DR DOS as a boot loader and maintenance platform, and Novell intended to extend its desktop presence by integrating networking into DR DOS and providing an alternative to Microsoft&#x27;s Windows. At first, the idea was to provide a graphical environment based on Digital Research&#x27;s GEM, but Novell&#x27;s legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple, so the company went directly to Apple starting Star Trek in February 1992, a project to run an x86-port of their Mac OS on top of a multitasking DR DOS.

Novell had already abandoned Digital Research&#x27;s Multiuser DOS in 1992. The three former Master Value Added Resellers (VARs) DataPac Australasia, Concurrent Controls and Intelligent Micro Software could license the source code to take over and continue independent development of their derivations in 1994.

By 1994, Corsair was a project run by Novell&#x27;s advanced technology group that sought to put together a desktop metaphor with Internet connectivity and toward that end conducted research on how to better and more easily integrate and manage network access for users. At the time, the Internet was dominated by Unix-based operating systems, but the Novell group saw the Unixes of the day as being too hardware intensive, too large, and charging too much in license fees. They became convinced that Linux offered the best possible answer for the operating system component, and started building code towards that purpose, including contributing work on IPX networking for NetWare and Wine compatibility layer for Windows.

Digital Research&#x27;s FlexOS had been licensed to IBM for their 4690 OS in 1993 and was also utilized for the in-house development of Novell&#x27;s Embedded Systems Technology (NEST), but was sold off to Integrated Systems, Inc. (ISI) for in July 1994. The deal comprised a direct payment of half this sum as well as shares representing 2% of the company.

NEST however held importance for Frankenberg&#x27;s vision of &quot;pervasive computing&quot;, wherein Novell software would be connecting a billion nodes by 2000. Many of those nodes would be common, everyday devices running NEST, linked by SuperNOS, Novell Directory Services, and other management services components.

Novell also abandoned their Corsair desktop project and in late 1994 or early 1995 transferred some components to Caldera, a startup funded by Noorda&#x27;s Canopy Group. The Canopy Group was a technology investment firm and real estate company that Noorda focused on after his departure from Novell.

Novell DOS (and all former DR DOS versions including StarTrek, PalmDOS and DOS Plus) as well as other remaining Digital Research assets (like GEM and the CP/M- and MP/M-based operating systems, programming languages, tools and technologies) were sold to Caldera on 23 July 1996. Personal NetWare had been abandoned at Novell in 1995 but was licensed to Caldera in binary form only. The deal consisted of a direct payment of US$400,000 as well as percentual royalties for any revenues derived from those assets to Novell.

In January 1997, Novell&#x27;s NEST initiative was abandoned as well.

====Server OS: UnixWare and SuperNOS====

On the server side, after their initial October 1991 Univel initiative, Novell announced in December 1992 that it was buying Unix System Laboratories (USL) from AT&amp;T Corporation. The measure was intended to help Novell compete against Microsoft, which was on the verge of including networking as a built-in feature of Windows in conjunction with Windows NT server. Unix did present some attractive characteristics to the market, such as its abilities as an application server and the lack of vendor lock-in, but there were still considerable obstacles to be overcome in using it in this context.

The deal closed in June 1993, with Novell acquiring rights to the Unix SVR4 source base and the UnixWare operating system product. Novell then turned the Unix brand name and specification over to the industry consortium X/Open. 
Novell created the Unix Systems Group to contain the new business, which also absorbed the Univel venture. Most of the core USL employees remained in USL&#x27;s Summit, New Jersey facility, which was later relocated to Florham Park, New Jersey in the summer of 1995. The USL Europe office in London was moved into Novell&#x27;s facility in Bracknell, Berkshire.

Novell&#x27;s time with Unix technology saw the release of UnixWare 1.1 in January 1994, in both personal and advanced server editions and with the bundled inclusion of TCP/IP, a NetWare Unix Client, and Merge functionality for running DOS and Windows 3.1 applications. This was followed in early 1995 by the release of UnixWare 2.0, which included full support for multiple processors as well as improved installation and ease-of-use and additional NetWare integration features.

In September 1994 Novell began publicly describing its plans to develop a &quot;SuperNOS&quot;, a microkernel-based network operating system based on NetWare 4.1 and UnixWare 2.0. The aim was to include UnixWare technology inside NetWare, provide the strengths of both NetWare&#x27;s network services and UnixWare&#x27;s application services, be able to run existing NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs) and Unix executables, and accordingly create a network operating system that could successfully compete with Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT. SuperNOS would also operate across distributed servers with unified presentation. Finally, SuperNOS would take advantage of object-oriented programming paradigms as a way of fostering easier application development.

In terms of operating system architecture, SuperNOS would run NLMs in kernel space, for maximum throughput, while it would run Spec 1170-based Unix applications in user space. For clustering, SuperNOS would embrace elements of a NetWare distributed parallel processing proposal and a UnixWare single system image initiative. SuperNOS was based on work that had already started at USL and at the French company Chorus Systèmes SA for cooperative work on the Chorus microkernel technology in the context of supporting SVR4 on a microkernel. This microkernel was arguably superior for this purpose than the more well-known Mach one, because it gave more flexibility at the kernel mode–user mode boundary. By mid-1995 the SuperNOS project was reportedly about one-third completed, with 1997 being seen as a customer release date for it. There were over 60 engineers assigned to it, mostly from the UnixWare and Chorus side. The project endured prolonged internal architectural debates and resistance from the NetWare side due to a reluctance to believe that Unix was really superior to NetWare in key aspects. In one instance, Novell&#x27;s Drew Major and Chorus Systèmes&#x27; Michel Gien disagreed in the trade press about whether the existent Chorus technology was up to the task. The long-running disputes reflected cultural and political divisions between the San Jose (with Rekhi being a Unix supporter before leaving altogether) and Utah camps within Novell. In any case the 1997 date was seen by industry observers as being too late to forestall the market-share gains that Windows NT was already making.

The acquisition of USL never really worked out for Novell. During the company&#x27;s fiscal years of 1993, 1994, and 1995, Novell&#x27;s Unix Systems Group represented only about 5 percent of the company&#x27;s revenue on an ongoing basis. Very few Certified NetWare Engineers ever reached a similar level of involvement with UnixWare. Another aim, that Novell might be able to coalesce Unix vendor versions and thus resolve the Unix wars, was not achieved either. By late summer 1995 the company was looking for a way out of the Unix business.

In September 1995, Novell announced the sale of UnixWare to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), coincident with a licensing arrangement with Hewlett-Packard. As part of the deal, SCO said that it would merge the SVR4.2-based UnixWare with its existing SVR3.2-based OpenServer operating system and add NetWare services to the new merged product, code-named &quot;Gemini&quot;. Gemini would then be sold through SCO&#x27;s well-known channel and reseller operation. As for HP, they said they would add NetWare code and NetWare Directory Services to their own version of Unix, HP-UX, in combination with Distributed Computing Environment elements, which would then be sold by HP&#x27;s strong direct-sales force. Finally, SCO and HP said that they would co-develop a next-generation, 64-bit version of Unix. Some 400 Novell software engineers had been working on UnixWare; most of them were offered jobs with either SCO or HP, while a few remained with Novell.

While some lip service was paid to the notion that SuperNOS would go on after the three-way deal, in fact, it was abandoned and never achieved fruition in that form. (A decade later, Novell&#x27;s Open Enterprise Server product would realize some aspects of a hybrid NetWare/Unix-like system, this time based around SUSE Linux Enterprise Server rather than UnixWare.)

By December, there were already some indications that the three-way arrangement was not working out as had been initially advertised. The computer industry was not sure that SCO could handle being the primary Unix shepherd. The HP project, code-named &quot;White Box&quot;, focused on making a hybrid environment out of the SVR4.2-based Gemini and the SVR3.2-based HP-UX, but that effort faced major technical hurdles. The terms of the deal between Novell and SCO, which closed in December 1995, were uncertain enough that an amendment had to be signed in October 1996, and even that was not clear enough to preclude an extended battle between the two companies during the SCO-Linux disputes of the 2000s.

====Tools: AppWare====
In June 1993, Novell purchased Serius Corp., a firm that made a graphical programming language that could construct applications by connecting together icons representing objects in the program and their commands. Novell also purchased Software Transformations Inc., who made a cross-platform object code library that could be used to port conventional programs to a number of platforms. The disparate technologies of the two products were combined and renamed to AppWare, with the Serius product being called AppWare Visual AppBuilder, the objects it used AppWare Loadable Modules, and the Software Transformations library AppWare Foundation. The organization working on this was called the AppWare Systems Group. The founder of Serius, Joe Firmage, became vice president of strategy for Novell&#x27;s Network Systems Group.

AppWare was one of the three main strategic focuses of Novell during this period, along with NetWare and UnixWare. These three prongs were intended to satisfy the growing need for scalable, distributed computing at the enterprise level of applications such as general ledger systems or reservation systems; as Novell executive Jim Tolonen outlined: &quot;[NetWare] being the underlying infrastructure over which those mission critical transactions will be moved, Unix [being] a place on which the applications can run, and AppWare as tools that will help programmers write that class of application in a distributed environment.&quot;

It was not long before the AppWare plans started to fall apart. In September 1994 Novell announced they would be selling the Appware Foundation product to a third party. Novell did state that development of Visual AppBuilder would continue, and a Unix port would be following (that did not materialize). Novell also continued to release a number of new Appware Loadable Modules. But overall, as &quot;Byte&quot; magazine wrote in early 1995 about the three-pronged strategy, these &quot;unrelated ... families of products formed an unsteady tripod&quot;.

Joe Firmage became disillusioned with Novell in mid-1995, following its decision to sell UnixWare and abandon the SuperNOS project, and left Novell later that year. Novell then publicly stated in November 1995 that it was looking for a buyer for AppWare. In March 1996, it was announced (based on an agreement that had been signed the month before) that Novell had sold all rights to the AppWare technology to a new company called Network Multimedia Inc., which was headed by Ed Firmage, who had been director of AppWare marketing at Novell.

====Applications: WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, and GroupWise====


In March 1994, Novell announced that it was acquiring WordPerfect Corporation, whose primary product was the WordPerfect word processor, as well as acquiring the Quattro Pro spreadsheet from Borland. The initial price for WordPerfect was $1.4 billion in a Novell stock swap while Quattro Pro would cost $145 million in cash. Novell executives said the goal of the acquisitions was to build a suite of products that could be connected across the network via NetWare and UnixWare. The key to this was the idea of &quot;groupware&quot; for collaboration. Noorda said, &quot;The era of stand-alone personal computing is evolving into group collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies. Novell&#x27;s objective is to accelerate this market transition.&quot; The geographical proximity, as well as the cultural similarity, between the two companies also made the acquisition seem like a good idea. The stock market was not enthused about the deal and Novell&#x27;s stock price slid steadily in value. The merger, and acquisition from Borland, both closed on June 24, 1994 (with the public announcement being made on June 27). Because the price for WordPerfect was measured in Novell stock, when the deal closed the cost of WordPerfect had become $855 million. Work on the acquired products was organized into the company&#x27;s Application Group. Both before and after the acquisition, there were substantial layoffs of WordPerfect staff; at the peak right after the acquisition closed, Novell&#x27;s employee count was around 10,150. Novell&#x27;s corporate address was shifted to WordPerfect&#x27;s Orem location for a while.

The market for standalone word processors and spreadsheets was expanding to that of office suites, where Microsoft Office had an early lead in marketshare. To compete, Novell PerfectOffice 3.0 was released in December 1994. It was based upon an earlier effort, Borland Office 2.0 for Windows, but had superior look-and-feel and integration. It contained not just WordPerfect and Quattro Pro but also other products, most of which had originated at WordPerfect Corporation, including Presentations for slides preparation, a personal information manager called InfoCentral, and the GroupWise collaboration product. There was also a professional edition that included AppWare as well as Borland&#x27;s Paradox database. PerfectOffice surpassed in sales one early player in the space, Lotus SmartSuite, and GroupWise found three times the number of users as Lotus Notes. The application products also had the advantage of what Novell&#x27;s senior vice president for corporate marketing, Christine Hughes, called &quot;[an] &#x27;in your face&#x27; presence for the user. Otherwise no one is aware it&#x27;s Novell providing that connection.&quot; But industry analyst reaction was that while PerfectOffice 3.0 was a good product, it was arriving too late to head off Microsoft Office&#x27;s momentum.

WordPerfect also played in a role in larger architectural ambitions within Novell, as WordPerfect incorporated OpenDoc and IBM System Object Model technology. These became part of the basis for Novell&#x27;s larger distributed object strategy. That strategy was tied to having supporting multiple object request brokers that could tie in NetWare Loadable Modules, the AppWare Bus, UnixWare, and eventually SuperNOS itself. WordPerfect itself was also supposedly using the AppWare foundation layer in its work. Other parts of WordPerfect were deemed less strategic, and the Main Street line of multimedia products for children was dropped.

During its time in Novell, WordPerfect still sold reasonably well as standalone software, garnering almost half of all such word processor sales; but the market was increasingly dominated by the idea of office suites, and there Microsoft Office was supreme, with 86 percent of the market compared to only 5 percent for Novell&#x27;s PerfectOffice. As such, the WordPerfect and Quattro Pro part of the company dragged down Novell&#x27;s earnings and stock price.

Novell stated in November 1995 that it was putting its personal productivity product line up for sale. Then in January 1996 it announced that the sale of these products, primarily WordPerfect and Quattro Pro, would be made to Corel for $186 million, a large loss from the $855 million that it had originally paid to acquire WordPerfect. Novell did hold onto a few pieces that it had acquired from WordPerfect, most importantly the GroupWise collaboration product. By some estimates Novell had lost $750 million on the WordPerfect experience. The sale to Corel was completed in March 1996.

====Results====
Overall, none of these moves had worked out well – for instance, Novell suffered a net loss of $35 million for its 1993 fiscal year, largely due to write-offs for the acquisitions, and under criticism from Wall Street, Novell&#x27;s stock price underwent a prolonged downturn – and many of the companies and products that had been purchased were subsequently sold off. Novell did have its two largest revenue years in 1994 and 1995, generating $1.998 billion and $2.041 billion in sales respectively. But the Noorda-era acquisitions were short-lived.

The business press was negative on the whole attempt: &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to &quot;acquisitions Mr. Noorda had made in his latter years in a disastrous attempt to compete head-on with Microsoft&quot;, while the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; talked of &quot;a disastrous acquisition spree undertaken by previous CEO Ray Noorda in an effort to compete with Microsoft.&quot; By the year 2000, &quot;The Age&quot; would say that &quot;The WordPerfect acquisition was the biggest disaster in software history&quot;.

Novell continued to have mediocre-at-best financial results during 1995 and 1996.
In August 1996, Frankenberg himself departed Novell in what was variously portrayed as a mutual decision, or as a resignation under pressure from the company&#x27;s board of directors. His years there had been marked by having to disassemble Noorda&#x27;s acquisitions but also by failing to fully recognize the growing importance of the Internet for networking applications.

===Loss of networking dominance===
====NDS and other new products====
Novell&#x27;s core products did not stay idle during this challenging-of-Microsoft time, as work in the company&#x27;s NetWare Systems Group continued.
One of Novell&#x27;s major innovations was Novell Directory Services (NDS), later known as eDirectory. It was based on the CCITT X.500 standard and supported the notion of a distributed directory. Introduced with NetWare 4.0 in 1993, NDS replaced the old Bindery server and user management technology employed by NetWare 3.x and earlier. Directory services were seen as a crucial strategic key to staying relevant in the networking marketplace. It was also one where Novell had a lead over Microsoft, as the latter&#x27;s Active Directory was not yet out.

Then with UnixWare gone, Novell focused on major upgrades to its core NetWare-based network operating system. The initial release of NetWare 4 came with compatibility problems for some NetWare 3 users, and large enterprises were faced with an upgrade-all-or-upgrade-none decision. However some 40 million users declined to move to NetWare 4, with the result that Novell lost large amounts of possible revenue in upgrades. Although the NetWare 4.1 release of 1995 sought to remedy some of these issues, the lag had caused many Novell customers to take a serious look at Windows NT. And Windows NT was proving better as a platform for application and database services than NetWare. Furthermore, Microsoft was having success with its no-extra-charge bundling of Microsoft&#x27;s IIS web server on NT, while Novell&#x27;s presence in the Internet market was severely lacking. Still, as of 1996, by one estimate there were three million networks, and tens of millions of PCs, still using NetWare.

In 1996, the company began a move into Internet-enabled products, replacing reliance on the proprietary IPX protocol in favor of a native TCP/IP stack. Support for the new Java programming language also began to be added to NetWare. An Internet-focused product released during 1996 was called Intranetware.

These moves were accelerated when Eric Schmidt became CEO in April 1997, the first in the post since Frankenberg&#x27;s departure; Christopher Stone was brought in as senior vice president of strategy and corporate development, reporting to Schmidt. Many observers were surprised that Schmidt would leave his chief technical officer position at Sun Microsystems, which at the time was doing very well, to go to Novell, which was viewed as a company in real trouble. The new CEO said, &quot;Novell has been defocused by a series of acquisitions and forays that didn&#x27;t work out. In this collaborative world, it&#x27;s more important to do a few things well and just go for them like you&#x27;ve never seen.&quot;

One result of these shifts was BorderManager, released in August 1997, which supplied proxy server, firewall, and other services for connecting NetWare networks to the Internet. Another was a new version of NDS, that was capable of running with Windows NT, not just NetWare.
And still another was NetWare 5.0, released in October 1998, with hopes for it accelerating Novell&#x27;s improved fortunes under Schmidt. NetWare 5.0 leveraged and built upon eDirectory and introduced new functions, such as Novell Cluster Services (NCS, a replacement for SFT-III) and Novell Storage Services (NSS), a replacement for the traditional Turbo FAT filesystem used by earlier versions of NetWare. While NetWare 5.0 introduced native TCP/IP support into the NOS, IPX was still supported, allowing for smooth transitions between environments and avoiding the &quot;forklift upgrades&quot; frequently required by competing environments. Similarly, the traditional Turbo FAT file system remained a supported option.

====Decline of marketshare====

The inclusion of networking as a core system component in all mainstream PC operating systems after 1995 led to a steep decline in Novell&#x27;s market share. Unlike Windows 3.1 and its predecessors, Windows NT, Windows 95, Linux, and OS/2 all included network functionality which greatly reduced demand for third-party products in this segment. For instance, one mid-1996 survey of a thousand corporate users, conducted by Forrester Research, showed that 90 percent of them owned NetWare but only 20 percent said they had upgraded to the latest NetWare version and less than half of the users thought they would still be using NetWare three years hence. By March 1996, the company&#x27;s stock price had fallen from a high of $33 a share in 1993 to a new low of under $12. Revenue declined from 1995 on. By 1997, Windows NT was winning 42 percent of new network operating system installations versus 33 percent for NetWare, and it was on the verge of overtaking NetWare even when upgrade sales were included. Overall, NetWare&#x27;s market share had fallen to 26 percent and had been passed by Windows NT&#x27;s 36 percent. Unix also had a significant share, and the free software Linux operating system had started to appear and make inroads as well.

With revenues in decline, Schmidt took actions to control costs, and some 18 percent of Novell employees were laid off during the first few months of his tenure. In addition he was forced to halt NetWare shipments to resellers because unsold inventory levels were so high. By the end of summer 1997, Schmidt was saying, &quot;I took the job on the presumption that we would not have to do this. If I&#x27;d known what shape the company was in, I might not have taken it.&quot; While there was some speculation that Novell might relocate much of the company to its San Jose facility, Novell instead recommitted to Provo, building a new headquarters tower that opened in 2000.

But Novell&#x27;s decline and loss of market share accelerated under Schmidt&#x27;s leadership, with Novell experiencing an across-the-board decline in sales and purchases of NetWare and a drop in share price from /share to /share. Analysts commented that the primary reason for Novell&#x27;s demise was linked to its channel strategy and mismanagement of channel partners under Schmidt.

Schmidt embarked on a channel strategy to undo Noorda&#x27;s &quot;look the other way&quot; approach and thereby remove the upgrades as whole box products, then directed Novell&#x27;s general counsel to initiate litigation against a large number of Novell resellers who were routinely selling upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions.
Although this move bolstered Novell&#x27;s revenue numbers for several quarters, Novell&#x27;s channels subsequently collapsed with the majority of Novell&#x27;s resellers dropping NetWare for fear of litigation.

By 1999, Novell had lost its dominant market position, and was continually being out-marketed by Microsoft as resellers dropped NetWare, allowing Microsoft to gain access to corporate data centers by bypassing technical staff and selling directly to corporate executives. Most resellers then re-certified their Novell CNE employees— the field support technicians who were Novell&#x27;s primary contact in the field with direct customers—as Microsoft MCSE technicians, and were encouraged to position NetWare as inferior to Windows 2000 features such as Group Policy and Microsoft&#x27;s GUI, which was considered to be more modern than the character-based Novell interfaces. With falling revenue, the company focused on net services and platform interoperability. Products such as eDirectory and GroupWise were made multi-platform.

By 2000, some large NetWare enterprise customers, such as Chase Manhattan Bank, United Parcel Service, and the University of Southern California were in the process of migrating most or all of their NetWare systems to alternatives. Revenue warnings during the second quarter of 2000 resulted in a 40 percent drop in the company&#x27;s stock price. In October 2000, Novell released a new product, dubbed &quot;DirXML&quot;, which was designed to synchronize data—typically user information—between disparate directory and database systems. This product leveraged the speed and functionality of eDirectory to store information, and would later become the Novell Identity Manager, forming the foundation of a core product set within Novell.

During Schmidt&#x27;s tenure during the late 1990s, Novell developed and delivered a series of Internet-centric products that were well-reviewed. But these new products did not sell as well as the company had hoped, in part due to Novell channel issues with training, lead generation, and support. Indeed, there were reports of channel stuffing taking place. So despite its efforts in these other spaces, Novell was increasingly becoming irrelevant within the industry. Of Schmidt&#x27;s efforts with Novell, News.com wrote, &quot;He had traversed a rocky road as chief executive at Novell, briefly laying a smooth path for a renaissance at the aging network software provider before succumbing to strategy issues that have plagued it for years.&quot;

=== Cambridge Technology Partners ===
In March 2001, it was announced that Novell was acquiring the consulting company Cambridge Technology Partners (CTP), founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts by John J. Donovan, to expand offerings into services. Novell felt that the ability to offer solutions (a combination of software and services) was key to satisfying customer demand. The merger was apparently against the firm&#x27;s software development culture, and the finance personnel at the firm also recommended against it.

The CEO of CTP, Jack Messman, engineered the merger using his position as a board member of Novell since its inception, and as part of the deal became CEO of Novell. Chris Stone, who had left in 1999, was rehired as vice chairman to set the course for Novell&#x27;s strategy into open source and enterprise Linux. With the acquisition of CTP, which closed in July 2001, Novell moved its headquarters to Massachusetts. As for Schmidt, he departed Novell soon after the CTP announcement and headed for Google, where he became chair of the board (and soon after that, CEO).

In July 2002, Novell acquired SilverStream Software, a leader in web services-oriented applications, but a laggard in the marketplace. Renamed to Novell exteNd, the platform comprised XML and web service tools based on Java EE.

=== Linux ===
==== SuSE and Open Enterprise Server ====
In August 2003, Novell acquired Ximian, a developer of open source Linux applications (Evolution, Red Carpet and Mono). This acquisition signaled Novell&#x27;s plans to move its collective product set onto a Linux kernel.

In November 2003, Novell acquired Linux OS developer SuSE, which led to a major shift of power in Linux distributions. IBM also invested to show support of the SuSE acquisition.

In mid-2003, Novell released &quot;Novell Enterprise Linux Services&quot; (NNLS), which ported some of the services traditionally associated with NetWare to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) version 8. NetWare 6.5, released in 2003, would prove to be the last version of that product.

In November 2004, Novell released the Linux-based enterprise desktop Novell Linux Desktop 9, based on Ximian Desktop and SUSE Linux Professional 9.1. This was Novell&#x27;s first attempt to get into the enterprise desktop market.

The successor product to NetWare, Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES), was released in March 2005. OES offers all the services previously hosted by NetWare 6.5, and added the choice of delivering those services using either a NetWare 6.5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 kernel. The release was aimed to persuade NetWare customers to move to Linux.

In August 2005, Novell created the openSUSE project, based on SUSE Professional. openSUSE can be downloaded freely and is also available as boxed retail product.

==== Stagnation ====
From 2003 through 2005 Novell released many products across its portfolio, with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products, but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped. In late 2004, Chris Stone again left the company, after an apparent control issue with then CEO Jack Messman. In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to offset the decrease in revenue of NetWare. While the company&#x27;s revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn&#x27;t growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring.

In June 2006, chief executive Jack Messman and chief finance officer Joseph Tibbetts were fired, with Ronald Hovsepian, Novell&#x27;s president and chief operating officer, appointed chief executive, and Dana Russell, vice-president of finance and corporate controller, appointed interim CFO.

==== &quot;Your Linux is Ready&quot; ====

In August 2006, Novell released the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SLE 10) series. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server was the first enterprise class Linux server to offer virtualization based on the Xen hypervisor. SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (popularly known as SLED) featured a new user-friendly GUI and XGL-based 3D display capabilities. The release of SLE 10 was marketed with the phrase &quot;Your Linux is Ready&quot;, meant to convey that Novell&#x27;s Linux offerings were ready for the enterprise. In late September 2006 Novell announced a real-time version of SLES called &quot;SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time&quot; (SLERT), based on technology from Concurrent Computer Corporation.

====Legal actions and reactions====
Beginning in 2003, Novell became a key player in the SCO–Linux disputes. The case &quot;SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc.&quot; revolved around the interpretation of the 1995 asset-transfer agreements between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation, a predecessor company to The SCO Group – when Novell got out of the Unix business as part of abandoning its effort to take on Microsoft on all fronts – and a 1996 amendment that had attempted to clarify that agreement. The SCO Group believed that the transfer included ownership of, and copyrights for, the source code for the Unix operating system (which they in turn claimed Linux had infringed upon). Novell counter-sued, claiming that the asset-transfer agreements did not, in fact, transfer the intellectual property rights SCO sought.

The case attracted considerable industry and media attention, with the free and open-source software (FOSS) community solidly on the side of Novell. There were a series of court rulings, most of which went in Novell&#x27;s favor and which sent The SCO Group into bankruptcy. The matter was settled finally in 2010 when a jury trial in Utah ruled that the copyrights belonged to Novell. (Novell made no material use of the Unix ownership once it was ruled theirs, as by then their interests were with SuSE Linux.)

In 2004, Novell sued Microsoft, asserting it had engaged in antitrust violations regarding Novell&#x27;s WordPerfect business in 1994 through 1996. Novell&#x27;s lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the United States District Court in July 2012 after it concluded that the claims were without merit.

On 2 November 2006, the two companies announced a joint collaboration agreement, including coverage of their respective products for each other&#x27;s customers. They also promised to work more closely to improve compatibility of software, setting up a joint research facility. Executives of both companies expressed the hope that such cooperation would lead to better compatibility between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org and better virtualization techniques.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said of the deal, &quot;This set of agreements will really help bridge the divide between open-source and proprietary source software.&quot;
The deal involved upfront payment of from Microsoft to Novell for patent cooperation and SLES subscription. Additionally, Microsoft agreed to spend around yearly, over the next 5 years, for marketing and selling a combined SLES/Windows Server offering and related virtualization solutions, while Novell paid at least yearly to Microsoft, in the same period.

One of the first results of this partnership was Novell adapting the OpenXML/ODF Translator for use in OpenOffice.org.

Microsoft released two public covenants not to sue users of the open source Moonlight runtime—a workalike for the Microsoft Silverlight rich media platform—for patent infringement. One condition common to each covenant was that no Moonlight implementation be released under the GPLv3 free software license.
In contrast to the SCO case, here initial reaction from members of the free and open source software community over the patent protection was mostly critical, with expressions of concern that Novell had &quot;sold out&quot; and doubt that the GNU GPL would allow distribution of code, including the Linux kernel, under this exclusive agreement.

In a letter to the FOSS development community on 9 November 2006, Bradley M. Kuhn, CTO of the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), described the agreement as &quot;worse than useless&quot;. In a separate development, the chairman of the SFLC, Eben Moglen, reported that Novell had offered cooperation with the SFLC to permit a confidential audit to determine the compliance of the agreement with the GPL (version 2). Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, said in November 2006 that changes coming with version 3 of the GPL would preclude such deals. When the final revision of the third version of the GPL license was decided, the deal between Microsoft and Novell was grandfathered in. A clause within GPLv3 allows companies to distribute GPLv3 software even if they have made such patent partnerships in the past, as long as the partnership deal was made before 28 March 2007 (GPLv3 Section 11 paragraph 7).

On 12 November 2006, the Samba team expressed strong disapproval of the announcement and asked Novell to reconsider. The team included an employee of Novell, Jeremy Allison, who confirmed in a comment on Slashdot that the statement was agreed on by all members of the team, and later quit his job at Novell in protest.

In early February 2007, Reuters reported that the Free Software Foundation had announced that it was reviewing Novell&#x27;s right to sell Linux versions, and was considering banning Novell from selling Linux. However, spokesman Eben Moglen later said that he was quoted out of context, and was only noting that GPL version 3 would be designed to block similar deals in the future.

==== Intelligent workload management ====
In December 2009, Novell announced its intention to lead the market in intelligent workload management, with products designed to manage diverse workloads in a heterogeneous data center. Seeing this approach as a key to giving customers confidence in the area of cloud computing security, Novell restructured its business around the new initiative. Technologies from Novell&#x27;s 2008 acquisition of Canadian company PlateSpin were involved. Key to this also was the use of SUSE Studio, an online Linux software creation tool through which users could develop their own Linux distribution, software appliance, or virtual appliance. Hovsepian said, &quot;Cloud computing is a megatrend that matches the company&#x27;s core competencies. ... We&#x27;ve developed our Suse appliance tool for application vendors [who have brand new applications being written or built for the cloud]. This product allows them to create a virtual appliance. They won&#x27;t have to rewrite and retest the application once it is in the cloud and it allows firms to host their application on other clouds too.&quot; But Novell&#x27;s approach would also support other cloud environments such as those based around Hyper-V, VMware, and Xen.

Partnerships in connection with intelligent workload management were announced with SAP, Citrix Systems, Ingres, and others. Reaction of industry analysts to the move varied, with some positive and some more mixed. Among the more skeptical was Dan Kusnetzky of ZDNet, who wrote that Novell &quot;clearly hopes that putting its products together in new ways and invoking today&#x27;s catch phrases and buzz words will appear fresh and new.&quot; While Novell did have strong technologies in this computing realm, it struggled to attract the same market attention that competing product lines from the likes of Microsoft or VMware held.

=== Acquisition by The Attachmate Group===

Novell had long been rumored to be a target for acquisition by a variety of other companies. In March 2010, Elliott Associates, L.P., an institutional investor with approximately 8.5% stock ownership of Novell, offered to acquire the company for per share in cash, or . The company declined the offer, saying that the proposal was inadequate and that it undervalued the company&#x27;s franchise and growth prospects.

Novell announced in November 2010 that it had agreed to be acquired by The Attachmate Group for , and planned to operate Novell as two units, one being SUSE. As part of the deal, 882 patents owned by Novell were sold to CPTN Holdings LLC, a consortium of companies led by Microsoft and including Apple, EMC, and Oracle. According to Novell&#x27;s SEC filing, the patents &quot;relate primarily to enterprise-level computer systems management software, enterprise-level file management and collaboration software in addition to patents relevant to our identity and security management business, although it is possible that certain of such issued patents and patent applications read on a range of different software products&quot;. The Attachmate Group expressed in advance of the deal closing that there would no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project. The merger completed in April 2011, with per share in cash being paid to acquire Novell. Novell became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Attachmate Group.

Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, some of Novell&#x27;s products and brands were transferred to another of the Attachmate Group business units, NetIQ, and the SUSE Linux brand was spun off as its own business unit. The fourth business unit, Attachmate, was not directly affected by the acquisition.

Immediately prior to merger being finalized, Novell completed the patent sale to CPTN Holdings for . The U.S. Department of Justice announced that, as originally proposed, the deal with CPTN would jeopardize the ability of open source software, such as Linux, to continue to innovate and compete in the development and distribution of server, desktop, and mobile operating systems, middleware, and virtualization products; to address the department&#x27;s antitrust concerns, CPTN and its owners had altered their original agreement:

* All of the Novell patents would be acquired subject to the GPLv2 open source license, and the Open Invention Network (OIN) license
* CPTN does not have the right to limit which of the patents, if any, are available under the OIN license
* Neither CPTN nor its owners will make any statement or take any action with the purpose of influencing or encouraging either Novell or Attachmate Group to modify which of the patents are available under the OIN license

With the acquisition, Novell&#x27;s headquarters were moved back to Provo. But by then considerable consolidation had occurred, and the original six buildings of the Provo campus were sold.
During April and May 2011, The Attachmate Group announced layoffs for the Novell workforce, including hundreds of employees from the Provo location, raising questions about the future of some open source projects such as Mono.

===Acquisition by Micro Focus and OpenText===
In September 2014, mainframe software company Micro Focus announced it was buying The Attachmate Group, including Novell, for . The acquisition closed on November 20, 2014, and the SUSE organization was split out separately from the rest of the former Novell organization within Micro Focus. SUSE was sold to EQT AB in 2019.

The Novell products themselves were relabeled and dispersed among the file and networking services, collaborations, and security product lines of Micro Focus, such that offerings like Open Enterprise Server, GroupWise, and ZENworks became billed as Micro Focus products with no mention of their Novell past. The one page at the Micro Focus website listing former Novell products did not even mention NetWare. 

In January 2023, Micro Focus was in turn acquired by Canadian software company OpenText. Again, the former Novell products are listed within OpenText product groups without being identified as to their Novell past.

== Legacy ==
Novell had a difficult time being associated for anything other than NetWare. And as &quot;The Register&quot; has written, &quot;NetWare was almost uniquely a thing of its time. Whereas the PC has transcended its roots ... and Windows has grown ... into a sophisticated 64-bit OS, NetWare never escaped as its niche. When Windows was just a client OS, Novell’s proprietary IPX/SPX protocol and simple, fast, semi-dedicated file servers were a compelling offering. As Windows grew into a server OS too, though, NetWare couldn&#x27;t compete.&quot;

But the effects of Novell have been long-lasting. While information technology had been present along the Wasatch Front since the 1950s in the form of work done at Utah State University, the first two software giants in the field in Utah were Novell and WordPerfect in the early 1980s. To that point, the &quot;Deseret News&quot; has stated, &quot;WordPerfect and Novell put Utah Valley on the high-tech industry map in the 1980s.&quot; Moreover, even when employees left the two companies, or were downsized, they often stayed in the Utah Valley area and started their own companies. This began a culture of entrepreneurship that led to the Wasatch Front becoming known by some as Silicon Slopes. &quot;Silicon Slopes Magazine&quot; has credited the rise of the industry in Utah to three people, among them Ray Noorda.

<doc id="169367" wikidata="Q366162" url="?curid=169367" title="John Lloyd (producer)">
<text>John Hardress Wilfred Lloyd (born 30 September 1951) is an English producer and writer. His television work includes &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;. He is currently the presenter of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot;.

==Early life==
Lloyd was born on 30 September 1951 in Dover, Kent. His father, H. L. &quot;Harpy&quot; Lloyd, was an Anglo-Irish captain with the Royal Navy. As a child, Lloyd lived in several different places, owing to his father&#x27;s job. This led him to attend school properly only at the age of 9. He was educated at West Hill Park School in Titchfield, Hampshire, a place where he claims bullying was &quot;endemic&quot;, and later at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. He read Law at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was a member of the Footlights. He became friends with fellow student Douglas Adams, with whom he later worked and shared a flat.

Lloyd is the great nephew of the soldier John Hardress Lloyd.

==Career==
Lloyd worked as a radio producer at the BBC between 1974 and 1978 creating &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;, &quot;To the Manor Born&quot; (with Peter Spence) and &quot;Quote... Unquote&quot; (with Nigel Rees). He wrote &quot;Hordes of the Things&quot; (as J. H. W. Lloyd) with Andrew Marshall, co-authored two episodes of &quot;Doctor Snuggles&quot; with Douglas Adams, and co-wrote the fifth and sixth episodes of the first radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; with Adams (Adams wrote all the previous and subsequent episodes solo, as well as the television adaptation). He pitched a story for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Doomsday Contract&quot;, while Adams was script editor of the series, which was never made at the time but eventually became an audio play adapted by Nev Fountain and produced by Big Finish Productions. He also produced series three and four of &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot; on Radio 4.

Lloyd then worked as a television comedy producer at both the BBC and ITV. As well as being associate producer of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, he created &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (co-produced with Sean Hardie) and produced &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. He also produced all four &quot;Blackadder&quot; series. 

Lloyd was originally to have been the host of BBC topical news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, with the programme initially intended to be called &quot;John Lloyd&#x27;s Newsround&quot;. A pilot episode of the show was recorded under this name in mid-1990, with Lloyd hosting alongside team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton. Lloyd subsequently decided to pull out of hosting the programme full-time and the pilot episode was never broadcast. Lloyd was replaced by Angus Deayton as host and the show was renamed &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in time for its debut on BBC2 later that year.

His first new TV series for 14 years, &quot;QI&quot; starring Stephen Fry (2003 - 2016), Sandi Toksvig (from 2016 - present) and Alan Davies, began on 11 September 2003 at 10pm on BBC Two for a run of 12 episodes. In its eighth series, which started on BBC One in September 2010, Lloyd appeared as a panellist in one of the episodes. Lloyd has presented the radio series &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot; (2011), which he co-created with producers Richard Turner and Dan Schreiber and former co-host Bill Bailey. In December 2011, Lloyd appeared as captain of the winning Trinity College, Cambridge, team on the &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;.

Lloyd was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting. Lloyd was also awarded an honorary degree from Southampton Solent University.

In August 2014, Lloyd was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Lloyd&#x27;s book &quot;1,411 Quite Interesting Facts to Knock You Sideways&quot;, a collaboration with John Mitchinson and James Harkin, was published in 2014 by Faber and Faber.

==Personal life==
Lloyd married Sarah Wallace in 1989, with whom he has three children, one of whom is Harry Lloyd (christened Hardress Llewellyn Lloyd), frontman and singer-songwriter of the band Waiting For Smith.

==Influences==
In a 2016 interview with the spiritual &quot;Beshara Magazine&quot;, Lloyd talked about the process of self-knowledge, and explained his interest in the Indian guru Nisargadatta Maharaj&#x27;s book &quot;I Am That&quot; and in Sufi mysticism, particularly the works of the writer, thinker and Sufi teacher Idries Shah. On BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, he chose &quot;The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are&quot;, by Alan Watts.

<doc id="169369" wikidata="Q133198" url="?curid=169369" title="Ja, vi elsker dette landet">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Norway. Originally a patriotic song, it became commonly regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Norway in the early 20th century after being used alongside &quot;&quot; since the 1860s. It was officially adopted in 2019.

The lyrics were written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson between 1859 and 1868, and the melody was written by his cousin Rikard Nordraak sometime during the winter of 1863 to 1864. It was first performed publicly on 17 May 1864 in connection with the 50th anniversary of the constitution. Usually, only the first and the last two verses are sung, with the first being by far the most common.

==History==
Until the mid-1860s, the songs &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; and &quot;Norges Skaal&quot; were commonly regarded as the Norwegian national anthems, with &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; being most recognised. &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; gradually came to be recognised as a national anthem from the mid-1860s. Until the early 20th century, however, both &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; and &quot;Ja, vi elsker&quot; were used, with &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; preferred in official situations. In 2011, the song &quot;Mitt lille land&quot; featured prominently in the memorial ceremonies following the 2011 Norway attacks and was described by the media as &quot;a new national anthem&quot;. On Norwegian Constitution Day in 2012, NRK opened its broadcast with &quot;Mitt lille land&quot;.

===Background===
Norway did not have an official national anthem until 11 December 2019, but over the last 200 years, several songs have been commonly regarded as &quot;de facto&quot; national anthems. At times, multiple songs have enjoyed this status simultaneously. &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; is now most often recognised as the anthem, but until the early 20th century, &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; occupied this position.

In the early 19th century, the song &quot;Norges Skaal&quot; was regarded by many as a &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem. From 1820, the song &quot;Norsk Nationalsang&quot; () became the most recognised national anthem. It came to be known as &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; (originally &quot;Sønner af Norge&quot;) after its first stanza. &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; was written by Henrik Anker Bjerregaard (1792–1842) and the melody by Christian Blom (1782–1861) after the Royal Norwegian Society for Development had announced a competition to write a national anthem for Norway in 1819. &quot;Norsk Nationalsang&quot; (&quot;Sønner af Norge&quot;) was announced as the winner. (also called &quot;Nordmandssang&quot;) by Ole Vig has also been used as a national anthem. Henrik Wergeland also wrote an anthem originally titled &quot;Smaagutternes Nationalsang&quot; () and commonly known as &quot;Vi ere en Nation, vi med&quot;.

&quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; was written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and composed by Rikard Nordraak between 1859 and 1868, and gradually came to replace &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; as the most recognised national anthem. Until the early 20th century, &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; and &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; were used alongside each other, but &quot;Sønner av Norge&quot; was preferred in official settings. Since 2011, the anthem &quot;Mitt lille land&quot; by Ole Paus has also been called a &quot;new national anthem&quot; and notably featured in the memorial ceremonies following the 2011 Norway attacks. On Norwegian Constitution Day in 2012, the NRK broadcast opened with &quot;Mitt lille land.&quot;

In addition, Norway has an unofficial royal anthem, &quot;Kongesangen&quot;, based on &quot;God Save the King&quot; and written in its modern form by Gustav Jensen. The psalm &quot;Gud signe vårt dyre fedreland&quot;, written by Elias Blix and with a melody by Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse, is often called Norway&#x27;s &quot;national psalm&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Bjørnson wrote in a modified version of the Danish language used in Norway at the time. Written Bokmål has since been altered in a series of orthographic reforms intended to distinguish it from Danish and bring it closer to spoken Norwegian. The text below, commonly used today, is identical to Bjørnson&#x27;s original in using the same words but with modernised spelling and punctuation. The most sung verses—1, 7 and 8 (which are highlighted and in bold)—have been modernised most and have several variations in existence. For example, Bjørnson originally wrote &quot;drømme på vor jord&quot;, which some sources today write as &quot;drømme på v&quot;å&quot;r jord&quot;, while others write &quot;drømme&quot;r&quot; på v&quot;å&quot;r jord&quot;.

In each verse, the last two lines are sung twice, and one or two words are repeated an extra time when the lines are sung the second time (for example, &quot;senker&quot; in the first verse). These words are written in &quot;italics&quot; in the Norwegian lyrics below. The first verse is written down in full as an example.


==Poetic translation and metric version==
Two alternative metrical versions also exist. The second closely follows the original and was learned by heart by a Norwegian who did not know the translator&#x27;s name. It was published (without the translator&#x27;s name) in a collection of &quot;Sange og digte paa dansk og engelsk&quot; (). There are two minor changes in the text in this version, which are presented here. Verse 2, which is seldom sung, has been omitted, and the last two lines in each verse are repeated in the same way as sung in Norwegian.

==Deleted verse a tribute to King Charles IV==
The original version of &quot;Ja, vi elsker&quot; included a verse hailing Charles IV, who succeeded his father as king of Norway in July 1859. However, after the divisive international events of the spring of 1864, including the Second Schleswig War, when the ideal of a unified Scandinavia became shattered, Bjørnson went from monarchist to republican, and the tribute to the reigning sovereign was stricken from the song.

The lyrics that were removed were:

:Kongen selv står stærk og åpen
:som vår Grænsevagt
:og hans allerbedste Våpen
:er vår Broderpagt.

In English, this reads:

:The King himself stands strong and open
:As our border guard
:and his most powerful weapon
:is our brethren pact.

The &quot;brethren pact&quot; the text refers to was a military treaty between Norway, Sweden and Denmark to assist one another should any of them come under military assault. But when German troops invaded South Jutland in February 1864, none of the alliance partners came to Denmark&#x27;s rescue. This perceived treason of the &quot;brethren pact&quot; once and for all shattered dreams of unification of the three countries.

==Controversies==

===Norwegian independence===
In 1905, the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved after many years of Norwegian struggle for equality between the two states, as stipulated in the 1815 Act of Union. The unilateral declaration by the Norwegian Storting of the union&#x27;s dissolution on 7 June provoked strong Swedish reactions, bringing the two nations to the brink of war in the autumn. In Sweden, pro-war conservatives were opposed by the Social Democrats, whose leaders, Hjalmar Branting and Zeth Höglund, spoke out for reconciliation and a peaceful settlement with Norway. Swedish socialists sang &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; to support the Norwegian people&#x27;s right to secede from the union.

===Nazi occupation===
During World War II, the anthem was used both by the Norwegian resistance and the Nazi collaborators, the latter mainly for propaganda reasons. Eventually, the German occupiers officially forbade any use of the anthem.

===Urdu translation===
In May 2006, the multicultural newspaper &quot;Utrop&quot; proposed that the national anthem be translated into Urdu, the native language of one of the most numerous groups of recent immigrants to Norway. The editor&#x27;s idea was that people from other ethnic groups should be able to honour their adopted country with devotion, even if they were not fluent in Norwegian. This proposal was referred to by other more widely read papers, and a member of the Storting called the proposal &quot;integration in reverse&quot;. One proponent of translating the anthem received batches of hate mail calling her a traitor and threatening her with decapitation.

<doc id="169375" wikidata="Q92440" url="?curid=169375" title="Dan Dare">
<text>Dan Dare is a British science fiction comic hero, created by illustrator Frank Hampson who also wrote the first stories. Dare appeared in the &quot;Eagle&quot; comic series &quot;Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot; from 1950 to 1967 (and subsequently in reprints), and dramatised seven times a week on Radio Luxembourg (1951–1956).

The stories were set in the late 1990s, but the dialogue and manner of the characters is reminiscent of British war films of the 1950s. Dan Dare has been described as &quot;Biggles in Space&quot; and as the British equivalent of Buck Rogers. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated comic-strip artwork by Hampson and other artists, including Harold Johns, Don Harley, Bruce Cornwell, Greta Tomlinson, Frank Bellamy, and Keith Watson.

&quot;Dan Dare&quot; returned in new strips in &quot;2000 AD&quot; in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by Titan Comics in 2017. It was written by Peter Milligan and is a completely new interpretation of Dan Dare, who is struggling to adapt to a peaceful life after the Mekon was defeated. Since October 2003, Dare&#x27;s adventures have also continued in &quot;Spaceship Away&quot;, a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare&#x27;s adventures where the original &quot;Eagle&quot; left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson&#x27;s death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Eagle&quot;===
Dan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, &quot;Eagle&quot;, on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, Southport, Lancashire. The Eagle&#x27;s founder, the Rev John Marcus Harston Morris, was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of spaceships, and models in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, &quot;Eagle&quot; incorporated &quot;centrefolds&quot; of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan&#x27;s ship the &quot;Anastasia&quot;, reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even in &quot;Eagle&quot; itself. The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year. Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson&#x27;s house in Epsom, Surrey, where his production line techniques were continued.

Attention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer Arthur C. Clarke (later a science fiction luminary) acting as science and plot adviser for the first six months of strips. The stories were set mostly on planets of the Solar System presumed to have extraterrestrial life and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to Venus.

Hampson&#x27;s working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of &quot;Marooned on Mercury&quot; (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by Samaritans founder and clergyman Rev. Chad Varah, who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, &quot;Operation Saturn&quot; (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant Don Harley, who completed the story and its successor, &quot;Prisoners of Space&quot; (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by Desmond Walduck).

Hampson returned full-time in 1955, starting &quot;The Man from Nowhere&quot; trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time.

The quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to Frank Bellamy, whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson&#x27;s, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell, who had been part of Hampson&#x27;s studio at the beginning.

====Characters====
Dan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially:
* Dan Dare (full name Colonel Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in Manchester, England, in 1967 and educated at Rossall School. Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at jujutsu, but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word.
:His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his eyebrows, which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical British Army type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a chaplain.
* Digby (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan&#x27;s Wigan-born batman. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food. His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship.
* Sir Hubert Guest, Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson&#x27;s father.
* Professor Peabody (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team&#x27;s most inventive plans.
* Hank Hogan and Pierre Lafayette, stereotypically American and French, were two of the Fleet&#x27;s best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic.
* Sondar was a Treen, a reptilian inhabitant of northern Venus. Originally a servant of the Mekon, he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed. He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under UN rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan&#x27;s personal spaceship.
* The Mekon, super-intelligent ruler of the Treens, was Dan&#x27;s archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth.
* Christopher &#x27;Flamer&#x27; Spry, freckle-faced student at &#x27;Astral&#x27; space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson&#x27;s son, Peter Hampson. No forename for &#x27;Flamer&#x27; was ever given in the comic strip itself.
* Lex O&#x27;Malley, bearded Irish submarine commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions.

With the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O&#x27;Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances. In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run:
*Colonel Wilf Banger, handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit.
*Technician Nutter Cobb, red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger&#x27;s assistant, a Digby to his Dare.
*Major Shillitoe Spence, balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator.
*Xel, first encountered in &quot;Operation Time Trap&quot; in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon. Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out. Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured.

====Vehicles====
Spacecraft of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged &quot;Anastasia&quot;. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the &quot;Zyl-bat&quot;. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called &quot;Tempus Frangit&quot; (Latin: &quot;it breaks time&quot; or &quot;time breaks&quot;).

There were land and air vehicles – in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of helicopters of the mid-twentieth century. Also of note was Lex O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Poseidon&quot;, a versatile craft that could operate as a jetfoil as well as a submarine.

London Transport used overhead monorails and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with gyroscopes and single wheels.

Venusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel.

====Spaceports====
There is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of Formby in Lancashire on a semicircle of land built into the Irish Sea by landfill.

====Spacesuits====
Spacefleet spacesuits had a corselet plate like on Siebe Gorman standard diving suits. Their suit had no life-support backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet.

All or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet spacesuits in space hang in folds like the boilersuit in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or Theron design.

Some other spacesuits such as Blasco&#x27;s have life-support backpacks.

====1960s====
In 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, Keith Watson, Gerald Palmer, with Bruce Cornwell, and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when &quot;Eagle&quot; merged with &quot;Lion&quot;. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in &quot;Lion&quot;.

===&quot;2000 AD&quot;===
In 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of &quot;2000 AD&quot; (26 February 1977). The first installment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and Pat Mills, had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the punk movement, as was much of &quot;2000 AD&quot;) and the personality of the title character. Written by Kelvin Gosnell and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by Massimo Belardinelli, whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by Gerry Finley-Day and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by Dave Gibbons. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of &quot;Star Trek&quot; but with technology designs very much influenced by &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the &quot;Star Slayers&quot; – the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage.

The strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon&#x27;s army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by Tom Tully but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the &quot;2000 AD&quot; Dan Dare strip &quot;Attack on Eternium&quot; ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979).

In 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, &quot;2000 AD&quot; published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called &quot;3000 AD&quot; which contained strips partially based on the first issue of &quot;2000 AD&quot;. One strip was entitled &quot;The Return of Dan Dare&quot;, which also featured the return of the Mekon.

===New &quot;Eagle&quot;===
In 1982 &quot;Eagle&quot; was re-launched, with &quot;Dan Dare&quot; again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-great-grandson of the original hero—the only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was Gerry Embleton, who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by Ian Kennedy, who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair.

The opening &quot;Dan Dare&quot; story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by Pat Mills and John Wagner. It opened with a flashback to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial asteroid and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which retconned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original &quot;Eagle&quot; took place—an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life.

After this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories.

In 1987 the strip became more like a space opera, with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by Judge Dredd.

The original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s &quot;Eagle&quot;, was revived in 1989, with artist Keith Watson providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was the main artist on &quot;Dan Dare&quot; from 1962 to 1967. The artwork for the final stories was provided by David Pugh. The new &quot;Eagle&quot; ended in 1994.

===&quot;Revolver&quot;===

In 1990, a strip entitled &quot;Dare&quot;, written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Rian Hughes, was serialised in &quot;Revolver&quot;. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s British politics, from the perspective of the defeated left wing of the Labour Party. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare&#x27;s mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to the Mekon and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on Margaret Thatcher). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in &quot;Crisis&quot;, following &quot;Revolver&quot;&#x27;s cancellation. This version was not popular.

===&quot;The Planet&quot;===
In 1996, &quot;The Planet&quot; published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, &quot;Remembrance&quot;, drawn by Sydney Jordan featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.

===Virgin Comics===
In 2007–2008 Virgin Comics published a 7-issue Dan Dare mini-series written by Garth Ennis, with art by Gary Erskine. Virgin&#x27;s founder and chairman Richard Branson is a fan of the character. The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the Royal Navy taking Space Fleet&#x27;s role. Peabody is the Home Secretary to a prime minister modelled on Tony Blair, who has sold Earth&#x27;s defence out to The Mekon out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.

===&quot;Spaceship Away&quot;===
Launched in October 2003, Spaceship Away magazine was originally created in order to get &quot;The Phoenix Mission&quot; (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine&#x27;s continuation following that strip&#x27;s conclusion, initially with &quot;Green Nemesis&quot; (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth). Other stories have since followed.

Despite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own website, or in a select few comic shops), &quot;Spaceship Away&quot; continues to appear three times a year as of 2022.

===Titan Comics===
In 2017–18 a four-issue mini-series by Peter Milligan and Alberto Foche was published by Titan Comics.

==In other media==
===Radio===
====Radio Luxembourg serial====

&quot;The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot; aired five times a week on Radio Luxembourg for five years from 2 July 1951. Dan&#x27;s voice was Noel Johnson, who also played Dick Barton on BBC radio. Each episode started with the command &quot;Spaceships Away!&quot;. The 15-minute show was sponsored by Horlicks and on 3 March 1952, the 106th episode of Dan Dare was heard that Monday night with different episodes on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 7:15pm. Although the dramatisation was recorded on wax discs for broadcast, the original discs were lost or destroyed. Until recently no copies had ever been recovered but in late 2011 two episodes were found as part of the Lost Shows Appeal, orchestrated by missing episode hunter Charles Norton. The recovered shows were &quot;Under Sentence of Death&quot; (episode 76), aired on 21 January 1952, and &quot;The Lost World On Mars&quot; (episode 53), aired on 19 March 1953.

====Radio Madrid serial====
&quot;Diego Valor&quot; Spanish adaptation of Dan Dare from 1954

====BBC adaptation====
From 19 April – 10 May 1990, BBC Radio 4 aired a four-part adaptation of Voyage to Venus, dramatised by Nick McCarty and directed by Glyn Dearman. The cast included Mick Ford (Col. Dan Dare), Donald Gee (Digby), Richard Pearce (the Mekon), Terence Alexander (Sir Hubert Guest), Zelah Clarke (Prof. Peabody), William Roberts (Hank Hogan), Sean Barrett (Pierre Lafayette), John Moffatt (Kalon), Shirley Dixon (Mrs. Digby), Ben Onwukwe (Volstar), David Goudge (Sondar), Margaret Courtenay (Aunt Anastasia), Brian Miller (Urtag), David King (Dapon).

====B7 Media adaptation====
In September 2015, B7 Media secured the rights to produce a new Dan Dare audio drama series from the Dan Dare Corporation. The lead writers were Richard Kurti and Bev Doyle, with Andrew Mark Sewell as director and Simon Moorhead as producer; John Freeman served as creative consultant. The first volume, released in 2016, starred Ed Stoppard as Dan Dare, Geoff McGivern as Digby, Heida Reed as Professor Peabody, Michael Cochrane as Sir Hubert, Raad Rawi as the Mekon and Bijan Daneshmand as Sondar; Volume 2 was released in 2017. Both volumes were produced in association with Big Finish Productions. BBC Radio 4 Extra began airing the B7 episodes in August 2018.

===Television===
In the 1980s, a series of live-action adverts for Mobil motor oil featured Dan and Digby in comedic situations, trying to get their rockets to go faster. The dialogue was straight from wartime upper class RAF officers&#x27; slang.

In 2002, &quot;Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future&quot; became a computer-generated TV series produced first by Netter Digital then by Foundation Imaging, running to twenty-six 22-minute episodes. The series drew on several comic book incarnations. It started on Nicktoons UK on 5 November 2005 at 6.30 pm. Two abortive attempts had been made to make a live-action series, in 1981 and 1991. James Fox and Robert Bathurst were reportedly lined up to play Dare respectively. In 1991, a short pilot starring Bathurst as Dare and Geoffrey Hughes as Digby was made. Parts of it were broadcast in an ITV documentary, &quot;Future Perfect&quot;.

===Film===
In 2010, Variety announced that Warner Bros. was planning to produce a Dan Dare movie starring Sam Worthington in the title role.

===Computer games===
During the 1980s Dan Dare starred in three computer games for the Commodore 64/128, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Atari computers. The first was a different game on each system; the second and third were shoot&#x27;em-ups. All three were based on the 1950s strip rather than the contemporary comics:
*&quot;Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future&quot; (1986, Electronic Arts, re-released by Ricochet)
*&quot;Dan Dare II: The Mekon&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1988, Virgin Games, re-released by Ricochet)
*&quot;Dan Dare III: The Escape&quot; (1990, Virgin Games)

===Console video games===
The protagonist human character from the &quot;Gaiares&quot; science fiction space shooter starfighter combat game released in Japan in 1990 was changed from an original character called Dan Diaz to the legendary sci-fi hero Dan Dare in the English translated western version.

===Music===
Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett wrote Dan Dare into his song &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, from the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, with the line &quot;Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who&#x27;s there?&quot;.

British electronic dance group Fluke mentioned Dan Dare in their song &quot;Absurd&quot;, &quot;Dan Dare&#x27;s sitting there, scared by the killer teddy bears&quot;.

David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;D.J.&quot; contains the somewhat obscure lyric: &quot;I feel like Dan Dare lies down&quot;.

Elton John recorded &quot;Dan Dare (Pilot Of The Future)&quot; for his 1975 album &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;.

Les Barker&#x27;s album &quot;Dogologues&quot; includes a monologue &quot;Dan Dare&quot;.

British punk rock group The Mekons included their song &quot;Dan Dare&quot; on their 1979 album &quot;The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen&quot;, and recorded it again for their 2004 album &quot;Punk Rock&quot;.
The album &quot;Below the Waste&quot; by the Art of Noise opened with the song &quot;Dan Dare&quot;.

The relaunch of the &quot;Eagle Magazine&quot; in 1982 saw a free single giveaway of a track called &quot;Dan Dare&quot; by the group Loose Talk.

==Characters inspired by Dan Dare==
Characters inspired by or based on Dan Dare have appeared throughout British popular culture. One example is Wing Commander Leyton in &quot;British Summertime&quot; by Paul Cornell, which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today.

In the 1980s, &quot;Private Eye&quot; published &quot;Dan Dire, Pilot of The Future?&quot;. Dire was based on politician Neil Kinnock, the question being whether he&#x27;d ever become prime minister. Dire&#x27;s enemy was the Maggon, a combination of the Mekon and Margaret Thatcher.

Radio DJ and Comedian Kenny Everett&#x27;s character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare.

A porcine pastiche, &quot;Ham Dare: Pig of the Future&quot;, written by Lew Stringer and with art by Malcolm Douglas, appeared in &quot;Oink!&quot; comic.

Marvel Comics created a Dan Dare-esque character in their Captain Britain line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the British heroes killed by The Fury.

In Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Avengers&quot; series, the character Smasher&#x27;s secret identity is astronomer Isabel &#x27;Izzy&#x27; Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him. He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with Captain America. The card reveals the grandfather&#x27;s name as Dan. In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy&#x27;s last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel&#x27;s Captain Terror.

In his Afterword to &quot;Ministry of Space&quot;, Warren Ellis lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of &quot;Ministry of Space&quot;, is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.

Captain Jack Harkness, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot; character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode &quot;The Empty Child&quot; in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having &quot;the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard&quot;.

<text>Kidnapping or abduction is the unlawful abduction and confinement of a person against their will, and is a crime in many jurisdictions. Kidnapping may be accomplished by use of force or fear, or a victim may be enticed into confinement by fraud or deception. Kidnapping is distinguished from false imprisonment by the intentional movement of the victim to a different location.

Kidnapping may be done to demand a ransom in exchange for releasing the victim, or for other illegal purposes. Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury, which in some jurisdictions elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping.

Kidnapping of a child may be a distinct crime, depending on jurisdiction.

==Motives==
Kidnapping can occur for a variety of reasons, with motivations for the crime varying particularly based on the perpetrator.

=== Ransom ===
The kidnapping of a person, most often an adult, for ransom is a common motivation behind kidnapping. This method is primarily utilized by larger organizations, such as criminal gangs, terrorist organizations, or insurgent groups. Typically this is done for financial incentive, with sums of money varying depending on the victim or the method of kidnapping.

Mexican gangs are estimated to have made up to $250 million in kidnappings from Central American migrants.

According to a 2022 study by political scientist Danielle Gilbert, armed groups in Colombia engage in ransom kidnappings as a way to maintain the armed groups&#x27; local systems of taxation. The groups resort to ransom kidnappings to punish tax evasion and incentivize inhabitants not to shirk. A 2024 study argued that insurgent groups are more likely to engage in kidnappings &quot;under two conditions: to generate support and reinstate bargaining capacity when organizations suffer military losses on the battlefield and to enforce loyalties and display strength when organizations face violent competition from other non-state actors.&quot;

Kidnapping has been identified as one source by which terrorist organizations have been known to obtain funding.

Express kidnapping is a method of abduction used in some countries, mainly from Latin America, where a small ransom, that a company or family can easily pay, is demanded. Express kidnapping is also used for an immediate ransom in which the victim is taken to an ATM and forced to give the captor money.

Tiger kidnapping occurs when a person is kidnapped, and the captor forces them to commit a crime such as robbery or murder. The victim is held hostage until the captor&#x27;s demands are met. The term originates from the usually long preceding observation, like a tiger does when stalking prey. This is a method which has been used by the Real Irish Republican Army and the Continuity Irish Republican Army.

Virtual kidnapping is a unique form of kidnapping that has risen in recent years. Unlike previous forms of kidnapping, virtual kidnapping does not actually involve a victim of any kind. The scam involves a process of calling numerous people on the phone and making them believe the caller has a victim&#x27;s loved one, such as a child, in order to gain a quick ransom from the victim. Previously these calls used to affect Spanish speaking communities in large cities, such as Los Angeles or Houston. Until around 2015 when the calls started to be directed to English speakers as well. Around 80 victims were identified as falling for this scam, with losses ranging close to $100,000. While most perpetrators behind this scam can be linked back to Mexico, one instance occurred in Houston, Texas. Yanette Rodriguez Acosta was found guilty of accosting victims for large sums of money, which she would pick up at a set drop off of point. She was sentenced to seven years in prison, with an additional three years of supervision following her release.

In the past, and presently in some parts of the world (such as southern Sudan), kidnapping is a common means used to obtain slaves and money through ransom. In the 19th century, kidnapping in the form of shanghaiing (or &quot;pressganging&quot;) men supplied merchant ships with sailors, whom the law considered unfree labour.

===Pirates===
Kidnapping on the high seas in connection with piracy has been increasing. It was reported that 661 crewmembers were taken hostage and 12 kidnapped in the first nine months of 2009. The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre recorded that 141 crew members were taken hostage and 83 were kidnapped in 2018.

=== Other ===
Other motivations behind kidnapping include the kidnap of a person for sexual assault purposes, or situations of domestic violence. For example, the &quot;2003 Domestic Violence Report in Colorado&quot; shows in most instances of domestic violence people, most typically white females, will be taken from their residence by a present or former spouse or significant other. Often they will be taken by force, not with a weapon, and victims will be freed without injury to their person.

Bride kidnapping is a term often applied loosely, to include any bride &quot;abducted&quot; against the will of her parents, even if she is willing to marry the &quot;abductor&quot;. It still is traditional amongst certain nomadic peoples of Central Asia. It has seen a resurgence in Kyrgyzstan since the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent erosion of women&#x27;s rights.

Kidnapping has sometimes been used by the family and friends of a cult member as a method to remove them from the cult and begin a deprogramming process to change their allegiance away from the group.

Motivations for kidnapping cannot always be easily defined. During the 1990s and afterward, for example, the New York divorce coercion gang was involved in a sting of kidnappings. They would take Jewish husbands from their homes in New York and New Jersey and torture them in order for them to grant &quot;gittin,&quot; or religious divorces, to their wives. The gang is notorious for crimes of this nature. They were later apprehended for their crimes on October 9, 2013, in connection with a foiled kidnapping plot.

==By jurisdiction==
Jurisdiction of kidnapping varies depending on the country, with each one having their own way of defining and prosecuting the crime. Some such countries with clearly defined laws on kidnapping include:

===Australia===
In Australia, kidnapping is a criminal offence, as defined by either the State Crimes Act or the Commonwealth Criminal Code. It is a serious indictable offence, and is punishable by up to 25 years&#x27; imprisonment.

===Canada===
Kidnapping that does not result in a homicide is a hybrid offence that comes with a maximum possible penalty of life imprisonment (18 months if tried summarily). A murder that results from kidnapping is classified as 1st-degree, with a sentence of life imprisonment that results from conviction (the mandatory penalty for murder under Canadian law).

=== Mexico ===
The General Law to Prevent and Punish Crimes of Kidnapping establishes a prison sentence of 20–40 years for an individual convicted of holding another person as a hostage. The prison term increases to 25–45 years if the kidnapping occurred with violence against the victims, and then increases to 25–50 years if the kidnapping was committed by members of public safety. If the kidnapping results in homicide, the prison sentence will be from 40 to 70 years.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, there are two kinds of kidnapping: Kidnapping from Pakistan and kidnapping from lawful guardianship. Penal Code 360 states that whoever conveys any person beyond the limits of Pakistan without the consent of that person or of some person legally authorized to consent on behalf of that person is said to kidnap that person from Pakistan. Penal Code 363 states that whoever kidnaps any person from Pakistan or lawful guardianship shall be punished with imprisonment of either description of a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to a fine. Kidnapping with a motive of murder, hurt, slavery, or to the lust of any person shall be punished with imprisonment for life with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to a fine.

===Netherlands===
Article 282 prohibits hostaging (and &#x27;kidnapping&#x27; is a kind of &#x27;hostaging&#x27;). Part 1 of Article 282 allows sentencing kidnappers to maximum imprisonment of eight years or a fine of the fifth category. Part 2 allows maximum imprisonment of nine years or a fine of the fifth category if there are serious injuries. Part 3 allows maximum imprisonment of 12 years or a fine of the fifth category if the victim has been killed. Part 4 allows sentencing people that collaborate with kidnapping (such as proposing or make available a location where the victim hostaged). Part 1, 2 and 3 will apply also to them.

===United Kingdom===
Kidnapping is an offence under the common law of England and Wales. Lord Brandon said in 1984 &quot;R v D&quot;:

In all cases of kidnapping of children, where it is alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it is the absence of the consent of that child which is material. This is the case regardless of the age of the child. A very small child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent. This means that absence of consent will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent. Lord Brandon said: &quot;I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent.&quot; If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having custody or care and control of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial. If, on the other hand, the child did not consent, the consent of the person having custody or care and control of the child may support a defence of lawful excuse. It is known as Gillick competence.

Regarding restriction on prosecution, no prosecution may be instituted, except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for an offence of kidnapping if it was committed against a child under the age of sixteen and by a person connected with the child, within the meaning of section 1 of the Child Abduction Act 1984. Kidnapping is an indictable-only offence. Kidnapping is punishable with imprisonment or fine at the discretion of the court. There is no limit on the fine or the term of imprisonment that may be imposed provided the sentence is not inordinate.

A parent should only be prosecuted for kidnapping their own child &quot;in exceptional cases, where the conduct of the parent concerned is so bad that an ordinary right-thinking person would immediately and without hesitation regard it as criminal in nature&quot;.

===United States===

Law in the United States follows from English common law. Following the highly publicized 1932 Lindbergh kidnapping, Congress passed the Federal Kidnapping Act, which authorized the FBI to investigate kidnapping at a time when the Bureau was expanding in size and authority. The fact that a kidnapped victim may have been taken across state lines brings the crime within the ambit of federal criminal law.

Most states recognize different types of kidnapping and punish according to such factors as the location, duration, method, manner and purpose of the offense. There are several deterrents to kidnapping in the United States of America. Among these are:

# The extreme logistical challenges involved in successfully exchanging the money for the return of the victim without being apprehended or surveilled.
# Harsh punishment. Convicted kidnappers face lengthy prison terms. If a victim is brought across state lines, federal charges can be laid as well.
# Good cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement agencies, and tools for spreading information to the public (such as the AMBER Alert system).

In 2009, Phoenix, Arizona reported over 300 cases of kidnapping, gaining it a reputation as America&#x27;s kidnapping capital, as according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; Hundreds of kidnappings for ransom occurred in the city, as per the &quot;Times&quot;, most of them having connections to Mexican drug and human trafficking as a way to pay off unpaid debts. These statistics would have made the city have the highest kidnapping rate of any U.S. city, and second in the world only to Mexico City. However, an investigation and later audit by the U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General found these statistics to be falsified. Only 59 federally reportable kidnappings occurred in 2008. This is in comparison to the over 300 claimed kidnappings on grant applications. The falsified data can be attributed to a variety of issues within the southwestern United States as a whole, including misclassification by local police, lack of unified standards, a desire for Federal grants, or the Mexican Drug War.

==Statistics==
===Countries with the highest rates===

In 2021, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that the United States was the country with most kidnappings, totaling 56,652. This is in comparison to 2010, when they were ranked sixth in the world (by absolute numbers, not per capita) for kidnapping by ransom, according to available statistics (after Colombia, Italy, Lebanon, Peru, and the Philippines).

Kidnapping for ransom is a common occurrence in various parts of the world today. In 2018, the United Nations found Pakistan and England had the highest number of kidnappings while New Zealand had the highest rate among the 70 countries for which data is available. As of 2007, that title belonged to Iraq with possibly 1,500 foreigners kidnapped. In 2004, it was Mexico, and in 2001, it was Colombia. Reports suggest a world total of 12,500–25,500 per year with 3,600 per year in Colombia and 3,000 per year in Mexico around the year 2000. However, by 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline.

Mexican numbers are hard to confirm because of fears of police involvement in kidnapping. According to Pax Christi, a Catholic peace movement, &quot;Kidnapping seems to flourish particularly in fragile states and conflict countries, as politically motivated militias, organized crime and the drugs mafia fill the vacuum left by government&quot;.

Since 2019, the risk of kidnapping has risen worldwide, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase is mostly seen in kidnappings for ransom. This factors from a variety of aspects, including socioeconomic disparities, insufficient resources, and flawed judicial systems. Another impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on kidnappers is the economic strain that it had put many families through. This pressured kidnappers to increase kidnappings as well as ransom demands. After 2022, the diminishing effects of COVID-19 have led many countries to welcome back in-person interactions, travel and tourism. The connection between increased tourism and kidnapping is reflected through the rise of global kidnapping rates from 2019 to 2021–2023.

The highest recorded ransom demand in 2021 was $77.3 million, while in 2019, it was $28.7 million. Between those two years, the average global ransom demand increased 43%, while the median global ransom demand increased by 6%. In Sub-Saharan Africa, regions such as Congo (DRC), Nigeria, and South Africa are likely to maintain higher levels of kidnappings due to ongoing effects of religious extremist groups, recent genocides, and civil wars. While there is no hard evidence of which country had the most kidnappings in 2021, the American region (which includes Mexico) maintains its position as the region with the second highest kidnapping rates.

One notorious failed example of kidnap for ransom was the 1976 Chowchilla bus kidnapping, in which 26 children were abducted with the intention of bringing in a $5 million ransom. The children and driver escaped from an underground van without the aid of law enforcement. According to the Department of Justice, kidnapping makes up 2% of all reported violent crimes against juveniles.

===By country===
The annual number of recorded kidnappings per capita by country for the last available year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, is shown in the table below. Each country&#x27;s definition of kidnapping may differ, and the table does not include unreported kidnappings.

<text>The Margites () is a comic mock-epic ascribed to Homer that is largely lost. From references to the work that survived, it is known that its central character is an exceedingly stupid man named Margites (from ancient Greek , &quot;margos&quot;, &quot;raving, mad; lustful&quot;), who was so dense he did not know which parent had given birth to him. His name gave rise to the adjective &quot;margitomanēs&quot; (), &quot;mad as Margites&quot;, used by Philodemus.

The work, among a mixed genre of works loosely labelled &quot;Homerica&quot; in antiquity, was commonly attributed to Homer, as by Aristotle (&quot;Poetics&quot; 13.92)—&quot;His &quot;Margites&quot; indeed provides an analogy: as are the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; to our tragedies, so is the &quot;Margites&quot; to our comedies&quot;—and Harpocration. Basil of Caesarea writes that the work is attributed to Homer but that he is unsure regarding this attribution. However, the massive medieval Greek encyclopaedia called the &quot;Suda&quot; attributed the &quot;Margites&quot; to Pigres, a Greek poet of Halicarnassus.

It is written in mixed hexameter and iambic lines, an oddity characteristic also of the &quot;Batrachomyomachia&quot; (likewise attributed to Pigres), which inserts a pentameter line after each hexameter of the &quot;Iliad&quot; as a curious literary game.

&quot;Margites&quot; was famous in the ancient world, but only the following lines survive:
Due to the Margites character, the Greeks used the word as an insult to describe foolish and useless people. Demosthenes called Alexander the Great Margites in order to insult and degrade him.

<text>Oder-Spree is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the eastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighboring are (from north clockwise) the district Märkisch-Oderland, the district-free city Frankfurt (Oder), Poland, the districts Spree-Neiße and Dahme-Spreewald, and the &quot;Bundesland&quot; Berlin.

==Geography==
The district is named after the two major rivers in the district - the Spree river forms a large bend within the district; the Oder river constitutes the eastern border.

==History==
The district was created in 1993 by merging the districts Eisenhüttenstadt, Beeskow and Fürstenwalde, and the district-free city Eisenhüttenstadt.

== Demography ==


==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms shows symbols for the three former districts which make up the district. In the top left quarter is the coat of arms of the Bishops of Lebus, who had their seat in Fürstenwalde. The second quarter shows the checkered bar of the Cistercian Order as the symbol of the Abbey of Neuzelle, who until 1817 owned most of the territory which later became the district Eisenhüttenstadt. The two quarters in the bottom symbolize the former district Beeskow. The three knives in the left are the symbol of the Lords of Strehla, the deer antler the symbol of the Lords of Biberstein, who in 1317 succeeded the Lords of Strehla as the Lords of Beeskow and Storkow.

==Towns and municipalities==
The capital of the district is Beeskow, but Fürstenwalde is the biggest town, with a population of 31,000 people.

<doc id="169382" wikidata="Q76807" url="?curid=169382" title="Max Delbrück">
<text>Max Ludwig Henning Delbrück (; September 4, 1906 – March 9, 1981) was a German–American biophysicist who participated in launching the molecular biology research program in the late 1930s. He stimulated physical scientists&#x27; interest into biology, especially as to basic research to physically explain genes, mysterious at the time. Formed in 1945 and led by Delbrück along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, the Phage Group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of genetics. The three shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses&quot;. He was the first physicist to predict what is now called Delbrück scattering.

==Early and personal life==

Delbrück was born in Berlin, German Empire. His mother was granddaughter of Justus von Liebig, an eminent chemist, while his father Hans Delbrück was a history professor at the University of Berlin. In 1937, Delbrück left Nazi Germany for America—first California, then Tennessee—becoming a US citizen in 1945. In 1941, he married Mary Bruce. They had four children.

Delbrück&#x27;s brother Justus, a lawyer, as well as his sister Emmi Bonhoeffer were active along with his brothers-in-law Klaus Bonhoeffer and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in resistance to Nazism. Found guilty by the People&#x27;s Court for roles in the July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, Dietrich and Klaus were executed in 1945 by the RSHA. Justus died in Soviet custody that same year. His son, Tobias Delbruck is a professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. Professor Tobias Delbruck is also one of the pioneers in the domain of event cameras, now increasingly being deployed in dynamic vision systems.

==Education==
Delbrück studied astrophysics, shifting towards theoretical physics, at the University of Göttingen. After completing his Ph.D. there in 1930, he traveled through England, Denmark, and Switzerland. He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr, who interested him in biology.

==Career and research==
Delbrück returned to Berlin in 1932 as an assistant to Lise Meitner, who was collaborating with Otto Hahn on irradiation of uranium with neutrons. Delbrück wrote a few papers, including one in 1933 on gamma rays&#x27; scattering by a Coulomb field&#x27;s polarization of a vacuum. Though theoretically tenable, his conclusion was misplaced, whereas Hans Bethe some 20 years later confirmed the phenomenon and named it &quot;Delbrück scattering&quot;.

In 1935, Delbrück published a collaboration with Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky and Karl Zimmer the major work, &quot;Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur&quot;. It was considered to be a major advance in understanding the nature of gene mutation and gene structure. The work was a keystone in the formation of molecular genetics. It was also an inspirational starting point for Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s thinking, a course of lectures in 1943, and the eventual writing of the book &quot;What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell&quot;.

In 1937, he attained a fellowship from Rockefeller Foundation—which was launching the molecular biology research program—to research genetics of the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, in California Institute of Technology&#x27;s biology department, where Delbrück could blend interests in biochemistry and genetics. While at Caltech, Delbrück researched bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or &quot;phages&quot;). In 1939, with Emory L. Ellis, he coauthored &quot;The growth of bacteriophage&quot;, a paper reporting that the viruses reproduce in &quot;one step&quot;, not exponentially as do cellular organisms.

Although Delbrück&#x27;s Rockefeller Foundation fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where from 1940 to 1947 he taught physics, yet had his laboratory in the biology department. In 1941, Delbrück met Salvador Luria of Indiana University who began visiting Vanderbilt. In 1942, Delbrück and Luria published on bacterial resistance to virus infection mediated by random mutation. Alfred Hershey of Washington University in St. Louis began visiting in 1943. The Luria–Delbrück experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel&#x27;s experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin&#x27;s theory was provided when Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin&#x27;s ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code. Of course, by then Avery, along with McCloud (and earlier, McCarty) was well on the way to showing the genetic capability of DNA.

In 1945, Delbrück, Luria, and Hershey set up a course in bacteriophage genetics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York. This Phage Group spurred molecular biology&#x27;s early development. Delbrück received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with Luria and Hershey &quot;for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses&quot;. The committee also noted that &quot;The honour in the first place goes to Delbrück who transformed bacteriophage research from vague empiricism to an exact science. He analyzed and defined the conditions for precise measurement of the biological effects. Together with Luria he elaborated the quantitative methods and established the statistical criteria for evaluation which made the subsequent penetrating studies possible. Delbrück&#x27;s and Luria&#x27;s forte is perhaps mainly theoretical analysis, whereas Hershey above all is an eminently skillful experimenter. The three of them supplement each other well also in these respects.&quot; That year, Delbrück and Luria were also awarded by Columbia University the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize. In late 1947, as Vanderbilt lacked the resources to keep him, Delbrück had returned to Caltech as a professor of biology, and remained there for the rest of his career. Meanwhile, he set up University of Cologne&#x27;s institute for molecular genetics.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Delbrück was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967. He was elected an EMBO Member in 1970. The Max Delbruck Prize, formerly known as the biological physics prize, is awarded by the American Physical Society and named in his honour. The Max Delbrück Center, in Berlin, Germany, national research center for molecular medicine of the Helmholtz Association also bears his name.

==Later life and legacy==
Delbrück helped spur physical scientists&#x27; interest in biology. His inferences on genes&#x27; susceptibility to mutation was relied on by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in his 1944 book &quot;What Is Life?&quot;, which conjectured genes were an &quot;aperiodic crystal&quot; storing codescript and influenced crystallographer Rosalind Franklin and biologists Francis Crick and James D. Watson in their 1953 identification of cellular DNA&#x27;s molecular structure as a double helix. In 1977, he retired from Caltech, remaining a Professor of Biology emeritus. He became interested in the behavioral sciences and spent some unfruitful effort on mold behavior in the 1960s.

Max Delbrück died, at age 74, on the evening of Monday, March 9, 1981, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California. On August 26 to 27, 2006—the year Delbrück would have turned 100—family and friends gathered at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to reminisce on his life and work. Although Delbrück held some anti-reductionist views; he conjectured that ultimately a paradox—akin perhaps to the waveparticle duality of physics—would be revealed about life. His view however, was later refuted upon the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.

<text>Elbe-Elster is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the southern part of Brandenburg, Germany. Neighboring districts are Teltow-Fläming, Dahme-Spreewald, Oberspreewald-Lausitz, Meißen,
Nordsachsen and Wittenberg. The district has a partnership with the Märkischer Kreis.

==History==
The district was established in 1993 by merging the former districts (Kreise) of Finsterwalde, Bad Liebenwerda and Herzberg.

==Geography==
The district is named after two rivers - the Elbe river forms the western border with Saxony, the Black Elster (&quot;Schwarze Elster&quot;) is a tributary of the Elbe and runs through the district. The district is part of the Lusatia region. The fens along the Black Elster are a habitat of several rare animals, like common kingfishers, beavers and Eurasian otters.

== Demography ==


==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms was granted in 1995. The lion in the bottom left derives from the county of Meissen (see Saxony), to which the southern area of the district belonged historically. The black bars derive from the Saxony-Wittenberg county as the area around Bad Liebenwerda belonged there in the past. The red bars derive from the oldest coat of arms of Brandenburg, and the bull is the symbol for the Lower Lusatia area were the district is located.

<doc id="169398" wikidata="Q1425534" url="?curid=169398" title="The Atomic Cafe">
<text>The Atomic Cafe is a 1982 American documentary film directed by Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce Rafferty. It is a compilation of clips from newsreels, military training films, and other footage produced in the United States early in the Cold War on the subject of nuclear warfare. Without any narration, the footage is edited and presented in a manner to demonstrate how misinformation and propaganda was used by the U.S. government and popular culture to ease fears about nuclear weapons among the American public.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The film covers the beginnings of the era of nuclear warfare, created from a broad range of archival material from the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s including newsreel clips, television news footage, U.S. government-produced films (including military training films), advertisements, television and radio programs. News footage reflected the prevailing understanding of the media and public. The film covers both the impact of the atomic bomb on popular culture and daily life, as well as documents the military&#x27;s increasing fascination with carrying out more and more dangerous tests. The film opens with footage of the Trinity Test and concludes with a montage of stock footage simulating a nuclear attack on the United States.

Though the topic of atomic holocaust is a grave matter, much of the humor derives from the modern audience&#x27;s reaction to old training films, such as the &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; film shown in schools. Another sequence involves footage of US Army training maneuvers in which soldiers are instructed to walk into a mushroom cloud as part of an exercise to study how efficiently the armed forces could kill the survivors of a nuclear bomb strike if Soviet Soldiers ever made it to US soil; prior to the beginning of the exercise, the soldiers are informed, &quot;Viewed from a safe distance, the atomic bomb is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man.&quot;

=== People shown ===
The following people are shown in excerpts from speeches, interviews and news reports, along with several unnamed actors, civilians, members of the armed forces and narrators: Lloyd Bentsen, William H. P. Blandy, Owen Brewster, Frank Gallop, Lyndon Johnson, Maurice Joyce, Nikita Khrushchev, Brien McMahon, Seymour Melman, George Molan, Richard Nixon, Robert E. Stripling, Val Peterson, George Portell, Bill Burrud, George Putnam, Ronald Reagan, Dwight D. Eisenhower,  Joseph Stalin, Douglas MacArthur,
Ethel Rosenberg, Julius Rosenberg, Mario Salvadori, Lewis Strauss, Paul Tibbets, Kermit Beahan, Harry S. Truman, and James E. Van Zandt.

== Historical context ==
&quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, referred to as a &quot;compilation verite&quot; with no &quot;voice of God narration&quot; or any recently shot footage, was released at the height of nostalgia and cynicism in America. By 1982, Americans lost much of their faith in their government following the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal the previous decade, alongside the seemingly never-ending arms race with the Soviet Union. &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; reflects and reinforces this idea as it exposes how the atomic bomb&#x27;s dangers were downplayed and how the government used films to shape public opinion. Loader, who grew up in 50s-60s Fort Worth, Texas living across the street to E.O. &quot;Soapy&quot; Gillam, better known as the &quot;bomb shelter king of North Texas&quot;, while also remembering one of her friends used her family&#x27;s bunker as a clubhouse/secret party spot, felt compelled to revisiting the era that formed her childhood.

&quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; was also released during the Reagan administration&#x27;s civil defense revival. Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera explain this revival in their article &quot;Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment&quot; published in &quot;International Security&quot;. They argue that in 1981–82 the Reagan administration was moving from an essentially defensive grand strategy of containment to a more offensive strategy. Due to the greater demands of its more offensive strategy &quot;the Reagan Administration ... proposed the biggest military buildup since the Korean War.&quot; Of key relevance to &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, the Reagan move toward offense included the adoption of a more aggressive nuclear strategy that required a large U.S. nuclear buildup. Containment only required that U.S. strategic nuclear forces be capable of one mission: inflicting unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union even after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise attack. To this &quot;assured destruction&quot; mission the Reagan administration added a second &quot;counterforce&quot; mission, which required the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike against Soviet strategic nuclear forces that would leave the Soviets unable to inflict unacceptable damage on the U.S. in retaliation. The U.S. had always invested in counterforce but the Reagan administration put even greater emphasis on it. The counterforce mission was far more demanding than the assured destruction mission, and required a vast expansion of U.S. nuclear forces to fulfill. Civil defense was a component of a counterforce strategy, as it reduced Soviet retaliatory capacity, hence civil defense was a candidate for more spending under Reagan&#x27;s counterforce nuclear strategy. Posen and Van Evera argue that this counterforce strategy was a warrant for an open-ended U.S. nuclear buildup.

Bob Mielke, in &quot;Rhetoric and Ideology in the Nuclear Test Documentary&quot; (&quot;Film Quarterly&quot;) discusses the release of &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;: &quot;This satire feature was released at the height of the nuclear freeze movement (which was in turn responding to the Reagan administration&#x27;s surreal handling of the arms race.)&quot;

In &quot;Atomic Café&quot; (&quot;Film Quarterly&quot;), Fred Glass points out that the technical and cultural background needed to create the film was not available in 1955. The film&#x27;s themes, critical of government propaganda and the nuclear arms race, would have been seen as unpatriotic during the McCarthy era. And getting the necessary permits and funding to make Atomic Café can be quite difficult.

Patricia Aufderheide, in &quot;Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction&quot; touches on the significance of &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; as a window into the past of government propaganda and disinformation during the years following the advent of the atomic bomb. Propaganda, also known as disinformation, public diplomacy, and strategic communication, continues to be an important tool for governments. But stand-alone documentary is no longer an important part of public relations campaigns aimed at the general public.

It has also been known as a postmodernist film.

==Production==
&quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; was produced over a five-year period through the collaborative efforts of three directors: Jayne Loader and brothers Kevin and Pierce Rafferty. For this film, the Rafferty brothers and Loader formed a production company called The Archives Project. The filmmakers opted not to use narration. Instead, they deployed carefully constructed sequences of film clips to make their points. Jayne Loader has referred to &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; as &quot;compilation verite&quot;: a compilation film with no &quot;Voice of God&quot; narration and no new footage added by the filmmakers. The soundtrack utilizes atomic-themed songs from the Cold War era to underscore the themes of the film.

The film cost $300,000 to make. The group did receive some financial support from outside sources, including the Film Fund, a New York City based non-profit. Grants comprised a nominal amount of the team&#x27;s budget, and the film was largely funded by the filmmakers themselves. Jayne Loader stated in an interview, &quot;Had we relied on grants, we would have starved.&quot; Pierce Rafferty helped to support the team and the film financially by working as a consultant and researcher on several other documentary films including the Oscar-nominated &quot;El Salvador: Another Vietnam&quot;, the Oscar-nominated &quot;With Babies and Banners&quot;, and &quot;The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter&quot; (which also was inducted into the National Film Registry). The Rafferty brothers had also received an inheritance that they used to support the team during the five years it took to make the film. About 75% of the film is made up of government materials that were in the public domain. Though they could use those public domain materials for free, they had to make copies of the films at their own expense. This along with the newsreel and commercial stock footage that comprises the other 25% of the film (along with the music royalties) represents the bulk of the trio&#x27;s expenditures.

==Release==
The film was released on March 17, 1982, in New York, New York. In August 1982, a tie-in companion book of the same name, written by Kevin Rafferty, Jayne Loader and Pierce Rafferty was released by Bantam Books. A 4K digital restoration of the film, created by IndieCollect, premiered at SXSW in 2018.

===Home media===
The 20th Anniversary Edition of the film was released in DVD format in Region 1 on March 26, 2002, by Docudrama. A 4K restored version was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2018, by Kino Lorber.

In 1995, &quot;Jayne Loader&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Public Shelter&quot;, an educational CD-ROM and website – with clips from &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, plus additional material from declassified films, audio, photographs, and text files that archive the history, technology, and culture of the Atomic Age – was released by EJL Productions, a company formed by Jayne Loader and her first husband, Eric Schwaab. Though it garnered positive national reviews and awards, the self-distributed &quot;Public Shelter&quot; CD-ROM sold only 500 copies and failed to find a national publisher. Loader and Schwaab divorced. The website folded in 1999.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical response===
When &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; was released, film critic Roger Ebert discussed the style and methods the filmmakers used, writing, &quot;The makers of &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; sifted through thousands of feet of Army films, newsreels, government propaganda films and old television broadcasts to come up with the material in their film, which is presented without any narration, as a record of some of the ways in which the bomb entered American folklore. There are songs, speeches by politicians, and frightening documentary footage of guinea-pig American troops shielding themselves from an atomic blast and then exposing themselves to radiation neither they nor their officers understood.&quot; He also reviewed it with Gene Siskel who saw it more as a piece of Americana and a curiosity.

Critic Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; praised the film, calling the film &quot;a devastating collage-film that examines official and unofficial United States attitudes toward the atomic age&quot; and a film that &quot;deserves national attention.&quot; Canby was so taken by &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; that he mentioned it in a subsequent article – comparing it, favorably, to the 1981 blockbuster &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;.

Critic Glenn Erickson discussed the editorial message of the film&#x27;s producers: The makers of &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; clearly have a message to get across, and to achieve that goal they use the inherent absurdity of their source material in creative ways. But they&#x27;re careful to make sure they leave them essentially untransformed. When we see Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover posing with a strip of microfilm, we know we&#x27;re watching a newsreel. The content isn&#x27;t cheated. Except in wrapup montages, narration from one source isn&#x27;t used over another. When raw footage is available, candid moments are seen of speechmakers (including President Truman) when they don&#x27;t know the cameras are rolling. Caught laughing incongruously before a solemn report on an atom threat, Truman comes off as callously flip ...

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 29 critics.

Deirdre Boyle, an Associate Professor and Academic Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Documentary Media Studies at The New School and an author of &quot;Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited&quot;, claimed that &quot;By compiling propaganda or fictions denying &#x27;nuclear-truth&#x27;, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Atomic Cafe&quot; reveals the American public&#x27;s lack of resistance to the fear generated by the government propaganda films and the misinformation they generated. Whether Americans of the time lacked the ability to resist or reject this misinformation about the atomic bomb is a debatable truth.&quot;

The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction&quot; said it was, in quotes, a &quot;mockumentary&quot; from its editing and called it, &quot;The most powerful satire of the official treatments of the atomic age&quot;.

===Influences===
In 2016, &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; was one of the 25 films selected for preservation in the annual United States&#x27; National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The press release for the Registry stated that &quot;The influential film compilation &#x27;Atomic Cafe&#x27; provocatively documents the post-World War II threat of nuclear war as depicted in a wide assortment of archival footage from the period ...&quot;

Controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore was inspired by the film that he tweeted:
&quot;This is the movie that told me that a documentary about a deadly serious subject could be very funny. Then I asked the people who made it to teach me how to do it. They did. That movie became my first – &#x27;Roger &amp; Me&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The Riksdag is the national legislature of Sweden. However, when it was founded in 1866 Sweden did not have a parliamentary system of government.

The national legislatures of Estonia and Finland are also called &quot;Riksdag&quot; in Swedish.

== The Old Riksdag ==
=== Origin ===
The precursor to the modern Riksdag was the Riksdag of the Estates (). Of ancient origin in the Viking Things, the 1435 meeting in the city of Arboga is considered the first Riksdag, however only three of the estates were probably present the nobility, the clergy and the burghers. This informal representation was formalized in 1527 by King Gustav I of Sweden to include representatives of all the four estates, which historically reflected the lines of division in Swedish society: the nobility, the clergy, the burghers and the peasantry. This ingathering is considered the first formal parliament in Sweden. In the 1540s, the word &quot;Riksdag&quot; was first used. During the reign of Gustav I, the Riksdags were at time convened once every few years and for a short time, leaving them relatively weak and strengthening the power of the monarch.

=== 17th century ===
In the 17th century the Riksdag would approve the raising of troops and the imposition of taxes. The Riksdag convened more frequently which consolidates and strengthened the political power of the representatives of the estates. The Riksdag also began submitting petitions. Under the Carolingian autocracy, the Riksdag became a tool of the king who exercised more autocratic power. During the reign of Karl XI the Riksdag convened only two times.

=== Age of freedom ===
After the death of Karl XII in 1718, the Riksdag regained its influence, this was also aided by the fact that the council of the realm (composed of the nobility and kings) was viewed as responsible for the poor economic situation and &quot;devastation&quot; in Sweden. From 1718 onwards, important decisions were taken by the Riksdag and the body began to convene for lengthy periods of time to discuss matters at hand. When the Riksdag was not in session, the council of the realm, which functioned as the &quot;government&quot; at the time, controlled Sweden. When the Riksdag convened it could issue punishments against members of the council if they deviated from the Riksdag&#x27;s wishes. The Riksdag&#x27;s functioning began to resemble that of a parliamentary system. Two political camps began to emerge at this time: the caps and the hats. in 1766, the Riksdag passed a law to guarantee freedom of press, this abolished censureship and allowed the general public to access information. During the period known as the &quot;age of freedom&quot;, from 1719 to 1772, when a decision was taken, each of the four estate was given one vote, necessitating three estates to support the implementation of a decision. There were four estates at the time:

* The Burghers, who represented 2% of the population and consisted of merchants and craftsmen who mostly resided in cities.
* The Nobility, consisting of 1200 families in Sweden and 0.5% of the population.
* The Clergy, which was about 1% of the population.
* The Peasantry which was about 95% of the population.
The Burghers had 100 representatives in the Riksdag. The peasantry had 150 representatives through county district courts. 500 nobles sat in Riksdag meetings while the clergy had 50 representatives.

King Gustav III performed a coup d&#x27;état in 1772, ending the &quot;age of freedom&quot; and severely weakening the Riksdag while increasing his own power.

=== 1809 Instrument of Government ===
Under the Instrument of Government of 1809 the Riksdag shared the powers of government with the king. The instrument remained valid until 1974. This new instrument took inspiration from the Swedish enlightenment in which division of power was a guiding principle as well as Swedish historical traditions. In 1809 the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman was created, it is considered the first public complaints office in the world. A committee of constitution was established which would oversee that the monarch complied to the constitution.

== The New Riksdag ==

On the basis of the 1863 electoral reform bill the Estates voted in 1866 to dissolve the Riksdag of the Estates and establish a new Riksdag. Thus the old estates system was abolished. Most of the Riksday and the king were not interested at the time in &quot;full democracy with universal and equal suffrage&quot;. The new Riksdag was a political assembly with two chambers (bicameral) where the members were chosen in national elections. A decision had to accepted by both chambers to pass.

The major change in the reform was that citizens could participate and vote in the elections without regard to which Estate they had hitherto belonged; instead, there were new requirements on income or wealth, i.e. census suffrage. Despite the fundamental change in the principles of representation, the social composition of the Riksdag did not alter by much, and the system of government had not changed. To vote, one had to meet a set of qualifications. Swedes who did not provide taxes or were supported were not able to vote. Prisoners, the bankrupt and those who did not serve in the military and finish their service could not vote. To be elected to the first chamber one had to be above the age of 35 and hold wealth, the elected received no pay. Those elected to the second chamber received a relatively small salary which meant they did not necessarily have to hold significant assets to hold office. Those who possessed wealth had more votes for the First chamber while the votes to the Second chamber worked as one vote per man. Under the Instrument of 1809 the Riksdag still divided the powers of government with the king.

== Democracy emerges ==

From the second half of the 19th century, when the Riksdag was founded, until the early 20th century, Swedish society underwent fundamental changes that impacted on the political system. Political demands, but also sheer economic progress, increased the size of the electorate and the degree of political mobilization. This in turn also sponsored the emergence and growth of political parties. As such, the legislature became more assertive against royal authority, successfully asserting responsible government; a parliamentary system thus became &quot;de facto&quot; established; the king could not (or at least would not dare) keep a government in office against parliamentary objections.

Between 1907 and 1909, universal suffrage to Swedish men was granted. This was carried out under the government led by Arvid Lindman. All Swedish men above 24 could vote for the Second chamber without any of the prior qualifications involving them having to possess wealth or income.

=== Courtyard Crisis ===

The last time the king attempted to assert himself in opposition to the Riksdag was the Courtyard Crisis of 1914, where King Gustav V delivered a partisan speech which precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister Karl Staaff and his government. Though the outbreak of World War I kept the King&#x27;s conservative government, headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjöld in office, in the face of popular unrest (also resulting from food shortages) and a clear majority for the opposition Social Democrats and Liberals at the 1917 general election, the King reluctantly resolved to appoint a cabinet from the reform-minded majority in the Riksdag. The new government&#x27;s main task was to present bills on constitutional reform.

In 2023, Micaela Edhager argued that courtyard crisis also reflected a confrontation between two different ideas of how Sweden&#x27;s political system should be arranged, a monarchical one vs a parliamentary system.

=== Further reforms ===
The franchise had been extended to all adult men in 1907; women&#x27;s suffrage first came in the 1921 general election to the second chamber of the Riksdag. In 1919, women as well as all other Swedes who were of age, were given the right to vote in elections for county and municipal councils. This reform affected the First chamber, as its members were chosen by the county councils.

== Constitutional reform ==


In the 1960s, debates intensified over constitutional reform in Sweden. The fundamental question was over the system of government. Even though a &quot;de facto&quot; parliamentary system was firmly established, somewhat similar to the situation in the United Kingdom, there were demands for a more democratic constitution. One of the main issues was whether the monarchy would survive constitutional reform and this blocked the issue for a long time. According to the old instrument of government from 1809, the monarch ruled the country despite the country having de facto transitioned to a parliamentary system.

In 1945, Swedes above the age of voting who were in relief or aid schemes were not permitted to vote.

Women first served as members of the Riksdag in 1922, however only in the 1960s did women&#x27;s representation increase. Also, beginning in the 1960s they received more meaningful political appointments.

Effective from 1970, a reform of the Riksdag had been agreed upon. Though not technically part of the constitution it showed that the parties in the Riksdag were able to agree upon fundamental changes of the political system, which transformed the Riksdag from a bicameral legislature into a unicameral one. This would have 350 seats, all of which would be filled by direct election. However, the second general election to the unicameral Riksdag only gave the government support from 175 members, while the opposition could mobilize an equal force of 175 members, resulting in what became known as the &quot;lottery Riksdag&quot;, in which the Speaker had to draw lots to resolve deadlocked votes. On 6 March 1974 it was passed in law that all public power in Sweden arises from the people. It was also decided that the Riskdag is the &quot;foremost representative of the people&quot;. In 1974, it was decided that the number of seats from 1977 were to be reduced to 349. The new instrument of government adopted in 1974 left the monarch as a ceremonial head of state without political power. The new instrument of government read as follows:
“All public power in Sweden proceeds from the people. Swedish democracy is founded on the free formation of opinion and on universal and equal suffrage. It is realised through a representative and parliamentary form of government and through local self-government. Public power is exercised under the law.”

In 1974, a new Instrument of Government was established as a vital part of the Constitution and for the system of government. The monarchy was retained, whereas the monarch lost all formal political influence and became only a symbolic head of state. Several of the traditional head-of-state functions have instead been transferred to the Speaker of the Riksdag.

In 1989, people who were deemed &quot;legally incompetent&quot; (at the time people suffering from mental illness or disabilities) were allowed to vote. For a person to be eligible to vote for the Riksdag one must be a Swedish citizen and at the age of 18 or above. Since 1994, the percentage of women in the Rikstag has fluctuated from 40 to 60 percent.

Today, what is described as &quot;fundamental laws&quot; can be amended if the amendment is adopted in its exact wording by two parliaments (meaning a parliament before an election and the parliament after the election had both adopted the same amendment with the same exact wording).
