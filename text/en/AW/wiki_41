<text>Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday, among other names, is the day during Holy Week that commemorates the Washing of the Feet (Maundy) and Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Apostles, as described in the canonical gospels.

It is the fifth day of Holy Week, preceded by Holy Wednesday (Spy Wednesday) and followed by Good Friday. &quot;Maundy&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;mandatum&quot;, or commandment, reflecting Jesus&#x27; words &quot;I give you a new commandment.&quot; 
The date of the day will vary according to whether the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar is used. Eastern churches generally use the Julian system.

== Names ==

Use of the names &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;, &quot;Holy Thursday&quot;, and others is not evenly distributed. The generally accepted name for the day varies according to geographical area and religious affiliation. Thus, although in England &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; is the normal term, the term &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; is more commonly used in Ireland, Scotland, Canada and the United States. The latter is the official name used in English by the Catholic Church in England and Wales.

The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England, which is the mother Church of the Anglican Communion, uses the name &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; for this observance. The corresponding publication of the US Episcopal Church, which is another province of the Anglican Communion, also refers to the Thursday before Easter as &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;. Throughout the Anglican Communion, the term &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; is a synonym for Ascension Day.

The Roman Rite of the Catholic Church uses the name &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; in its modern English-language liturgical books. The Latin books use the name &quot;Feria quinta in Cena Domini&quot; (&quot;Thursday of the Supper of the Lord&quot;; the medieval spelling &quot;&quot; was used in place of &quot;&quot; in documents predating the 1955 decree Maxima redemptionis), along with Maundy Thursday as the English name, as given in &quot;The Saint Andrew Daily Missal&quot;. The personal ordinariates in the Catholic Church, which have an Anglican patrimony, retain the traditional English term &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;, however. An article in the 1911 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; used the term &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;, and some Catholic writers use the same term either primarily, or alternatively.

The Methodist &quot;Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) uses the term &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;; the &quot;Book of Worship&quot; (1992) uses the term &quot;Holy Thursday&quot;, and other official sources of the United Methodist Church use both &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; and &quot;Holy Thursday&quot;.

Both names are used by other Christian denominations as well, including the Lutheran Church, and certain Reformed Churches. Certain Presbyterian Churches use the term &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; to refer to the holy day in their official sources.

In the Byzantine Rite the name for the holy day is &quot;Great and Holy Thursday&quot; or &quot;Holy Thursday&quot;, and in Western Rite Orthodoxy &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;, &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; or both. The Coptic Orthodox Church uses the term &quot;Covenant Thursday&quot; or &quot;Thursday of the Covenant&quot;.

In the Maronite Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church, the name is &quot;Thursday of Mysteries&quot;.

&quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; is the official name of the day in the civil legislation of England and the Philippines.

The day has also been known in English as &quot;Shere Thursday&quot; (also spelled &quot;Sheer Thursday&quot;), from the word &quot;shere&quot; (meaning &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;bright&quot;). This name might refer to the act of cleaning, or to the fact that churches would switch liturgical colors from the dark tones of Lent, or because it was customary to shear the beard on that day, or for a combination of reasons. This name has cognates in the Nordic languages, such as Danish &quot;skærtorsdag&quot;, Swedish &quot;skärtorsdag&quot;, Norwegian &quot;skjærtorsdag&quot;, Faroese &quot;skírhósdagur&quot; and &quot;skírisdagur&quot;, Icelandic &quot;skírdagur&quot;, and Finnish &quot;kiirastorstai&quot;.
=== Derivation of the name &quot;Maundy&quot; ===

&quot;Maundy&quot; is the name of the Christian rite of footwashing, which traditionally occurs during Maundy Thursday church services.

The English word &quot;&quot; in the name for the day is derived through Middle English and Old French &quot;mandé&quot;, from the Latin &quot;mandatum&quot; (also the origin of the English word &quot;mandate&quot;), the first word of the phrase &quot;Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos&quot; (&quot;A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.&quot;) By this statement in chapter 13 of the Gospel of John, Jesus explained to the Apostles the significance of his action of washing their feet.

The phrase is used as the antiphon sung in the Roman Rite during the Maundy (Ecclesiastical Latin: &quot;Mandatum&quot;) ceremony of the washing of the feet, which may be held during Mass or as a separate event. A priest or bishop, representing Christ, ceremonially washes the feet of others, typically 12 persons chosen as a cross-section of the community. In 2016, it was announced that the Roman Missal had been revised to allow women to participate as part of the 12 in the Mandatum. Previously, only males partook of the rite.

Others theorize that the English name &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; arose from &quot;maunds&quot; or baskets or &quot;maundy purses&quot; of alms which the king of England distributed to certain poor at Whitehall before attending Mass on that day. Thus, &quot;maund&quot; is connected to the Latin &quot;mendicare&quot;, and French &quot;mendier&quot;, to beg.

A source from the Shepherd of the Springs, Lutheran Church likewise states that, if the name was derived from the Latin &quot;mandatum&quot;, we would call the day Mandy Thursday, or Mandate Thursday, or even Mandatum Thursday. The term &quot;Maundy&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;mendicare&quot;, Old French &quot;mendier&quot;, and English &quot;maund&quot;, which as a verb means to beg and as a noun refers to a small basket held out by maunders as they maunded. Other sources reject this etymology.

==Services==
===Western Christianity===

Maundy Thursday initiates the Paschal Triduum, the period which commemorates the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. This period includes Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and ends on the evening of Easter Sunday. The Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper or service of worship is normally celebrated in the evening, when Friday begins according to Jewish tradition, as the Last Supper was held on the feast of Passover, according to the three Synoptic Gospels.

====Services====
In the United Kingdom, the Royal Maundy service involves the Monarch offering &quot;alms&quot; to deserving senior citizens – one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign&#x27;s age. These coins, known as Maundy money or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to King Edward I. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing. The white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign&#x27;s age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out Maundy coins, which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in Northern Ireland at Armagh Cathedral. Until the death of King James II, the Monarch would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen Elizabeth I washing people&#x27;s feet on Maundy Thursday.

The Maundy (washing of the feet) is practised among many Christian groups on Maundy Thursday, including the Anglican/Protestant Episcopal, Armenian, Ethiopian, Lutheran, Methodist, Eastern Catholic, Schwarzenau (German Baptist) Brethren, Mennonite, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.

With Maundy Thursday commemorating the Last Supper, Christian denominations who observe this day universally celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion, which they teach was instituted by Jesus on this night. In the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church and in certain Anglican congregations, the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper begins as usual, but the Gloria is accompanied by the ringing of church bells, which are then silent until the Easter Vigil. After the homily the washing of feet may be performed. The Blessed Sacrament remains exposed, at least in the Catholic Mass, until the service concludes with a procession taking it to the place of reposition. The altar is later stripped bare, as are all other altars in the church except the Altar of Repose. In pre-1970 editions, the Roman Missal of the Catholic Church envisages this being done ceremonially, to the accompaniment of , a practice which continues in the Lutheran churches and Anglican churches of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship. In other Christian denominations, such as the Methodist Churches, the stripping of the altar and other items on the chancel also occurs, as a preparation for the somber Good Friday service. The stripping of the altar represents &quot;the abandonment of Jesus by his disciples and the stripping of Jesus by the soldiers before his crucifixion.&quot;

====Chrism Mass====
The Chrism Mass is a religious service held in Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism.

Maundy Thursday is notable for being the day on which the Chrism Mass is celebrated in each diocese. Usually held in the diocesan cathedral, it is generally held on the morning of Maundy Thursday, but may in some dioceses take place on another day during Holy Week. The Mass is a celebration of the institution of the priesthood.

During the Mass, those present are called to renew their baptismal promises. Priests/ministers and deacons also reaffirm their ministry by renewing the promises made at their ordination. The Mass takes its name from the blessing of the holy oils used in the sacraments throughout the year, which are then given to priests to take back to their parishes.

The service is a 1967 restoration of the rite recorded in the early 200s by the historian Hippolytus who writes of a ceremony taking place during the Easter Vigil at which two holy oils were blessed and one was consecrated. In the decree renewing this rite Pope Paul VI said, &quot;The Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop&#x27;s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.&quot;

The Holy Oils are:
* Chrism – used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.
* the oil of catechumens – also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and
* the oil of the sick – used in the rite of the Anointing of the Sick

The oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming Holy Saturday at the Easter Vigil, for the baptism and confirmation of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply &quot;blessed,&quot; the Sacred Chrism is &quot;consecrated,&quot;. Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the &quot;odor of sanctity&quot; to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive.

With respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (p. 307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.

====Plenary indulgence====
In the Roman Catholic Church, plenary indulgence is obtained in the following cases:
# If during the solemn reservation of the Blessed Sacrament (typically on a side altar), which follows the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, it is recited or sung the Eucharistic hymn &quot;Tantum ergo&quot;.
# If it is adored the solemnly reserved Blessed Sacrament for a half hour.

===Eastern Christianity===
====Eastern Orthodoxy====

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the liturgical colours are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.

The primary service of this day is Vespers combined with the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great at which is read a Composite Gospel, primarily taken from Matthew, but with episodes inserted from John (the Washing of the Feet) and Luke (Jesus sweating blood), and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following troparion:

&quot;Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the Thief will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy Kingdom.&quot;

When necessary to replenish the sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy, an additional Lamb (Host) is consecrated on this day, intincted, covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the artophorion.

In cathedrals and monasteries the ceremony of the Washing of Feet is normally performed. When there is need to consecrate more chrism, that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various autocephalous churches.
In the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the hangings and vestments are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the Twelve Gospels is conducted. In these readings Christ&#x27;s last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ&#x27;s prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:
*
*
*
*

Beginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the memorial service for the dead is forbidden until after Thomas Sunday.
=====Local customs=====
* In Greek practice, the Mystery of Unction is performed on Great Wednesday as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under Ottoman control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.
* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of &quot;Today He Who Hung&quot;. During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ&#x27;s body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.
* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.

====Oriental Orthodoxy====
Oriental Orthodox Churches celebrate Covenant Thursday during Holy Week (based on their local calendars). They offer praises and vespers every day of week, and on Thursday and Saturday they remain in church praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas&#x27; Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham.

==Customs and names around the world==

* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passiontide (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.
* The popular German name &quot;Gründonnerstag&quot; means either &quot;mourning Thursday&quot; or &quot;green Thursday&quot;.
* In the Czech Republic and Slovakia the day is called &quot;Zelený čtvrtek&quot; or &quot;Zelený štvrtok&quot; respectively, again meaning &quot;Green Thursday&quot;, because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the church bells until Holy Saturday, here called &quot;White Saturday&quot;, because &quot;they have flown to Rome&quot; (a euphemism); in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and to call the people to church.
* The tradition of silent bells also occurs in Luxembourg: the bells fall silent until Easter, because &quot;they have flown to Rome for Confession&quot;, so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.
* In the Netherlands and Belgium, the day is called &quot;Witte Donderdag&quot; (White Thursday) referring to the liturgical colour of the day.
* In Malta, Holy Thursday is known as &quot;Ħamis ix-Xirka&quot; (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of visiting seven churches (see below) is called &quot;is-seba&#x27; visti&quot; or is-Sepulkri.
* Eastern Slavic cultures traditionally carried out a range of cleansing ceremonies on Maundy Thursday (sometimes known in Russian as &quot;Clean Thursday&quot; ()).
* In Welsh, Maundy Thursday is &quot;Dydd Iau Cablyd&quot;.
* In Sweden Maundy Thursday (skärtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for Easter eggs.
* In Bulgaria Maundy Thursday is called &quot;Veliki Chetvurtuk&quot; (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their Easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for &quot;Razpeti Petuk&quot; (Crucifixion Friday), &quot;Velika Subota&quot; (Great Saturday) and &quot;Velikden&quot; (Easter Day).
* In Kerala the day is called as &quot;Pesaha&quot; (പെസഹ), a Malayalam word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word &quot;Peshai&quot; meaning Passover . Maundy Thursday and following Good Friday are observed as statewide public holiday declared by the Government of Kerala, given the high number of Syrian Christians in the state. The tradition of consuming &quot;Pesaha appam&quot; or &quot;Indariyappam&quot; is customary after special longer Holy Qurbana, which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call &quot;Pesaha Paal&quot; made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, &quot;Pesaha Paal&quot; a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them. The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating Jesus washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.
* In the Philippines, the day is officially known as &quot;Huwebes Santo&quot; (phonetic transliteration of Jueves Santo in Spanish, Holy Thursday) or &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;. Most businesses are closed during the Easter Triduum, with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday.

===Public holiday===

Maundy Thursday is a public holiday in most countries that were part of the Spanish Empire (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Uruguay and Venezuela), countries that were part of the Danish colonial empire (Denmark, Iceland, Norway and United States Virgin Islands), and in the Kerala State of India.
Certain German states declare a public holiday for public sector employees. In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as &quot;privilege leave&quot;) on this date, but that was abolished, by David Cameron, after 2012.

===Seven Churches Visitation===

The tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in Rome. and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.

In India, the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per Station of the Cross. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily fasting for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.

In the Philippines the tradition is called &quot;Visita Iglesia&quot; (Spanish, &quot;church visit&quot;) – people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the Stations of the Cross. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in cities, and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of Intramuros that stood until the 1945 Bombing of Manila.
The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the Blessed Sacrament in the Altar of Repose on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the Pope), the Stations of the Cross were recited.

In Singapore, the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Ave Maria, and the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8 pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, hot cross buns and other local snacks like the traditional &quot;kueh ko chee&quot;. Observant Catholics have a &#x27;Last Supper&#x27; meal in anticipation of the next day&#x27;s fast.

<doc id="170390" wikidata="Q757646" url="?curid=170390" title="Atomic chess">
<text>Atomic chess is a chess variant. Standard rules of chess apply, with the difference that all captures result in an &quot;explosion&quot; through which the capturing piece, captured piece, and all surrounding pieces of both colors other than pawns are removed from play. Some variations additionally remove rules concerning check such that the king may be able to move into (or remain in) check.

==Rules and variations==
Rules of atomic chess are the same as standard chess with a few important differences concerning capturing, check, and winning conditions.

===Capturing===
When a capture is made, an explosion occurs on the destination square of the capturing piece. This explosion causes the captured piece, the capturing piece, and all adjacent non-pawn pieces to be removed from the board. Captures that result in the explosion of a player&#x27;s own king are illegal; therefore, a king can never capture.

===Check===

Threats to the king can be direct or indirect. Putting a king in check is a direct attack and is sometimes called &quot;atomic check&quot;. An indirect threat occurs when a player threatens to explode the king by capturing an adjacent piece. In most variations of atomic chess, players must respond to being checked in a similar way they would in traditional chess—by moving the king out of check, blocking the check, or removing the checking piece—but an exception exists when the checked player can win the game by exploding the checking player&#x27;s king.

As the king cannot take another piece, it is possible to move the kings next to each other without a check occurring or to escape check. This possibility is often used by a losing player to defensively position his king next to his opponent&#x27;s at endgame, hoping for a draw. Depending on the board setup, this strategy is sometimes optimal and allows the draw to be forced. At other times, a player can counter by forcing a win with a position such that a piece or pawn can be exploded next to their opponent&#x27;s king without blowing up their own king, or they can force the opposing king away using their king and the remaining pieces on the board, which will typically result in a loss for the retreating king.

The variant of atomic chess played at the Internet Chess Club is one that does not enforce check at all, making legal any move, even one leaving the king to be captured directly in the next move.

===Winning conditions===
In all variations of atomic chess, a player wins by exploding the king of the opposite color without exploding their own king. This is usually done by capturing a piece on a square adjacent to the opponent&#x27;s king or putting a queen next to the king which results in checkmate since a king cannot take any piece.

In variations that require a response to being checked, it is possible to checkmate an opponent to win the game, creating a situation in which a king is directly threatened and cannot make a legal move. This is sometimes called &quot;atomic checkmate&quot;. It is likewise possible for the game to end in stalemate if a king is not directly threatened and no legal moves are possible.

When typical rules of check are not enforced, victory is only attained via the explosion of the enemy king. In these variations without check, the king may be forced into check and thus capture through zugzwang.

==History==
In 1995 the German Internet Chess Server (GICS) introduced the game, based on rules one of its users collected from friends who played offline. It was soon after incorporated into the Middle East Wild Internet Server (MEWIS) and other smaller servers before being implemented at Chess Live and Internet Chess Club in 2000, Free Internet Chess Server in 2003 and Lichess in 2015. It was added to Chess.com in late 2020. In 2021, 4.9 million atomic chess games were played on Lichess. Lichess also hosts 24-hour tournaments called &quot;Atomic Revolution&quot; with cash prizes where 8 thousand people participated in the 2022 edition.

It has garnered serious attention from chess grandmasters with Andrew Tang reaching quarterfinals and Jeffery Xiong reaching semifinals of Atomic Chess Championship 2017 hosted on Lichess, where both got knocked out by GM Arka50 who has won the championship in 2017, 2018 and 2020 whereas he did not participate in 2019 and 2021 editions.

==Strategy==

The first-move advantage enjoyed by White is much greater in this game than in standard chess. However, no attempts to prove a win for White have been successful.

Material sacrifices are more common in atomic chess than in chess. In the opening and middlegame, it is common to offer a piece in order to open spaces to seize an initiative.

===Opening===

White has the initiative in atomic chess, and many openings begin with a quick attempt to explode Black&#x27;s d-, e-, or f-pawns, and thus the black king. For this reason, atomic openings are fraught with traps, and Black may have to respond precisely to defend. Several common traps begin with 1.Nf3 followed by Ng5 or Ne5, forcing Black to start with 1..f6 to maintain rough equality. Games between experienced players follow more traditional opening principles, such as piece , controlling , and winning .

===Endgame===

As with atomic opening theory, a small amount of endgame theory and analyses have been published online by strong players.

A common scenario in atomic endgames is to have two kings on adjacent squares. As a player cannot intentionally blow up their own king, a king can never capture another piece, including another king. Similarly, because a capture affects all adjacent squares, one king cannot be captured directly if it means destruction of the other. Moving one king towards the other is thus a strategy to achieve a draw. The player with the advantage must then maneuver into a position where a non-king piece can be captured that is adjacent to one king but not the other. If there is no piece that can be captured, the player with the advantage can promote two queens and force the opponent into zugzwang and therefore forcing the opponent&#x27;s king away from their king. Creative use of zugzwang is a common tactic to force a win in these situations.

The Internet Chess Club variation of atomic chess ignores check completely, and thus leads to different outcomes in certain situations. For example, a king and rook vs. king endgame that would be a draw under normal circumstances can become a forced win on ICC.

<text>Ronald Frederick Delderfield (12 February 1912 – 24 June 1972) was an English novelist and dramatist, some of whose works have been adapted for television and film.

==Biography==

===Childhood in London and Surrey===
Ronald Frederick Delderfield was born at 37 Waller Road, New Cross, London, in 1912 to Alice and William James Delderfield (–1956). His father worked for a meat wholesaler in Smithfield Market, and was the first Liberal to be elected to Bermondsey Council. William supported women&#x27;s suffrage and the Boer cause in the Boer War. He was a firm supporter of the temperance movement, and of David Lloyd George until the latter allied himself in government with the Conservative Party. From 1918 to 1923, the family lived at 22 Ashburton Avenue, Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey. &quot;The Avenue&quot; novels were based on Ronald&#x27;s life in Addiscombe and Shirley Park.

Delderfield attended an infant school in Bermondsey, then a &quot;seedy and pretentious&quot; small private school — &quot;seventy boys and four underpaid ushers, presided over by a jovial gentleman who wore blue serge&quot;. He then went to a council school, which he hated, but which provided him with the prototype for Mr. Short in &quot;The Avenue&quot;. This experience was followed by a grammar school whose dedicated teachers inspired several of his characters. Once the family moved to Devon, Delderfield first attended a co-educational grammar school and, finally, West Buckland School. In his autobiography &quot;For My Own Amusement&quot;, Delderfield joked that West Buckland could be likened to schools in &quot;The Spring Madness of Mr Sermon&quot;, &quot;The Avenue&quot; and &quot;A Horseman Riding By&quot;, and that it had earned its fees three times over. Again, in &quot;For My Own Amusement&quot;, Delderfield divided the nation into city and suburb dwellers, rural dwellers, and those who lived in coastal towns.

On a family holiday in Swanage when he was young, Delderfield caught scarlet fever and had to spend three months in an isolation hospital.

===Residence in East Devon===
In 1923, Delderfield&#x27;s father and a neighbour in Bermondsey bought the &quot;Exmouth Chronicle&quot;, a local newspaper in Exmouth, and William became the editor. In 1929, Delderfield joined the staff of the paper and later succeeded his father as editor. In &quot;For My Own Amusement&quot;, he describes his work—attending Magistrates&#x27; Courts and Council meetings, covering amateur dramatics and other events, visiting the bereaved to write local obituaries, even cycling after the fire engine to see if there was a story, as well as relying on a large number of local correspondents. His experiences during this period were clearly mirrored in the romantic novel &quot;Diana&quot;. In 1926 he had a house, &#x27;Dove Cottage&#x27; (now &#x27;Gazebo&#x27;), built on Peak Hill in Sidmouth.

Delderfield&#x27;s first published play was produced at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1936; the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; wrote &quot;more please, Mr Delderfield&quot;. One of his plays, &quot;Worm&#x27;s Eye View&quot;, had a run at the Whitehall Theatre in London, and was filmed in 1951 with Diana Dors. Following service in the RAF during World War II, he resumed his literary career, while also running an antiques business near Budleigh Salterton, Devon. Having begun with drama, Delderfield decided to switch to writing novels in the 1950s. His first novel, &quot;Seven Men of Gascony&quot;, a tale of French soldiers in the Napoleonic Wars, was published in 1949 by Werner Laurie. In 1950 he featured in a BBC Newsreel clip of the short-lived &quot;The Axminster and Lyme Regis Clarion&quot; in Lyme Regis.

===Autobiography===
In &quot;For My Own Amusement&quot; (1972), Delderfield discusses the inspiration for the storylines and tells in anecdotes the origin of several of his characters. He believed that authors draw inspiration from the scenes of their youth, pointing out that Charles Dickens&#x27; characters nearly always used the stagecoach, when he was writing in the age of the train. Delderfield calls his sources &quot;character farms&quot;, the main ones being his time in Addiscombe, schooldays, and his time at the &quot;Exmouth Chronicle&quot;. Of &quot;The Avenue&quot; and &quot;A Horseman Riding By&quot; he said, &quot;I set out to tell a straightforward story of a group of undistinguished British people—the only kind of people I really know.&quot; Delderfield pointed out in this autobiography that he had been criticized for his very conventional views of women&#x27;s social roles.

===Death===
Delderfield died at his home, then called Dove Cottage, in Sidmouth of lung cancer, and was survived by his widow, the former May Evans, whom he married in 1936. They had a son and a daughter. A brother, Eric Delderfield (1909–1995) survived him and wrote several books on the history of England&#x27;s West Country.

==Early 20th century social history as a subject of his writing==
Several of Delderfield&#x27;s historical novels and series involve young men who return from war and take up careers in peacetime that allow the author to delve deeply into social history from the Edwardian era to the early 1960s.

=== Examples ===
* David Powlett-Jones of &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot; is from a Welsh working-class background and begins his teaching of history at a rural public school shortly after being released from a shell-shock ward in 1918. That novel examines the changes in private education and the development of the Labour political movement between the world wars.
* Adam Swann of the &quot;God is an Englishman&quot; series is a veteran of the British Army in India who forms a transport business in the mid-19th century. The series explores the economic history of the United Kingdom from the 1860s to the outbreak of the First World War.
* In the &quot;A Horseman Riding By&quot; trilogy, Paul Craddock, also an ex-soldier, becomes a rural landlord in Delderfield&#x27;s own Devon in the early 20th century.
* The two-volume work &quot;The Avenue&quot;, which follows the residents of a middle-class suburban road over a few decades, begins shortly after the end of World War I with the return of one resident, who finds that his wife has died in the Spanish flu epidemic and left him with several children to care for.

== Other works ==
Delderfield also published non-fiction books on Napoleonic history, historical novels involving the Napoleonic Wars, and some isolated novels set in more contemporary periods. His prose style tends to be straightforward and readable, lacking in any influence from post-modernist fiction, and his social attitudes are fairly traditional, though his politics, as expressed via his characters, are a mixture of progressive and free market. In general, Delderfield&#x27;s novels celebrate English history, humanity, and liberalism while demonstrating little patience with entrenched class differences and snobbery yet also sometimes advocating individualism, self-reliance, and other traditional Victorian values.

Delderfield wrote &quot;The Adventures of Ben Gunn&quot; (1956) which follows Ben Gunn from sexton&#x27;s son to pirate and is narrated by Jim Hawkins in Gunn&#x27;s words. It describes the life of Ben Gunn from the events which led him to leave Devon, and eventually to his presence on Treasure Island and involvement in the story told by Stevenson, and follows up with a brief summary of Ben Gunn&#x27;s life afterwards.

<doc id="170395" wikidata="Q234033" url="?curid=170395" title="Princess Ingeborg of Denmark">
<text>Princess Ingeborg of Denmark (Ingeborg Charlotte Caroline Frederikke Louise; 2 August 1878 – 12 March 1958), was a Princess of Sweden by marriage to Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland.

Princess Ingeborg was a daughter of Frederick VIII of Denmark and Louise of Sweden, she grew up in Copenhagen as a Danish princess. In 1897, she was married to her mother&#x27;s first cousin Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and spent the rest of her of life in Sweden as a member of the Swedish royal family.

Her marriage produced four children, among whom were Märtha, Crown Princess of Norway and Astrid, Queen of the Belgians.

==Early life==
Princess Ingeborg was born on 2 August 1878 at her parents&#x27; country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. She was the second daughter and fifth child of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, and his wife Princess Louise of Sweden. Her father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, and her mother was the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands. She was baptised with the names &quot;Ingeborg Charlotte Caroline Frederikke Louise&quot;, and was known as Princess Ingeborg.

As a granddaughter of Christian IX, referred to by the sobriquet the &quot;Father-in-law of Europe&quot;, Princess Ingeborg was related to several European monarchs and rulers. She was thus a first cousin of the future King George V of the United Kingdom, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, King Constantine I of Greece and Duke Ernest Augustus of Brunswick.
Princess Ingeborg had seven siblings, the two eldest of whom were Prince Christian (the future King Christian X of Denmark) and Prince Carl (the future King Haakon VII of Norway). She was raised with her siblings at the royal household in Copenhagen, and grew up between her parents&#x27; city residence, the Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen, and their country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located by the coastline of the Øresund strait north of the city. In contrast to the usual practise of the period, where royal children were brought up by governesses, the children were raised by Crown Princess Louise herself. Under the supervision of their mother, the children of the Crown Princess received a rather strict Christian-dominated upbringing, which was characterized by severity, the fulfillment of duties, care and order. In spite of this austere upbringing, Princess Ingeborg grew up to be a friendly, carefree and quick-witted young woman.

==Engagement and marriage==
In May 1897, Princess Ingeborg was engaged at the age of eighteen to Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland who was the third son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and Sophia of Nassau. They were, therefore, first cousins once-removed. It had long been a public secret that Crown Princess Louise wanted one of her daughters to marry a member of the Swedish royal family, which thus indeed happened. In 1947, on the occasion of their golden wedding anniversary, her spouse admitted that their marriage had been completely arranged by their respective fathers, and Ingeborg herself added: &quot;I married a complete stranger!&quot; Although their marriage was arranged, the outcome was very much in accordance with the personal aspiration of the princess who after the wedding said: &quot;I have prayed to God for a whole year to have Carl.&quot;

The wedding was celebrated on 27 August 1897 in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. The wedding guests included members of the Danish and Swedish royal families, as well as the bride&#x27;s paternal aunts, the Dowager Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales. After the wedding reception, the newly married couple left the palace for the pier, where they embarked the Danish royal yacht, the paddle steamer &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, which early next morning sailed for Lübeck. They spent their honeymoon in Germany.

==Public role==

The marriage was popular because she was the granddaughter of the popular king Charles XV of Sweden and IV of Norway, and she was a personal success in Sweden. It was said of her, that of all foreign princesses married into the Swedish royal house, she was perhaps the one best suited to be Queen consort of Sweden, and for the first ten years in Sweden, she almost was: from 1897 until 1907, Queen Sophia seldom attended public events and Crown Princess Victoria spent most of her time abroad for health reasons, Princess Ingeborg was thereby given more public duties, unofficially performing much of the role associated with the queen consort at the Swedish court. She is perceived as having performed her representational duties with a combination of dignity and easygoing friendliness, and as attracting a social circle with her wit.
Her sister-in-law, Crown Princess Victoria, however, did not approve of her informality and once remarked: &quot;One does not enter the chamber of the Crown Princess of Sweden without knocking, even if one is Princess Ingeborg.&quot;

Ingeborg was interested in sports, especially ice skating, and at the automobile exhibition of Stockholm in 1903, she and the Crown Prince, Gustav, made a spontaneous demonstration trip in a car from Scania. In 1908, she accompanied her husband&#x27;s nephew Prince William to his wedding with her paternal first cousin once removed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna in Russia.

==Family life==

Although the parties had not had much influence on its conclusion, the marriage between Ingeborg and Carl ended up being successful, and the couple&#x27;s relationship was described as harmonious. They had four children: 
# Princess Margaretha of Sweden, later Princess Axel of Denmark (1899–1977).
# Princess Märtha of Sweden, later Crown Princess of Norway (1901–1954).
# Princess Astrid of Sweden, later Queen of the Belgians (1905–1935).
# Prince Carl Bernadotte, known as &quot;Carl Jr.&quot;, later &quot;Prince Bernadotte&quot;, a Belgian title (1911–2003).

The family lived a harmonious life, and was known as &quot;The happy family&quot;. The children were given a simple upbringing, and expected to learn household tasks: they were, for example, given a real stove in their play cottage, on which they cooked real food. She and Carl lived an informal and intimate family life with their children.

Ingeborg was admired for her handling of the economic difficulties experienced when a bank they invested in crashed in 1922 and they had to sell their home. She was portrayed as a symbol of a wife and mother in many magazines and was for many years the most popular member of the royal house.

== Later life ==

In 1905, the Norwegian government discussed making them king and queen of Norway, but Carl declined the offer. Instead, her brother was elected monarch of Norway. Ingeborg&#x27;s kinship to the Scandinavian dynasties helped bring the three royal houses together again after tension created due to Norway&#x27;s 1905 secession. Politically, Ingeborg had democratic and liberal sympathies and disliked the conservatives, views she expressed during the government crisis in 1914. She detested the conservative Hammarskjöld cabinet and the 1914 policy, criticized the conservative press and viewed the resignation of the Liberal-Social Democratic cabinet of 1914 as a disaster, reportedly commented it with the words: &quot;It must not happen! No no no!&quot;

During World War II from 1940 to 1945, she demonstrated publicly against Nazi Germany by blocking the window of her house which faced the German embassy in Stockholm.

<doc id="170396" wikidata="Q184453" url="?curid=170396" title="Bark (botany)">
<text>Bark is the outermost layer of stems and roots of woody plants. Plants with bark include trees, woody vines, and shrubs. Bark refers to all the tissues outside the vascular cambium and is a nontechnical term. It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older stems is living tissue, includes the innermost layer of the periderm. The outer bark on older stems includes the dead tissue on the surface of the stems, along with parts of the outermost periderm and all the tissues on the outer side of the periderm. The outer bark on trees which lies external to the living periderm is also called the rhytidome.

Products derived from bark include bark shingle siding and wall coverings, spices, and other flavorings, tanbark for tannin, resin, latex, medicines, poisons, various hallucinogenic chemicals, and cork. Bark has been used to make cloth, canoes, and ropes and used as a surface for paintings and map making. A number of plants are also grown for their attractive or interesting bark colorations and surface textures or their bark is used as landscape mulch.

The process of removing bark is decortication and a log or trunk from which bark has been removed is said to be decorticated.

==Botanical description==

Bark is present only on woody plants - herbaceous plants and stems of young plants lack bark.

From the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem, the layers include the following:

# Bark
## Periderm
### Cork (phellem or suber), includes the rhytidome
### Cork cambium (phellogen)
### Phelloderm
## Cortex
## Phloem
# Vascular cambium
# Wood (xylem)
## Sapwood (alburnum)
## Heartwood (duramen)
# Pith (medulla)

In young stems, which lack what is commonly called bark, the tissues are, from the outside to the inside:

# Epidermis, which may be replaced by periderm
# Cortex
# Primary and secondary phloem
# Vascular cambium
# Secondary and primary xylem.

Cork cell walls contain suberin, a waxy substance which protects the stem against water loss, the invasion of insects into the stem, and prevents infections by bacteria and fungal spores. The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the vascular cambium, are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. Phloem is a nutrient-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with parenchyma and fibers. The cortex is the primary tissue of stems and roots. In stems the cortex is between the epidermis layer and the phloem, in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the pericycle.

As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world. In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork. Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients. This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems.

Cork, sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech, is the outermost layer of a woody stem, derived from the cork cambium. It serves as protection against damage from parasites, herbivorous animals and diseases, as well as dehydration and fire.

===Periderm===

Often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which is composed of cork (phellem), the cork cambium (phellogen), and the phelloderm. The periderm forms from the phellogen which serves as a lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have suberin in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, as is the case with woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm.

In woody plants, the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year. As the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis, called the cork cambium, these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork. A limited number of cell layers may form interior to the cork cambium, called the phelloderm.
As the stem grows, the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm, namely the epidermis, cortex and older secondary phloem die.

Within the periderm are lenticels, which form during the production of the first periderm layer. Since there are living cells within the cambium layers that need to exchange gases during metabolism, these lenticels, because they have numerous intercellular spaces, allow gaseous exchange with the outside atmosphere. As the bark develops, new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers.

===Rhytidome===
The rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark, being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees. It is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of suberized periderm, cortical and phloem tissue. The rhytidome is especially well developed in older stems and roots of trees. In shrubs, older bark is quickly exfoliated and thick rhytidome accumulates. It is generally thickest and most distinctive at the trunk or bole (the area from the ground to where the main branching starts) of the tree.

==Chemical composition==
Bark tissues make up by weight between 10 and 20% of woody vascular plants and consists of various biopolymers, tannins, lignin, suberin and polysaccharides. Up to 40% of the bark tissue is made of lignin, which forms an important part of a plant, providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides, such as cellulose.

Condensed tannin, which is in fairly high concentration in bark tissue, is thought to inhibit decomposition. It could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood. 
It has been proposed that, in the cork layer (the phellogen), suberin acts as a barrier to microbial degradation and so protects the internal structure of the plant.

Analysis of the lignin in the bark wall during decay by the white-rot fungi &quot;Lentinula edodes&quot; (Shiitake mushroom) using 13C NMR revealed that the lignin polymers contained more Guaiacyl lignin units than Syringyl units compared to the interior of the plant. Guaiacyl units are less susceptible to degradation as, compared to syringyl, they contain fewer aryl-aryl bonds, can form a condensed lignin structure, and have a lower redox potential. This could mean that the concentration and type of lignin units could provide additional resistance to fungal decay for plants protected by bark.

==Damage and repair==
Bark can sustain damage from environmental factors, such as frost crack and sun scald, as well as biological factors, such as woodpecker and boring beetle attacks. Male deer and other male members of the Cervidae (deer family) can cause extensive bark damage during the rutting season by rubbing their antlers against the tree to remove their velvet.

The bark is often damaged by being bound to stakes or wrapped with wires. In the past, this damage was called bark-galling and was treated by applying clay laid on the galled place and binding it up with hay. In modern usage, &quot;galling&quot; most typically refers to a type of abnormal growth on a plant caused by insects or pathogens.

Bark damage can have several detrimental effects on the plant. Bark serves as a physical barrier to disease pressure, especially from fungi, so its removal makes the plant more susceptible to disease. Damage or destruction of the phloem impedes the transport of photosynthetic products throughout the plant; in extreme cases, when a band of phloem all the way around the stem is removed, the plant will usually quickly die. Bark damage in horticultural applications, as in gardening and public landscaping, results in often unwanted aesthetic damage.

The degree to which woody plants are able to repair gross physical damage to their bark is quite variable across species and type of damage. Some are able to produce a callus growth which heals over the wound rapidly, but leaves a clear scar, whilst others such as oaks do not produce an extensive callus repair. Sap is sometimes produced to seal the damaged area against disease and insect intrusion.

A number of living organisms live in or on bark, including insects, fungi and other plants like mosses, algae and other vascular plants. Many of these organisms are pathogens or parasites but some also have symbiotic relationships.


==Uses==
The inner bark (phloem) of some trees is edible. In hunter-gatherer societies and in times of famine, it is harvested and used as a food source. In Scandinavia, bark bread is made from rye to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of scots pine or birch is added. The Sami people of far northern Europe use large sheets of &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot; bark that are removed in the spring, prepared and stored for use as a staple food resource. The inner bark is eaten fresh, dried or roasted.

Bark can be used as a construction material, and was used widely in pre-industrial societies. Some barks, particularly Birch bark, can be removed in long sheets and other mechanically cohesive structures, allowing the bark to be used in the construction of canoes, as the drainage layer in roofs, for shoes, backpacks, and other useful items. Bark was also used as a construction material in settler colonial societies, particularly Australia, both as exterior wall cladding and as a roofing material.

In the cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;) the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a cork product without killing the tree; in this species the bark may get very thick (e.g. more than 20 cm has been reported).

Some s have significantly different phytochemical content from other parts. Some of these phytochemicals have pesticidal, culinary, or medicinally and culturally important ethnopharmacological properties.

Bark contains strong fibres known as bast, and there is a long tradition in northern Europe of using bark from coppiced young branches of the small-leaved lime (&quot;Tilia cordata&quot;) to produce cordage and rope, used for example in the rigging of Viking Age longships.

Among the commercial products made from bark are cork, cinnamon, quinine (from the bark of Cinchona) and aspirin (from the bark of willow trees). The bark of some trees, notably oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) is a source of tannic acid, which is used in tanning. Bark chips generated as a by-product of lumber production are often used in bark mulch. Bark is important to the horticultural industry since in shredded form it is used for plants that do not thrive in ordinary soil, such as epiphytes.

Wood bark contains lignin which when pyrolyzed yields a liquid bio-oil product rich in natural phenol derivatives. These are used as a replacement for fossil-based phenols in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins used in Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and plywood.

<text>Constantine X Doukas or Ducas (, &quot;Kōnstantinos Doukas&quot;, – 23 May 1067), was Byzantine emperor from 1059 to 1067. He was the founder of the Doukid dynasty. During his reign, the Normans took over much of the remaining Byzantine territories in Italy, while in the Balkans the Hungarians occupied Belgrade. He also suffered defeats by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan.

==Reign==

Constantine&#x27;s parents are not mentioned in any primary sources, but some scholars theorize that he was the son of Andronikos Doukas, a nobleman who served as &quot;strategos&quot; of Preslav during the reign of Basil II (). Historians often give his birthdate as 1006, as he is said to have died aged &quot;slightly over sixty years&quot;. He was an academic, addicted to endless debates about philosophy and theology, and he gained influence after he married, as his second wife, Eudokia Makrembolitissa, a niece of Patriarch Michael Keroularios. In 1057, Constantine supported the usurpation of Isaac I Komnenos, gradually siding with the court bureaucracy against the new emperor&#x27;s reforms. In spite of this tacit opposition, Constantine was chosen as successor by the ailing Isaac in 1059, under the influence of Michael Psellos. Isaac abdicated on 22 November and Constantine X was crowned emperor on the following day.

The new emperor quickly associated two of his young sons in power, Michael VII Doukas and Konstantios Doukas, and appointed his brother John Doukas as &quot;kaisar&quot; (caesar), and also embarked on a policy favorable to the interests of the court bureaucracy and the church. Severely undercutting the training and financial support for the armed forces, Constantine X disbanded the Armenian local militia of 50,000 men at a crucial point of time, coinciding with the westward advance of the Seljuk Turks and their Turcoman allies. Undoing many of the necessary reforms of Isaac I Komnenos, he bloated the military bureaucracy with highly paid court officials and crowded the Senate with his supporters.

His decisions to replace standing soldiers with mercenaries and leaving the frontier fortifications unrepaired led Constantine to become naturally unpopular with the supporters of Isaac within the military aristocracy, who attempted to assassinate him in 1061. He also became unpopular with the general population after he raised taxes to try to pay the army.

At the very start of his reign, the Normans under Robert Guiscard completed the conquest of Byzantine Calabria, but Constantine showed a resurgent interest in retaining Apulia. He appointed at least two catepans of Italy (Marules and Sirianus) and sent reinforcements on two further occasions (under &quot;Miriarcha&quot; and Michael Maurex). He also suffered invasions by Alp Arslan in Asia Minor in 1064, resulting in the loss of the Armenian capital, and by the Oghuz Turks in the Balkans in 1065, while Belgrade was lost to the Hungarians.

Already old and unhealthy when he came to power, Constantine died on 23 May 1067. His final act was to demand that only his sons succeed him, forcing his wife Eudokia Makrembolitissa to take a vow not to remarry. Both Michael and Konstantios were too young to rule, so Empress Eudokia ruled as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler until 1 January 1068, when she married Romanos IV Diogenes and crowned him emperor.

==Family==

By his first wife, a daughter of Constantine Dalassenos, Constantine X Doukas had no issue.

By his second wife, Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he had the four sons and three daughters:

* Michael VII Doukas, co-emperor from 1060 and senior emperor after 1071.
* A son who died in infancy.
*Anne Doukaina, nun.
* Andronikos Doukas, co-emperor from 1068 to 1078.
* Theodora Doukaina, who married Domenico Selvo, Doge of Venice.
*Konstantios Doukas, co-emperor from 1060 to 1078, died in battle with the Normans in 1081
*Zoe Doukaina, who married Adrianos Komnenos, a brother of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. They had a son, Alexios, and two daughters, maybe named Anne and Alexia.

<text>José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (19 November 1888 – 8 March 1942) was a Cuban chess player who was the third world chess champion from 1921 to 1927. A chess prodigy, he is widely renowned for his exceptional endgame skill and speed of play.

Capablanca was born in 1888 in the Castillo del Príncipe, Havana. He beat Cuban champion Juan Corzo in a match on 17 November 1901, two days before his 13th birthday. His victory over Frank Marshall in a 1909 match earned him an invitation to the 1911 San Sebastián tournament, which he won ahead of players such as Akiba Rubinstein, Aron Nimzowitsch and Siegbert Tarrasch. Over the next several years, Capablanca had a strong series of tournament results. After several unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match with then world champion Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca finally won the world chess champion title from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated from February 10, 1916 to March 21, 1924, a period that included the world championship match with Lasker.

Capablanca lost the title in 1927 to Alexander Alekhine, who had never beaten Capablanca before the match. Following unsuccessful attempts to arrange a rematch over many years, relations between them became bitter. Capablanca continued his excellent tournament results in this period but withdrew from serious chess in 1931. He made a comeback in 1934, with good results, but also showed symptoms of high blood pressure. He died in 1942 of a brain hemorrhage.

Capablanca excelled in simple positions and endgames; Bobby Fischer described him as possessing a &quot;real light touch&quot;. He could play tactical chess when necessary, and had good defensive technique. He wrote several chess books during his career, of which &quot;Chess Fundamentals&quot; was regarded by Mikhail Botvinnik as the best chess book ever written. Capablanca preferred not to present detailed analysis but focused on critical moments in a game. His style of chess influenced the play of future world champions Bobby Fischer and Anatoly Karpov.

== Biography and career ==
=== Childhood ===

José Raúl Capablanca, the second surviving son of a Spanish army officer, José María Capablanca, and a Spanish woman from Catalonia, Matilde María Graupera y Marín, was born in Havana on 19 November 1888. According to Capablanca, he learned to play chess at the age of four by watching his father play with friends, pointed out an illegal move by his father, and then beat his father. At the age of eight he was taken to Havana Chess Club, which had hosted many important contests, but on the advice of a doctor he was not allowed to play frequently. Between November and December 1901, he narrowly beat the Cuban Chess Champion, Juan Corzo, in a match. However, in April 1902 he came in fourth out of six in the National Championship, losing both his games with Corzo. In 1905 Capablanca easily passed the entrance examinations for Columbia College (New York), where he wished to play for Columbia&#x27;s strong baseball team, and soon was starting shortstop on the freshman team. In the same year he joined the Manhattan Chess Club, and was soon recognized as the club&#x27;s strongest player. He was particularly dominant in rapid chess, winning a tournament ahead of the reigning World Chess Champion, Emanuel Lasker, in 1906. He represented Columbia on top board in intercollegiate team chess. In 1908 he left the university to concentrate on chess.

According to Columbia University, Capablanca enrolled at Columbia&#x27;s School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry in September 1910, to study chemical engineering. Later, his financial support was withdrawn because he preferred playing chess to studying engineering. He left Columbia after one semester to devote himself to chess full-time.

=== Early adult career ===

Capablanca&#x27;s skill in rapid chess lent itself to simultaneous exhibitions, and his increasing reputation in these events led to a US-wide tour in 1909. Playing 602 games in 27 cities, he scored 96.4%—a much higher percentage than, for example, Géza Maróczy&#x27;s 88% and Frank Marshall&#x27;s 86% in 1906. This performance gained him sponsorship for an exhibition match that year against Marshall, the US champion, who had won the 1904 Cambridge Springs tournament ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker and Dawid Janowski, and whom Chessmetrics ranks as one of the world&#x27;s top three players at his peak. Capablanca beat Marshall, 15–8 (8 wins, 1 loss, 14 draws)—a margin comparable to what Lasker achieved against Marshall (8 wins, no losses, 7 draws) in winning his 1907 World Championship match. After the match, Capablanca said that he had never opened a book on chess openings. Following this match, Chessmetrics rates Capablanca the world&#x27;s third strongest player for most of the period from 1909 through 1912.

Capablanca won six games and drew one in the 1910 New York State Championship. Both Capablanca and Charles Jaffe won their four games in the knock-out preliminaries and met in a match to decide the winner, who would be the first to win two games. The first game was drawn and Capablanca won the second and third games. After another grueling series of simultaneous exhibitions, Capablanca placed second, with 9½ out of 12, in the 1911 National Tournament at New York, half a point behind Marshall, and half a point ahead of Charles Jaffe and Oscar Chajes. Marshall, invited to play in a tournament at San Sebastián, Spain, in 1911, insisted that Capablanca also be allowed to play.

According to David Hooper and Ken Whyld, San Sebastián 1911 was &quot;one of the strongest five tournaments held up to that time&quot;, as all the world&#x27;s leading players competed except the World Champion, Lasker. At the beginning of the tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca&#x27;s participation because he had not fulfilled the entry condition of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments. Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round, more simply against Nimzowitsch, and astounded the chess world by taking first place, with six wins, one loss and seven draws, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Milan Vidmar, Marshall, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch, et al. His loss, to Rubinstein, was one of the most brilliant achievements of the latter&#x27;s career. Some European critics grumbled that Capablanca&#x27;s style was rather cautious, though he conceded fewer draws than any of the next six finishers in the event. Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championship.

=== World title contender ===
In 1911, Capablanca challenged Lasker for the World Chess Championship. Lasker accepted his challenge while proposing 17 conditions for the match. Capablanca objected to some of the conditions, which favored Lasker, and the match did not take place.

In 1913, Capablanca won a tournament in New York with 11/13, half a point ahead of Marshall. Capablanca then finished second to Marshall in Havana, scoring 10 out of 14 and losing one of their individual games. The 600 spectators naturally favored their native hero, but sportingly gave Marshall &quot;thunderous applause&quot;. In a tournament in New York in 1913, at the Rice Chess Club, Capablanca won all 13 games.

In September 1913, Capablanca accepted a job in the Cuban Foreign Office, which made him financially secure for life. Hooper and Whyld write, &quot;He had no specific duties, but was expected to act as a kind of ambassador-at-large, a well-known figure who would put Cuba on the map wherever he travelled.&quot; His first instructions were to go to Saint Petersburg, where he was due to play in a major tournament. On his way, he gave simultaneous exhibitions in London, Paris and Berlin, where he also played two-game matches against Richard Teichmann and Jacques Mieses, winning all four games. In Saint Petersburg, he played similar matches against Alexander Alekhine, Eugene Znosko-Borovsky and Fyodor Duz-Chotimirsky, losing one game to Znosko-Borovsky and winning the rest.

The St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was the first in which Capablanca confronted Lasker under tournament conditions. This event was arranged in an unusual way: after a preliminary single round-robin tournament involving 11 players, the top five were to play a second stage in double round-robin format, with total scores from the preliminary tournament carried forward to the second contest. Capablanca placed first in the preliminary tournament, 1½ points ahead of Lasker, who was out of practice and had made a shaky start. Despite a determined effort by Lasker, Capablanca still seemed on course for ultimate victory. But in their second game of the final, Lasker reduced Capablanca to a helpless position and Capablanca was so shaken by this that he blundered away his next game to Tarrasch. Lasker then won his final game, against Marshall, thus finishing half a point ahead of Capablanca and 3½ ahead of Alekhine.
Alekhine commented:

His real, incomparable gifts first began to make themselves known at the time of St. Petersburg, 1914, when I too came to know him personally. Neither before nor afterwards have I seen—and I cannot imagine as well—such a flabbergasting quickness of chess comprehension as that possessed by the Capablanca of that epoch. Enough to say that he gave &quot;all&quot; the St. Petersburg masters the odds of 5–1 in quick games—and won! With all this he was always good-humoured, the darling of the ladies, and enjoyed wonderful good health—really a dazzling appearance. That he came second to Lasker must be entirely ascribed to his youthful levity—he was already playing as well as Lasker.

After the breakdown of his attempt to negotiate a title match in 1911, Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed to by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games, whichever the champion preferred; and the stake should be at least £1,000 (worth about £26,000 or $44,000 in 2013 terms).

=== During World War I ===
World War I began in midsummer 1914, bringing international chess to a virtual halt for more than four years. Capablanca won tournaments in New York in 1914, 1915, 1916 (with preliminary and final round-robin stages) and 1918, losing only one game in this sequence. In the 1918 event, Marshall, playing Black against Capablanca, unleashed a complicated counterattack, later known as the Marshall Attack, against the Ruy Lopez opening. It is often said that Marshall had kept this secret for use against Capablanca since his defeat in their 1909 match; however, Edward Winter discovered several games between 1910 and 1918 where Marshall passed up opportunities to use the Marshall Attack against Capablanca; and an 1893 game that used a similar line. This gambit is so complex that Garry Kasparov used to avoid it, and Marshall had the advantage of using a . Nevertheless, Capablanca found a way through the complications and won. Capablanca was challenged to a match in 1919 by Borislav Kostić, who had come through the 1918 tournament undefeated to take second place. The match was to go to the first player to win eight games, but Kostić resigned the match after losing the first five. Capablanca considered that he was at his strongest around this time.

=== World Champion ===

The Hastings Victory tournament of 1919 was the first international competition on Allied soil since 1914. The field was not strong, and Capablanca won with 10½ points out of 11, one point ahead of Kostić.

In January 1920, Lasker and Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted that if he resigned the title, then Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein&#x27;s. Lasker then resigned the title to Capablanca on 27 June 1920, saying, &quot;You have earned the title not by the formality of a challenge, but by your brilliant mastery.&quot; When Cuban enthusiasts raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played in Havana, Lasker agreed in August 1920 to play there, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming it.

The match was played in March–April 1921; Lasker resigned it after 14 games, having lost four and won none. Reuben Fine and Harry Golombek attributed the one-sided result to Lasker&#x27;s mysteriously poor form. Fred Reinfeld mentioned speculations that Havana&#x27;s humid climate weakened Lasker and that he was depressed about the outcome of World War I, especially as he had lost his life savings. On the other hand, Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an &quot;even and fascinating fight&quot; until Lasker blundered in the last game. Kramnik explained that Capablanca was 20 years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.

Edward Winter, after a lengthy summary of the facts, concludes, &quot;The press was dismissive of Lasker&#x27;s wish to confer the title on Capablanca, even questioning the legality of such an initiative, and in 1921 it regarded the Cuban as having become world champion by dint of defeating Lasker over the board.&quot; Reference works invariably give Capablanca&#x27;s reign as titleholder as beginning in 1921, not 1920.
Capablanca won the London tournament of 1922 with 13 points in 15 games with no losses, ahead of Alekhine with 11½, Milan Vidmar (11), and Akiba Rubinstein (10½). During this event, Capablanca proposed the &quot;London Rules&quot; to regulate future World Championship negotiations: the first player to win six games would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to 5 hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2½ hours; the champion must defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than US$10,000 (about $260,000 in 2006 terms); 20% of the purse was to be paid to the title holder and the remainder divided, 60% to the winner of the match, and 40% to the loser; the highest purse bid must be accepted. Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubow, Géza Maróczy, Richard Réti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them. Between 1921 and 1923 Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine could raise the money, in 1927.

In 1922, Capablanca had also given a simultaneous exhibition in Cleveland against 103 opponents, the largest in history up to that time, winning 102 and drawing one—setting a record for the best winning percentage ever in a large simultaneous exhibition.

After beginning with four draws, followed by a loss, Capablanca placed second at the New York 1924 chess tournament with the score of 14½/20 (+10−1=9), 1½ points behind Lasker, and 2½ ahead of third-placed Alekhine. Capablanca&#x27;s defeat by Réti in the fifth round was his first in serious competition in eight years. He made another bad start at the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, and could only fight back to third place, two points behind Bogoljubow and ½ point behind Lasker. Capablanca won at Lake Hopatcong, 1926 with 6 points out of 8, ahead of Abraham Kupchik (5) and Maroczy (4½).

A group of Argentinian businessmen, backed by a guarantee from the president of Argentina, promised the funds for a World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine in 1927. Since Nimzowitsch had challenged before Alekhine, Capablanca gave Nimzowitsch until 1 January 1927, to provide a deposit in order to arrange a match. When this did not materialize, a Capablanca–Alekhine match was agreed, to begin in September 1927.

In the New York 1927 chess tournament, held from 19 February to 23 March 1927, six of the world&#x27;s strongest masters played a quadruple round-robin, with the others being Alekhine, Rudolf Spielmann, Milan Vidmar, Nimzowitsch and Marshall, with Bogoljubow and Lasker absent. Before the tournament, Capablanca wrote that he had &quot;more experience but less power&quot; than in 1911, that he had peaked in 1919 and that some of his competitors had become stronger in the meantime. But Capablanca had overwhelming success: he finished undefeated with 14/20, winning the mini-matches with each of his rivals, 2½ points ahead of second-place Alekhine, and won the &quot;best game&quot; prize for a win over Spielmann.

In December 1921, shortly after becoming World Champion, Capablanca married Gloria Simoni Betancourt. They had a son, José Raúl Jr., in 1923 and a daughter, Gloria, in 1925. According to Capablanca&#x27;s second wife, Olga, his first marriage broke down fairly soon, and he and Gloria had affairs. Both his parents died during his reign, his father in 1923 and mother in 1926.

=== Losing the title ===

Since Capablanca had won the New York 1927 chess tournament overwhelmingly and had never lost a game to Alekhine, most pundits regarded the Cuban as the clear favorite in their World Chess Championship 1927 match. But Alekhine won the match, played from September to November 1927 at Buenos Aires, by 6 wins, 3 losses, and 25 draws—the longest formal World Championship match until the contest in 1984–85 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov. Alekhine&#x27;s victory surprised almost the entire chess world. After Capablanca&#x27;s death, Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory, since in 1927 he had not thought he was superior to Capablanca, and he suggested that Capablanca had been overconfident. Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation, while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition and had thoroughly studied Capablanca&#x27;s play. According to Kasparov, Alekhine&#x27;s research uncovered many small inaccuracies, which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely. Vladimir Kramnik commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins. Luděk Pachman suggested that Capablanca, who was unaccustomed to losing games or to any other type of setback, became depressed over his unnecessary loss of the 11th game in a grueling endgame featuring errors by both players. The match became somewhat notorious for its extremely lopsided use of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined; all games after the first two used this opening, and Capablanca&#x27;s defeat has been partially attributed to his unwillingness to attempt any other openings.

Immediately after winning the match, Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a rematch, on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion—the challenger must provide a stake of US$10,000, of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated. Alekhine had challenged Capablanca in the early 1920s, but Alekhine could not raise the money until 1927. After Capablanca&#x27;s death, Alekhine wrote that Capablanca&#x27;s demand for a $10,000 stake was an attempt to avoid challenges. Negotiations dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Their relationship became bitter, and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played.

===Post-championship and partial retirement===

After losing the World Championship in late 1927, Capablanca played more often in tournaments, hoping to strengthen his claim for a rematch. From 1928 through 1931, he won six first prizes, also finishing second twice and one joint second. His competitors included rising stars such as Max Euwe and Isaac Kashdan, as well as players who had been established in the 1920s, but Capablanca and Alekhine never played in the same tournament during this period, and next met only at the Nottingham 1936 tournament, after Alekhine had lost the world title to Euwe the previous year. In late 1931, Capablanca also won a match (+2−0=8) against Euwe, whom Chessmetrics ranks sixth in the world at the time.

Despite these excellent results, Capablanca&#x27;s play showed signs of decline: his play slowed from the speed of his youth, with occasional time trouble; he continued to produce many superb games, but also made some gross blunders. Chessmetrics nonetheless ranks Capablanca as the second strongest player in the world (after Alekhine) from his loss of the title through to autumn 1932, except for a brief appearance in the top place.

Alekhine&#x27;s offer to play Capablanca in a rematch if $10,000 could be raised came to naught due to the Great Depression. After winning an event at New York in 1931, he withdrew from serious chess, perhaps disheartened by his inability to secure a rematch with Alekhine, and played only less serious games at the Manhattan Chess Club and . On 6 December 1933, Capablanca won all 9 of his games in one of the club&#x27;s weekly rapid chess tournaments, finishing 2 points ahead of Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine and Milton Hanauer.

It is from this period that the only surviving voiced film footage survives. He is with Euwe and Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander. Hollander asks Capablanca for his views on the upcoming world Championship match between Euwe and Alekhine in October of that year (1935). Capablanca replies: &quot;Dr. Alekhine&#x27;s game is 20% bluff. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game is clear and straightforward. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game—not so strong as Alekhine&#x27;s in some respects—is more evenly balanced.&quot; Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch, explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism, but in the previous ten years, their score had been evenly matched at 7–7.

=== Return to competitive chess ===
At first Capablanca did not divorce his first wife, as he had not intended to remarry. Olga, Capablanca&#x27;s second wife, wrote that she met him in the late spring of 1934; by late October the pair were deeply in love, and Capablanca recovered his ambition to prove he was the world&#x27;s best player. In 1938 he divorced his first wife and married Olga on 20 October, about a month before the AVRO tournament.

Starting his comeback at the Hastings tournament of 1934–35, Capablanca finished fourth, although coming ahead of Mikhail Botvinnik and Andor Lilienthal. He placed second by ½ point in the Margate tournaments of 1935 and 1936. At Moscow 1935 Capablanca finished fourth, 1 point behind the joint winners, while Lasker&#x27;s third place at the age of 66 was hailed as &quot;a biological miracle.&quot; The following year, Capablanca won an even stronger tournament in Moscow, one point ahead of Botvinnik and 3½ ahead of Salo Flohr, who took third place; A month later, he shared first place with Botvinnik at Nottingham, with a score of (+5−1=8), losing only to Flohr. The loss to Flohr was because of being disturbed while in time trouble by the bystander Euwe. Alekhine placed sixth, only one point behind the joint winners. These tournaments of 1936 were the last two Lasker played, and the only ones in which Capablanca finished ahead of Lasker, now 67. During these triumphs Capablanca began to suffer symptoms of high blood pressure. He tied for second place at Semmering in 1937, then could only finish seventh of the eight players at the 1938 AVRO tournament, an elite contest designed to select a challenger for Alekhine&#x27;s world title.

Capablanca&#x27;s high blood pressure was not correctly diagnosed and treated until after the AVRO tournament, and caused him to lose his train of thought towards the end of playing sessions. In 1940, he had extremely dangerous hypertension of 210 systolic/180 diastolic (hypertensive crisis is 180/120 or above, and even after treatment Capablanca had 180/130).

After winning at Paris in 1938 and placing second in a slightly stronger tournament at Margate in 1939, Capablanca played for Cuba in the 8th Chess Olympiad, in Buenos Aires, and won the gold medal for the best performance on the . While Capablanca and Alekhine were both representing their countries in Buenos Aires, Capablanca made a final attempt to arrange a World Championship match. Alekhine declined, saying he was obliged to be available to defend his adopted homeland, France, as World War II had just broken out. Capablanca announced in advance that he would not play Alekhine if their teams met.

===Death===
Not long before his death, his familial hypertension had shot up to the hazardous 200–240/160+. The day before his fatal stroke, his vascular specialist Dr. Schwarzer strongly advised him that his life was endangered unless he totally relaxed, but Capablanca said that he could not because his ex-wife and children had started court proceedings against him. The doctor blamed his death on &quot;his troubles and aggravation&quot;.

On 7 March 1942, Capablanca was observing a game and chatting with friends at the Manhattan Chess Club in New York City, when he asked for help removing his coat, and collapsed shortly afterward. Eminent physician Eli Moschcowitz administered first aid and then arranged an ambulance. He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he died at 6:00 AM the next day. Emanuel Lasker had died in the same hospital only a year earlier. The cause of death was given as &quot;a cerebral hemorrhage provoked by hypertension&quot;, in particular a hypertensive thalamic hemorrhage. The hospital admissions report stated:

When admitted to Mt. Sinai Hospital, the examination showed: Patient critically ill in deep coma, unreceptive to nocioceptive stimuli, unequal pupils with the left one dilated (fixed and unresponsive to light), left facial palsy, left hemiplegia, globally depressed tendinous reflexes and arterial tension 280/140. A lumbar puncture was performed which showed hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a pressure of 500 mm of water.

The full autopsy, by Drs. Moschcowitz, Prill, and Levin, showed that the right thalamus was almost totally destroyed, and in its place was a hematoma 2 inches wide and 2 inches high. The whole ventricular system and cisterna magna were flooded with blood. The gyri were flattened and sulci narrowed, consistent with years of extreme hypertension. His heart was enlarged, 575 g instead of the normal 300–350 g, including 3 cm hypertrophy of left ventricle wall. This wall had a number of subendiocardial hemorrhages, which was later proved to be common in patients with severe intercranial hypertension. This caused the release of a large amount of vasoactive substances into the bloodstream, including acetylcholine and noradrenaline that caused these hemorrhages.

The lumbar puncture was a bad idea, as intracranial hypertension is now a well-known contraindication because it releases the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid counteracting the herniating force of the hypertension. But neurosurgeon Orlando Hernández-Meilán has said that it made no difference, as Capablanca could not have been revived even if the best modern medicine had been available.

Capablanca was given a public funeral in Havana&#x27;s Colón Cemetery on 15 March 1942.

====Tributes====

Alekhine wrote in a tribute to Capablanca: &quot;Capablanca was snatched from the chess world much too soon. With his death, we have lost a very great chess genius whose like we shall never see again.&quot; Lasker once said: &quot;I have known many chess players, but only one chess genius: Capablanca.&quot;

An annual Capablanca Memorial tournament has been held in Cuba, most often in Havana, since 1962.

==Assessment==

===Playing strength and style===

As an adult, Capablanca lost only 34 serious games. He was undefeated from 10 February 1916, when he lost to Oscar Chajes in the New York 1916 tournament, to 21 March 1924, when he lost to Richard Réti in the New York International tournament. During this streak, which included his 1921 World Championship match against Lasker, Capablanca played 63 games, winning 40 and drawing 23. In fact, only Marshall, Lasker, Alekhine and Rudolf Spielmann won two or more serious games from the mature Capablanca, though in each case, their overall lifetime scores were minus (Capablanca beat Marshall +20−2=28, Lasker +6−2=16, Alekhine +9−7=33), except for Spielmann who was level (+2−2=8). Of top players, only Keres had a narrow plus score against him (+1−0=5). Keres&#x27;s win was at the AVRO 1938 chess tournament, during which tournament Capablanca turned 50, while Keres was 22.

Statistical ranking systems place Capablanca high among the greatest players of all time. Nathan Divinsky and Raymond Keene&#x27;s book &quot;Warriors of the Mind&quot; (1989) ranks him fifth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Botvinnik—and immediately ahead of Emanuel Lasker. In his 1978 book &quot;The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present&quot;, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Capablanca was the strongest of those surveyed, with Lasker and Botvinnik sharing second place. Chessmetrics (2005) is rather sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, and ranks Capablanca between third and fourth strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to 15 years. Its author, the statistician Jeff Sonas, concluded that Capablanca had more years in the top three than anyone except Lasker, Karpov and Kasparov—though Alekhine had more years in the top two positions. A 2006 study found that Capablanca was the most accurate of all the World Champions when compared with computer analysis of World Championship match games. This analysis was criticized for using a second-rank chess program, &quot;Crafty&quot;, modified to limit its calculations to six moves by each side, and for favoring players whose style matched that of the program; however a 2011 computer analysis by Bratko and Guid using the stronger engines Rybka 2 and Rybka 3 found similar results to the 2006 Crafty analysis for Capablanca.

Boris Spassky, World Champion from 1969 to 1972, considered Capablanca the best player of all time. Bobby Fischer, who held the title from 1972 to 1975, admired Capablanca&#x27;s &quot;light touch&quot; and ability to see the right move very quickly. Fischer reported that in the 1950s, older members of the Manhattan Chess Club spoke of Capablanca&#x27;s performances with awe.

Capablanca excelled in simple positions and endgames, and his positional judgment was outstanding, so much so that most attempts to attack him came to grief without any apparent defensive efforts on his part. But he could play great tactical chess when necessary—most famously in the 1918 Manhattan Chess Club Championship tournament, when Marshall sprang a deeply analyzed on him, which he refuted while playing under the normal time limit (although ways have since been found to strengthen the Marshall Attack). He was also capable of using aggressive tactical play to drive home a positional advantage, provided he considered it safe and the most efficient way to win, for example against Spielmann in the 1927 New York tournament.

===Influence on the game===
Capablanca did not found any school &quot;per se&quot;, but his style influenced world champions Fischer, Karpov, and Botvinnik. Alekhine received schooling from Capablanca in positional play before their fight for the world title made them bitter enemies.

As a chess writer, Capablanca did not present large amounts of detailed analysis, instead focusing on the critical moments in a game. His writing style was plain and easy to understand. Botvinnik regarded Capablanca&#x27;s book &quot;Chess Fundamentals&quot; as the best chess book ever written. Capablanca in a lecture and in his book &quot;A Primer of Chess&quot; pointed out that while the bishop was usually stronger than the knight, queen and knight was usually better than queen and bishop, especially in endings—the bishop merely mimics the queen&#x27;s diagonal move, while the knight can immediately reach squares the queen cannot. Research is divided over Capablanca&#x27;s conclusion: in 2007, Glenn Flear found little difference, while in 1999, Larry Kaufman, analysing a large database of games, concluded that results very slightly favored queen plus knight. John Watson wrote in 1998 that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages in that specific game.

===Personality===
Early in his chess career, Capablanca received some criticism, mainly in Britain, for the allegedly conceited description of his accomplishments in his first book, &quot;My Chess Career&quot;. He therefore took the unprecedented step of including virtually all of his tournament and match defeats up to that time in &quot;Chess Fundamentals&quot;, together with an instructive group of his victories. Nevertheless, his preface to the 1934 edition of &quot;Chess Fundamentals&quot; is confident that the &quot;reader may therefore go over the contents of the book with the assurance that there is in it everything he needs.&quot; Julius du Mont wrote that he knew Capablanca well and could vouch that he was not conceited. In du Mont&#x27;s opinion, critics should understand the difference between the merely gifted and the towering genius of Capablanca, and the contrast between the British tendency towards modesty and the Latin and American tendency to say &quot;I played this game as well as it could be played&quot; if he honestly thought that was true. Capablanca himself said, in his author&#x27;s note prefacing &quot;My Chess Career&quot;: &quot;Conceit I consider a foolish thing, but more foolish still is the false modesty that vainly attempts to conceal which all facts tend to prove.&quot; Fischer also admired this frankness. Du Mont also said that Capablanca was rather sensitive to criticism, and chess historian Edward Winter documented a number of examples of self-criticism in &quot;My Chess Career&quot;.
Despite his achievements Capablanca appeared more interested in baseball than in chess, which he described as &quot;not a difficult game to learn and it is an enjoyable game to play.&quot; His second wife, Olga, thought he resented that chess had dominated his life, and wished he could have studied music or medicine.

==Capablanca chess==
In an interview in 1925, Capablanca denied reports that he thought chess had already currently reached its limit because it was easy for top players to obtain a draw. He was concerned, however, that the accelerating development of chess technique and opening knowledge might cause such stagnation in 50 years. Hence, he suggested the adoption of a 10×8 board with two extra pieces per side:
* a chancellor that combines the movements of a rook and a knight;
* an archbishop that combines the movements of a bishop and a knight. This piece would be able to deliver checkmate on its own, which none of the conventional pieces can do, but checkmate cannot be forced without the help of its own king. He thought this would prevent technical knowledge from becoming such a dominant factor, at least for a few centuries.

Capablanca and Edward Lasker experimented with 10×10 and 10×8 boards, using the same expanded set of pieces. They preferred the 8- version as it encouraged combat to start earlier, and their games typically lasted 20 to 25 moves. Contrary to the claims of some critics, Capablanca proposed this variant while he was world champion, not as sour grapes after losing his title.

Similar 10×8 variants had previously been described in 1617 by Pietro Carrera and in 1874 by Henry Bird, differing only in how the new pieces were placed in each side&#x27;s back row. Subsequent variants inspired by Capablanca&#x27;s experimentation have been proposed, including Grand Chess (a 10×10 board with pawns on the third rank) and Embassy Chess (the Grand Chess setup on a 10×8 board).

<text>Silt is granular material of a size between sand and clay and composed mostly of broken grains of quartz. Silt may occur as a soil (often mixed with sand or clay) or as sediment mixed in suspension with water. Silt usually has a floury feel when dry, and lacks plasticity when wet. Silt can also be felt by the tongue as granular when placed on the front teeth (even when mixed with clay particles).

Silt is a common material, making up 45% of average modern mud. It is found in many river deltas and as wind-deposited accumulations, particularly in central Asia, north China, and North America. It is produced in both very hot climates (through such processes as collisions of quartz grains in dust storms) and very cold climates (through such processes as glacial grinding of quartz grains.)

Loess is soil rich in silt which makes up some of the most fertile agricultural land on Earth. However, silt is very vulnerable to erosion, and it has poor mechanical properties, making construction on silty soil problematic. The failure of the Teton Dam in 1976 has been attributed to the use of unsuitable loess in the dam core, and liquefication of silty soil is a significant earthquake hazard. Windblown and waterborne silt are significant forms of environmental pollution, often exacerbated by poor farming practices.

==Description==
Silt is detritus (fragments of weathered and eroded rock) with properties intermediate between sand and clay. A more precise definition of silt used by geologists is that it is detrital particles with sizes between 1/256 and 1/16 mm (about 4 to 63 microns). This corresponds to particles between 8 and 4 phi units on the Krumbein phi scale. Other geologists define silt as detrital particles between 2 and 63 microns or 9 to 4 phi units. A third definition is that silt is fine-grained detrital material composed of quartz rather than clay minerals. Since most clay mineral particles are smaller than 2 microns, while most detrital particles between 2 and 63 microns in size are composed of broken quartz grains, there is good agreement between these definitions in practice.

The upper size limit of 1/16 mm or 63 microns corresponds to the smallest particles that can be discerned with the unaided eye. It also corresponds to a &quot;Tanner gap&quot; in the distribution of particle sizes in sediments: Particles between 120 and 30 microns in size are scarce in most sediments, suggesting that the distinction between sand and silt has physical significance. As noted above, the lower limit of 2 to 4 microns corresponds to the transition from particles that are predominantly broken quartz grains to particles that are predominantly clay mineral particles.

Assallay and coinvestigators further divide silt into three size ranges: C (2–5 microns), which represents post-glacial clays and desert dust; D1 (20–30 microns) representing &quot;traditional&quot; loess; and D2 (60 microns) representing the very coarse North African loess.

Silt can be distinguished from clay in the field by its lack of plasticity or cohesiveness and by its grain size. Silt grains are large enough to give silt a gritty feel, particularly if a sample is placed between the teeth. Clay-size particles feel smooth between the teeth. The proportions of coarse and fine silt in a sediment sample are determined more precisely in the laboratory using the pipette method, which is based on settling rate via Stokes&#x27; law and gives the particle size distribution accordingly. The mineral composition of silt particles can be determined with a petrographic microscope for grain sizes as low as 10 microns.

&quot;Vadose silt&quot; is silt-sized calcite crystals found in pore spaces and vugs in limestone. This is emplaced as sediment is carried through the vadose zone to be deposited in pore space.

=== Definitions ===
ASTM American Standard of Testing Materials: 200 sieve – 0.005 mm.

USDA United States Department of Agriculture 0.05–0.002 mm.

ISSS International Society of Soil Science 0.02–0.002 mm.

Civil engineers in the United States define silt as material made of particles that pass a number 200 sieve (0.074 mm or less) but show little plasticity when wet and little cohesion when air-dried. The International Society of Soil Science (ISSS) defines silt as soil containing 80% or more of particles between 0.002 mm to 0.02 mm in size while the U.S. Department of Agriculture puts the cutoff at 0.05mm. The term &quot;silt&quot; is also used informally for material containing much sand and clay as well as silt-sized particles, or for mud suspended in water.

==Occurrence==
Silt is a very common material, and it has been estimated that there are a billion trillion trillion (1033) silt grains worldwide. Silt is abundant in eolian and alluvial deposits, including river deltas, such as the Nile and Niger River deltas. Bangladesh is largely underlain by silt deposits of the Ganges delta. Silt is also abundant in northern China, central Asia, and North America. However, silt is relatively uncommon in the tropical regions of the world.

Silt is commonly found in suspension in river water, and it makes up over 0.2% of river sand. It is abundant in the matrix between the larger sand grains of graywackes. Modern mud has an average silt content of 45%. Silt is often found in mudrock as thin laminae, as clumps, or dispersed throughout the rock. Laminae suggest deposition in a weak current that winnows the silt of clay, while clumps suggest an origin as fecal pellets. Where silt is dispersed throughout the mudrock, it likely was deposited by rapid processes, such as flocculation. Sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt is known as siltstone.

Silt is common throughout the geologic record, but it seems to be particularly common in Quaternary formations. This may be because deposition of silt is favored by the glaciation and arctic conditions characteristic of the Quaternary. Silt is sometimes known as &quot;rock flour&quot; or &quot;glacier meal&quot;, especially when produced by glacial action. Silt suspended in water draining from glaciers is sometimes known as &quot;rock milk&quot; or &quot;moonmilk&quot;.

== Sources ==

A simple explanation for silt formation is that it is a straightforward continuation to a smaller scale of the disintegration of rock into gravel and sand. However, the presence of a Tanner gap between sand and silt (a scarcity of particles with sizes between 30 and 120 microns) suggests that different physical processes produce sand and silt. The mechanisms of silt formation have been studied extensively in the laboratory and compared with field observations. These show that silt formation requires high-energy processes acting over long periods of time, but such processes are present in diverse geologic settings.

Quartz silt grains are usually found to have a platy or bladed shape. This may be characteristic of how larger grains abrade, or reflect the shape of small quartz grains in foliated metamorphic rock, or arise from authigenic growth of quartz grains parallel to bedding in sedimentary rock. Theoretically, particles formed by random fracturing of an isotropic material, such as quartz, naturally tend to be blade-shaped. The size of silt grains produced by abrasion or shattering of larger grains may reflect defects in the crystal structure of the quartz, known as &quot;Moss defects.&quot; Such defects are produced by tectonic deformation of the parent rock, and also arise from the high-low transition of quartz: Quartz experiences a sharp decrease in volume when it cools below a temperature of about , which creates strain and crystal defects in the quartz grains in a cooling body of granite.

Mechanisms for silt production include:
* Erosion of initially silt-sized grains from low-grade metamorphic rock.
* Production of silt-sized grains from fracture of larger grains during initial rock weathering and soil formation, through processes such as frost shattering and haloclasty. This produces silt particles whose size of 10–30 microns is determined by Moss defects.
* Production of silt-sized grains from grain-to-grain impact during transport of coarser sediments.
* Formation of authigenic quartz during weathering to clay.
* Crystallization of the tests of siliceous organisms deposited in mudrock.

Laboratory experiments have produced contradictory results regarding the effectiveness of various silt production mechanisms. This may be due to the use of vein or pegmatite quartz in some of the experiments. Both materials form under conditions promoting ideal crystal growth, and may lack the Moss defects of quartz grains in granites. Thus production of silt from vein quartz is very difficult by any mechanism, whereas production of silt from granite quartz proceeds readily by any of a number of mechanisms. However, the main process is likely abrasion through transport, including fluvial comminution, aeolian attrition and glacial grinding.

Because silt deposits (such as &quot;loess&quot;, a soil composed mostly of silt) seem to be associated with glaciated or mountainous regions in Asia and North America, much emphasis has been placed on glacial grinding as a source of silt. High Asia has been identified as a major generator of silt, which accumulated to form the fertile soils of north India and Bangladesh, and the loess of central Asia and north China. Loess has long been thought to be absent or rare in deserts lacking nearby mountains (Sahara, Australia). However, laboratory experiments show eolian and fluvial processes can be quite efficient at producing silt, as can weathering in tropical climates. Silt seems to be produced in great quantities in dust storms, and silt deposits found in Israel, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia cannot be attributed to glaciation. Furthermore, desert source areas in Asia may be more important for loess formation than previously thought. Part of the problem may be the conflation of high rates of production with environments conducive to deposition and preservation, which favors glacial climates more than deserts.

Loess associated with glaciation and cold weathering may be distinguishable from loess associated with hot regions by the size distribution. Glacial loess has a typical particle size of about 25 microns. Desert loess contains either larger or smaller particles, with the fine silt produced in dust storms and the coarse silt fraction possibly representing the fine particle tail of sand production.

==Human impact==
Loess underlies some of the most productive agricultural land worldwide. However, it is very susceptible to erosion. The quartz particles in silt do not themselves provide nutrients, but they promote excellent soil structure, and silt-sized particles of other minerals, present in smaller amounts, provide the necessary nutrients. Silt, deposited by annual floods along the Nile River, created the rich, fertile soil that sustained the Ancient Egyptian civilization. The closure of the Aswan High Dam has cut off this source of silt, and the fertility of the Nile delta is deteriorating.

Loess tends to lose strength when wetted, and this can lead to failure of building foundations. The silty material has an open structure that collapses when wet. Quick clay (a combination of very fine silt and clay-sized particles from glacial grinding) is a particular challenge for civil engineering.

The failure of the Teton Dam has been attributed to the use of loess from the Snake River floodplain in the core of the dam. Loess lacks the necessary plasticity for use in a dam core, but its properties were poorly understood, even by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, with its wealth of experience building earthen dams.

Silt is susceptible to liquefaction during strong earthquakes due to its lack of plasticity. This has raised concerns about the earthquake damage potential in the silty soil of the central United States in the event of a major earthquake in the New Madrid Seismic Zone.

== Environmental impacts ==

Silt is easily transported in water and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air in the form of dust. While the coarsest silt particles (60 micron) settle out of a meter of still water in just five minutes, the finest silt grains (2 microns) can take several days to settle out of still water. When silt appears as a pollutant in water the phenomenon is known as siltation.

Silt deposited by the Mississippi River throughout the 20th century has decreased due to a system of levees, contributing to the disappearance of protective wetlands and barrier islands in the delta region surrounding New Orleans.

In southeast Bangladesh, in the Noakhali district, cross dams were built in the 1960s whereby silt gradually started forming new land called &quot;chars&quot;. The district of Noakhali has gained more than of land in the past 50 years. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop older chars in the late 1970s, and the effort has since become a multi-agency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some to 21,000 families.

A main source of silt in urban rivers is disturbance of soil by construction activity. A main source in rural rivers is erosion from plowing of farm fields, clearcutting or slash and burn treatment of forests.

== Culture ==
The fertile black silt of the Nile river&#x27;s banks is a symbol of rebirth, associated with the Egyptian god Anubis.

<text>Colin Andrew Firth (born 10 September 1960) is an English actor and producer. He is the recipient of several accolades, including an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2011, Firth was appointed a CBE for his services to drama, and appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world.

Identified in the mid-1980s with the &quot;Brit Pack&quot; of rising young British actors, he had leading roles in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1987), &quot;Tumbledown&quot; (1988) and &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989). His portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 1995 television adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; led to widespread attention and roles in more prominent films such as &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002), and &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003). He starred as Mark Darcy in the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; film series (2001–2025), and also acted in the musical comedy &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008) and its 2018 sequel.

Firth won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of King George VI in the historical drama &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010). He was previously Oscar-nominated for playing a grieving gay man in the romantic drama &quot;A Single Man&quot; (2009), which earned him the BAFTA Award and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He subsequently played secret agent Harry Hart in &quot;&quot; (2014) and . He also performed in films such as &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (2011), &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018), &quot;1917&quot; (2019), &quot;Supernova&quot; (2020), and &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot; (2021). For his roles on television, he received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his portrayals of Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart in the BBC film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001), and Michael Peterson in the HBO limited series &quot;The Staircase&quot; (2022).

In 2012, he founded the production company Raindog Films, under which he served as a producer for &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; (2015) and &quot;Loving&quot; (2016). His films have grossed more than $3 billion from 42 releases worldwide. Firth has campaigned for the rights of Indigenous people and is a member of Survival International. He has also campaigned on issues of asylum seekers, refugees&#x27; rights and the environment. He commissioned and co-authored a scientific paper on a study of the differences in brain structure between people of differing political orientations.

== Early life and education ==
Firth was born in the village of Grayshott, Hampshire, to parents who were academics and teachers. His mother, Shirley Jean (&quot;née&quot; Rolles), was a comparative religion lecturer at King Alfred&#x27;s College (now the University of Winchester); and his father, David Norman Lewis Firth, was a history lecturer at King Alfred&#x27;s and education officer for the Nigerian government. Firth is the eldest of three children; his sister Kate is an actress and voice coach, and his brother Jonathan is also an actor. His maternal grandparents were Congregationalist ministers and his paternal grandfather was an Anglican priest. They did overseas missionary work, and both of his parents were born and spent part of their childhoods in India.

As a child, Firth frequently travelled due to his parents&#x27; work, spending some years in Nigeria. He also lived in St. Louis, Missouri, when he was 11, which he has described as &quot;a difficult time&quot;. On returning to England, he attended the Montgomery of Alamein Secondary School (now Kings&#x27; School, Winchester), which at the time was a state comprehensive school in Winchester, Hampshire. He was still an outsider and the target of bullying. To counter this, he adopted the local working-class Hampshire accent and copied his schoolmates&#x27; lack of interest in schoolwork.

Firth began attending drama workshops at age 10, and by 14 had decided to be a professional actor. Until further education, he was not academically inclined, later saying in an interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like school. I just thought it was boring and mediocre and nothing they taught me seemed to be of any interest at all.&quot; However, at Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Eastleigh, he was imbued with a love of English literature by an enthusiastic teacher, Penny Edwards, and has said that his two years there were among the happiest of his life.

After his sixth form years, Firth moved to London and joined the National Youth Theatre, where he made many contacts and got a job in the wardrobe department at the National Theatre. He subsequently studied at Drama Centre London.

== Career ==
=== 1983–1995: Early work and breakthrough ===
Firth played Hamlet in the Drama Centre end-of-year production, and in 1984, Firth made his film debut as Tommy Judd, Guy Bennett&#x27;s straight, Marxist school friend in the screen adaptation of the play Another Country (with Rupert Everett as Guy Bennett). It was the start of a longstanding public feud between Firth and Everett, which was eventually resolved. He starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in &quot;Lost Empires&quot; (1986), a TV adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s novel.

In 1987, Firth and other up-and-coming British actors such as Tim Roth, Bruce Payne and Paul McGann were dubbed the &#x27;Brit Pack&#x27;. That year, he appeared with Kenneth Branagh in the film version of J. L. Carr&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. Sheila Johnston observed a theme in his early work of playing those traumatised by war. He portrayed real-life British soldier Robert Lawrence MC in the 1988 BBC dramatisation &quot;Tumbledown&quot;. Lawrence was severely injured at the Battle of Mount Tumbledown during the Falklands War, and the film details his struggles to adjust to his disability whilst confronted with indifference from the government and public. It attracted controversy at the time, with criticism coming from left and right sides of the political spectrum. Despite this, the performance brought Firth a Royal TV Society Best Actor Award, and a nomination for the 1989 BAFTA Television Award. In 1989, he played the title role in Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Valmont&quot;, based on &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;. Released just a year after &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, it did not make a big impact in comparison. That year he also played a paranoid, socially awkward character in the Argentinian psychological thriller &quot;Apartment Zero&quot;.

Firth finally became a British household name through his role as the aloof, haughty aristocrat Mr. Darcy in the 1995 BBC television adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Producer Sue Birtwistle&#x27;s first choice for the part, he was eventually persuaded to take it despite his unfamiliarity with Austen&#x27;s writing. He and co-star Jennifer Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming, which received media attention only after their separation. Sheila Johnston wrote that Firth&#x27;s approach to the part &quot;lent Darcy complex shades of coldness, even caddishness, in the early episodes&quot;. The series was an international success and unexpectedly elevated Firth to stardomin some part due to a scene not from the novel, where he emerges from a lake swim in a wet shirt. Although he did not mind being recognised as &quot;a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal&quot; in a role that &quot;officially turned him into a heart-throb&quot;, he expressed the wish not to be associated with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; forever. He was, therefore, reluctant to accept similar roles and risk becoming typecast.

===1996–2008: Romance and ensemble films ===
For a time, it did seem as if Mr. Darcy would overshadow the rest of Firth&#x27;s career, and there were humorous allusions to the role in his next five movies. The most notable was his casting as the love interest Mark Darcy in the film adaptation of &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, itself a modern-day retelling of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Firth accepted the part as he saw it as an opportunity to lampoon his Mr. Darcy character. The film was very successful and critically well-liked. A 2004 sequel was mostly panned by critics but still financially successful.

Prior to this, Firth had a significant supporting role in &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996) as the husband of Kristin Scott Thomas&#x27;s character, whose jealousy of her adultery leads to tragedy. That year he also played the husband of the character of Kristin&#x27;s sister, Serena Scott Thomas, in the television miniseries &quot;Nostromo&quot;. Of the two he said &quot;Serena was a much more faithful wife.&quot;

He next played the lead role as a school teacher and obsessed Arsenal F.C. football fan in the romantic fictional adaptation &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1997) of Nick Hornby’s million-selling autobiographical essay &quot;Fever Pitch: A Fan&#x27;s Life&quot;.

He had parts in light romantic period pieces such as &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;Relative Values&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002). He appeared in several television productions, including &quot;Donovan Quick&quot; (an updated version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;) (1999), and had a more serious role as Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart in &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001), concerning the Nazi Wannsee Conference, for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.

Firth featured in the ensemble all-star cast of Richard Curtis&#x27;s &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), another financial success which divided critics. He was also given solo billing as the romantic lead in &quot;Hope Springs&quot;, but it received very poor reviews and made little box-office impact. He starred as Amanda Bynes&#x27; character&#x27;s father in the 2003 teen comedy &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot;, which was based on the play &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot;. He played painter Johannes Vermeer opposite Scarlett Johansson in the 2003 release &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;; some critics praised the film&#x27;s subtlety and sumptuous visuals, whilst others found it almost restrained, tedious and bereft of emotion. Nevertheless, it received mostly favourable reviews, was moderately successful and earned several awards and nominations.

In 2005 Firth appeared in &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; with Emma Thompson, in which he plays a struggling widowed father, it was a rare venture for him into the fantasy genre. He also appeared in &quot;Where the Truth Lies&quot;, a return to some of his darker, more intense early roles, that included a notorious scene featuring a bisexual orgy. Sheila Johnston wrote that it &quot;confounded his fans&quot;, but nonetheless that his character &quot;draws knowingly on that suave, cultivated persona&quot;, which could be traced from Mr. Darcy. Other films from this time included &quot;Then She Found Me&quot; (2007) with Helen Hunt and &quot;The Last Legion&quot; (2007) with Aishwarya Rai.

In 2008, he played the adult Blake Morrison reminiscing on his difficult relationship with his ailing father in the film adaptation of Morrison&#x27;s memoir, &quot;And When Did You Last See Your Father?&quot; It received generally favorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it four out of five stars. Manohla Dargis in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure to watch Mr. Firth–a supremely controlled actor who makes each developing fissure visible–show the adult Blake coming to terms with his contradictory feelings, letting the love and the hurt pour out of him.&quot; Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that Firth &quot;[does] quiet agonising to perfection.&quot; However, Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an unashamed tearjerker that&#x27;s all wrapping and no center.&quot; While he conceded that it was &quot;undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings&quot;, he added, &quot;Things aren&#x27;t helped any by Firth&#x27;s dour perf, as his Blake comes across as a self-centered whiner, a latter-day Me Generation figure who&#x27;s obsessed with finding problems when there really aren&#x27;t any.&quot;

The film adaptation of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008) was Firth&#x27;s first foray into musicals. He described the experience as &quot;a bit nerve-wracking&quot; but believed he got off lightly by being tasked with one of the less demanding songs, &quot;Our Last Summer&quot;. &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; became the highest grossing British-made film of all time, taking in over $600 million worldwide. Like &quot;Love Actually&quot;, it polarised critics, with supporters such as &quot;Empire&quot; calling it &quot;cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine, and toe tappers&quot;, whereas Peter Bradshaw in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the film gave him a &quot;need to vomit&quot;. Carrie Rickey in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described Firth&#x27;s performance as &quot;the embodiment of forced mirth.&quot; That year, Firth also starred in &quot;Easy Virtue&quot;, which screened at the Rome Film Festival to excellent reviews. He starred in &quot;Genova&quot;, which premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival.
In 2009 he appeared in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel, using the performance capture procedure, playing Scrooge&#x27;s optimistic nephew Fred.

===2009–2011: Critical success===
At the 66th Venice International Film Festival in 2009, Firth received the Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his role in Tom Ford&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;A Single Man,&quot; as a college professor grappling with solitude after the death of his longtime partner. His performance earned him career-best reviews and Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors&#x27; Guild, BAFTA, and BFCA nominations; he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in February 2010.

Firth starred in the 2010 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; as Prince Albert, Duke of York/King George VI, detailing his efforts to overcome his speech impediment while becoming monarch of the United Kingdom at the end of 1936. At the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the film received a standing ovation. The TIFF release of &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; fell on Firth&#x27;s 50th birthday and was called the &quot;best 50th birthday gift&quot;. On 16 January 2011, he won a Golden Globe for his performance in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; in the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. The Screen Actors Guild recognised him with the award for Best Male Actor on 30 January 2011.
In February 2011, he won his second consecutive best actor award at the 2011 BAFTA awards, and received an Academy Award for Best Actor in on 27 February 2011. The film grossed $414,211,549 worldwide.

Firth appeared as senior British secret agent Bill Haydon in the 2011 adaptation of the John le Carré novel &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, directed by Tomas Alfredson and co-starring Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and John Hurt. It gathered mostly excellent reviews. &quot;The Independent&quot; described Firth&#x27;s performance as &quot;suavely arrogant&quot; and praised the film. Deborah Young in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; thought Firth got &quot;all the best dialogue&quot;, which he delivered &quot;sardonically&quot;. Leslie Felperin in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that all the actors brought their &quot;A game&quot; and Firth was in &quot;particularly choleric, amusing form.&quot;

===2012–present: Established actor===
In May 2011, Firth began filming &quot;Gambit&quot;—a remake of a 1960s crime caper, in the part originally played by Michael Caine. It was released in the UK in November 2012 and was a financial and critical failure. &quot;Empire&quot; Kim Newman wrote, &quot;Firth starts out homaging Caine with his horn-rimmed cool but soon defaults to his usual repressed British cold mode&quot;, whilst &quot;Time Out London&quot; called his a &quot;likeable performance&quot;, although criticised the film overall. Stephen Dalton in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said, &quot;To his credit, Firth keeps his performance grounded in downbeat realism while all around are wildly mugging in desperate pursuit of thin, forced laughs. In 2012, Firth co-founded Raindog Films with British music industry executive and entrepreneur Ged Doherty. Its first feature, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, for which Firth was co-producer, was released in April 2016.

In May 2013, it was announced that Firth had signed to co-star with Emma Stone in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot;, set in the 1920s and shot on the French Riviera. In 2014, he did his first turn as Harry Hart / Agent Galahad in the spy action film &quot;&quot;, which grossed $414.4 million against an $81 million budget. Firth had been announced to voice Paddington Bear for the film &quot;Paddington&quot;; however, he announced his withdrawal on 17 June 2014, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s been bittersweet to see this delightful creature take shape and come to the sad realization that he simply doesn&#x27;t have my voice&quot;.

In June 2015, he began filming the story of amateur yachtsman Donald Crowhurst in &quot;The Mercy&quot;, alongside Rachel Weisz, David Thewlis and Jonathan Bailey. In 2016, Firth reprised his popular role as Mark Darcy in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which fared much better with audiences and critics than the second in the series (&quot;Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason&quot;). He portrayed American book editor Max Perkins in &quot;Genius&quot;, co-starring Jude Law as author Thomas Wolfe and based on A. Scott Berg&#x27;s biography &quot;Max Perkins: Editor of Genius&quot;. In 2016 he began filming for Rupert Everett&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, a biopic of Oscar Wilde, playing Wilde&#x27;s friend Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Turner.

In 2017, he reprised his role as Jamie from 2003&#x27;s &quot;Love Actually&quot; in the television short film &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;, by original writer and director Richard Curtis. Also that year, Firth returned as Harry Hart / Agent Galahad in the sequel &quot;&quot;. In 2018, Firth reprised his role of Harry Bright in the sequel to &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;. That year, he also appeared as William Weatherall Wilkins in the musical fantasy film &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, starring Emily Blunt in the title role. He also played British naval commander David Russell in Thomas Vinterberg&#x27;s &quot;Kursk&quot;, a film about the true story of the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster, in which he starred alongside Matthias Schoenaerts. In 2019, he had a cameo as British General Erinmore in Sam Mendes&#x27; World War I film &quot;1917&quot;. Set in 1947 England, Firth starred with Julie Walters in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; and later in 2020 with Stanley Tucci in &quot;Supernova&quot;. In 2021, he starred in romantic drama film &quot;Mothering Sunday&quot; directed by Eva Husson. In December 2021, he was cast in Sam Mendes&#x27; drama film &quot;Empire of Light&quot;, starring Olivia Colman. He was seen as Ewen Montagu in &quot;Operation Mincemeat&quot;, in April 2022. Firth returned to television in May 2022 starring as Michael Peterson in the HBO production &quot;The Staircase&quot;. In 2025, Firth starred in the drama series &quot;&quot;, portraying Jim Swire whose daughter died on Pan Am Flight 103 while in flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.

==Writing==
Firth&#x27;s first published work, &quot;The Department of Nothing&quot;, appeared in &quot;Speaking with the Angel&quot; (2000), a collection of short stories edited by Nick Hornby and published to benefit the TreeHouse Trust to aid autistic children. He met Hornby during the filming of the original &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. He contributed to the book &quot;We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples&quot; (2009), which explores the cultures, diversity and challenges of Indigenous peoples around the world. It features contributions from many Western writers, including Laurens van der Post, Noam Chomsky, Claude Lévi-Strauss; and from Indigenous people such as Davi Kopenawa Yanomami and Roy Sesana. Profits from the book&#x27;s sale benefit the Indigenous rights organisation Survival International. Firth was an executive producer for the film &quot;In Prison My Whole Life&quot;, featuring Noam Chomsky and Angela Davis. It was selected to the 2007 London Film Festival and the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

In December 2010, Firth was guest editor on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, where he commissioned research to scan the brains of volunteers (mostly university students) to see if there were structural differences that might account for political leanings. The resulting academic paper listed him as an author, along with two University College London researchers and the science reporter of the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; programme. For his contribution, professor John Jost called Firth a &#x27;scientific ambassador&#x27; in the field of political neuroscience. The study suggested that conservatives had more development in the amygdala, and liberals in the anterior cingulate cortex.

In 2012, Firth&#x27;s audiobook recording of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; was released at Audible.com and was declared Audiobook of the Year at the 2013 Audie Awards.

== Activism ==
Firth has been a longstanding supporter of Survival International, a non-governmental organisation that advocates for the rights of tribal peoples. Speaking in 2001, he said, &quot;My interest in tribal peoples goes back many years ... and I have supported [Survival] ever since.&quot; In 2003, during the promotion of &quot;Love Actually&quot;, he spoke in defence of the Indigenous people of Botswana, condemning the Botswana government&#x27;s eviction of the Gana and Gwi people (San) from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. He said of San, &quot;These people are not the remnants of a past era who need to be brought up to date. Those who are able to continue to live on the land that is rightfully theirs are facing the 21st century with a confidence that many of us in the so-called developed world can only envy.&quot; He has also backed a Survival International campaign to press the Brazilian government to take more decisive action in defence of Awá-Guajá people, whose land and livelihood is critically threatened by the actions of loggers.

As a supporter of the Refugee Council, Firth was involved in a campaign to stop the deportation of a group of 42 Congolese asylum seekers, expressing concerns in open letters to &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; that they faced being murdered on their return to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Firth said: &quot;To me, it&#x27;s just basic civilisation to help people. I find this incredibly painful to see how we dismiss the most desperate people in our society. It&#x27;s easily done. It plays to the tabloids, to the Middle-England xenophobes. It just makes me furious. And all from a government we once had such high hopes for.&quot; Four of the asylum seekers were given last-minute reprieves from deportation.

Firth, along with other celebrities, has been involved in the Oxfam global campaign Make Trade Fair, focusing on trade practices considered especially unfair to third-world producers, including dumping, high import tariffs, and labour rights. He and some collaborators opened Eco, an eco-friendly shop in West London, which offers fair-trade and eco-friendly goods, and expert advice on making spaces more energy efficient. In October 2009, at the London Film Festival, he launched a film and political activism website, Brightwide (since decommissioned), with his wife Livia.

During the 2010 general election, Firth announced his support for the Liberal Democrats, having previously been a Labour supporter, citing asylum and refugees&#x27; rights as key reasons for the change. In December 2010, he publicly dropped his support of the Liberal Democrats, citing their U-turn on tuition fees, and said that he was currently unaffiliated. He appeared in literature supporting changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing members of parliament to the House of Commons, in the unsuccessful Alternative Vote referendum in 2011.

In 2009, Firth joined the 10:10 project, supporting the movement calling for people to reduce their carbon footprints. In 2010, he endorsed &quot;Roots &amp; Shoots&quot;, an education programme in the UK run by the Jane Goodall Institute.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Firth began a relationship with Meg Tilly, his co-star in &quot;Valmont&quot;. Their son, William Joseph Firth, was born in 1990. William is now also an actor, appearing with his father in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; in 2016. The family moved to the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada but Firth and Tilly ultimately broke up in 1994. During the filming of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Firth and co-star Jennifer Ehle began a romantic relationship, which received media attention only after their separation.

In 1997, Firth married Italian activist Livia Giuggioli. They have two sons, Luca and Matteo. Firth speaks fluent Italian. The family divided their time between Wandsworth, in London, and Umbria, Italy. They announced their separation in 2019. They had gone through a private separation several years prior, but had reconciled.

Firth was a vocal opponent of the Brexit initiative for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Following the referendum&#x27;s passage, and the ensuing uncertainty over rights of non-EU citizens, he applied for &quot;dual citizenship (British and Italian)&quot; in 2017 to &quot;have the same passports as his wife and children&quot;. The Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, announced Firth&#x27;s application had been approved on 22 September 2017. Firth said, &quot;I will always be extremely British (you only have to look at or listen to me).&quot;

In 2011, after winning the Academy Award for his portrayal of King George VI in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, Firth suggested that he may be a republican (anti-monarchist) in a CNN interview with Piers Morgan, saying that voting was &quot;one of his favourite things&quot; and that unelected institutions were &quot;a problem for him&quot;.

==Acting credits and accolades==
Firth has received numerous awards, including an Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, British Academy Film Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance as King George VI in Tom Hooper&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010).

He received an honorary doctorate on 19 October 2007 from the University of Winchester. On 13 January 2011, he was presented with the 2,429th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In April 2011, &quot;Time&quot; included him in its list of the World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People. He was made a Freeman of the City of London on 8 March 2012, and was awarded an honorary fellowship by the University of the Arts London in 2012.

Firth was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

<doc id="170415" wikidata="Q2664403" url="?curid=170415" title="Alan Lightman">
<text>Alan Paige Lightman (born November 28, 1948) is an American physicist, writer, and social entrepreneur. He has served on the faculties of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is currently a professor of the practice of the humanities at MIT.

Lightman was one of the first persons at MIT to hold a joint faculty position in both the sciences and the humanities. His thinking and writing explore the intersection of the sciences and humanities, especially the multilogues among science, philosophy, religion, and spirituality.

Lightman is a member of the United Nations’ Scientific Advisory Board. The purpose of this Board is to advise UN leaders on breakthroughs in science and technology and mitigate potential risks, including ethical and social issues.

Lightman is the author of the international bestseller &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Dreams&quot;. and his novel &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; was a finalist for the National Book Award. He is also the founder of Harpswell, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in Southeast Asia.

Lightman hosts the public-television series &quot;Searching: Our Quest for Meaning in the Age of Science&quot;.

He has received six honorary doctoral degrees.

==Early life and education==
Alan Lightman was born and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. His father Richard Lightman was a movie theater owner and played a major role in desegregating movie theaters in the South in 1962. His mother Jeanne Garretson was a dance teacher and Braille typist.

Lightman graduated from White Station High School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. in physics from Princeton University in 1970 after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;Design and construction of a gas scintillation detector capable of time-of-flight measurements of fission isomer decays&quot;, under the supervision of Robert Naumann. He then received a Ph.D. in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1974 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;I. Time-dependent accretion disks around compact objects. II. Theoretical frameworks for analyzing and testing gravitation theories&quot;, under the supervision of Kip S. Thorne.

==Career==

Lightman was a postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at Cornell University (1974–1976); an assistant professor
at Harvard University (1976–1979); a senior research scientist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian (1979–1989); and then a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (1989– ). During this period
he began publishing poetry in small magazines and eventually essays in &quot;Science 80&quot;, the &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;,
and other magazines.

At MIT, in the mid-1990s Lightman chaired the committee that established the communication requirement
for all undergraduates. In 2001, he cofounded the graduate program in science writing. In 2005, he was a cofounder of the Catalyst Collaborative at MIT, a partnership between MIT and Central
Square Theater, in Cambridge, that sponsors plays involving science and the culture of science. 

In August 2023, Lightman was appointed a member of the United Nations’ Scientific Advisory Board.

==Scientific work==
In his scientific work, Lightman has made contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures and densities. In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of accretion disks, stellar dynamics, radiative processes, and relativistic plasmas. Some of his significant achievements are his discovery, with Douglas Eardley, of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter, called accretion disks, that form around massive condensed objects such as black holes, with wide application in astronomy; his proof, with David L. Lee, that all gravitation theories obeying the Weak Equivalence Principle (the experimentally verified fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field) must be metric theories of gravity, that is, must describe gravity as a geometrical warping of time and space; his calculations, with Stuart L. Shapiro, of the distribution of stars around a massive black hole and the rate of destruction of those stars by the hole; his discovery, independently of Roland Svensson of Sweden, of the negative heat behavior of optically thin, hot thermal plasmas dominated by electron-positron pairs, that is, the result that adding energy to thin hot gases causes their temperature to decrease rather than increase; and his work on unusual radiation processes, such as unsaturated inverse Compton scattering, in thermal media, also with wide application in astrophysics.

In 1990 he chaired the science panel of the National Academy of Sciences Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee. He is a past chair of the High Energy Division of the American Astronomical Society.

== Literary work ==
Lightman&#x27;s essays, articles, and stories have appeared in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other publications. His books include:

==Nonprofit work==
In 2003, Lightman made his first trip to Southeast Asia, to Cambodia. There he met a Cambodian lawyer named Veasna Chea Leth who told him that when she had been going to university in Phnom Penh in the mid-1990s, she and a handful of female students lived underneath the university building, in the two-meter crawl space between the bottom of the building and the mud, because there was no housing for female university students. Lightman and Chea together conceived the idea of a dormitory for female university students in Phnom Penh. That first facility was completed in 2006, the first dormitory for college women in the country.

During this work, Lightman founded Harpswell, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to support emerging women leaders in Southeast Asia. Harpswell now operates two centers in Phnom Penh. In addition to providing housing, food, and medical care, the facility operates a program in leadership skills and critical thinking. The in-house program includes English instruction, computer literacy, debate, analytical writing, comparative genocide studies, strategies for civic engagement, leadership training, and discussion and analysis of national and international events. As of fall 2023, the Cambodian program has about 250 graduates and about 76 current students.

In 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei, plus Nepal. The Harpswell-ASEAN Women&#x27;s Leadership Summit consists of a ten-day summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program has a total of 25 participants each year, who are flown to Penang from their respective countries.

<text>T cells are one of the important types of white blood cells of the immune system and play a central role in the adaptive immune response. T cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on their cell surface.

T cells are born from hematopoietic stem cells, found in the bone marrow. Developing T cells then migrate to the thymus gland to develop (or mature). T cells derive their name from the thymus. After migration to the thymus, the precursor cells mature into several distinct types of T cells. T cell differentiation also continues after they have left the thymus. Groups of specific, differentiated T cell subtypes have a variety of important functions in controlling and shaping the immune response.

One of these functions is immune-mediated cell death, and it is carried out by two major subtypes: CD8+ &quot;killer&quot; (cytotoxic) and CD4+ &quot;helper&quot; T cells. (These are named for the presence of the cell surface proteins CD8 or CD4.) CD8+ T cells, also known as &quot;killer T cells&quot;, are cytotoxic – this means that they are able to directly kill virus-infected cells, as well as cancer cells. CD8+ T cells are also able to use small signalling proteins, known as cytokines, to recruit other types of cells when mounting an immune response. A different population of T cells, the CD4+ T cells, function as &quot;helper cells&quot;. Unlike CD8+ killer T cells, the CD4+ helper T (TH) cells function by further activating memory B cells and cytotoxic T cells, which leads to a larger immune response. The specific adaptive immune response regulated by the TH cell depends on its subtype (such as T-helper1, T-helper2, T-helper17, regulatory T-cell), which is distinguished by the types of cytokines they secrete.

Regulatory T cells are yet another distinct population of T cells that provide the critical mechanism of tolerance, whereby immune cells are able to distinguish invading cells from &quot;self&quot;. This prevents immune cells from inappropriately reacting against one&#x27;s own cells, known as an &quot;autoimmune&quot; response. For this reason, these regulatory T cells have also been called &quot;suppressor&quot; T cells. These same regulatory T cells can also be co-opted by cancer cells to prevent the recognition of, and an immune response against, tumor cells.

==Development==
===Origin, early development and migration to the thymus===
All T cells originate from c-kit+Sca1+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) which reside in the bone marrow. In some cases, the origin might be the foetal liver during embryonic development. The HSC then differentiate into multipotent progenitors (MPP) which retain the potential to become both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The process of differentiation then proceeds to a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), which can only differentiate into T, B or NK cells. These CLP cells then migrate via the blood to the thymus, where they . Henceforth they are known as thymocytes, the immature stage of a T cell.

The earliest cells which arrived in the thymus are commonly termed &quot;double-negative&quot;, as they express neither the CD4 nor CD8 co-receptor. The newly arrived CLP cells are CD4−CD8−CD44+CD25−ckit+ cells, and are termed early thymic progenitor (ETP) cells. These cells will then undergo a round of division and downregulate c-kit and are termed &quot;double-negative one&quot; (DN1) cells. To become T cells, the thymocytes must undergo multiple DN stages as well as positive selection and negative selection.

Double negative thymocytes can be identified by the surface expression of CD2, CD5 and CD7. Still during the double negative stages, CD34 expression stops and CD1 is expressed. Expression of both CD4 and CD8 makes them &quot;double positive&quot;, and matures into either CD4+ or CD8+ cells.

===TCR development===

A critical step in T cell maturation is making a functional T cell receptor (TCR). Each mature T cell will ultimately contain a unique TCR that reacts to a random pattern, allowing the immune system to recognize many different types of pathogens. This process is essential in developing immunity to threats that the immune system has not encountered before, since due to random variation there will always be at least one TCR to match any new pathogen.

A thymocyte can only become an active T cell when it survives the process of developing a functional TCR. The TCR consists of two major components, the alpha and beta chains. These both contain random elements designed to produce a wide variety of different TCRs, but due to this huge variety they must be tested to make sure they work at all. First, the thymocytes attempt to create a functional beta chain, testing it against a &#x27;mock&#x27; alpha chain. Then they attempt to create a functional alpha chain. Once a working TCR has been produced, the cells then must test if their TCR will identify threats correctly, and to do this it is required to recognize the body’s major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a process known as positive selection. The thymocyte must also ensure that it does not react adversely to &quot;self&quot; antigens, called negative selection. If both positive and negative selection are successful, the TCR becomes fully operational and the thymocyte becomes a T cell.

====TCR β-chain selection====
At the DN2 stage (CD44+CD25+), cells upregulate the recombination genes RAG1 and RAG2 and re-arrange the TCRβ locus, combining V-D-J recombination and constant region genes in an attempt to create a functional TCRβ chain. As the developing thymocyte progresses through to the DN3 stage (CD44−CD25+), the thymocyte expresses an invariant α-chain called pre-Tα alongside the TCRβ gene. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele). Although these signals require the pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. If the chains successfully pair a pre-TCR forms, and the cell downregulates CD25 and is termed a DN4 cell (CD25−CD44−). These cells then undergo a round of proliferation, and begin to re-arrange the TCRα locus during the &quot;double-positive&quot; stage.

====Positive selection====
The process of positive selection takes 3 to 4 days and occurs in the thymic cortex. Double-positive thymocytes (CD4+/CD8+) migrate deep into the thymic cortex, where they are presented with self-antigens. These self-antigens are expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells on MHC molecules, which reside on the surface of cortical epithelial cells. Only thymocytes that interact well with MHC-I or MHC-II will receive a vital &quot;survival signal&quot;, while those that cannot interact strongly enough will receive no signal and die from neglect. This process ensures that the surviving thymocytes will have an &#x27;MHC affinity&#x27; that means they will exhibit stronger binding affinity for specific MHC alleles in that organism. The vast majority of developing thymocytes will not pass positive selection, and die during this process.

A thymocyte&#x27;s fate is determined during positive selection. Double-positive cells (CD4+/CD8+) that interact well with MHC &quot;class II&quot; molecules will eventually become CD4+ &quot;helper&quot; cells, whereas thymocytes that interact well with MHC &quot;class I&quot; molecules mature into CD8+ &quot;killer&quot; cells. A thymocyte becomes a CD4+ cell by down-regulating expression of its CD8 cell surface receptors. If the cell does not lose its signal, it will continue downregulating CD8 and become a CD4+, both CD8+ and CD4+ cells are now &quot;single positive&quot; cells.

This process does not filter for thymocytes that may cause autoimmunity. The potentially autoimmune cells are removed by the following process of negative selection, which occurs in the thymic medulla.

====Negative selection====
Negative selection removes thymocytes that are capable of strongly binding with &quot;self&quot; MHC molecules. Thymocytes that survive positive selection migrate towards the boundary of the cortex and medulla in the thymus. While in the medulla, they are again presented with a self-antigen presented on the MHC complex of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). mTECs must be Autoimmune regulator positive (AIRE+) to properly express tissue-specific antigens on their MHC &quot;class I&quot; peptides. Some mTECs are phagocytosed by thymic dendritic cells; this makes them AIRE− antigen presenting cells (APCs), allowing for presentation of self-antigens on MHC &quot;class II&quot; molecules (positively selected CD4+ cells must interact with these MHC class II molecules, thus APCs, which possess MHC class II, must be present for CD4+ T-cell negative selection). Thymocytes that interact too strongly with the self-antigen receive an apoptotic signal that leads to cell death. However, some of these cells are selected to become Treg cells. The remaining cells exit the thymus as mature naive T cells, also known as recent thymic emigrants. This process is an important component of central tolerance and serves to prevent the formation of self-reactive T cells that are capable of inducing autoimmune diseases in the host.

====TCR development summary====
β-selection is the first checkpoint, where thymocytes that are able to form a functional pre-TCR (with an invariant alpha chain and a functional beta chain) are allowed to continue development in the thymus. Next, positive selection checks that thymocytes have successfully rearranged their TCRα locus and are capable of recognizing MHC molecules with appropriate affinity. Negative selection in the medulla then eliminates thymocytes that bind too strongly to self-antigens expressed on MHC molecules. These selection processes allow for tolerance of self by the immune system. Typical naive T cells that leave the thymus (via the corticomedullary junction) are self-restricted, self-tolerant, and single positive.

===Thymic output===
About 98% of thymocytes die during the development processes in the thymus by failing either positive selection or negative selection, whereas the other 2% survive and leave the thymus to become mature immunocompetent T cells.
The thymus contributes fewer cells as a person ages. As the thymus shrinks by about 3% a year throughout middle age, a corresponding fall in the thymic production of naive T cells occurs, leaving peripheral T cell expansion and regeneration to play a greater role in protecting older people.

==Types of T cell==
T cells are grouped into a series of subsets based on their function. CD4 and CD8 T cells are selected in the thymus, but undergo further differentiation in the periphery to specialized cells which have different functions. T cell subsets were initially defined by function, but also have associated gene or protein expression patterns.

===Conventional adaptive T cells===
====Helper CD4+ T cells====

T helper cells (TH cells) assist other lymphocytes, including the maturation of B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells, and activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. These cells are also known as CD4+ T cells as they express the CD4 glycoprotein on their surfaces. Helper T cells become activated when they are presented with peptide antigens by MHC class II molecules, which are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete cytokines that regulate or assist the immune response. These cells can differentiate into one of several subtypes, which have different roles. Cytokines direct T cells into particular subtypes.

====Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells====

Cytotoxic T cells (TC cells, CTLs, T-killer cells, killer T cells) destroy virus-infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection. These cells are defined by the expression of the CD8 protein on their cell surface. Cytotoxic T cells recognize their targets by binding to short peptides (8-11 amino acids in length) associated with MHC class I molecules, present on the surface of all nucleated cells. Cytotoxic T cells also produce the key cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ. These cytokines influence the effector functions of other cells, in particular macrophages and NK cells.

====Memory T cells====

Antigen-naive T cells expand and differentiate into memory and effector T cells after they encounter their cognate antigen within the context of an MHC molecule on the surface of a professional antigen presenting cell (e.g. a dendritic cell). Appropriate co-stimulation must be present at the time of antigen encounter for this process to occur. Historically, memory T cells were thought to belong to either the effector or central memory subtypes, each with their own distinguishing set of cell surface markers (see below). Subsequently, numerous new populations of memory T cells were discovered including tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, stem memory TSCM cells, and virtual memory T cells. The single unifying theme for all memory T cell subtypes is that they are long-lived and can quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen. By this mechanism they provide the immune system with &quot;memory&quot; against previously encountered pathogens. Memory T cells may be either CD4+ or CD8+ and usually express CD45RO.

Memory T cell subtypes:
*Central memory T cells (TCM cells) express CD45RO, C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7), and L-selectin (CD62L). Central memory T cells also have intermediate to high expression of CD44. This memory subpopulation is commonly found in the lymph nodes and in the peripheral circulation. (Note- CD44 expression is usually used to distinguish murine naive from memory T cells).
*Effector memory T cells (TEM cells and TEMRA cells) express CD45RO but lack expression of CCR7 and L-selectin. They also have intermediate to high expression of CD44. These memory T cells lack lymph node-homing receptors and are thus found in the peripheral circulation and tissues. TEMRA stands for terminally differentiated effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA, which is a marker usually found on naive T cells.
*Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) occupy tissues (skin, lung, etc.) without recirculating. One cell surface marker that has been associated with TRM is the intern αeβ7, also known as CD103.
*Virtual memory T cells (TVM) differ from the other memory subsets in that they do not originate following a strong clonal expansion event. Thus, although this population as a whole is abundant within the peripheral circulation, individual virtual memory T cell clones reside at relatively low frequencies. One theory is that homeostatic proliferation gives rise to this T cell population. Although CD8 virtual memory T cells were the first to be described, it is now known that CD4 virtual memory cells also exist.

====Regulatory CD4+ T cells====
Regulatory T cells are crucial for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Their major role is to shut down T cell–mediated immunity toward the end of an immune reaction and to suppress autoreactive T cells that escaped the process of negative selection in the thymus.

Two major classes of CD4+ Treg cells have been described—FOXP3+ Treg cells and FOXP3− Treg cells.

Regulatory T cells can develop either during normal development in the thymus, and are then known as thymic Treg cells, or can be induced peripherally and are called peripherally derived Treg cells. These two subsets were previously called &quot;naturally occurring&quot; and &quot;adaptive&quot; (or &quot;induced&quot;), respectively. Both subsets require the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 which can be used to identify the cells. Mutations of the &quot;FOXP3&quot; gene can prevent regulatory T cell development, causing the fatal autoimmune disease IPEX.

Several other types of T cells have suppressive activity, but do not express FOXP3 constitutively. These include Tr1 and Th3 cells, which are thought to originate during an immune response and act by producing suppressive molecules. Tr1 cells are associated with IL-10, and Th3 cells are associated with TGF-beta. Recently, Th17 cells have been added to this list.

===Innate-like T cells===
Innate-like T cells or unconventional T cells represent some subsets of T cells that behave differently in immunity. They trigger rapid immune responses, regardless of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, unlike their conventional counterparts (CD4 T helper cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells), which are dependent on the recognition of peptide antigens in the context of the MHC molecule. Overall, there are three large populations of unconventional T cells: NKT cells, MAIT cells, and gammadelta T cells. Now, their functional roles are already being well established in the context of infections and cancer. Furthermore, these T cell subsets are being translated into many therapies against malignancies such as leukemia, for example.

====Natural killer T cell====

Natural killer T cells (NKT cells – not to be confused with natural killer cells of the innate immune system) bridge the adaptive immune system with the innate immune system. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize protein peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, NKT cells recognize glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d. Once activated, these cells can perform functions ascribed to both helper and cytotoxic T cells: cytokine production and release of cytolytic/cell killing molecules. They are also able to recognize and eliminate some tumor cells and cells infected with herpes viruses.

====Mucosal associated invariant T cells====

Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells display innate, effector-like qualities. In humans, MAIT cells are found in the blood, liver, lungs, and mucosa, defending against microbial activity and infection. The MHC class I-like protein, MR1, is responsible for presenting bacterially-produced vitamin B metabolites to MAIT cells. After the presentation of foreign antigen by MR1, MAIT cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and are capable of lysing bacterially-infected cells. MAIT cells can also be activated through MR1-independent signaling. In addition to possessing innate-like functions, this T cell subset supports the adaptive immune response and has a memory-like phenotype. Furthermore, MAIT cells are thought to play a role in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, although definitive evidence is yet to be published.

====Gamma delta T cells====

Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) represent a small subset of T cells which possess a γδ TCR rather than the αβ TCR on the cell surface. The majority of T cells express αβ TCR chains. This group of T cells is much less common in humans and mice (about 2% of total T cells) and are found mostly in the gut mucosa, within a population of intraepithelial lymphocytes. In rabbits, sheep, and chickens, the number of γδ T cells can be as high as 60% of total T cells. The antigenic molecules that activate γδ T cells are still mostly unknown. However, γδ T cells are not MHC-restricted and seem to be able to recognize whole proteins rather than requiring peptides to be presented by MHC molecules on APCs. Some murine γδ T cells recognize MHC class IB molecules. Human γδ T cells that use the Vγ9 and Vδ2 gene fragments constitute the major γδ T cell population in peripheral blood. These cells are unique in that they specifically and rapidly respond to a set of nonpeptidic phosphorylated isoprenoid precursors, collectively named phosphoantigens, which are produced by virtually all living cells. The most common phosphoantigens from animal and human cells (including cancer cells) are isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMPP). Many microbes produce the active compound hydroxy-DMAPP (HMB-PP) and corresponding mononucleotide conjugates, in addition to IPP and DMAPP. Plant cells produce both types of phosphoantigens. Drugs activating human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells comprise synthetic phosphoantigens and aminobisphosphonates, which upregulate endogenous IPP/DMAPP.

==Activation==
Activation of CD4+ T cells occurs through the simultaneous engagement of the T-cell receptor and a co-stimulatory molecule (like CD28, or ICOS) on the T cell by the major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) peptide and co-stimulatory molecules on the APC. Both are required for production of an effective immune response; in the absence of co-stimulation, T cell receptor signalling alone results in anergy. The signalling pathways downstream from co-stimulatory molecules usually engages the PI3K pathway generating PIP3 at the plasma membrane and recruiting PH domain containing signaling molecules like PDK1 that are essential for the activation of PKC-θ, and eventual IL-2 production. Optimal CD8+ T cell response relies on CD4+ signalling. CD4+ cells are useful in the initial antigenic activation of naive CD8 T cells, and sustaining memory CD8+ T cells in the aftermath of an acute infection. Therefore, activation of CD4+ T cells can be beneficial to the action of CD8+ T cells.

The first signal is provided by binding of the T cell receptor to its cognate peptide presented on MHCII on an APC. MHCII is restricted to so-called professional antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, to name a few. The peptides presented to CD8+ T cells by MHC class I molecules are 8–13 amino acids in length; the peptides presented to CD4+ cells by MHC class II molecules are longer, usually 12–25 amino acids in length, as the ends of the binding cleft of the MHC class II molecule are open.

The second signal comes from co-stimulation, in which surface receptors on the APC are induced by a relatively small number of stimuli, usually products of pathogens, but sometimes breakdown products of cells, such as necrotic-bodies or heat shock proteins. The only co-stimulatory receptor expressed constitutively by naive T cells is CD28, so co-stimulation for these cells comes from the CD80 and CD86 proteins, which together constitute the B7 protein, (B7.1 and B7.2, respectively) on the APC. Other receptors are expressed upon activation of the T cell, such as OX40 and ICOS, but these largely depend upon CD28 for their expression. The second signal licenses the T cell to respond to an antigen. Without it, the T cell becomes anergic, and it becomes more difficult for it to activate in future. This mechanism prevents inappropriate responses to self, as self-peptides will not usually be presented with suitable co-stimulation. Once a T cell has been appropriately activated (i.e. has received signal one and signal two) it alters its cell surface expression of a variety of proteins. Markers of T cell activation include CD69, CD71 and CD25 (also a marker for Treg cells), and HLA-DR (a marker of human T cell activation). CTLA-4 expression is also up-regulated on activated T cells, which in turn outcompetes CD28 for binding to the B7 proteins. This is a checkpoint mechanism to prevent over activation of the T cell. Activated T cells also change their cell surface glycosylation profile.

The T cell receptor exists as a complex of several proteins. The actual T cell receptor is composed of two separate peptide chains, which are produced from the independent T cell receptor alpha and beta (&quot;TCRα&quot; and &quot;TCRβ&quot;) genes. The other proteins in the complex are the CD3 proteins: CD3εγ and CD3εδ heterodimers and, most important, a CD3ζ homodimer, which has a total of six ITAM motifs. The ITAM motifs on the CD3ζ can be phosphorylated by Lck and in turn recruit ZAP-70. Lck and/or ZAP-70 can also phosphorylate the tyrosines on many other molecules, not least CD28, LAT and SLP-76, which allows the aggregation of signalling complexes around these proteins.

Phosphorylated LAT recruits SLP-76 to the membrane, where it can then bring in PLC-γ, VAV1, Itk and potentially PI3K. PLC-γ cleaves PI(4,5)P2 on the inner leaflet of the membrane to create the active intermediaries diacylglycerol (DAG), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3); PI3K also acts on PIP2, phosphorylating it to produce phosphatidlyinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). DAG binds and activates some PKCs. Most important in T cells is PKC-θ, critical for activating the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. IP3 is released from the membrane by PLC-γ and diffuses rapidly to activate calcium channel receptors on the ER, which induces the release of calcium into the cytosol. Low calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum causes STIM1 clustering on the ER membrane and leads to activation of cell membrane CRAC channels that allows additional calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. This aggregated cytosolic calcium binds calmodulin, which can then activate calcineurin. Calcineurin, in turn, activates NFAT, which then translocates to the nucleus. NFAT is a transcription factor that activates the transcription of a pleiotropic set of genes, most notable, IL-2, a cytokine that promotes long-term proliferation of activated T cells.

PLC-γ can also initiate the NF-κB pathway. DAG activates PKC-θ, which then phosphorylates CARMA1, causing it to unfold and function as a scaffold. The cytosolic domains bind an adapter BCL10 via CARD (Caspase activation and recruitment domains) domains; that then binds TRAF6, which is ubiquitinated at K63. This form of ubiquitination does not lead to degradation of target proteins. Rather, it serves to recruit NEMO, IKKα and -β, and TAB1-2/ TAK1. TAK 1 phosphorylates IKK-β, which then phosphorylates IκB allowing for K48 ubiquitination: leads to proteasomal degradation. Rel A and p50 can then enter the nucleus and bind the NF-κB response element. This coupled with NFAT signaling allows for complete activation of the IL-2 gene.

While in most cases activation is dependent on TCR recognition of antigen, alternative pathways for activation have been described. For example, cytotoxic T cells have been shown to become activated when targeted by other CD8 T cells leading to tolerization of the latter.

In spring 2014, the T-Cell Activation in Space (TCAS) experiment was launched to the International Space Station on the SpaceX CRS-3 mission to study how &quot;deficiencies in the human immune system are affected by a microgravity environment&quot;.

T cell activation is modulated by reactive oxygen species.

===Antigen discrimination===
A unique feature of T cells is their ability to discriminate between healthy and abnormal (e.g. infected or cancerous) cells in the body. Healthy cells typically express a large number of self derived pMHC on their cell surface and although the T cell antigen receptor can interact with at least a subset of these self pMHC, the T cell generally ignores these healthy cells. However, when these very same cells contain even minute quantities of pathogen derived pMHC, T cells are able to become activated and initiate immune responses. The ability of T cells to ignore healthy cells but respond when these same cells contain pathogen (or cancer) derived pMHC is known as antigen discrimination. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this process are controversial.

==Clinical significance==
===Deficiency===

Causes of T cell deficiency include lymphocytopenia of T cells and/or defects on function of individual T cells. Complete insufficiency of T cell function can result from hereditary conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Omenn syndrome, and cartilage–hair hypoplasia. Causes of partial insufficiencies of T cell function include acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and hereditary conditions such as DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), chromosomal breakage syndromes (CBSs), and B cell and T cell combined disorders such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS).

The main pathogens of concern in T cell deficiencies are intracellular pathogens, including &quot;Herpes simplex virus&quot;, &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; and &quot;Listeria&quot;. Also, fungal infections are also more common and severe in T cell deficiencies.

===Cancer===

Cancer of T cells is termed T-cell lymphoma, and accounts for perhaps one in ten cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The main forms of T cell lymphoma are:
*Extranodal T cell lymphoma
*Cutaneous T cell lymphomas: Sézary syndrome and Mycosis fungoides
*Anaplastic large cell lymphoma
*Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma

===Exhaustion===
T cell exhaustion is a poorly defined or ambiguous term. There are three approaches to its definition. &quot;The first approach primarily defines as exhausted the cells that present the same cellular dysfunction (typically, the absence of an expected effector response). The second approach primarily defines as exhausted the cells that are produced by a given cause (typically, but not necessarily, chronic exposure to an antigen). Finally, the third approach primarily defines as exhausted the cells that present the same molecular markers (typically, programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]).&quot;

Dysfunctional T cells are characterized by progressive loss of function, changes in transcriptional profiles and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors. At first, cells lose their ability to produce IL-2 and TNFα, which is followed by the loss of high proliferative capacity and cytotoxic potential, and eventually leads to their deletion. Exhausted T cells typically indicate higher levels of CD43, CD69 and inhibitory receptors combined with lower expression of CD62L and CD127. Exhaustion can develop during chronic infections, sepsis and cancer. Exhausted T cells preserve their functional exhaustion even after repeated antigen exposure.

====During chronic infection and sepsis====
T cell exhaustion can be triggered by several factors like persistent antigen exposure and lack of CD4 T cell help. Antigen exposure also has effect on the course of exhaustion because longer exposure time and higher viral load increases the severity of T cell exhaustion. At least 2–4 weeks exposure is needed to establish exhaustion. Another factor able to induce exhaustion are inhibitory receptors including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), CTLA-4, T cell membrane protein-3 (TIM3), and lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3). Soluble molecules such as cytokines IL-10 or TGF-β are also able to trigger exhaustion. Last known factors that can play a role in T cell exhaustion are regulatory cells. Treg cells can be a source of IL-10 and TGF-β and therefore they can play a role in T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, T cell exhaustion is reverted after depletion of Treg cells and blockade of PD1. T cell exhaustion can also occur during sepsis as a result of cytokine storm. Later after the initial septic encounter anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-apoptotic proteins take over to protect the body from damage. Sepsis also carries high antigen load and inflammation. In this stage of sepsis T cell exhaustion increases. Currently there are studies aiming to utilize inhibitory receptor blockades in treatment of sepsis.

====During transplantation====
While during infection T cell exhaustion can develop following persistent antigen exposure after graft transplant similar situation arises with alloantigen presence. It was shown that T cell response diminishes over time after kidney transplant. These data suggest T cell exhaustion plays an important role in tolerance of a graft mainly by depletion of alloreactive CD8 T cells. Several studies showed positive effect of chronic infection on graft acceptance and its long-term survival mediated partly by T cell exhaustion. It was also shown that recipient T cell exhaustion provides sufficient conditions for NK cell transfer. While there are data showing that induction of T cell exhaustion can be beneficial for transplantation it also carries disadvantages among which can be counted increased number of infections and the risk of tumor development.

====During cancer====
During cancer T cell exhaustion plays a role in tumor protection. According to research some cancer-associated cells as well as tumor cells themselves can actively induce T cell exhaustion at the site of tumor. T cell exhaustion can also play a role in cancer relapses as was shown on leukemia. Some studies have suggested that it is possible to predict relapse of leukemia based on expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 by T cells. Many experiments and clinical trials have focused on immune checkpoint blockers in cancer therapy, with some of these approved as valid therapies that are now in clinical use. Inhibitory receptors targeted by those medical procedures are vital in T cell exhaustion and blocking them can reverse these changes.

<text>Dennistoun John Franklyn Rose Price (23 June 1915 – 6 October 1973) was an English actor. He played Louis Mazzini in the Ealing Studios film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) and the omnicompetent valet Jeeves in 1960s television adaptations of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s stories.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Price was born in Ruscombe in Berkshire. He had distant Welsh family connections, and was the son of Brigadier-General Thomas Rose Caradoc Price (1875–1949), CMG, DSO (who was a great-grandson of Sir Rose Price, 1st Baronet, and, through his mother, a descendant of the Baillie baronets of Polkemmet, near Whitburn, West Lothian), and his wife Dorothy, née Verey, daughter of Sir Henry Verey, Official referee of the Supreme Court of Judicature. He attended Copthorne Prep School, Radley College and Worcester College, Oxford. He studied acting at the Embassy Theatre School of Acting.

===Stage actor===
Price made his first appearance on stage at the Croydon Repertory Theatre in June 1937, followed by a London debut at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre on 6 September 1937 in &quot;Richard II&quot;.

He served in the Royal Artillery from March 1940 to June 1942 during the Second World War, but returned to acting after being invalided out, appearing with Noël Coward in &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; and &quot;Present Laughter&quot; and later as Charles Condomine in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, which he later named in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Theatre&quot; as one of his two favourite parts along with the title role in André Obey&#x27;s &quot;Noah&quot;.

===Film career===
Price&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944). He impressed Gainsborough Pictures, which put him under contract. According to Brian MacFarlane, Price was &quot;mercilessly used by Gainsborough [Pictures] in one unsuitable role after another&quot; in this period.

He was given a support role in &quot;A Place of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1945) starring James Mason. British National borrowed him for &quot;The Echo Murders&quot; (1946), a Sexton Blake film; he was then fourth-billed as the villain in a Gainsborough melodrama, &quot;Caravan&quot; (1946) with Stewart Granger and Jean Kent, playing the type of villainous part that had made James Mason a star (and that Mason was no longer interested in playing). It was a huge success.

Price was a villain again in Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Bow&quot; (1946) with Granger and Kent. Two Cities Films used him in one of its melodramas, &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; (1947). Gainsborough used him in villainous roles in &quot;Dear Murderer&quot;, &quot;Holiday Camp&quot;, &quot;Jassy&quot; and &quot;Master of Bankdam&quot; (all 1947).

He made two films for Bernard Knowles, supporting Margaret Lockwood in &quot;The White Unicorn&quot; and a comedy, &quot;Easy Money&quot; (both 1948). He followed this with a thriller, &quot;Snowbound&quot;, and a crime melodrama &quot;Good-Time Girl&quot; (both 1948). In 1948, British exhibitors voted Price the tenth-most popular British actor at the box office.

===Stardom===
He was promoted to starring roles. He was given the title role in &quot;The Bad Lord Byron&quot; (1949); this was a huge flop at the box-office, and helped kill off the Gainsborough melodrama. Much more successful, both at the box-office and among critics, was &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), for Ealing Films; he played the suave serial murderer Louis Mazzini with Alec Guinness playing his eight relatives.

Price was in a wartime drama, &quot;The Lost People&quot; (1949). In the same year, he was a guest judge on a BBC radio broadcast of the Piddingtons show. His role was to represent the eyes of listeners as the Piddingtons performed their telepathy act in the Piccadilly studios, and in the Tower of London. He was ensuring that no cheating was going on and overseeing the telepathy tests as a witness.

He was loaned to Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) to make two films: the musical &quot;The Dancing Years&quot; (1950), a sizeable hit; and the thriller &quot;Murder Without Crime&quot; (1950), was less successful.

Back at Rank, Price was a villain in &quot;The Adventurers&quot;, and was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget You&quot; (both 1951).

He played the lead in &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; (1951), and after a cameo in &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951) he had top billing in a comedy, &quot;Song of Paris&quot; (1952).

===Supporting actor===
Price supported in &quot;The Tall Headlines&quot; (1952) and had the lead in some B-films: &quot;Noose for a Lady&quot; (1953), &quot;Murder at 3am&quot; (1953) and &quot;Time Is My Enemy&quot; (1954). In &quot;A&quot; pictures he was now a supporting actor, with his films including &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1953), &quot;For Better, for Worse&quot; (1954), &quot;That Lady&quot; (1955), &quot;Oh... Rosalinda!!&quot; (1955), &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1956), &quot;Charley Moon&quot; (1956) with Max Bygraves, &quot;Port Afrique&quot; (1956), &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot; (1956), &quot;Fortune Is a Woman&quot; (1957), &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1957), &quot;Danger Within&quot; (1959), &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959), and &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; (1960). He was top billed in &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic Chaps!&quot; (1959), a minor comedy made by Hammer Films.

In the 1950s, Price appeared in London and New York City in new plays and revivals of classics. It has been suggested that he was the first name actor on television to play a &quot;more or less overtly gay role&quot; in &quot;Crime on Our Hands&quot; (1954). In 1957, he made his debut in South Africa in lead roles in &quot;Separate Tables&quot;.

As a radio actor, Price was the original &quot;No. 1&quot; in charge of the crew of HMS &quot;Troutbridge&quot; in the first series of the long-running radio comedy series &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; in 1959, but was unable to continue the role in the second series because of other work commitments; he was replaced by Stephen Murray. His film appearances from this period included &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Amorous Prawn&quot; (also known as &quot;The Playgirl and the War Minister&quot;, 1962). In &quot;Victim&quot; (1961) he portrayed one of several characters being blackmailed because of their (then illegal) homosexuality. In the horror spoof &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1961) he starred alongside Kenneth Connor, Sid James, Shirley Eaton and Donald Pleasence, while in the science fiction film &quot;The Earth Dies Screaming&quot; (1964) he appeared alongside Willard Parker and Thorley Walters.

In the BBC television series &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; (1965–67), Price&#x27;s performance as Jeeves was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;an outstanding success&quot;, and P. G. Wodehouse said Price had &quot;that essential touch of Jeeves mystery&quot;. Working with Ian Carmichael as Bertie Wooster, this now almost completely lost series was based on the novels and short stories of P. G. Wodehouse. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1967, Price was declared bankrupt; he attributed his financial distress to &quot;extravagant living and most inadequate gambling&quot;. He then moved to the tax haven island of Sark, which coincided with an escalation in his alcoholism. Towards the end of his life, Price appeared in a series of horror movies including &quot; The Haunted House of Horror&quot; (1969), &quot;Twins of Evil&quot; (1971), &quot;Horror Hospital&quot; (1973) and &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973), as well as five films directed by Jesús Franco. One of his last film appearances was a star-studded version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1972) with Ralph Richardson, Robert Helpmann, Peter Sellers and Dudley Moore, among others. On television, he had recurring roles in the ITC series &quot;Jason King&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1972).

Price died of heart failure, complicated by a hip fracture, in Guernsey in 1973, at the age of 58. He was cremated at the Foulon Vale Crematorium, Guernsey, and his ashes were buried outside St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church on Sark, next to the traditional burial plot of the Seigneurs of Sark.

In the book &quot;British Film Character Actors&quot; (1982), Terence Pettigrew wrote that Price&#x27;s most successful screen characterisations were &quot;refined, self-centred, caddish and contemptuous of a world inhabited by inferiors. Everything about him was deceptive. He could be penniless and still manage to look as if he owned the bank. But behind all that grand talk and lordly ways, there skulked, in his characters, the most ordinary of shabby, grasping souls.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Price was married to the actress Joan Schofield from 1939 to 1950. They had two daughters. Decades after his death, it was claimed that Price was bisexual.

In April 1954, he tried to commit suicide by gas in a London guest house. Public sympathy led to a revival of his career and the offer of film roles.

<doc id="170420" wikidata="Q3062544" url="?curid=170420" title="Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936">
<text>The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 (No. 58 of 1936) was an Act of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament). The Act, which was signed into law on 12 December 1936, was one of two passed hurriedly in the aftermath of the Edward VIII abdication crisis to sharply reduce the role of the Crown. It is also sometimes referred to as the External Relations Act.

==Background and provisions of the Act==

Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State as originally enacted, the executive authority of the Irish Free State was declared to be vested in the King and declared to be exercisable by the Governor-General as representative of the Crown. But the 1932 Irish general election was won by Fianna Fáil, led by Éamon de Valera and other republicans who had opposed the monarchial elements in the constitution, and part of their programme aimed to reduce the role and visibility of the monarch in Irish political life.

In the aftermath of King Edward VIII&#x27;s signing of an Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State enacted the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolishing the office of the Governor-General so that thereafter the powers of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, insofar as internal matters were concerned, ceased to be exercised in the name of the King. While the Crown was thus abolished for the purposes of internal government, article 51 of the amendment allowed the Executive Council to, for the purposes of foreign relations, make use of &quot;any organ used as a constitutional organ for the like purposes by [other nations of the Commonwealth].&quot;

The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 was enacted the following day to implement that provision. It provided that the diplomatic and consular representatives of the Irish Free State in other countries should be appointed, and that the Irish Free State&#x27;s international agreements should be concluded, by the King acting on the advice of the Executive Council (as. 1–2). Thus the Act preserved the Crown to a limited extent in the sphere of external relations.

More particularly, the Act stipulated (s. 3(1)) that:

It was in that manner specifically provided that so long as the Irish Free State was associated with the members of the British Commonwealth and so long as the members of the Commonwealth continue to recognise the King as the symbol of their special relationship and the King acts on their behalf in the sphere of external affairs, the King shall continue to act in the external relations of the Irish Free State. The meaning of this provision was a matter of considerable uncertainty.

The Act also brought King Edward VIII&#x27;s Instrument of Abdication into effect for the purposes of Irish law (s. 3(2)). Due to the Act&#x27;s phrasing, King Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication was actually back-dated to the day before that on which it took effect in the United Kingdom and most of the other Dominions.

==Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937==

Unfortunately the speed with which the 1936 Act was passed also meant that some serious legal matters had been overlooked by the draughtsmen, touching on the top of the Irish legal hierarchy. In May 1937 these were covered by the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937. As the Governor-Generalship had not been actually abolished by the 1936 Act, this Act was required to validate the otherwise-unlawful appointment of the Chief Justice of Ireland Timothy Sullivan. Sullivan had in turn questionably appointed three High Court judges. The recent appointment of Patrick Lynch as the Attorney General of Ireland and even the pension of the outgoing Governor-General (Domhnall Ua Buachalla) needed to be legalised.

==Repeal==

The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 was repealed by The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 when Ireland became an independent republic outside the Commonwealth of Nations.

The new Act vested the powers formerly possessed by the King in the President of Ireland.

<text>Mega Man (known as in Japan) is a Japanese science fiction video game franchise developed and published by Capcom, featuring the protagonist of the same name. The original game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, and spawned a franchise that expanded to over 50 games on multiple systems. As of July 2024, the series has sold 42 million units worldwide.
Mega Man has been popular among gamers and has been reimagined and evolved as a video game character for over 30 years.

The main series consists of eleven games, the standalone &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot;, the spin-off Game Boy series (released in Japan as &quot;Rockman World&quot;), and various ports, remakes, and compilations. The core games in the franchise have all been set in a single continuity; the storyline of the &quot;classic&quot; series is succeeded by the &quot;Mega Man X&quot;, &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot;, &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot;, and the &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; series. This timeline excludes the spin-off &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; and &quot;Mega Man Star Force&quot; series, both of which take place in an alternate universe where the internet flourished rather than robotics.

== Games ==
=== Original series ===

The original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, dubbed &quot;Classic Mega Man&quot;, marks the start of the franchise, released on the NES on December 17, 1987. In the original series, &quot;Mega Man&quot; is an android originally named Rock (nicknamed &quot;Mega&quot; in later installments), created as a lab assistant by the scientist Dr. Light with Dr. Wily as his partner. Following treachery by Dr. Wily in which he reprogrammed most of Dr. Light&#x27;s robots, Rock volunteered to be converted into a fighting robot to defend the world from Wily&#x27;s violent robotic threats, thus becoming Mega Man.

&quot;Mega Man&quot; is a side-scrolling action platformer. The player character must fight through the levels using Mega Man&#x27;s &quot;Mega Buster&quot;—a cannon attached to his arm—to shoot the robotic enemies inhabiting his environment. When Mega Man was released in 1987, the characteristic that made it revolutionary was the choice given to the player of which robot master to attempt first. After defeating a Robot Master—the boss of a level—Mega Man gains the ability to use that Robot Master&#x27;s special weapon. Each Robot Master represents a specific element or object, with bosses such as Fire Man, Ice Man, Guts Man, Cut Man, Elec Man, and Bomb Man. The weapons Mega Man gains share the theme of the defeated boss. After defeating all of the Robot Masters, Mega Man travels to a multi-stage fortress to confront Dr. Wily, the person responsible for the robotic enemies&#x27; destructive acts. In the fortress, Mega Man fights new bosses, clones of the game&#x27;s Robot Masters, and Wily himself, who is usually in a large multi-phase war machine.

Enemies are weak to at least one weapon; for instance, Fire Man will take more damage from Ice Man&#x27;s weapon than from other weapons. This concept draws inspiration from rock-paper-scissors. Robot Master levels can generally be completed in any order, resulting in a strategic hallmark of the series: determining the best order to defeat bosses and earn weapons. Sequels of &quot;Mega Man&quot; games contain new enemies alongside familiar ones, new bosses, new weapons, and occasionally new gadgets that Mega Man could use. Starting from &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;—Mega Man&#x27;s trusty robot dog companion became a series mainstay, and later installments would provide Rush abilities for Mega Man to use. Later installments of the game give the player the option of commanding other player characters with different abilities, such as Proto Man, Duo, and Bass.

The &quot;Classic&quot; series has yet to reach a definite conclusion. Originally developed for the NES, the original Mega Man series experienced graphical improvements in fourth and fifth-generation installments. The series had no games developed for sixth-generation consoles but returned in the seventh generation purposely sporting graphics, sound, and gameplay similar to the original NES games to inspire a nostalgic look and feel, distributed as downloadable content instead of retail games like the previous installments.

On December 4, 2017, Capcom announced that a new game in the classic series, &quot;Mega Man 11&quot;, would be released in late 2018. Unlike &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; and &quot;10&quot;, this game makes a return to the modern era, featuring Mega Man in a 2.5D environment, with 3D cel-shaded graphics, and is presented in a widescreen aspect ratio. When using a special weapon, in addition to changing colors, Mega Man&#x27;s armor also changes appearance.

=== &quot;Mega Man X&quot; ===

Capcom wanted a redesign in graphics and control as the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series moved from the NES to the SNES, prompting the creation of the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series in 1993. Set years in the future, this series follows the story of Mega Man&#x27;s successor, X, a new, advanced robot that has complete free will over his actions, thoughts and feelings. This character, also a creation of Dr. Light, was put into suspended animation and uncovered 100 years in the future by a researcher named Dr. Cain. The &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series features more detailed 16-bit graphics and greater freedom of movement. In the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series, the characters grow in abilities and power as the game progresses. While the gameplay loop and combat is largely similar to the &quot;Classic Mega Man&quot; series, &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series differs from its increased emphasis on mobility, with X being able to dash and reach higher places through the use of his various armors gained throughout the games, as well as its more mature story than its predecessor.

As the series progressed, various other player characters have appeared, such as fellow Maverick Hunter Zero who was created by Dr. Wily of the &quot;Classic&quot; series, and Axl, a Reploid with an adolescent personality who has the ability to shape-shift into other Reploids. Zero would later star in his own spin-off series, &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot;.

The series was originally intended to conclude with &quot;Mega Man X5&quot;, which will lead to the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series, however, as Inafune began work on the Zero series, its storyline was continued without his supervision, with three additional installments (&quot;Mega Man X6&quot;, &quot;Mega Man X7&quot;, &quot;Mega Man X8&quot;), releasing in 2001, 2003, and 2004 respectively, causing confusion in the games&#x27; official timeline. &quot;Mega Man X8&quot; ended with a cliffhanger, leaving the series to not have a conclusion.

A Role playing game spin-off, Mega Man X: Command Mission, was released on July 29, 2004, developed by Capcom Production Studio 3, who previously worked on the &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; series of role-playing games. The game takes place 100 years after the events of the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series and follows X, Zero, and Axl as they take part in a resistance on an artificial island from its oppressors, and the conspiracy within the Maverick Hunters. Due to the game being mostly independent from the rest of the series, it is unclear whether the game was canon or not.

A mobile game spin-off, &quot;Rockman X DiVE&quot;, was developed and published by Capcom Taiwan and was released on March 24, 2020 in Taiwan, in Japan on October 26, 2022, and globally on August 16, 2021, the latter was published by NebulaJoy. The Steam version of the game was released in Asian territories by Capcom Taiwan on September 15, 2021. The game is a meta-narrative, taking place within a cyberspace database called the &quot;Deep Log&quot; which contains data from all games in the Mega Man X series, along with the experiences of players all around the world. The game follows the Player, and RiCO, the latest administrator of the Deep Log, welcoming the Player and enlisting their help in clearing up the glitches plaguing the database.

The Taiwan/Japanese servers of the game were shut down on September 27, 2023, with the global servers shutting down July 30, 2024. The offline version of the game, &quot;Mega Man X DiVE Offline&quot;, was released on September 1, 2023.

=== &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; ===

In 2002, a follow-up series to the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; franchise was developed for the Game Boy Advance by Inti Creates. Taking place hundreds of years after the events of the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series, the new series stars Zero, a sidekick/ally of X. Set in a post-apocalyptic world in which Reploids were falsely branded as Mavericks and were hunted down, and surviving Reploids formed an opposing faction called &quot;The Resistance&quot;, with the help of human scientist Ciel, Zero awakens and begins his battle against a powerful human-supremacy force called &quot;Neo Arcadia&quot; as he protects the oppressed remaining reploids, uncovers the history behind &quot;The Elf Wars&quot;, and the cause of his slumber.

In the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series, the gameplay is largely similar to Zero&#x27;s play style in the later &quot;Mega Man X&quot; games, featuring a more close-quarter hack-n-slash combat compared to Mega Man X&#x27;s ranged combat, and features an in-depth ranking system that rewards the player with new abilities and enhancements (such as copied abilities from boss characters) in exchange for better play performance. In the fourth game, Zero can also physically steal weapons from enemies (such as axes and guns).

With its fourth installment, &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; became the first series in the franchise to reach a definitive conclusion.

=== &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot; ===
The &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot; series debuted in 2006 for Nintendo DS, once again developed by Inti Creates, and chronologically takes place 200 years after the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series. In this series, progression has led to the equality of humankind and robotkind. Humans are given the physical advantages of robots, and robots are also given biological lifespans. With equality achieved, the world enters a new era of peace. The series follows multiple protagonists as they become involved in a new incident called the &quot;Game of Destiny&quot;, in which people who were chosen with the powers of a &quot;Biometal&quot;, called a &quot;Mega Man&quot;, are pitted against each other to see who was worthy of ruling the world.

The gameplay for Mega Man ZX is similar to the Mega Man Zero series, with an emphasis on close-quarter combat. The player is given the choice of choosing a male or female human protagonist in each installment, a first in the franchise. New to the series is the interconnected Metroidvania-esque world that encourages exploration and replay value, and the ability to collect &quot;Biometals&quot;, which are central to the story. &quot;Biometals&quot; contains data on the legendary heroes of the past (including X, Zero, and the Four Guardians from the &quot;Zero&quot; series). Using these Biometals, the protagonists are able to transform (or &quot;Mega-Merge&quot;, in the English releases) and use the powers of these heroes. In the second game, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man ZX Advent&quot;, the player character is also able to transform into boss characters upon defeating them, which allows them to access previously inaccessible areas.

A third game, code-named &quot;Mega Man ZXC&quot; was under development around 2008, but was cancelled by Capcom&#x27;s decision in favor of developing Mega Man 9. As such, the series has not received a proper conclusion. 

=== &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; ===
Beginning on the PlayStation in 1997, a 3D action game series called &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; was created to take advantage of the console&#x27;s advanced graphics hardware. The &quot;Legends&quot; series is set thousands of years in the future, where the world is covered by immense bodies of water, and humanity is extinct. In its place, Carbons, artificial humans, roam what was left of the world. The story follows Mega Man (Rock) Volnutt, a relic hunter called a &quot;Digger&quot; who scavenges various ruins throughout the world in search of refractor shards that can be mined and traded as currency. &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; brings the gameplay into 3D and is an action-adventure game with third-person shooting role-playing elements.

The &quot;Legends&quot; series was left on a cliffhanger, with only two main games and a spin-off starring mainstay antagonist Tron Bonne before being discontinued. A continuation to the &quot;Legends&quot; series has become an oft-requested game among many Capcom and Mega Man fans. A third game was once under development for the Nintendo 3DS, but on July 17, 2011, Capcom canceled the project saying it did not meet certain requirements. This decision was met with criticism from fans and gaming news outlets.

Despite the many years since the last new release in the series, various characters from the &quot;Legends&quot; series consistently appear in Capcom cross-over games such as &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, and the Servbot characters have become iconic within the Capcom community, making many cameo appearances in non-&quot;Mega Man&quot; games, including &quot;Dead Rising&quot; and as part of the outfit obtained via achievements in &quot;Lost Planet 2&quot;.

=== &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; ===
&quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot;, a series primarily on the Game Boy Advance, began in 2001 as a way for the &quot;Mega Man&quot; games to branch out into the role-playing video game market and to celebrate &quot;Mega Man&quot;″s 15th anniversary. This series features a Net Navi called &quot;MegaMan.EXE&quot;. NetNavis acts as virtual assistants to Operators, such as the protagonist Lan Hikari, an elementary school student and a future hero who uses his Net Navi to help battle computer viruses and other Internet-based threats. The game combines real-time strategy, role-playing, and collectible card games to create a unique fast-paced battle system. Players and enemies are placed in a 6x3 grid, with each side usually occupying 3x3 of the space. Players must select Battle Chips from a select few from a folder deck, and once selected, the game switches to real-time as the player must move to dodge enemy attacks while attacking at the same time using said Battle Chips. Once the Custom Gauge is full, the player is able to select new chips from the deck.

An anime series, &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;, was also produced, ending with 209 episodes and a 50-minute film adaptation. A spin-off game &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot;, was released in 2003. It is the only entry in the series released on a home console rather than a handheld, and takes place chronologically between the first two &quot;Battle Network&quot; games. It is also different from other games in the Battle Network universe as the game plays similarly to the &quot;Classic Mega Man&quot; series with several &quot;Battle Network&quot; elements.

Along with the anime and games, Mega Man Battle Network had toys mainly based on the Advanced PET from the series, the user would buy a starter pack which included 3 battle chips, and an Advanced PET, the toy came in three colors, Red (based on &quot;ProtoMan.EXE&quot;), Black (based on &quot;Bass.EXE&quot;) and Blue (based on &quot;MegaMan.EXE&quot;). Several battle chip expansion packs were also released, when the toy was discontinued, a total of 333 Battle Chips were released. The toy could be linked together via a link cable with another Advanced PET to battle each other.

With the series&#x27; sixth installment, &quot;Battle Network&quot; was the second series in the franchise to reach a definitive conclusion.

=== &quot;Mega Man Star Force&quot; ===
A follow-up to the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; series and released on the Nintendo DS, The &quot;Star Force&quot; series&#x27; marks the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise. &quot;Star Force&quot; takes place roughly 200 years after the events of Battle Network, where network technology has progressed with electromagnetic wave technology to connect the world via radio waves. The series follows a boy named Geo Stelar, who lost his father after a space incident, and Omega-Xis, an extraterrestrial EM-wave fugitive arriving on Earth. The two transform into an EM-Human being known as &quot;Mega Man,&quot; and as they explore both the real world and the EM-world, they face off against malicious EM-beings like Omega-Xis merging with other humans for their malicious intentions.

With the series third installment completing the story arc that started in the first game, &quot;Star Force&quot; became the third series in the Mega Man franchise to have a proper conclusion.

The &quot;Star Force&quot; games are similar to the &quot;Battle Network&quot; games, in which players must use a select number of Battle Cards on a folder deck to attack enemies. However, unlike &quot;Battle Network,&quot; combat takes place in 3D space, with most of the grid occupied by enemies, and the player having only a 1x3 grid to move, making combat much faster-paced and focusing more on player reflexes and quick-reaction time from an opening. To compensate, the collectible card system has been simplified, and players were given the &quot;Mega Attack&quot; ability which allows the player to lock on and move straight to the enemy to attack, and a regenerating shield that can deflect most attacks.

Like &quot;Battle Network&quot;, multiple merchandise and toys have been created for this series, such as add-on accessories for the Nintendo DS, as well as physical Battle Cards that can be used in-game. An anime based on this series began airing on TV Tokyo in October 2006 for 76 episodes. A remake of the first &quot;Battle Network&quot; game, &quot;Operation Shooting Star&quot;, features crossover content between &quot;Battle Network&quot; and &quot;Star Force&quot; and was released exclusively in Japan in 2009.

=== &quot;Rockman Xover&quot; ===
&quot;Rockman Xover&quot; (ロックマン Xover &quot;Rokkuman Kurosuōbā&quot;, pronounced as Rockman Cross-over) is a game for Apple&#x27;s iOS platform. The game marks the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise and was released on November 29, 2012, on the Hong Kong iTunes Store. The game features a new protagonist, OVER-1 (オーバー ワン &quot;Ōbā Wan&quot;), a Reploid created by Dr. Light and Dr. Cossack, as he travels confronting villains from the entire &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise, who have crossed between dimensions to join forces. The game received largely negative reviews from Japanese players, prompting Capcom to cancel the game&#x27;s North American release. The game ceased operations on March 31, 2015.

== In other media ==

=== In other video games ===
Various incarnations of Mega Man appear as playable fighters in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series. The original was a playable fighter in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;. He is assisted by his companion robots, Rush, Beat and Eddie. His sister robot, Roll, is also playable in both games, but is a secret character in the first game. Although he did not make a playable appearance in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot;, and its successor, &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, Zero from &quot;Mega Man X&quot; and Tron Bonne from &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; appear as representatives for the series. X appears as an alternate costume for Zero and Frank West and as a card in Heroes and Heralds mode. The original Mega Man appears in the arcade endings of Thor and Nova, and also appears on a poster in the Days of Future Past stage, and finally, as another card in Heroes and Heralds Mode. X and Zero appear as playable characters in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot;, with Sigma appearing as both a DLC fighter and a major antagonist in the Story Mode, where he merges with the supervillain Ultron to become Ultron Sigma.

MegaMan.EXE and Zero both appear as bonus playable characters in the fighting game &quot;Onimusha Blade Warriors&quot;, while a different version of Mega Man, based on his appearance on the American box art of the first game, appears as a playable fighter in the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions of &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. Mega Man Volnutt and Roll also make an appearance in &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot;, with Zero added to the U.S. version. In 2014, Mega Man appeared as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. An amiibo based on his appearance was confirmed on November 11, and can be utilized in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; as well as &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; where it can be scanned to unlock a costume for the player&#x27;s Mii based on Mega Man&#x27;s. In &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;, the player can unlock a Mega Man costume by scanning the character&#x27;s amiibo.

In &quot;Monster Hunter: World&quot;, Mega Man is a playable character through downloadable content.

=== Television appearances ===
Mega Man&#x27;s first television appearances were produced for the American market and were based on the classic series. First was &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; (1989–91), a show that took place in a universe that was made up of many different Nintendo games. It featured Mega Man as a main character and also featured Dr. Wily as one of the antagonists. This was followed by &quot;Mega Man&quot; (1994–95), the first series to be based in the Mega Man universe.

Mega Man next appeared in anime produced in Japan and based on spin-off series. First was &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; (2002–06), based on the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; video game series (both the anime and the video game series were known as &quot;Rockman.EXE&quot; in Japan). This was followed by &quot;Mega Man Star Force&quot; (2006–08), based on the video game series of the same name (both were known as &quot;Shooting Star Rockman&quot; in Japan).

A series titled &quot;Mega Man: Fully Charged&quot; began airing in 2018. Unlike the previous anime, it is again an American-produced animated series loosely based on the classic series.

In August 2024, it was revealed that Mega Man would be adapted in video game anthology series &quot;Secret Level&quot; created by Tim Miller for Amazon Prime Video.

=== OVA ===
Mega Man starred in &quot;Mega Man: Upon a Star&quot;, a three-part OVA that was developed in Japan. Production on this series started circa 1992-1993, before the American TV series, but was not officially released in the United States until 2005.

=== Film adaptation ===
Development of a film based on &quot;Mega Man&quot; had begun by December 2014 when 20th Century Fox registered a website domain for the film. In September 2015, Fox was revealed to be developing the film with Chernin Entertainment, and its CEO Peter Chernin was set to serve as a producer, with David Ready and Michael Finfer overseeing the production for Chernin, while Mike Ireland and Ryan Horrigan were overseeing for Fox. Fox had attempted to secure the &quot;Mega Man&quot; rights for over two years, and officially signed a deal to do so in early 2017. The filmmaking duo of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman were in final negotiations to write and direct the film for Fox and Chernin Entertainment in July 2017, when Masi Oka joined as a producer. In October 2018, Capcom officially announced that a live-action film was in development at Fox and Chernin Entertainment, and confirmed the involvement of Joost and Schulman along with Oka. The film was part of Capcom&#x27;s plans to increase value in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise following the release of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; original series video game &quot;Mega Man 11&quot; that month, and the company intended for the film to draw different audiences interested in video games or action films. The film was set to depict the world of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; games by using a higher-budgeted film production. In March 2019, The Walt Disney Company officially acquired Fox, and in August, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that several films in development at Fox would not be progressing, citing operating losses from that studio in Disney&#x27;s third fiscal quarter; the &quot;Mega Man&quot; film was believed to have been one of these films. That October, Capcom announced that &quot;Mega Man&quot; remained slated for a live-action film adaptation to create further awareness for the brand.

In January 2020, Disney and Chernin mutually agreed to end their production deal, citing Disney rarely having third-party studios finance their films. Chernin Entertainment was set to retain 70 of its projects from Fox, while the remaining productions were Disney-owned properties that would still involve Chernin as an executive producer. Later that month, Mattson Tomlin was revealed to be rewriting the &quot;Mega Man&quot; script. In April, Chernin signed a non-exclusive multi-year first-look film deal between Chernin Entertainment and the streaming service Netflix. In July, Joost and Schulman said that &quot;big news&quot; would soon be provided for the film, and said they invited Tomlin to co-write the script after he wrote their Netflix film &quot;Project Power&quot; (2020), a process they enjoyed. Joost and Schulman wanted to combine their interest in robotics and the future of automation with their favorite &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, and called Mega Man an &quot;underdog hero&quot;. In August, Tomlin said his approach was to explore Mega Man as a real person with a &quot;primal and emotional&quot; story that can be relatable beyond the character&#x27;s traditional depictions. In December 2021, Joost and Schulman&#x27;s production company Supermarché was revealed to be developing the film alongside Chernin Entertainment for Netflix, with the duo&#x27;s in-house producer Orlee-Rose Strauss also attached. Ryan Leston at &quot;IGN&quot; reported the film was still in early development at that time. In August 2022, Schulman confirmed that he and Joost were writing a &quot;Mega Man&quot; film adaptation for Netflix, and said it would explore the future of automation and &quot;man and robot becoming one&quot; as either being good or bad. Shortly after, Joost said that Josh Koenigsberg, who co-wrote Joost and Schulman&#x27;s film &quot;Secret Headquarters&quot; (2022), was writing a new draft of the screenplay with the duo and hoped to turn in a completed draft to Netflix in the following weeks. Koenigsberg said he had replayed past &quot;Mega Man&quot; video games to research the property.

=== Artbooks ===
Various artbooks and source books have been released for many years in Japan, often including conceptual artwork, interviews with production staff, and background information on the storyline and concepts that are not present within the games themselves. One of the most well-known is the &quot;Rockman Perfect Memories&quot; sourcebook released in 2002 which first confirmed the presence of an alternate timeline (for &quot;Battle Network&quot;), as well as exactly where the &quot;Legends&quot; series fit into the fictional &quot;Mega Man&quot; universe.

Recently a series of artbooks called the &quot;Official Complete Works&quot; has been published for individual &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, showcasing a large collection of artwork and background information. To date, books for the &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;X&quot; (released together as &quot;R20&quot;), &quot;Star Force&quot;, and &quot;Battle Network&quot; series have been produced. Although these books have for many years been exclusive to Japan, Udon Entertainment has finished translating the &quot;Official Complete Works&quot; series for the North American market, called &quot;R25&quot;. &quot;Mega Man: Official Complete Works&quot; was re-released as a hardcover on October 16, 2018, &quot;Mega Man X: Official Complete Works&quot; was followed by a hardcover re-release on November 27, 2018. A hardcover re-release of &quot;Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works&quot; was released on June 11, 2019. On April 2, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Official Complete Works&quot; would be getting a hardcover re-release on August 20, 2019. On October 31, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Mega Man Star Force Official Complete Works&quot; would be getting a hardcover re-release on May 5, 2020.

=== Comics ===
Mega Man has also been featured in many comics and manga in Japan, although few have been localized in North America.

The most well-known series is produced by Hitoshi Ariga (who went on to provide character designs and artwork for future official Capcom releases, including the Super Famicom game &quot;Mega Man and Bass&quot;). The series began with &quot;Rockman Remix&quot;, later known as &quot;Rockman Megamix&quot;, and followed up by &quot;Rockman Gigamix&quot;. The &quot;Megamix&quot; portion of the series would eventually be brought to North American shores thanks to Udon Entertainment, also responsible for the localization of the short &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot; manga by Shin Ogino. In the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, Dr. Light was known as Dr. &quot;R&quot;ight, so many of his robots featured in Ariga&#x27;s comic have &quot;R&quot;s in their designs. Udon did not alter this detail in the English version of &quot;Mega Man Megamix&quot;.

In addition, Viz Media localized the 13-volume &quot;Rockman EXE&quot; manga by Ryo Takamisaki under the name &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;. Takamisaki would later serialize a short adaptation of &quot;Mega Man Star Force 3&quot; that was never published outside Japan.

Some other manga series that have not been localized outside Japan include a 12-volume &quot;Rockman X&quot; adaptation by Yoshihiro Iwamoto, over 15 &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;X&quot; adaptations by Shigeto Ikehara, a light-hearted adaptation of &quot;Rockman Zero&quot; by Hideto Kajima, a slapstick adaptation of &quot;Shooting Star Rockman&quot; by Masaya Itagaki, another &quot;Battle Network&quot; adaptation by Jun Keijima and Miho Asada called &quot;Rockman EXE Battle Story&quot;, and a short series of slapstick &quot;Battle Network&quot; and &quot;Star Force&quot;-themed adaptations by Takumi Kawano.

Dreamwave Productions and Brazilian publisher Magnum Press made its own comic books based on the classic game series. The Brazilian series, &quot;Novas Aventuras de Megaman&quot; (&quot;New Adventures of Megaman&quot;), were originally published and sold in Brazil between 1996 and 1997 and drew certain criticism for featuring bizarrely altered storylines (with characters from several installments appearing at random, as well as erotic and sexual innuendo in Mega Man and X&#x27;s relationship with Roll) as well for frequent nudity involving Roll and an original character named Princesa, which attempted to take over the status as the main character of the comics; its sudden end on a cliffhanger. The series was illustrated by Erica Awano, Eduardo Francisco, Daniel HDR and others.

The Dreamwave series lasted only four issues and also ended abruptly, with plot-threads from the first three issues being dropped completely in the final issue and the inclusion of a short story promising a &quot;Mega Man X&quot; follow-up that never materialized. This was one of several Dreamwave Capcom comics that were cut short or simply never made it to issue #1, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; and &quot;Rival Schools&quot;.

On July 20, 2017, it was announced that &quot;Mega Man Megamix&quot; would be getting remastered on January 24, 2018, titled &quot;Mega Man: Mastermix&quot; These releases will contain remastered versions of the original stories and in full color provided by Josh Perez. And on September 29, 2018, It was announced that &quot;Mega Man Mastermix&quot; would be getting released in trade paperback form on April 2, 2019.

In July 2024, Udon Entertainment announced a &quot;Mega Man&quot; comic for release in 2025.

====Archie Comics====
In April 2011, Archie Comics released their first issue in an ongoing series of licensed comics based on the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise which features the titular character going against his nemesis Dr. Wily in various, original story arcs. The overall concept was created and almost exclusively written by Ian Flynn, who was also the head writer for Archie Comics&#x27; other video game licensed comic series &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Consequently, as of May 2013, both series have been crossed-over in a major story arc called &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;, which spans twelve issues between the &quot;Mega Man&quot; comics, the main &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comics, and the latter&#x27;s side-series &quot;Sonic Universe&quot;. The popularity of this crossover is such that another meeting of the two series, &quot;Worlds Unite&quot;, was announced for spring of 2015. The series was put on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; after Issue 55.

=== Junior novel ===
In 1990, a junior novel version of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; novel series. Mega Man is turned human by Dr. Light during an accident in a machine designed to clone Mega Man. Instead of a Mega Buster, human Mega Man uses a hand gun, and instead of being able to copy the robot master&#x27;s weapons, he instead takes them off of their arms. For some reason, being human does not affect him much and he is still able to consume E-drinks (Energy Tanks) and gain a power boost. The book follows the general plot of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; and even provides game hints at the end of some chapters.

=== Music ===
Ascertaining the identity of video game composers, especially prior to the fifth generation of consoles, can be difficult, as the composers were often uncredited or credited under a pseudonym. Recent soundtrack releases and interviews have discovered the true names of the composers; and in some cases, specific track credits.

The indie rock music group The Protomen dedicated their first two albums to a rock opera based on Mega Man, called &quot;The Protomen&quot; (2005) and &quot;Act II: The Father of Death&quot; (2009).

Independent rap artist Mega Ran remixed several Mega Man tracks for an album called &quot;Mega Ran&quot; (2007) and several follow-up albums, which were officially licensed by Capcom. He now holds a Guinness World Record for the most songs recorded referencing Megaman with 130.

Indie video game cover band The Megas (band) is a band that covers the music of the original NES Mega Man games, known for adding their own twist on the original story in their lyrics such as giving Robot Masters distinct personalities unseen in the games. &quot;Get Equipped&quot; (2008), their debut album covering the events of Mega Man 2; while their most recent albums, &quot;History Repeating: Blue&quot; (2012) and &quot;History Repeating: Red&quot; (2014) cover the events of &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==

According to GamesRadar, the &quot;Mega Man&quot; games were the first to feature a non-linear &quot;level select&quot; option. This was a stark contrast to both linear games (like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;) and open world games (like &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Metroid&quot;). GamesRadar credits the &quot;level select&quot; feature of &quot;Mega Man&quot; as the basis for the non-linear mission structure found in most open-world, multi-mission, sidequest-heavy games, including modern games like &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot;. In &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; tenth episode &quot;Raging Demon&quot;, Ryu and Ken were seen playing &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; from a gift from Ken&#x27;s father.

The original Mega Man series was well received, with IGN ranking all six original titles in the top 100 best NES games. Mega Man 2 in particular is widely regarded as the best of the series and one of the finest and most influential platformers of all-time. IGN ranked it as the fourth best NES game, behind only Super Mario and Legend of Zelda titles, calling it &quot;virtually flawless&quot; and its gameplay &quot;oft-replicated and never exceeded&quot;.

The &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series has been positively received. The first Mega Man X game was widely acclaimed by critics since its release. Gaming magazines in the United States and Europe including &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;Game Players&quot;, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;Super Play&quot;, and the German version of &quot;Total!&quot; consistently lauded the game&#x27;s visuals, audio, control, and overall gameplay. &quot;Game Players&quot; summarized &quot;Mega Man X&quot; as &quot;a near-perfect cart with classic gameplay, excellent graphics and sound and tons of hidden items and power-ups&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; stated that the game had &quot;great control and fun&quot; along with &quot;challenging play&quot;.

Websites such as IGN, GameSpot, GamesRadar, and 1UP.com retrospectively held &quot;Mega Man X&quot; as a successful milestone in converting the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series from its increasingly stale existence on the NES to the SNES. Brett Elston of GamesRadar stated, &quot;&quot;X&quot; was a total reinvention of the series, a perfectly executed update that had fans anticipating its release with a fervor the franchise hadn&#x27;t seen since the &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; days.&quot;

&quot;Mega Man X&quot; received criticism from some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the &quot;EGM&quot; review panel all noted that the game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. &quot;Super Play&quot; editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. &quot;A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits,&quot; Nicholson explained. &quot;Within the level you&#x27;ll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit to put pressure on your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you&#x27;ll see we&#x27;re not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; criticized how little the game had changed stating that &quot;the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles.&quot; The game&#x27;s title initially proved a source of some confusion; the gaming media reported that many gamers mistook the &quot;X&quot; for the roman numeral 10.

&quot;Mega Man X&quot; was ranked number 58 in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; in its 100th issue in September 1997, number 103 in the publication&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Games&quot; list for its 200th issue in February 2006, and the 11th best SNES game of all time in its August 2008 issue. Both GamesRadar and ScrewAttack listed &quot;Mega Man X&quot; as the eighth best game in the SNES library. &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly listed it as the eighth greatest 16-bit video game. &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered it the 120th best game of all time in its own 200th issue in December 2009. IGN named it the twelfth-best on its own top 100 SNES games list in 2011.

&quot;Mega Man X&quot; was a commercial success. The SNES version has sold 1.16 million copies worldwide as of March 31, 2021, making it the 89th best-selling Capcom game of all time. IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham speculated that the game&#x27;s more mature storyline and its inclusion of numerous gameplay extensions over the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series helped create a &quot;unique cadre of fans&quot;. A spin-off series, &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot;, began in 2002 on the Game Boy Advance handheld as a result of the immense popularity of the character Zero.

The &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; games have earned generally positive reviews. Review sources both criticized and praised the high difficulty level of the game and remarked that they were similar in nature to earlier installments in the Mega Man series. Positive reviews noted the variety of abilities and customization along with an engaging story than compared to its earlier series, while negative reviews focused on the series repetitiveness and lack of originality. Review scores were lower for the last two games in the series, with critics pointing out that the games were just using the same gameplay without introducing anything new. When the first game in the series came out, reviewers were quick to hail a return to what they considered &quot;the Mega Man roots&quot;, however some fans criticized that the lack of knowing which boss the player will face next was a change for the worse and that it &quot;takes away what made the series unique in the past&quot;.

Overall, the character of Mega Man has been well received by critics. IGN called him an icon of Capcom. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed Mega Man as their fourth favourite hero, citing his ability to steal weapons from downed Robot Masters. Mega Man was also listed as the best robot in video games by many sources such Joystick Division, UGO Networks, and &quot;Complex&quot;. GameDaily ranked him as the best Capcom character of all time. UGO Networks listed Mega Man as one of their best heroes of all time, and called him &quot;one of the most iconic video game heroes of all time&quot;. He was included in GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;All Time Greatest Video Game Hero&quot; contest and reached the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; round before losing to Mario. In a &quot;Famitsu&quot; poll done in February 2010, Mega Man was voted by readers as the twenty-second most popular video game character. The 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; lists Mega Man as the 23rd most popular video game character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 12th &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; protagonist in games.

&quot;Complex&quot; ranked him as having the tenth best fighting game cameos for his guest appearances in &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; in 2012. Joystick Division cited his rivalry with Dr. Wily as seventh of the ten greatest in video games, adding giving &quot;great credit to this rivalry for its open-endedness&quot; and GamesRadar listed him and Proto Man as having one of the best brotherly rivalries in gaming. UGO Networks have placed Mega Man as the eighth character who most deserves his own movie.

1UP.com described Mega Man as &quot;Capcom&#x27;s ill-treated mascot&quot;, and &quot;one of the most incongruous characters of all time&quot;, saying &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t be completely incorrect to assume that the popularity of the series has almost nothing to do with Mega Man himself&quot;, but with &quot;his rivals, his enemies, and their abilities.&quot; IGN agreed with his dependency on support characters, saying Zero is &quot;cooler than Mega Man&quot;. Den of Geek listed Mega Man&#x27;s incarnation from &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; as the 15th best cameo in fighting game history due to how it represented Capcom&#x27;s lack of interest in featuring other games as of 2012, as well as the apparent self-mockery of it due to Mega Man&#x27;s poor characterization. Destructoid described this Mega Man as &quot;legit&quot; stating it was &quot;an unexpected and interesting creative decision by [Capcom] using this version of Mega Man to represent them in what may be one of their biggest games of 2012&quot;.

&quot;Mega Man&quot; series director Keiji Inafune announced the similarly themed &quot;Mighty No. 9&quot; in September 2013, but after much controversy surrounding delays and mishandling, the game was released in June 2016 to a mixed-to-negative reception. Batterystaple Games released the &quot;Mega Man X&quot;-inspired &quot;20XX&quot; in 2014.

<doc id="170429" wikidata="Q6086567" url="?curid=170429" title="Isotropic etching">
<text>In semiconductor manufacturing, isotropic etching is a method commonly used to remove material from a substrate via a chemical process using an etchant substance. The etchant may be in liquid-, gas- or plasma-phase, although liquid etchants such as buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF) for silicon dioxide etching are more often used. Unlike anisotropic etching, isotropic etching does not etch in a single direction, but rather etches in multiple directions within the substrate. Any horizontal component of the etch direction may therefore result in undercutting of patterned areas, and significant changes to device characteristics. Isotropic etching may occur unavoidably, or it may be desirable for process reasons.

<text>The University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC or Kansas City) is a public research university in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. UMKC is part of the University of Missouri System and has a medical school. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the university&#x27;s enrollment was over 15,300 students. It is the largest university and third-largest college in the Kansas City metropolitan area. It offers more than 125 degree programs over 11 academic units. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. UMKC is Kansas City&#x27;s only R1 university. 

==History==
===Lincoln and Lee University===

The school has its roots in the Lincoln and Lee University movement first put forth by the Methodist Church and its Bishop Ernest Lynn Waldorf in the 1920s. The proposed university (which was to honor Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee) was to be built on the Missouri–Kansas border at 75th and State Line Road. Proponents of the school said it would be a location &quot;where North met South and East met West.&quot; 

In 1930, after the Methodists had brought the Kansas City Dental School into their fold, the two plans were merged. The new school was to be called &quot;Lincoln and Lee, the University of Kansas City.&quot; and plans were underway to develop it into a four-year school.

The university was built on a plot, southeast of the Nelson mansion. William Volker had purchased and donated this land for the University of Kansas City. The original Volker purchase did not include the Dickey mansion itself. Dickey died unexpectedly in 1931 and Volker acquired it to be the first building.

===University of Kansas City===

The two groups were to squabble back and forth, with Ernest H. Newcomb attempting to mediate. The Church did not maintain its ties, and the Lincoln and Lee name was abandoned. The school announced that it would start if 125 students enrolled. The target was met, and the University of Kansas City, or &quot;KCU&quot; for short, held its first classes in October 1933 with a faculty of 17 and a student enrollment of 264.

The campus (now expanded to ) is called the Volker Campus. The Dickey mansion is now Scofield Hall. The second building on the campus, the library, was named for Newcomb. A Carl Milles fountain on Brush Creek opposite the Nelson Gallery is called the Volker Fountain.

The University of Kansas City grew quickly, and soon incorporated other existing local private institutions of higher learning. The Kansas City School of Law, which was founded in the 1890s and located in downtown Kansas City, merged into the university in 1938. The Kansas City-Western Dental College followed in 1941 and the Kansas City College of Pharmacy merged in 1943. This was followed by the Kansas City Conservatory of Music in 1959. During this period, the university also established the School of Administration in 1953, the School of Education in 1954, and the Division for Continuing Education in 1958.

===University of Missouri–Kansas City===
On July 25, 1963, at the urging of alumnus Hilary A. Bush, the university became part of the University of Missouri System and $20 million of assets including 23 buildings were transferred to the University of Missouri. At the time, KCU had 3,300 students (2,000 full-time) and 175 full-time faculty.

At the time Missouri already owned the campuses in Columbia and Rolla. Accordingly, the university&#x27;s name was changed to the University of Missouri–Kansas City. After this, UMKC established the School of Graduate Studies in 1964, the School of Medicine in 1970, the School of Nursing in 1980, the School of Basic Life Sciences in 1985 (which was renamed the School of Biological Sciences in the mid-1990s), and the School of Computing and Engineering in 2001.

In 2012, the school conducted studies on whether to rename the school back to the University of Kansas City (while still remaining in the University of Missouri system). In November 2012, the school decided against the change noting at the time, &quot;while prospective students and the community at large had strong interest in the name change, several other important groups — current students, faculty/staff, and alumni — do not favor a name change at this time.&quot;

In the mid and late 2010s, UMKC came under fire for corruption and cover-ups that alleged a pursuit of outside money above all else. Critics highlighted examples in the management school and pharmaceutical school, including a faculty member who required international students to perform personal tasks for him and false information used to rank the business school.

==Academics==
=== Academic units ===
Today, the academic divisions of UMKC are as follows:
* the College of Arts and Sciences
* the Conservatory of Music and Dance
* the Henry W. Bloch School of Management
* the School of Science and Engineering
* the School of Dentistry
* the School of Education
* the School of Law
* the School of Medicine
* the School of Nursing and Health Studies
* the School of Pharmacy
* the School of Graduate Studies

The School of Medicine is known for its six-year post-secondary program, wherein a student spends only six years obtaining both a Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Medicine degree. The school operates two campuses, one in Kansas City, Missouri, and one in St. Joseph, Missouri. The School of Medicine in Kansas City, Missouri, is known as the Health Sciences District campus or HSD. It is situated away from the main campus on Hospital Hill, where it is connected to University Health Truman Medical Center, an extensive research hospital. The St. Joseph campus, or STJ, is located within Mosaic Life Care hospital, with construction underway on a new $14.5 million, 22,000-square-foot medical school.
The School of Law is one of four law schools in Missouri (St. Louis University School of Law, University of Missouri School of Law, and Washington University School of Law are the others). It is one of only seven American law schools to have educated both a President of the United States (Harry S. Truman) and a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (Charles Evans Whittaker). Truman attended but did not graduate from the law school and never practiced law. The schools that actually have had President-Supreme Court graduates who practiced law are Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, Columbia Law School, the University of Virginia School of Law, the William &amp; Mary Law School and the University of Cincinnati College of Law.

The university is the home of New Letters, a literary magazine, as well as the nationally syndicated public radio program &quot;New Letters on the Air&quot;. For over 50 years, UMKC has broadcast live, taped, and syndicated programming over KCUR, the university&#x27;s radio station and NPR affiliate.

In 2004, the Fungal Genetics Stock Center moved to UMKC where it is in the School of Biological Sciences. The FGSC was founded in 1960 and is supported by the US National Science Foundation. The FGSC distributes research materials around the world, and is part of the World Federation for Culture Collections. Collaborators include researchers at the Broad Institute and the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute.

UMKC Theatre is considered to have one of the stronger M.F.A. programs in acting in the country. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 the MFA costume design program was ranked in the top 10 best costume design schools in the country by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

The university is the site where the Supplemental Instruction program was established and developed.

=== Rankings ===


In 2014, &quot;Princeton Review&quot; named the university a &quot;Best Value&quot; public university, for the third consecutive year.

 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges rankings, UMKC was ranked 269th (tied) in the National Universities category.

==Athletics==
UMKC&#x27;s mascot is Kasey Kangaroo (originally drawn by Walt Disney). Historically, UMKC athletics had used the identity of &quot;UMKC Kangaroos,&quot; but the short form &quot;Roos&quot; was widely used both within and outside of the program. On July 1, 2019, the athletic program officially rebranded itself as the Kansas City Roos. The school&#x27;s colors are old gold and royal blue. It is a member of the NCAA&#x27;s Division I Summit League, having rejoined that conference on July 1, 2020, after seven years in the Western Athletic Conference.

The men&#x27;s soccer team won the Summit League men&#x27;s soccer championships in 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2010. The team set an NCAA record on October 12, 2001, with the fastest trio of goals scored in Division I soccer during the MLS era, by scoring three times in 1:46 against Valparaiso University. Notable Roos soccer players have included goalkeepers Kevin Corby and Connor Sparrow, defenders Roberto Albuquerque and Coady Andrews, forwards Levi Coleman, Eric McWoods, and Jordan Rideout, and midfielders Manny Catano, Jony Muñoz, and Bryan Pérez.

The department sponsors: men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s tennis and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s golf and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track &amp; field and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, men&#x27;s cross country and women&#x27;s cross country, softball, and volleyball. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play at Swinney Recreation Center. UMKC sponsors 16 sports for both men and women at the intercollegiate level. In April 2007, the school dropped its Co-Ed Rifle Program in order to add women&#x27;s soccer and men&#x27;s baseball. Women&#x27;s soccer was added to the institution for the 2009–10 school year.

==Campuses==
UMKC is spread across multiple locales; the main Volker Campus, home to the majority of university operations, is located in Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s Rockhill neighborhood, east of the Country Club Plaza, and adjacent to both the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the Linda Hall Library. In 2017 the university, in collaboration with University Health Truman Medical Center, Children&#x27;s Mercy Hospital, the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill. This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.

===Volker Campus===
UMKC has two campuses in Kansas City. Most of UMKC&#x27;s main campus (Volker campus) is inside a square formed by Volker Boulevard (north), Oak Street (west), 53rd Street (south), and Troost (east). The Health Sciences District campus houses the health sciences academic departments. Directly across Troost from UMKC is Rockhurst University, a Jesuit university.

===Health Sciences District Campus===
The Health Sciences District campus houses the School of Nursing, the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, and the School of Pharmacy.

=== St. Joseph Campus ===
The School of Medicine–St. Joseph campus is currently under construction of a $14.5 million, 22,000-square-foot medical building in St. Joseph, Missouri. It is planning to open in June of 2025.

===Buildings===

==== Biological Sciences Building ====
Built in 1972, the Biological Sciences Building is located north of the Spencer Chemistry Building and east of Katz Hall. The building houses offices, classrooms, and research laboratories of the School of Biological Sciences. The school offers undergrad, grad, and doctoral degrees in the life sciences. The Biological Sciences Building and Spencer Chemistry Building are connected on four of its floors; in addition to this, the south stairwell on the basement floor of the Biological Sciences Building is the north stairwell of the Spencer Chemistry Building.

==== Fine Arts Building ====
The Fine Arts Building was built in 1942 and remodeled in 1975. Currently, the Art and Art History departments use the building. Student works are often displayed in the building&#x27;s UMKC Gallery of Art.

==== Spencer Chemistry Building ====
The building, located at 51st &amp; Rockhill, was built in 1972 using funds donated by Helen Spencer. The purpose of the building was to nurture scientific advancement at UMKC. It currently houses the main office of the Chemistry Department, as well as several chemistry laboratories and classrooms. Spencer Chemistry Building and the Biological Sciences Building are connected on four of its floors.

==== The Quad ====
The majority of UMKC&#x27;s students regularly attend classes in buildings on the Quad. These buildings are Flarsheim Hall, Newcomb Hall, Manheim Hall, Royall Hall, Haag Hall, and Scofield Hall.

==== Cockefair Hall ====
Cockefair, (pronounced coke-fair), is located on Rockhill across from Flarsheim Hall. It was built in 1950 and is named for former faculty member Carolyn Cockefair, who was a humanities professor at UMKC. The building currently houses the departments of History, English, and Philosophy.

==== Flarsheim Hall ====
Flarsheim Hall was built in 1999, and is the largest building on UMKC&#x27;s campus. The Chemistry, Physics, and Geosciences departments, as well as the School of Computing and Engineering, are located in Flarsheim Hall. The hall was named after Robert H. Flarsheim, who left a $9 million endowment to the university in his estate. Flarsheim Hall is located on the northeast corner of the Quad.

==== Haag Hall ====
Haag Hall (pronounced Hāg), built in 1937, contains offices and classrooms including the departments of mathematics and communication studies. Its most recognizable features are large murals stretching along the main stairwell. Haag Hall is connected to both Royall and Flarsheim Halls. Haag Hall is located on the southeast corner of the Quad.

==== Katz Hall ====
Completed in 1965, Katz Hall is named in honor of Isaac and Michael Katz, founders of a major Kansas City drug store chain. The building currently houses the Department of Architecture, Urban Planning + Design&#x27;s offices and classrooms, and was once the location for the School of Pharmacy. The Pharmacy School has moved to the Health Sciences Building on UMKC&#x27;s Hospital Hill campus, approximately four miles north of the Volker Campus.

==== Manheim Hall ====
Manheim Hall, along with Newcomb Hall were the first two buildings originally built for the university. It is named for Ernest Manheim, a professor of sociology, who taught at the university and founded its sociology program. Currently, Manheim Hall houses offices. It is connected to Royall Hall by a second-floor walkway. Manheim is located on the southwest corner of the Quad.

==== Newcomb Hall ====
Newcomb Hall (built in 1936) was named after the first manager of the university, Ernest H. Newcomb. Originally designed to house the library, Newcomb Hall is now home to offices, the University Archives, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection and the Edgar Snow Collections. Newcomb Hall is located on the extreme west edge of the quad.

==== Royall Hall ====
Royall Hall was built in 1968 and is almost exclusively classrooms. Two large lecture halls are on the ground floor, and an astronomical observatory is on the roof. Also on the ground floor is a lounge area with an Einstein Bros. Bagels. Royall Hall is connected to both Manheim and Haag Halls, and to a five-level parking structure across the street. Royall Hall is located on the south end of the Quad.

==== Scofield Hall ====
Scofield Hall was built in 1912, and was originally a private residence. In 1931, William Volker acquired it and donated it to the university. It was named after Carleton Scofield, who was chancellor of the university when it merged with the University of Missouri System. The Arts &amp; Sciences advising office as well as the Language Resource Center and the Department of Foreign Languages &amp; Literatures are located in Scofield Hall. Scofield Hall is located on the north end of the Quad.

==== Epperson House ====

Epperson House is located south of 52nd St. between Oak and Cherry. The Tudor-Gothic structure was completed in 1923 at a cost of $450,000. Originally built as a private residence, Epperson House contained 48 rooms, six bathrooms, elevators, a swimming pool, and a billiard room, spread through four floors. The residence was built by Uriah S. Epperson, who was a banker, industrialist, and philanthropist who amassed significant wealth from insurance and meat-packing industries. The building was donated to the university in 1942 for use as a men&#x27;s dormitory until 1956. Epperson is well known for its apparent hauntings, which earned it a spot on Unsolved Mysteries as one of the top five haunted houses in the United States. The house now sits vacant and unused, awaiting incite from the chancellor on what it will be used for next.

==== University Center and Atterbury Student Success Center ====
The University Center (known as the &quot;U-Center&quot;) was built in 1961. The student dining hall is located here, as is Pierson Auditorium, an often used site for career fairs or luncheons. In 2012, the University Center underwent renovations and was rededicated as the Atterbury Student Success Center. It was designed to promote student academic success.

==== Swinney Recreation Center ====
Swinney Recreation Center was built in 1941, and was gifted to the university by E. F. Swinney. There are five basketball courts, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, racquetball and squash courts, weight-training center, soccer field, and indoor and outdoor tracks at the recreation center. Along with the Kansas City Club and the Pembroke Hill School, Swinney is one of only three locations in Kansas City containing squash courts. University students, faculty and staff have access to the center, and paid memberships are open to others.

==== James C. Olson Center for the Performing Arts ====
Known on campus simply as the PAC (Performing Arts Center), this building partially houses the Conservatory of Music and Dance and the Department of Theatre, as well as the Kansas City Repertory Theatre. The PAC, designed by Kivett and Myers, opened in 1979 and contains White Recital Hall, Helen F. Spencer Theatre, and a black box theatre space, Studio 116.

==== Proposed new downtown arts campus ====
A proposal for a new downtown arts campus got a funding boost on June 26, 2013, with a $20 million challenge grant from the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation, but an additional $70 million needs to be raised. The backers say a new campus will increase the profile of the university&#x27;s arts programs and the new performing arts facility. The first phase involves moving the university&#x27;s Conservatory of Music and Dance to a location in the Crossroads District. Other programs would be moved in subsequent phases.

==Housing==
As of Fall 2022, 7% of the university&#x27;s students lived in housing that was owned by UMKC, operated by it, or affiliated with it. The remainder lived off-campus.

=== Cherry Hall ===

Cherry Street Hall is a former dormitory located at 5030 Cherry Street on the UMKC Volker campus. It was constructed in 1955 and had a more traditional dormitory style. The building had 168 single, double, and triple rooms, housing approximately 300 students. Each floor was segregated by gender and shared a communal bathroom. Students often viewed Cherry Street Hall as offering more opportunities for social interaction compared to Oak Street. The building ceased being a student residence in 2009. In 2011, the Psychology Department relocated to the renovated Cherry Hall.

=== Twin Oaks Apartments ===
Twin Oaks Apartments, formerly situated at 5000 Oak Street, were purchased by the university in 1998 to accommodate students who desired more independent living arrangements than the traditional dormitories could offer. Over time, the buildings began to deteriorate, and in 2002, the university determined that demolishing Twin Oaks and constructing a new residence hall in its place would be more cost-effective. As a result, UMKC stopped leasing to new tenants in 2005 and granted current tenants an extended grace period to find alternative housing. The buildings were entirely vacated by 2006. In September 2006, the Kansas City Fire Department utilized Twin Oaks for firefighter training. The buildings were then demolished with a wrecking ball in November 2006 and the process was completed in 2007.

=== Oak Street Hall ===
Completed in 2004, Oak Street Hall is located at 5051 Oak Street. The five-story building houses approximately 559 students in single room and suite-style two-bedroom suites. The ground level is a large common lobby with a kitchen, laundry facility, music practice rooms, pool tables and a widescreen television set. On floors 2–5, kitchenettes, vending machines, quiet study rooms and social lounges comprise the common areas. Oak Hall was set as the quality standard for the UMKC 30-year Master Plan.

=== Oak Place Apartments ===
The Oak Place Apartments were located at 5050 Oak Street on land once occupied by the demolished Twin Oaks Apartments. Twin Oaks construction on Oak Place started in 2007 and Oak Place was opened to students in 2008. Oak Place consisted of two four story apartment complexes separated by an above ground parking structure. Oak Place housed around 500 students in 1, 2, and 4 bedroom suite style apartments, each complete with a kitchen. Common areas included lounge areas, an academic room, and 1 computer lab in each building.

The apartments were demolished in mid-2020 after various issues with the buildings such as water damage and mold prevailed, forcing students to evacuate. The University of Missouri Board of Curators filed a lawsuit in March 2018 against JE Dunn construction, Gould Evans Associates and other companies involved in the construction of Oak Place. The board listed 34 entities responsible for what it called “reckless” construction and design.

=== Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall ===
Construction on Herman and Dorothy Johnson Hall began in 2008, and it is situated on the UMKC Volker Campus, north of Oak Place Apartments. The four-story building opened its doors to students in 2009 and has a capacity to house up to 328 students in traditional dormitory-style living arrangements. The suites consist of single and double occupancy rooms that share a bathroom, and the building has gender-segregated floors. Amenities available to students include music practice rooms, a computer lab, laundry facilities, and outdoor green space.

==Student activities==

===Greek life===
Greek Life at the University of Missouri–Kansas City is administered by the Office of Student Involvement&#x27;s Fraternity and Sorority Affairs. UMKC is home to 24 Greek Letter Organizations (six social fraternities, seven social sororities, one multicultural sorority, and ten professional fraternities). Although the Greek population is relatively small, it maintains a proud heritage, and several chapters have received awards from their organization&#x27;s international offices.

Greek Life at UMKC traces its origins to 1936, with the establishment of the Bounders Fraternity. The Bounders was the first social organization recognized by the University of Kansas City, and the fraternity originated many of UMKC&#x27;s school traditions. The Bounders even led the push for the removal of university president Clarence Decker. Decker&#x27;s resignation in 1953 opened the door for both intercollegiate athletics and national Greek organizations on campus. In 1956, the Bounders petitioned Delta Chi and received a charter. Delta Chi became the first national fraternity to charter on the UMKC campus. The Delta Rho chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha was founded four years earlier, in 1952; however, it was originally chartered at nearby Rockhurst University and did not submit its charter for official recognition by UMKC until 1963.

===Traditions===

==== Hobo Day and Bum Friday ====
One of the best known traditions in the history of UMKC was Hobo Day, later known as Bum Friday. The campus-wide event was created as Hobo Day, and it first occurred on May 8, 1935, to celebrate the end of the spring semester. Students dressed as hobos throughout the day, and various events and competitions took place. The day started with the Hobo parade, and then everyone gathered in the quad where university president Clarence Decker would read a proclamation that he was cancelling classes and turning the university over to the students. President Decker was an appropriate master of ceremonies for the day, as he had lived the life of a hobo during a portion of his younger years. Events throughout the day included beard growing contests, pie eating contests, glee club performances, skits satirizing campus life, car rallies, talent shows, and athletic contests. The Bum Friday Queen and the Most Fascinating Man were crowned, and the day ended with a dance in which students switched out their bum attire for formal wear. Awards for the daytime activities were presented at the dance. A bonfire closed out the evening. In 1951, Hobo Day was renamed Bum Friday, although the activities essentially remained the same. In 1982, the Student Life Office put a stop to Bum Friday and replaced it with &quot;Roo Fest&quot;, which lacked many of the activities and traditions of Bum Friday and its predecessor, Hobo Day.

==== The Bounder Bells ====
Alumni members of the former Bounders Fraternity raised nearly $30,000 in donations for the purchase of a Van Bergen 49-bell carillon. The Bounder Bells was dedicated on the UMKC campus in May 1989. The carillon is located in the tower of the Swinney Recreation Center. The bells controlled by an electronic keyboard, and they ring on the hour. The bells can also can be programmed to play melodies.

<doc id="170431" wikidata="Q6770843" url="?curid=170431" title="Market system">
<text>A market system (or market ecosystem) is any systematic process enabling many market players to offer and demand: helping buyers and sellers interact and make deals. It is not just the price mechanism but the entire system of regulation, qualification, credentials, reputations and clearing that surrounds that mechanism and makes it operate in a social context. Some authors use the term &quot;market system&quot; to refer to specifically to the free market system. This article focuses on the more general sense of the term according to which there are a variety of different market systems.

Market systems are different from voting systems. A market system relies on buyers and sellers being constantly involved and unequally enabled; in a voting system, candidates seek the support of voters on a less regular basis. In addition (a) buyers make decisions on their own behalves, whereas voters make decisions for collectives, (b) voters are usually fully aware of their participation in social decision-making, whereas buyers are often unaware of the secondary repercussions of their acts, (c) responsibility for making purchasing decisions is concentrated on the individual buyer, whereas responsibility for making collective decisions is divided, (d) different buying decisions at the same time are made under conditions of scarcity --- the selection of one thing precludes the selection of another, whereas different voting decisions are not --- one can vote for a president and a judge in the same election without one vote precluding the other, and (e) under ordinary conditions, a buyer is choosing to buy an actual good and is therefore never overruled in his choice, whereas it is the nature of voting that the voter is choosing among potential alternatives and may be overruled by other voters. However, the interactions between market and voting systems are an important aspect of political economy, and some argue they are hard to differentiate; for example, systems like cumulative voting and runoff voting involve a degree of market-like bargaining and trade-off, rather than simple statements of choice.

==Types==
In economics, market forms are studied. These look at the impacts of a particular form on larger markets, rather than technical characteristics of how buyers and sellers interact.

Heavy reliance on many interacting market systems and different forms of markets is a feature of capitalism, and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system. This article does not discuss the political impact of any particular system nor applications of a particular mechanism to any particular problem in real life. For more on specific types of real-life markets, see commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, commercial markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market, each of which is explained in its own article with features of its application, referring to market systems as such if needed. One of the most important characteristics of a market economy, also called a free enterprise economy, is the role of a limited government.

==Protocols==
The market itself provides a medium of exchange for the contracts and coupons and cash to seek prices relative to each other, and for those to be publicized. This publication of current prices is a key feature of market systems, and is often relevant far beyond the current groups of buyers and sellers, affecting others&#x27; supply and demand decisions, e.g. whether to produce more of a commodity whose price is now falling.
Market systems are more abstract than their application to any one use, and typically a &#x27;system&#x27; describes a protocol of offering or requesting things for sale. Well-known market systems that are used in many applications include:
*auctions - the most common, including:
**Dutch auctions
**reverse auctions
**silent auctions
*rationing 
*Administrative allocation (including the command economy of some states)
*regulated market (including most real-life examples as above)
*black market (the term &#x27;black&#x27; indicating lack of regulation, or any trade, often illegal, operating in violation of official regulations)
The term &#x27;laissez-faire&#x27; (&quot;let alone&quot;) is sometimes used to describe some specific compromise between regulation and black market, resulting in the political struggle to define or exploit &quot;free markets&quot;. This is not an easy matter to separate from other debates about the nature of capitalism. There is no such thing as a &quot;free&quot; market other than in the sense of a black market, and most free-market advocates favor at least some form of regulated market, e.g. to prevent outright fraud, theft, and retain some degree of credibility with the larger public. This political debate is out of the scope of this article, other than to note that the &quot;free&quot; market is usually a &quot;less regulated&quot; market, but not qualitatively different from other regulated markets, in any society with laws, and that what opponents of &quot;free markets&quot; usually seek is some kind of moral purchasing rather than pure rationing.

As this debate suggests, key debates over market systems relate to their accessibility, safety, fairness, and ability to guarantee clearance and closure of all transactions in a reasonable period of time.

==Importance of trust==
The degree of trust in a political or economic authority (such as a bank or central bank) is often critical in determining the success of a market. A market system depends inherently on a stable money system to ensure that units of account and standards of deferred payment are uniform across all players—and to ensure that the balance of contracts due within that market system are accepted as a store of value, i.e. as &quot;collateral&quot; of the holder of the contract, which justifies &quot;credit&quot; from a lender of cash.

Banks, themselves, are often described in terms of markets, as &quot;transducers of trust&quot; between lenders (who deposit money) and borrowers (who take it out again). Trust in the bank to manage this process makes more economic activity possible. However, critics say, this trust is also quite easy to abuse, and has many times proven difficult to limit or control (see business cycle), resulting in &#x27;runs on banks&#x27; and other such &#x27;crises of trust&#x27; in &#x27;the system&#x27;.

==Criticisms==
In &quot;The Economics of Innocent Fraud&quot;, Economist John Kenneth Galbraith criticized the concept of the &quot;market system&quot; as nonsensical and as a weasel word intended to replace the term &quot;capitalism&quot;, but which does not specify anything specific.

== Marketing System ==
Marketing System is a consistent pattern of provisioning relationships in society that exists between members of society including individuals, firms, communities and institutions. While marketing, in the sense of firm&#x27;s micro marketing activities, can be the same across contexts, cultures, and nations, a marketing system is a unique market structure pertaining to a specific context (e.g. agricultural marketing systems in Africa). Marketing system is a differentiated subset of social system. Marketing system is a general term that represents how different patterns of the flows of goods/services from producers to consumers are culturally (uniquely) organised, whereas terms such as market system (a market based economic system of the West), horizontal marketing system (cooperation between two firms at the same level), and digital marketing system (a specific type of centralised channel distribution) represent its context-specific variations. Marketing systems are mostly researched within the discipline of macromarketing.

=== Definition ===
The notion of &quot;aggregated marketing system&quot; signifies all marketing practices at the societal level. Roger Layton defines a marketing system as &quot;a network of individuals, groups and/or entities, embedded in a social matrix, linked directly or indirectly through sequential or shared participation in economic exchange, which jointly and/or collectively creates economic value with and for customers, through the offer of assortments of goods, services, experiences and ideas, that emerge in response to or anticipation of customer demand&quot;. Marketing systems can be rudimentary or complex, emergent or purposefully designed, spatio-temporal or virtual; these can also be aggregate, parallel, symbolic, dignity-based and chrematistics-driven. From the societal perspective, a marketing system represents a public good which can have value over and beyond goods/services it generates.

=== MAS theory ===
MAS (mechanism, action, structure) theory of marketing systems proposed by Layton focuses on social mechanisms, strategic action fields, and emergent marketing system structure to explicate potential sources and causes of marketing system&#x27;s formation, adaptation, and evolution. Social mechanisms include cooperation, specialisation, and self-organisation, while strategic action fields comprise the action and practices of marketing system actors in their specific roles. Layton argues that marketing systems emerge as localised exchanges grow in scope and become stabilised while specialisation expands, and in addition, as key structures become formalised.

=== MSPG theory ===
MSPG (marketing systems as a public good) theory conceptualises a marketing system as a purposefully designed structure that resembles a &quot;public good&quot; in its features. According to this theory, the holistic design of a marketing system as a public good enables its structural elements (e.g. goods, value, exchanges and processes) to become meaningful. Hence, purposeful design precedes emergence.

=== Symbolism in Marketing Systems ===
Marketing systems are strongly driven by symbolism.

<text>A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king, and usually shares her spouse&#x27;s social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king&#x27;s monarchical titles and may be crowned and anointed, but historically she does not formally share the king&#x27;s political and military powers, unless on occasion acting as regent.

In contrast, a queen regnant is a female monarch who rules &quot;suo jure&quot; (Latin for, &quot;in her own right&quot;) and usually becomes queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.

A queen dowager is a widowed queen consort, and a queen mother is a queen dowager who is the mother of the current monarch.

==Titles==

When a title other than king is held by the sovereign, his wife can be referred to by the feminine equivalent, such as princess consort or empress consort.

In monarchies where polygamy has been practised in the past (such as Morocco and Thailand), or is practised today (such as the Zulu nation and the various Yoruba polities), the number of the king&#x27;s wives and their status varies. In Morocco, King Mohammed VI has broken with tradition and given his wife, Lalla Salma, the title of princess; prior to his reign, the Moroccan monarchy had no such title. In Thailand, the king and queen must both be of royal descent; his other consorts need not be royal before marriage to him but are accorded royal titles that confer status. A Zulu chieftain designates one of his wives as &quot;Great Wife&quot;, an equivalent to queen consort.

The situation is more complex in Yorubaland. All of a chief&#x27;s consorts are essentially of equal rank. Although one wife, usually the one married to the chief for the longest time, may be given a chieftaincy of her own to highlight her relatively higher status compared to the other wives, she does not share her husband&#x27;s ritual power as a chieftain. When a woman is to be vested with an authority similar to that of the chief, she is usually a lady courtier in his service who, although not married to him, is expected to lead his female subjects on his behalf.

In the Ottoman Empire, &quot;haseki sultan&quot; (; &quot;Ḫāṣekī Sulṭān;&quot; ) was the title held by the lawful wife and imperial consort of the sultan. The title was first used in the 16th century by Hurrem Sultan, wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, replacing the previous title of &quot;Baş Kadın (&quot;Head Lady&quot;). The bearer of the title occupied the second most important position in the Ottoman Empire for a female after valide sultan (queen mother).

While the wife of a king is usually given the title of queen, there is much less consistency for the husband of a reigning queen. The title of king consort is rare. Examples are Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in Scotland and Francis, Duke of Cádiz, in Spain. Antoine of Bourbon-Vendôme in Navarre and Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in Portugal also gained the title. In Portugal, because of the practice of jure uxoris, both King Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburgo-Gotha and his predecessor, King Pedro of Portugal, were treated as ruling kings in protocol and were thus symbolically co-rulers with their wives, but both really had only the same power of a consort and the queen was the real ruler.

The title of prince consort for the husband of a reigning queen is more common. The monarchies that adopted this title did so because the title of king is usually historically higher than queen, so when the sovereign is female, her husband should never have a higher title than her. An example is Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom; because she insisted that he be given a title identifying his status, he became Albert, Prince Consort.

==Role==

The traditional historiography on queenship has created an image of a queen who is a king&#x27;s &quot;helpmate&quot; and provider of heirs. They had power within the royal household and partially within the court. Their duty was running the royal household smoothly, such as directing the children&#x27;s education, supervising the staff, and managing the private royal treasury. They unofficially acted as hostesses, ensuring the royal family was not involved in scandals and giving gifts to high-ranking officials in a society where this was important to maintain bonds. As a result, consorts were expected to act as wise, loyal, and chaste women.

Some royal consorts of foreign origin have served as cultural transmitters. Due to their unique position of being reared in one culture and then, when very young, promised into marriage in another land with a different culture, they have served as a cultural bridge between nations. Based on their journals, diaries, and other autobiographical or historical accounts, some exchanged and introduced new forms of art, music, religion, and fashion.

However, the consorts of monarchs have no official political power , even when their position is constitutionally or statutorily recognized. They often held an informal sort of power dependent on the opportunities afforded to them. Should a queen consort have had an amiable personality and high intelligence, produced a healthy heir, and gained the favor of the court, then chances were higher she would gain more power over time. Many royal consorts have been shrewd or ambitious stateswomen and, usually (but not always) unofficially, among the monarch&#x27;s most trusted advisors. In some cases, the royal consort has been the chief power behind her husband&#x27;s throne, e.g., Maria Luisa of Parma, wife of Charles IV of Spain. At other times the consort of a deceased monarch (the dowager queen or queen mother) has served as regent if her child, the successor to the throne, was still a minor:
* Queen Regent Anne of Kiev, wife of Philip I of France
* Queen Regent Jeonghui, grandmother of King Seongjong of Korea
* Queen Regent Munjeong, mother of King Myeongjong of Korea
* Queen Regent Sunwon, grandmother of King Heonjong of Korea
* Grand Princess Regent Olga of Kiev, mother of Sviatoslav I of Kiev
* Grand Princess Regent Elena Glinskaya, mother of Ivan IV of Russia
* Queen Regent Mary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots
* Queen Regent Catherine of Austria, grandmother of King Sebastian of Portugal
* Queen Regent Marie de&#x27; Medici, mother of Louis XIII of France
* Queen Regent Anne, mother of Louis XIV of France
* Queen Regent Luisa de Guzmán, mother of Afonso VI of Portugal
* Rani Lakshmi Bai, mother of Raja Damodar Rao of Jhansi
* Queen Regent Maria Christina of Austria, mother of Alfonso XIII of Spain
* Queen Regent Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, mother of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands
* Queen Regent Anna Khanum, mother of Abbas II of Persia
* Queen Regent Helen of Greece, mother of Michael I of Romania

Similarly, in several cases in Siam (now Thailand) the queen consort was named regent during an extended absence of the king:
* Queen Regent Saovabha Phongsri, wife of King Chulalongkorn of Siam, served as Regent during his tour of Europe
* Queen Regent Sirikit, wife of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, served as Regent during her husband&#x27;s extended retreat

<text>Heather Joan Graham (born January 29, 1970) is an American actress. The accolades she has received include nominations for two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, and an Independent Spirit Award.

After appearing in television commercials, her first starring role in a feature film came with the teen comedy &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988), followed by the critically acclaimed film &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; (1989). She then played supporting roles on the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1991), and in films such as &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993) and &quot;Swingers&quot; (1996). She gained critical praise for her role as &quot;Rollergirl&quot; in the film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997). This led to major roles in the comedy films &quot;Bowfinger&quot; and &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (both 1999).

Graham had leading roles in &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; (2001) and &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001), and continued to play supporting roles in the films &quot;Mary&quot; (2005); &quot;The Hangover&quot; (2009) and its sequel, &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot; (2013); &quot;At Any Price&quot; (2012); and &quot;Horns&quot; (2013). She has had roles on television series such as &quot;Scrubs&quot; (2004) and &quot;Californication&quot; (2014). In 2018, Graham made her directorial debut with the comedy &quot;Half Magic&quot;.

Graham is a public advocate for Children International and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.

== Early life ==
Graham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The elder of two children, her younger sister Aimee Graham is also an actress and writer. Her mother Joan (née Bransfield) is a teacher and author of children&#x27;s books, and her father James Graham is a retired FBI agent. Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California when she was nine. She was introduced to acting during a school production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

After high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years. Against her parents&#x27; wishes, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full time.

== Career ==
=== Early work (1984–1988) ===
Graham&#x27;s first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot; (1984). Her first credited film appearance was in the television film &quot;Student Exchange&quot;. In 1986, she appeared on a special &quot;Teen Week&quot; episode of the NBC game show &quot;Scrabble&quot;. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle &quot;License to Drive&quot; (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim&#x27;s character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s mother in flashbacks in their film, &quot;Twins&quot;.

=== From &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; to &quot;Swingers&quot; (1989–1996) ===
In 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive. After &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film &quot;Shout&quot; (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.

After Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show&#x27;s cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;.

She featured in &quot;Diggstown&quot; (1992), alongside James Woods; the well-received &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993), alongside Will Smith; and &quot;The Ballad of Little Jo&quot; (1993), alongside Ian McKellen before reteaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned film adaptation of &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, alongside Uma Thurman. The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;. In 1995, she starred as Jackie in the poorly received &quot;Desert Winds&quot; and guest-starred in an episode of the television series &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. She had a small but important role in &quot;Swingers&quot; (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau&#x27;s love interest. She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot; (1996).

=== Wider industry and public recognition (1997–2003) ===
Graham&#x27;s popularity significantly increased after playing a young porn star in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year, she also starred in the Gregg Araki film &quot;Nowhere&quot;, and had a cameo in the horror hit &quot;Scream 2&quot; as a fictionalised version of herself, portraying Casey Becker in the film within a film &quot;Stab&quot;. She was subsequently cast in &quot;Two Girls and a Guy&quot; (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters, shot in 11 days, which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.

She starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), which was a box-office hit. Shagwell is one of her best-known roles and became a fan favorite. Her turn as Shagwell also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress. She appeared in the music video for Lenny Kravitz&#x27;s cover of &quot;American Woman&quot;. Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.

The 2000 film &quot;Committed&quot; was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes summary of critics felt that &quot;Graham shows she can play a central character&quot;, but noted &quot;she&#x27;s not enough to make &quot;Committed&quot; successful&quot;. The following year, she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns&#x27; &quot;Sidewalks of New York&quot;. In 2002, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige&#x27;s English-language debut film &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: &quot;Respected director Chen Kaige&#x27;s first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue&quot;. In 2009, the site also rated it No. 12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.

Graham&#x27;s other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001), starring Johnny Depp; &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; (2001), opposite Sally Field; &quot;The Guru&quot;, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and &quot;Hope Springs&quot; (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.

=== Focus on independent films and television (2004–2008) ===

From 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films &quot;Gray Matters&quot;, &quot;Broken&quot;, &quot;Adrift in Manhattan&quot; (all 2007), and &quot;Miss Conception&quot; (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office. Her 2005 film &quot;Mary&quot; holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, her first &quot;Fresh&quot; film since &quot;Bowfinger&quot;. The film premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize, as well as three smaller awards. The film also played at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, Deauville Film Festival, and San Sebastián International Film Festival, and co-starred Juliette Binoche, Forest Whitaker, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine. In 2006, she co-starred in &quot;Bobby&quot; as Angela; the film&#x27;s cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

Graham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled &quot;The Accidental Virgin&quot;, which would have focused on &quot;female sexual confusion&quot;, telling the story of a woman who has not had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if it is &quot;something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do&quot;.

On television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She was given special guest-star status on nine episodes of &quot;Scrubs&quot; during its fourth season (2004–2005), and also appeared as George Michael Bluth&#x27;s ethics teacher in an episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in 2004. She played Emily Sanders in &quot;Emily&#x27;s Reasons Why Not&quot;, but the sitcom was cancelled after airing only one episode.

=== &quot;The Hangover&quot; and after (2009–present) ===
In 2009, Graham played the stripper with a heart of gold, Jade, in &quot;The Hangover&quot;, which was released to critical and box-office success. She won the role after Lindsay Lohan turned it down. Though she did not return for the sequel &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;, she reprised her role in the final installment of the trilogy, &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot;. In 2010, she starred in &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;, followed by roles in the unsuccessful films &quot;Father of Invention&quot;, &quot;5 Days of War&quot;, &quot;Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer&quot; (all 2011), and &quot;About Cherry&quot; (2012). Graham was also credited for archive footage of her from &quot;Scream 2&quot; re-used in &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011).

Graham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing video game &quot;EverQuest 2&quot;.

She played Meredith Crown in &quot;At Any Price&quot;, which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals. Other roles include mob lawyer Annette Stratton-Osborne in &quot;Behaving Badly&quot; and short story writer Mary Bellanova in &quot;My Dead Boyfriend&quot; (both 2014). She wrote a comedy screenplay called &quot;Half Magic&quot;, which in 2013 she stated she wanted to direct. She said the story focuses on &quot;these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism&quot;. The film was released in 2018.

In 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.

In 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger, an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic to receive an inheritance from her dying father. Graham also appeared in two TV films sequels based on the V.C. Andrews&#x27; series: &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; and &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger. She appeared in the final season of &quot;Californication&quot; as the mother of David Duchovny&#x27;s long-lost son.

In 2018, she co-starred in the David Cross dark comedy series &quot;Bliss&quot;, which was released by the BritBox streaming service. It starred Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who struggles to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another.

In 2023, Graham starred as Charlotte Sanders in the Netflix Christmas-themed film &quot;Best. Christmas. Ever!&quot; alongside Brandy Norwood, Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeño.

Graham wrote, directed, and starred in &quot;Chosen Family&quot;, which was set for release in 2024.

== Activism ==
Besides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Children International. She stated that what she likes about Children International is that &quot;you are helping a child have a better life. It&#x27;s great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them&quot;. Graham works with the Cambodian Children&#x27;s Fund, also an NGO, which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,&quot; Graham has said. &quot;Women are dying because they don&#x27;t have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children&#x27;s Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We&#x27;re creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.&quot;

In 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur&#x27;s short film &quot;Global Cool&quot; alongside Sienna Miller.

== In the media ==
Graham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in &quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number 74 in the 2005 list and at number 98 in 2006 list. In 2001, she was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by &quot;People&quot;. In 2003, she posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician who later also sawed her in half. Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; for an article titled &quot;The Science of Meditation&quot;. To promote &quot;Emily&#x27;s Reasons Why Not&quot;, she posed for a &quot;LIFE&quot; cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as &quot;TV&#x27;s sexiest star&quot;, which appeared in the January 27, 2006, issue.

Graham is often cast in sexual roles, including those of Felicity Shagwell (&quot;Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me&quot;), porn stars Rollergirl (&quot;Boogie Nights&quot;) and Sharonna (&quot;The Guru&quot;), prostitute Mary Kelly (&quot;From Hell&quot;), porn director Margaret (&quot;About Cherry&quot;), and stripper Jade (&quot;The Hangover&quot; and &quot;The Hangover, Part III&quot;). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that &quot;our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be &#x27;good&#x27; mothers who would never do those things?&quot; and that she likes &quot;the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex&quot;.

In 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman for the Garnier brand of hair care products.

In 2017, Graham recounted a time in the early 2000s when Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein indirectly implied that he would give her a role of her choice if she slept with him. Later, Graham indicated she canceled a planned meeting with Weinstein at a hotel when a friend was unable to accompany her. Graham did not have further contact with Weinstein and she was never cast in any films he produced.

== Personal life ==
Graham has been estranged from her parents in the past. Regarding the media&#x27;s perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t really like to talk about my parents because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press.&quot;

Graham has been practicing transcendental meditation since 1991 after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She has also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: &quot;I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable? Other people&#x27;s pain and misery – it seems kind of sad.&quot;

In 1992, Graham dated James Woods, her co-star in the film &quot;Diggstown&quot;. She later dated British rock star Adam Ant.
From 2008 to 2011, she was in a relationship with Israeli screenwriter Yaniv Raz. She also dated Heath Ledger.

She has been dating John de Neufville since 2022.

<text>Needlepoint is a type of [[canvas]] work, a form of embroidery in which yarn is stitched through a stiff open weave canvas. Traditionally needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas. Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern. Needlepoint is the oldest form of canvas work.

The degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the thread count of the underlying mesh fabric. Due to the inherent lack of suppleness of needlepoint, common uses include eyeglass cases, holiday ornaments, pillows, purses, upholstery, and wall hangings.

==History==
The roots of needlepoint go back thousands of years to the ancient Egyptians, who used small slanted stitches to sew up their canvas tents. Howard Carter, of Tutankhamen fame, found some needlepoint in the cave of a Pharaoh who had lived around 1500 BC.

Modern needlepoint descends from the canvas work in tent stitch, done on an evenly woven open ground fabric that was a popular domestic craft in the 16th century.

Further development of needlepoint was influenced in the 17th century by Bargello and in the 19th century by shaded Berlin wool work in brightly colored wool yarn. Upholstered furniture became fashionable in the 17th century, and this prompted the development of a more durable material to serve as a foundation for the embroidered works of art. In 18th century America, needlepoint was used as a preparatory skill to train young women to sew their own clothing.

==Terminology==
When referring to handcrafted textile arts which a speaker is unable to identify, the appropriate generalized term is &quot;needlework&quot;. The first recorded use of the term needlepoint is in 1869, as a synonym for point-lace. Mrs Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Beeton&#x27;s Book of Needlework&quot; (1870) does not use the term &quot;needlework&quot;, but rather describes &quot;every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas with wool, silk or beads&quot; as Berlin Work (also spelled Berlinwork). Berlin Work refers to a subset of needlepoint, popular in the mid-19th century that was stitched in brightly colored wool on needlepoint canvas from hand-colored charts.

&quot;Needlepoint&quot; refers to a particular set of stitching techniques worked upon stiff openwork canvas.
However, &quot;needlepoint&quot; is not synonymous with all types of embroidery. Because it is stitched on a fabric that is an open grid, needlepoint is not embellishing a fabric, as is the case with most other types of embroidery, but literally the making of a new fabric. It is for this reason that many needlepoint stitches must be of sturdier construction than other embroidery stitches.

Needlepoint is often referred to as &quot;tapestry&quot; in the United Kingdom and sometimes as &quot;canvas work&quot;. However, needlepoint—which is stitched on canvas mesh—differs from true tapestry—which is woven on a vertical loom. When worked on fine weave canvas in tent stitch, it is also known as &quot;petit point&quot;. Additionally, &quot;needlepoint lace&quot; is also an older term for needle lace, an historic lace-making technique.

==Contemporary techniques==

===Materials===
The thread used for stitching may be wool, silk, cotton or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers may also be used, such as metallic cord, metallic braid, ribbon, or raffia. Stitches may be plain, covering just one thread intersection with a single orientation, or fancy, such as in bargello or other counted-thread stitches. Plain stitches, known as tent stitches, may be worked as basketweave, continental or half cross. Basketweave uses the most wool, but does not distort the rectangular mesh and makes for the best-wearing piece.

Several types of embroidery canvas are available: single thread and double thread embroidery canvas are open even-weave meshes, with large spaces or holes to allow heavy threads to pass through without fraying. Canvas is sized by mesh sizes, or thread count per inch. Sizes vary from 5 threads per inch to 24 threads per inch; popular mesh sizes are 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The different types of needlepoint canvas available on the market are interlock, mono, penelope, plastic, and rug.

*Interlock Mono Canvas is more stable than the others and is made by twisting two thin threads around each other for the lengthwise thread and &quot;locking&quot; them into a single crosswise thread. Interlock canvas is generally used for printed canvases. Silk gauze is a form of interlock canvas, which is sold in small frames for petit-point work. Silk gauze most often comes in 32, 40 or 48 count, although some 18 count is available and 64, 128 and other counts are used for miniature work.
*Mono canvas comes in the widest variety of colors (especially 18 mesh) and is plain woven, with one weft thread going over and under one warp thread. This canvas has the most possibilities for manipulation and open canvas. It is used for hand-painted canvases as well as counted thread canvaswork.
*Penelope canvas has two threads closely grouped together in both warp and weft. Because these threads can be split apart, penelope sizes are often expressed with two numbers, such as 10/20.
*Plastic canvas is a stiff canvas that is generally used for smaller projects and is sold as &quot;pre-cut pieces&quot; rather than by the yard. Plastic canvas is an excellent choice for beginners who want to practice different stitches.
*Rug canvas is a mesh of strong cotton threads, twisting two threads around each other lengthwise forms the mesh and locking them around a crosswise thread made the same way; this cannot be separated. Canvases come in different gauges, and rug canvas is 3.3 mesh and 5 mesh, which is better for more detailed work.

===Frames and hoops===
Needlepoint canvas is stretched on a scroll frame or tacked onto a rectangular wooden frame to keep the work taut during stitching. Petit point is sometimes worked in a small embroidery hoop rather than a scroll frame.

===Patterns===
Commercial designs for needlepoint may be found in different forms: hand-painted canvas, printed canvas, trammed canvas, charted canvas, and free-form.

In hand-painted canvas, the design is painted on the canvas by the designer, or painted to their specifications by an employee or contractor. Canvases may be stitch-painted, meaning each thread intersection is painstakingly painted so that the stitcher has no doubts about what color is meant to be used at that intersection. Alternatively, they may be hand-painted, meaning that the canvas is painted by hand but the stitcher will have to use their judgment about what colors to use if a thread intersection is not clearly painted. Hand-painted canvases allow for more creativity with different threads and unique stitches by not having to pay attention to a separate chart. In North America this is the most popular form of needlepoint canvas.

Printed canvas is when the design is printed by silk screening or computer onto the needlepoint canvas. Printing the canvas in this means allows for faster creation of the canvas and thus has a lower price than Hand-Painted Canvas. However, care must be taken that the canvas is straight before being printed to ensure that the edges of the design are straight. Designs are typically less involved due to the limited color palette of this printing method. The results (and the price) of printed canvas vary extensively. Often printed canvases come as part of kits, which also dramatically vary in quality, based on the printing process and the materials used. This form of canvas is widely available outside North America.

On a trammed canvas the design is professionally stitched onto the canvas by hand using horizontal stitches of varying lengths of wool of the appropriate colours. The canvas is usually sold together with the wool required to stitch the trammed area. The stitcher then uses tent stitch over the horizontal lines with the trame stitches acting as an accurate guide as to the colour and number of stitches required. This technique is particularly suited to designs with a large area of mono-colour background as such areas do not require tramming, reducing the cost of the canvas and allowing the stitcher to choose the background colour themselves. The Portuguese island of Madeira is the historic centre for the manufacture of trammed canvases.

Charted canvas designs are available in book or leaflet form. They are available at book stores and independent needlework stores. Charted Canvas designs are typically printed in two ways: either in grid form with each thread intersection being represented with a symbol that shows what color is meant to be stitched on that intersection, or as a line drawing where the stitcher is to trace the design onto his canvas and then fill in those areas with the colors listed. Books typically include a grouping of designs from a single designer such as Kaffe Fassett or Candace Bahouth, or may be centered on a theme such as Christmas or Victorian Needlepoint. Leaflets usually include one to two designs and are usually printed by the individual designer.

Free-form needlepoint designs are created by the stitcher. They may be based around a favorite photograph, stitch, thread color, etc. The stitcher just starts stitching! Many interesting pieces are created this way. It allows for the addition of found objects, appliqué, computer-printed photographs, goldwork, or specialty stitches.

While traditionally needlepoint has been done to create a solid fabric, more modern needlepoint incorporates colored canvas, a variety of fibers and beadwork. Different stitching techniques also allow some of the unstitched, or lightly stitched, canvas to show through, adding an entirely new dimension to needlepoint work. Some of these techniques include &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;light&quot; stitching, blackwork on canvas, and pattern darning.

Needlepoint continues to evolve as stitchers use new techniques and threads, and add appliqué or found materials. The line between needlepoint and other forms of embroidery is becoming blurred as stitchers adapt techniques and materials from other forms of embroidery to needlepoint.

==Famous needlepointers==
=== Historical and political figures===
Royal needlepointers include: Mary, Queen of Scots, Marie Antoinette, . In fact, the American Needlepoint Guild has established a Princess Grace Award (Needlepoint) for needlepoint completed entirely in tent stitch. (This award is not formally associated with the Princess Grace Foundation which presents the &quot;Princess Grace Awards&quot;.)

An American historical figure who was an avid needlepointer is Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington.

=== Modern celebrities===
American football player Roosevelt &quot;Rosey&quot; Grier released a book titled &quot;Rosey Grier&#x27;s Needlepoint for Men&quot; (1973) that shows Grier stitching and samples of his work.

Actress Mary Martin&#x27;s book &quot;Mary Martin&#x27;s Needlepoint&quot; (1969) catalogues her works and provides needlework tips.
The American actress Sylvia Sidney sold needlepoint kits featuring her designs, and she published two popular instruction books: &quot;Sylvia Sidney&#x27;s Needlepoint Book&quot; and &quot;The Sylvia Sidney Question and Answer Book on Needlepoint&quot;.

The MTV documentary &quot;9 Days and 9 Nights with Ed Sheeran&quot; (2014) revealed that Taylor Swift made Sheeran a Drake-themed needlepoint as a friendship gesture.

Actress Loretta Swit&#x27;s book, &quot;A Needlepoint Scrapbook&quot; (1986), includes a design for Ms. Pac-Man.

==Needlepoint stitches==
Most commercial needlework kits recommend one of the variants of tent stitch, although Victorian cross stitch and random long stitch are also used. Authors of books of needlepoint designs sometimes use a wider range of stitches. Historically, a very wide range of stitches have been used including:

* for Arraiolos rugs
*Bargello (needlework)
** Old Florentine stitch
** Hungarian ground stitch
** Hungarian point stitch
*
** Upright cross stitchThis stitch creates an almost crunchy texture and can be used on both single and double canvas. 
*(Victorian) 
* Gobelin stitch – A slanting stitch worked over two horizontal threads and one perpendicular.
** Encroaching upright Gobelin stitch
*Long stitch - A pattern of triangles in double rows used on a single canvas.
*
*es. Variants include:
** Basketweave, Continental and Half cross
* Whipped flower stitch

There are many books that teach readers how to create hundreds, if not thousands, of stitches. Some were written by famous stitchers, such as Mary Martin and Sylvia Sidney. However, is &quot;The Needlepoint Book&quot; by Jo Ippolito Christensen, Simon &amp; Schuster. First published in 1976 by Prentice-Hall, the widely distributed text has been continuously in print and was revised in 2015. Over 425,000 copies have been sold as of 2023. It contains 436 stitches and 1680 illustrations in 560 pages.

==In popular culture==
A needlepoint stitched by Cullen Bohannon&#x27;s murdered wife, Mary, is referred to repeatedly throughout &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; season 1. For example, in episode 2, &quot;Immoral Mathematics&quot; (November 13, 2011), Bohannon flashes back to seeing Mary stitching the needlepoint; in episode 3, &quot;A New Birth of Freedom&quot; (November 20, 2011), Bohannon finds a piece of that finished needlework in the personal effects of the now-deceased foreman, Daniel Johnson (who in the previous episode had admitted to being part of the Union outfit that raped and killed Mary); and in episode 4, &quot;Jamais je ne t&#x27;oublierai&quot; (November 27, 2011), the inebriated Bohannon realizes he&#x27;s lost the needlepoint, and he gets into a fight with Bolan, when the latter tauntingly reveals that he has the swatch.

Needlepoint backgrounds were used most famously on the long running game show, &quot;Family Feud&quot; from its premiere with Richard Dawson in 1976 to the end of the Ray Combs era in 1994.

<doc id="170442" wikidata="Q5035283" url="?curid=170442" title="Caper story">
<text>The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction. The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story. 

The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime, and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed. For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters—in different stories Dortmunder&#x27;s gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property. By contrast, the same author&#x27;s Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime—the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block&#x27;s Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr&#x27;s criminal talents to solve murders.

A caper may appear as a subplot in a larger work. For example, Tom Sawyer&#x27;s plot to steal Jim out of slavery in the last part of &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is a classic caper.

== Etymology ==
The verb &quot;to caper&quot; means to leap in a frolicsome way, and probably derives from &quot;capriole&quot;, which derives from the Latin for goat (&quot;Capra&quot;). The noun &quot;caper&quot; means a frolicsome leap, a capricious escapade or an illegal or questionable act.

In American state courts, JNOV is the practice whereby the presiding judge in a civil jury trial may overrule the decision of a jury and reverse or amend their verdict. In literal terms, the judge enters a judgment notwithstanding the jury verdict. The rarely granted intervention permits the judge to exercise discretion to avoid extreme and unreasonable jury decisions. In civil cases in U.S. federal court, the term was replaced in 1991 by the renewed judgment as a matter of law, which emphasizes its relationship to the judgment as a matter of law, formerly called a directed verdict.

A judge may not enter a JNOV of &quot;guilty&quot; following a jury acquittal in United States criminal cases. Such an action would violate a defendant&#x27;s Fifth Amendment right not to be placed in double jeopardy and Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. If the judge grants a motion to set aside judgment after the jury convicts, however, the action may be reversed on appeal by the prosecution. This can only be appealed after a guilty verdict; a judgment cannot be appealed if made after the prosecution rests, but before the defense begins, rather than after a verdict. In U.S. federal criminal cases, the term is &quot;judgment of acquittal&quot;.

A JNOV is appropriate only if the judge determines that no reasonable jury could have reached the given verdict as a matter of law. For example, if a party enters no evidence on an essential element of their case but the jury, the finder of fact, still finds in their favor, the court may rule that no reasonable jury would have disregarded the lack of evidence on that key point and reform the judgment. Even if a judge erroneously excludes evidence and acquits on the basis of insufficient evidence, a judgement of acquittal cannot be appealed, as ruled by the Supreme Court in &quot;Sanabria v. United States&quot; (1978). 

The reversal of a jury&#x27;s verdict by a judge occurs when the judge believes that there were insufficient facts on which to base the jury&#x27;s verdict or that the verdict did not correctly apply the law. That procedure is similar to a situation in which a judge orders a jury to arrive at a particular verdict, called a directed verdict. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict is occasionally made when a jury refuses to follow a judge&#x27;s instruction to arrive at a certain verdict.

<text>Inter-library loan (abbreviated ILL, sometimes called document delivery, document supply, inter-lending, inter-library services, inter-loan, or resource sharing) is a service that enables patrons of one library to borrow materials that are held by another library.

==Methods==
After receiving a request, the borrowing library identifies potential lending libraries with the desired item. The lending library delivers the item physically or electronically, and the borrowing library receives the item and delivers it to their patron, and if necessary, arranges for its return. Sometimes, fees accompany interlibrary loan services. 

Libraries can define what materials from their holdings are eligible for interlibrary loan. Many journal or database licenses specify whether a library can or cannot supply journal articles via ILL, with libraries negotiating for ILL eligibility.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed ISO standards 10160 and 10161 to standardize terminology and define a set of communication protocols between interlibrary loan systems.

==History==
Informal borrowing and lending between libraries has examples in Western Europe as early as the 8th century CE.

In the 16th century, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc unsuccessfully attempted to establish an interlibrary loan system between the Royal Library at the Louvre Palace in Paris and the Vatican Library in Rome.
In 1876, Massachusetts librarian Samuel Swett Green published a proposal for an interlibrary loan system modeled on European examples, writing, &quot;It would add greatly to the usefulness of our reference libraries if an agreement should be made to lend books to each other for short periods of time.&quot;In 1886, Joseph C. Rowell, librarian at the University of California, Berkeley, sought permission to begin an interlibrary loan program. In 1894, Rowell initiated U.C. Berkeley&#x27;s first program of interlibrary lending with the California State Library. In 1917, the American Library Association established a national code for interlibrary loan in the United States.

In China, formalized interlibrary loan policies were established as early as 1924 through the Shanghai Library Constitution.

In 1927, an increase in international lending and borrowing between libraries following the First World War led to the establishment of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). IFLA published the &quot;International Resource Sharing and Document Delivery: Principles and Guidelines for Procedure&quot; in 1954.

In Great Britain, Kate Edith Pierce became the chair of the newly formed East Midlands Regional Library Bureau in 1935. Enabled by Carnegie Trust funding, the Bureau introduced formalized &quot;Inter-Library Lending&quot;.

The Ohio State University and others in Ohio began integrating campus library systems at an early date. In the 1960s, state funds supported development of the Ohio College Library Center, now the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC).

In 1994, the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) of the ALA (America Library Association) formed an ALA Interlibrary Loan Code for the United States.

In 1997, following the 1997 Spring Creek flood, which significantly damaged its physical journal holdings, Colorado State University developed RapidILL as a resource sharing solution. The service has grown to include over 300 member libraries internationally, with most member libraries in the United States. In 2019, Ex Libris acquired RapidILL from CSU.

==Resource sharing networks==

Libraries have established voluntary associations for resource sharing, organized on a regional or national basis, or through other affiliations such as university systems with multiple campuses, communities of libraries with related holdings and research interests, or established library consortia.

The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) guides interlibrary loan policies internationally.

=== North America ===
In the US, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is used by public and academic libraries. Formerly, Research Libraries Group (RLG) was used primarily by academic libraries, but it merged with OCLC in July, 2006. The Center for Research Libraries (CRL) is a major resource sharing network in North America with a buy-in membership system. Other large resource sharing networks include Libraries Very Interested in Sharing (LVIS) and Amigos.

Medical libraries in the United States participate in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine to share resources. The National Library of Medicine developed the request routing system DOCLINE for this purpose.

=== Africa ===
The South African Bibliographic and Information Network (SABINET) was developed in 1983 for the purposes of collection development and resource sharing across libraries in South Africa.

In Ghana, the Ghana Inter-Library Lending and Document Delivery Network (GILLDDNET) pioneered resource sharing in West Africa. The network was replaced in 2004 by the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries (CARLIGH).

=== Central and South America ===
&quot;Consorcio Iberoamericano para la Educación en Ciencia y Tecnología&quot; (ISTEC) is a consortium and resource sharing network of 50 institutions across 17 countries in Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula, with a focus on science and technology materials. Many ISTEC member libraries use the software Celsius, which was developed as part of the consortium initiative.

&quot;Consorcio de Bibliotecas Universitarias de El Salvador&quot; (CBUES) is a resource sharing consortium of institutions in El Salvador with comments that there are other CBUES affiliated institutions along the Atlantic coast, including libraries from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico and Panama; however only El Salvadorian institutions are listed on CBUES&#x27;s website.

=== Europe ===
In France, the PEB ILL network services over 300 libraries using the SUPEB ILL software.

In Germany, Gateway Bayern (GB) is the ILL network and tool for Bavarian libraries, including the Bavarian State Library.

=== Asia ===
National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa)DELNET, the Developing Library Network (formerly the Delhi Library Network), is a resource sharing network supporting India and South Asia.

The National Diet Library of Japan serves as a resource sharing hub for Japanese-language materials domestically and internationally.

Launched in 1998, China Academic Library and Information System (CALIS) is a Beijing-based academic library consortium that facilitates interlibrary loan among research libraries in China.

=== Oceania ===
Australia uses TROVE

New Zealand utilizes the National Library of New Zealand.

<doc id="170452" wikidata="Q748836" url="?curid=170452" title="Simple Minds">
<text>Simple Minds are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1977, becoming best known internationally for their song &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; (1985), which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Other commercially successful singles include &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot; (1982), &quot;Glittering Prize&quot; (1982), &quot;Someone Somewhere in Summertime&quot; (1982), &quot;Waterfront&quot; (1983), &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot; (1985), &quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot; (1986), &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; (1991), &quot;She&#x27;s a River&quot; (1995), and the UK number one single &quot;Belfast Child&quot; (1989).

Simple Minds have achieved 24 top 40 singles on the UK Singles Chart, and 23 top 40 albums on the UK Albums Chart, including five number one albums: &quot;Sparkle in the Rain&quot; (1984), &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (1985), &quot;Live in the City of Light&quot; (1987), &quot;Street Fighting Years&quot; (1989), and &quot;Glittering Prize 81/92&quot; (1992). They have sold more than 60 million albums worldwide, and were the most commercially successful Scottish band of the 1980s. Simple Minds have had chart success in the United States, Australia, Germany, Spain, Italy and New Zealand. Despite various personnel changes, they continue to record and tour.

In 2014, Simple Minds were awarded the &quot;Q&quot; Inspiration Award for their contribution to the music industry and an Ivor Novello Award in 2016 for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors (BASCA). Other notable recognitions include nominations for both the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction and MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction for &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; in 1985, nomination for the Brit Award for British Group in 1986 and for the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group in 1987. &quot;Belfast Child&quot; was nominated for the Song of the Year at the Brit Awards 1990.

Singer Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill are the two members who have been with the band throughout its whole history, and the only current permanent members and songwriters. As of 2023, the other current members of the live and studio band are bassist Ged Grimes, drummer Cherisse Osei, backing singer Sarah Brown, guitarist and keyboardist Gordy Goudie and keyboardist Erik Ljunggren. Notable former members include keyboardist Mick MacNeil, bassists Derek Forbes and John Giblin and drummers Brian McGee and Mel Gaynor.

==History==
===Early years (1977–1979)===
Simple Minds originated from the punk band Johnny &amp; The Self-Abusers, formed in early 1977 on Glasgow&#x27;s South Side, as the brainchild of Alan Cairnduff. Cairnduff left the organisation of the band to John Milarky, suggesting that he enlist two strangers, singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill, who had been acquainted since age eight, roped in their school friends Brian McGee and Tony Donald to play drums and bass respectively. Milarky served as singer, guitarist and saxophonist, and recruited his friend Allan McNeill to be the band&#x27;s third guitarist. Kerr doubled on keyboards, and Burchill also played violin. 

On 11 April 1977, Johnny &amp; The Self-Abusers held their first performance at the Doune Castle pub in Glasgow, following up two weeks later as the opening act for Generation X in Edinburgh. They performed concerts in Glasgow over the ensuing summer, but a split developed in the band, with Milarky and McNeill forming one faction and the other consisting of Kerr, Donald, Burchill and McGee; In November 1977, Johnny &amp; The Self-Abusers released their only single, &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;, on Chiswick Records (which was dismissed as being &quot;rank and file&quot; in a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review). The band split on the same day that the single was released, with Milarky and McNeill going on to form The Cuban Heels. Ditching the stage names and the overt punkiness, the remaining members continued together as Simple Minds (naming themselves after a David Bowie lyric from his song &quot;Jean Genie&quot;), making their very first performance at Glasgow&#x27;s Satellite City on 17 January 1978.

In January 1978, Simple Minds recruited Duncan Barnwell as a second guitarist (allowing for an optional two-guitar line-up while also enabling Burchill to play violin). Meanwhile, Kerr had abandoned keyboards to concentrate entirely on vocals. In March 1978, Kerr, Burchill, Donald, Barnwell and McGee were joined by the Barra-born keyboard player Mick MacNeil. The band got a residency at the Mars Bar in Glasgow and played various other venues in Scotland and rapidly established a reputation as an exciting live act (usually performing in full makeup). Tony Donald quit in April 1978 and was replaced by Duncan Barnwell&#x27;s friend Derek Forbes (formerly the bass player with The Subs). In May 1978 Simple Minds recorded their first demo tape, including &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; and some other tracks that would appear on their debut album. The group were turned down by record companies, but gained a management deal with Bruce Findlay, owner of the Bruce&#x27;s Records chain of record shops and the Zoom Records label. Championed by his journalist friend Brian Hogg, Findlay was persuaded to sign Simple Minds to his Zoom label which had a licensing deal with Arista Records. In November 1978, Barnwell was ousted from the band. 

From 1979 through until 1981, Simple Minds would continue as a quintet of Kerr, Burchill, MacNeil, Forbes and McGee, operating as a tight-knit collective. Subsequent line-up changes would shrink and diminish this core band, with only founder members being considered to be full members of the creative and compositional team.

===Initial albums (1979–1980)===
During late 1978 and early 1979, Simple Minds began rehearsing the set of Kerr/Burchill-written songs which appear on their debut album. On 27 March 1979 the band made their first television appearance, performing the songs &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; and &quot;Life in a Day&quot; on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. The first Simple Minds album, &quot;Life in a Day&quot;, was produced by John Leckie and released by Zoom Records in April 1979. The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Life in a Day&quot; was released as Simple Minds&#x27; first single and reached No. 62 in the UK Singles Chart, with the album reaching No. 30 in the UK Albums Chart. In April/May 1979 they made their first UK tour as supporting act for Magazine, who were a major influence on them at the time.

In June 1979 &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; was released as the second single from the album, failing to reach the chart, while the band continued to tour the UK on their own. In September 1979 Simple Minds recorded their next album, &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; at Rockfield Studios with producer John Leckie. The songs were mostly conceived in the studio and was a significant departure from the pop tunes of &quot;Life in a Day&quot;. German Krautrock was now the band&#x27;s main influence, adopting a more experimental electronic sound that drew influences from the motorik, repetitive grooves of bands such as Neu!, Kraftwerk and La Düsseldorf.

The band began their &quot;Real to Real Cacophony Tour&quot; in Germany and also made a short visit to New York in October 1979. Their performance of the songs &quot;Premonition&quot;, &quot;Factory&quot; and &quot;Changeling&quot; at Hurrah was filmed for The Old Grey Whistle Test.

&quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; was released in November 1979. While the band got little marketing support from their record company Arista, who didn&#x27;t like the album, it received critical acclaim. The release was followed by their third UK tour of the year and a BBC session for John Peel in December. In January 1980 &quot;Changeling&quot; was released as the only single from &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot;, failing to make an impression on the charts. In March they supported Gary Numan on a couple of gigs, and continued their Real to Real Cacophony Tour until June 1980 with dates mainly in Germany, France and the Netherlands. In June 1980 Simple Minds entered the studio to record their next album, again with producer John Leckie at Rockfield Studios. The band again had a new approach to their music that differed from the previous album, this time aiming for a more repetitive, dance-orientated sound inspired by disco music they had heard in nightclubs while touring Europe.

&quot;Empires and Dance&quot; was released in September 1980. Many of the tracks were minimal and featured a significant use of sequencing, further exploring their repetitive Krautrock-influences with electronic dance grooves. McNeil&#x27;s keyboards and Forbes&#x27; bass became the main melodic elements in the band&#x27;s sound, with Burchill&#x27;s heavily processed guitar becoming more of a textural element. With this album, Kerr began to experiment with non-narrative lyrics based on observations he had made as the band travelled across Europe on tour. While a modest commercial success, &quot;Empires and Dance&quot; received enthusiastic response in the British music press Simple Minds had caught the attention of Peter Gabriel who selected them as the opening act on several dates of his European tour starting in August 1980. The tour as support act for Peter Gabriel gave the band the opportunity to play at bigger venues. 

&quot;Empires and Dance&quot; peaked at no.41 on the UK Albums Chart and dropped out of the chart after three weeks. The band&#x27;s manager Bruce Findlay later blamed Arista for poor handling of the album and it not being more commercially successful. Initially Arista only released 7500 copies of the album. Furthermore, Arista did not release a single to promote the album. &quot;I Travel&quot; was not released as a single until October to promote the Empires and Dance tour. The single sold poorly and did not reach the UK chart, but the 12&quot; version became popular in the US club scene and (based on import sales only) entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Disco Chart at no.80 in early 1981. &quot;I Travel&quot; was subsequently reissued twice in the UK, but again failed to reach the singles chart.

===Commercial breakthrough (1981–1983)===

In early 1981, Simple Minds frustration with poor support and marketing by Arista made them threaten to split up rather than continue working with them. They were released from Arista and instead signed to Virgin Records. After the band had left the label, Arista decided to release &quot;Celebrate&quot; as the second single from &quot;Empires and Dance&quot; in February 1981 to promote the album, with the earlier single &quot;Changeling&quot; on the b-side to promote &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot;, but this single too sold poorly and failed to chart. The following year, Arista put out a compilation album, &quot;Celebration&quot;, featuring tracks from the three previous albums which reached No. 45 on the UK albums chart. Following their change of record company, the band demoed new songs and embarked on a club tour in the US and Canada. 

In May 1981, Simple Minds&#x27; first release on Virgin, the single &quot;The American&quot; reached No. 59 on the UK singles chart. The band recorded their next album with producer Steve Hillage and an abundance of new material under much time pressure. At the end of the recording sessions drummer Brian McGee decided to leave the band, citing exhaustion at Simple Minds&#x27; constant touring schedule, and a desire for more time at home with family. In an interview shortly after, he also cited disappointment that he was not getting enough credit in the band. McGee joined Glasgow band Endgames, and later Propaganda. In August, &quot;Love Song&quot; was released and became their highest charting single to date, peaking at No. 47 on the UK singles chart and an international hit, reaching the top 20 in Australia and Sweden, and no.38 in Canada. In September 1981, Virgin released the entirety of Simple Minds recent studio sessions on two albums: &quot;Sons and Fascination&quot; and &quot;Sister Feelings Call&quot;. The latter album was initially included as a bonus disc with the first 10,000 vinyl copies of &quot;Sons and Fascination&quot;, but it was later re-issued as an album in its own right. (For the CD release, it was paired on a single disc with &quot;Sons and Fascination&quot;at first with two tracks deleted, but in full on later issues). The album reached No. 11 on the UK albums chart, and was subsequently placed as No. 18 on Sounds &quot;Album of the Year&quot;-chart. The next single &quot;Sweat in Bullet&quot; was a remixed version by Peter Walsh and included two songs recorded live at Hammersmith Odeon in September. During this period, the band&#x27;s visual aesthetic was established, masterminded by Malcolm Garrett&#x27;s graphic design company Assorted iMaGes. Characterised at first by hard, bold typography and photo-collage, Garrett&#x27;s designs for the band later incorporated pop-religious iconography in clean, integrated package designs that befitted the band&#x27;s idealised image as neo-romantic purveyors of European anthemic pop.

To replace McGee as drummer (although not as full band member), Simple Minds hired Kenny Hyslop (ex-Skids, Slik, Zones) to play on the first leg of the Sons and Fascination tour, which included Simple Minds first visit to Australia, touring with Icehouse. Hyslop also played on the studio recording of &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot;, a song originating in a riff from a tape of funk music Hyslop played on the tour bus, that would become the band&#x27;s next single. Despite this contribution, Hyslop ultimately &quot;didn&#x27;t fit in&quot; with the band or their management and was replaced for the second leg of the Sons and Fascination tour by the Kilmarnock-born percussionist Mike Ogletree (the former drummer for Café Jacques) in early 1982. 

Simple Minds started working on their next album in an old farmhouse in Fife. In February 1982 the songs &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot; and &quot;King is White and in the Crowd&quot; were premiered on a BBC session for Kid Jensen. The band then moved to Townhouse Studios for recording sessions with producer Peter Walsh. The band told Walsh they wanted the album to represent their live sound, so Walsh decided to record it as a live studio album. Unsatisfied with Ogletree&#x27;s drumming style, Walsh introduced them to a London-born drummer called Mel Gaynor, a 22-year-old session musician with plenty of experience from playing with funk-bands such as Beggar and Co and Light of the World, who then played drums on the majority of the record, while Ogletree played drums on three tracks. &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot; was released in April 1982 and became Simple Minds first Top 20 single in the UK, peaking at No. 13 and also reaching the Australian Top 10. The song earned the band performances on Top of the Pops and interviews in teen-orientated pop magazines. &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot; was released in September 1982. The album was a commercial breakthrough, spending 53 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 3 in October 1982. It generated charting singles including &quot;Glittering Prize&quot;, which also reached the UK Top 20 and Australian Top 10. While some tracks (&quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Colours Fly and Catherine Wheel&quot;) continued the formula perfected on &quot;Sons and Fascination&quot;, other tracks (&quot;Someone Somewhere in Summertime&quot;, &quot;Glittering Prize&quot;) were pure pop. Jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock, who recorded in the studio next door, performed a synth solo on the track &quot;Hunter and the Hunted&quot;.

The band embarked on their extensive New Gold tour in September 1982, which included dates in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Mike Ogletree played on the first leg of the tour, but was asked to leave the band in November 1982, later joining Fiction Factory. Mel Gaynor was recruited for the remaining dates and retained afterwards, eventually becoming the band&#x27;s longest-standing drummer (and longest-standing member other than mainstays Burchill and Kerr) despite thrice leaving and returning in the following decades. The band&#x27;s late 1982 UK dates included a show at City Hall in Newcastle that was recorded by Virgin and later included on the 2003 &quot;Seen the Lights&quot; DVD. On these dates the band was supported by China Crisis.

The second leg of the New Gold Dream tour started in March 1983 and included dates in Europe, USA and Canada. In July they performed at festivals such as Roskilde Festival in Denmark and Rock Werchter in Belgium. Prior to the tour the band had started working on their next album. In August the new song &quot;Waterfront&quot; was premiered in a live concert. In September the band recorded a BBC session for David Jensen, including &quot;Waterfront&quot; and the newly written &quot;The Kick Inside of Me&quot;. In October their next album was recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite at Townhouse Studios in London. In November &quot;Waterfront&quot; was released as a single and the band embarked on their Sparkle in the Rain Tour. The opening show at Barrowlands Ballroom in Glasgow was filmed for the &quot;Waterfront&quot; video. &quot;Waterfront&quot; became their most successful single to date; hitting No. 1 in New Zealand, No. 5 in Ireland, the Top 20 in Australia and Sweden, and No. 13 on the UK chart.

===Mainstream success and political activism (1984–1987)===

&quot;Sparkle in the Rain&quot; was released in February 1984. It entered the UK albums chart at number one. It was preceded by the single &quot;Speed Your Love to Me&quot; which reached No.20 on the singles chart. A third single from the album, &quot;Up on the Catwalk&quot;, was subsequently released and also reached the Top 30 in the UK. &quot;Sparkle in the Rain&quot; hit the top 20 in several other countries (including Canada, where it reached No. 13). The band spent much of 1984 touring the world, including Australia, Europe, North America and Japan. In 1984, Jim Kerr married Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders (who renamed herself Christine Kerr). Simple Minds headlined a North American tour supported by China Crisis during the Canadian leg and supported the Pretenders in the US while Hynde was pregnant with Kerr&#x27;s daughter. The marriage lasted until 1990.

Despite the band&#x27;s new-found popularity in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia, Simple Minds remained essentially unknown in the US. The band&#x27;s UK releases on Arista were not picked up by Arista USA who had &#x27;right of first refusal&#x27; for their releases. The 1985 film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; broke Simple Minds into the US market, when the band achieved their only No. 1 U.S. pop hit in April 1985 with the film&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, a song written by Keith Forsey and Steve Schiff; which had previously been offered to Billy Idol and Bryan Ferry before Simple Minds agreed to record it. The song soon became a chart-topper in many other countries around the world.

At around this point, the camaraderie that had fuelled Simple Minds began to unravel, and over the next ten years the band&#x27;s line-up underwent frequent changes. Jim Kerr subsequently recalled &quot;We were knackered. We were desensitized. The band started to fracture. We were lads who had grown up together, we were meant to grow together, politically, spiritually and artistically. But we were getting tired with each other. There was an element of the chore creeping in. We were coasting and this whole other thing was a challenge.&quot; The first casualty was bassist Derek Forbes, who was beginning to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained in touch with the band (and was soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in Propaganda).

To replace Forbes, Simple Minds hired former Brand X bass player John Giblin, who owned the band&#x27;s rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush. Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where the band performed &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, a new track called &quot;Ghost Dancing&quot; and &quot;Promised You a Miracle&quot;.

During 1985, Simple Minds were in the studio with former Tom Petty/Stevie Nicks producer Jimmy Iovine. In November, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; was released; former Chic singer Robin Clark, who performed call-and-response vocals with Kerr throughout the album (effectively becoming a second lead singer), and was heavily featured in Simple Minds music videos of the time. The record reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 10 in the US, despite the fact that their major-league breakthrough single &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; was not included. &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; went on to generate four worldwide hit singles: &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, &quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot;, &quot;Ghost Dancing&quot; and &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;, the last of which featured a music video directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński that used techniques developed in music videos for bands such as Pet Shop Boys and Art of Noise. The band also toured, with both Robin Clark and percussionist Sue Hadjopoulos added to the live line-up.

Because of Simple Minds&#x27; powerful stage presence and lyrics that were now beginning to adopt Christian symbolism, the band was criticised by some in the music press as a lesser version of U2, despite the fact that both bands were now heading in different musical directions. The two groups were well-acquainted with one another, and Bono joined Simple Minds on-stage at the Barrowlands in Glasgow in 1985 for a live version of &quot;New Gold Dream&quot;. Bono also appeared on stage at Simple Minds Croke Park concert and sang &quot;Sun City&quot; during the &quot;Love Song&quot; medley. Derek Forbes also appeared on stage at the Croke Park concert and performed on several songs during the encore. To document their worldwide &quot;Once Upon a Time Tour&quot;, Simple Minds released the double-live set &quot;Live in the City of Light&quot; in May 1987, which was recorded primarily over two nights in Paris in August 1986.

===&quot;Street Fighting Years&quot;, &quot;Real Life&quot; and hiatus (1988–1993)===
By 1988, Simple Minds had built their own recording premises — the Bonnie Wee Studio — in Scotland. Following the lengthy period of touring to support &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, the remaining core members (Kerr, Burchill and MacNeil) began new writing sessions in Scotland: Gaynor and Giblin pursued session work elsewhere while waiting to be called in. Initially the band began work on an instrumental project called &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot; (mostly written by Burchill and MacNeil). This project was then supplanted by an increase in the band&#x27;s political activism, something which they had begun to stress in recent years (by giving all of the income from the &quot;Ghostdancing&quot; single to Amnesty International, and playing cover versions of Little Steven&#x27;s &quot;(Ain&#x27;t Gonna Play) Sun City&quot; on tour), inspired by Peter Gabriel with whom they had toured in the early 1980s.

Simple Minds were the first band to sign up for Mandela Day, a concert held at Wembley Stadium, London, as an expression of solidarity with the then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela. Bands involved were asked to produce a song especially for the event – Simple Minds were the only act which produced one. This was &quot;Mandela Day&quot;, which the band played live on the day (alongside cover versions of &quot;Sun City&quot; with Little Steven and a cover version of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Biko&quot; on which Gabriel himself took on lead vocals). &quot;Mandela Day&quot; was released on the &quot;Ballad of the Streets&quot; EP, which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart (the only time the band did so). Another EP track, &quot;Belfast Child&quot;, was a rewrite of the Celtic folk song &quot;She Moved Through the Fair&quot; (which had been introduced to Kerr by John Giblin) with new lyrics written about the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland). The single was also an expression by Simple Minds of their support for the campaign for the release of Beirut-held hostage Brian Keenan, kidnapped by the Islamic Jihad.

The next album &quot;Street Fighting Years&quot; (produced by Trevor Horn and Stephen Lipson) moved away from the American soul and gospel influences of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in favour of soundtrack atmospherics and a new incorporation of acoustic and folk music-related ingredients. The lyrics were also more directly political, covering topics including the Poll Tax, the Soweto townships, the Berlin Wall and the stationing of nuclear submarines on the Scottish coast. The band underwent further line-up changes during the recording of &quot;Street Fighting Years&quot;. Mel Gaynor and John Giblin both contributed to the recording (and, in Giblin&#x27;s case, to some of the writing) but both had left the band by the time of the album&#x27;s release, by which time the band was officially listed as a trio of Kerr, Burchill and MacNeil. In a new development for the band, various bass guitar and drum tracks were performed by high-profile guesting session musicians. Gaynor&#x27;s departure from the band was brief (he was rehired for the following tour).

Released in 1989, the album rose to No. 1 in the UK charts and received a rare five-star review from &quot;Q&quot; magazine. It received a less positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; which criticised the band for what the reviewer considered to be political vacuity. &quot;This Is Your Land&quot; was chosen as the lead single for the U.S., and even with guest vocals from Lou Reed, the single failed to make a mark on the pop charts. Reunited with Mel Gaynor, Simple Minds hired Malcolm Foster (ex-Pretenders) as the new bass player, following a failed attempt to re-recruit Derek Forbes (who declined due to family reasons and a lack of affinity with the new music). The live band was once again expanded by recruiting three additional touring members: Level 42 backing singer Annie McCaig, percussionist Andy Duncan and violinist Lisa Germano. Touring began in May 1989, and included the first and only time that the group headlined Wembley Stadium, where they were supported by fellow Scottish bands The Silencers, Texas and Gun. In September, the concert in the Roman amphitheatre Verona Arena in Italy was recorded for the live video &quot;Verona&quot;, released by Virgin in 1990, and later included on the &quot;Seen the Lights&quot; DVD in 2003.

At the end of the Street Fighting Years tour, Simple Minds laid plans to go to Amsterdam to begin recording a new album. Just before the end of the tour, keyboardist Michael MacNeil announced to the band that he would not be joining them as he needed a break. MacNeil played his last concert with Simple Minds in Brisbane a week later. At the time, MacNeil&#x27;s departure was put down to health concerns, but he had been gradually suffering disillusionment with the band&#x27;s lifestyle and touring schedule (as well as what Kerr has referred to as &quot;a number of animated quarrels&quot;.) At around the same time, long-term manager Bruce Findlay was dismissed and over the next few years the band gradually altered to the point where it was a shifting set of musicians around the only remaining core members, Kerr and Burchill. In December 2009, Kerr retrospectively defended the changes in an online diary entry, although he said that MacNeil&#x27;s departure had been a &quot;colossal fracture&quot;. He also paid tribute to his former bandmate and said that MacNeil had been irreplaceable. 

Simple Minds continued to record, hiring keyboard players as and where required. The first of these was session keyboard player Peter-John Vettese who played live with the band at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Concert and on a short German tour. He was subsequently replaced in the live band by Mark Taylor.

In 1991, Simple Minds returned with &quot;Real Life&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover showed a trio of Kerr, Burchill and Gaynor and the writing credits for all songs was Kerr/Burchill. The album reached No. 2 in the UK, where it also spawned four Top 40 singles. In the US, &quot;See the Lights&quot; was the band&#x27;s last Top 40 pop single. The band toured to support the release, playing as a basic five-piece (Kerr, Burchill, Gaynor, Foster and Taylor) and cutting down on the extended arrangements of the last few large tours. Mel Gaynor left the band in 1992 to pursue session work and other projects, and for the next two years Simple Minds were on hiatus, releasing the compilation album &quot;Glittering Prize 81/92&quot; in 1992.

===&quot;Good News from the Next World&quot; and &quot;Néapolis&quot; (1994–1999)===
Simple Minds returned to activity later in 1994. By now the band was officially a duo of Kerr and Burchill (with the latter taking on keyboards in the studio, as well as guitar). Hiring Keith Forsey (the writer of &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;) as producer, they began to put together an album which returned to the uplifting arena rock feel of their &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; days. With Gaynor now out of the picture, the remaining instrumentation was covered by session musicians (although Malcolm Foster was included among the bass players used for recording). &quot;Good News from the Next World&quot; was released in 1995. The album reached No. 2 in the UK and produced the Top 10 hit &quot;She&#x27;s a River&quot; and the Top 20 single &quot;Hypnotised&quot;. The band toured to promote &quot;Good News from the Next World&quot;, with Malcolm Foster and Mark Taylor as touring bass and keyboard players and Mark Schulman (who had played on the album) on drums. This was Foster&#x27;s last work with the band, and Schulman returned to session work at the end of the tour.

After being released from their contract with Virgin Records, Simple Minds made use of the skills of their original rhythm section, Derek Forbes and Brian McGee (returning after respective eleven- and fourteen-year absences). Although McGee was not involved beyond the rehearsal stage, Forbes formally rejoined Simple Minds in July 1996. The band then reunited with Mel Gaynor for a studio session in early 1997. Gaynor was reinstated as a full-time member for the European tour (which once again featured Mark Taylor on keyboards). After the tour, album recording sessions were interrupted by Kerr and Burchill&#x27;s decision to play live (without Forbes, Taylor or Gaynor) as part of the Proms tour (a series of orchestral concerts featuring a mixture of light classical and pop music). The duo played versions of &quot;Alive And Kicking&quot;, &quot;Belfast Child&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; backed by a full orchestra and were billed as Simple Minds. 

The new album, &quot;Néapolis&quot; featured Forbes playing bass guitar on all tracks, and Gaynor on one song, &quot;War Babies&quot;. Other drum tracks were recorded by session players Michael Niggs and Jim McDermott, with additional percussion programming by Transglobal Underground/Furniture drummer Hamilton Lee. It was the only Simple Minds album released by Chrysalis Records, who refused to release the album in the U.S., citing lack of interest. The music video for &quot;Glitterball&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, was the first production of any kind to film at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. A European tour followed between March and July 1998, undermined by problems with ill-health and contractual fiascos (including a pull-out from the Fleadh Festival to be replaced by British rock band James).

As Simple Minds&#x27; main writing team, Kerr and Burchill had continued to demo and originate material by themselves. For the latest sessions they had shared studio space with a band called Sly Silver Sly who featured Jim Kerr&#x27;s brother Mark (previously the drummer with Gun) and bass guitarist Eddie Duffy, and who were working with American songwriter Kevin Hunter. While in the studio, the two writing and recording projects (including the Hunter co-writes) merged to become the sessions for the next Simple Minds album, &quot;Our Secrets Are the Same&quot;. Once again, Forbes and Gaynor found themselves out of the band: Mark Kerr became the new drummer and Eddie Duffy joined on bass guitar. The new-look Simple Minds made their début with a short set of greatest hits at the Scotland Rocks For Kosovo festival, with Mark Taylor returning on keyboards. The displaced Forbes and Gaynor, having apparently been told that the band was not appearing at the festival, formed a new band of their own to play the same concert.

===&quot;Our Secrets Are the Same&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot; (1999–2005)===

Having delivered &quot;Our Secrets Are the Same&quot; to Chrysalis, Simple Minds then found themselves caught up in record company politics while Chrysalis, EMI and other companies attempted to merge with each other. Originally due for release in late 1999, the album remained unreleased after the band mired themselves in lawsuits with Chrysalis. In 2000, the situation became even more complicated when &quot;Our Secrets Are the Same&quot; was leaked on the internet. Discouraged with their label&#x27;s failure to resolve the problems, and with both momentum and potential album sales lost, the band once again went on hiatus. Eddie Duffy, Mark Taylor and Mark Kerr all moved on to other projects. Jim Kerr moved to Sicily and took up a part-time career as a hotelier, although both he and Burchill continued working together on various business interests and kept the idea of the band alive. 

In 2001, Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill began working with multi-instrumentalist Gordon Goudie (ex-Primevals) on a new Simple Minds album to be called &quot;Cry&quot;. Mark Kerr also contributed to the project (this time as an acoustic guitarist and Burchill&#x27;s co-writer on several songs) while Kerr brought in various Italian musicians as collaborators, including Planet Funk and Punk Investigation. In parallel to &quot;Cry&quot;, Simple Minds also recorded an album of covers called &quot;Neon Lights&quot;, featuring Simple Minds versions of songs from artists including Patti Smith, Roxy Music and Kraftwerk. &quot;Neon Lights&quot; was the first to be completed and released (later in 2001). In the video for the &quot;Neon Lights&quot; single &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot;, the band consisted of Jim Kerr, Charlie Burchill, Gordon Goudie and Mark Kerr. A 2-CD compilation, &quot;The Best of Simple Minds&quot;, was released soon afterwards.

&quot;Cry&quot; was released in April 2002. Although the album did not sell in great numbers in the U.S., Simple Minds felt confident enough to mount a North American leg of their Floating World tour (named after the instrumental track which closes &quot;Cry&quot;), their first in seven years. With Goudie opting to remain studio bound (and Mark Kerr leaving the band again), Simple Minds once again recruited Mel Gaynor as tour drummer. The live band was completed by the returning Eddie Duffy on bass guitar and by new keyboard player/programmer Andy Gillespie (of SoundControl). On 28 October 2003, Capitol released &quot;Seen The Lights – A Visual History&quot;, the first-ever Simple Minds commercial (double) DVD, featuring over four hours and twenty minutes of archive footage. The first disc includes the majority of the band&#x27;s promotional videos. The second disc is devoted to &quot;Verona&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live home video release, which was originally released in VHS format in 1990. It was upmixed to 5.1 surround sound for the DVD, but otherwise remains the same as the original VHS copy. 

On 18 October 2004, Simple Minds released a five-CD compilation entitled &quot;Silver Box&quot;. This mostly comprised previously unreleased demos, radio and TV sessions and live recordings from 1979 to 1995, but also included the long-delayed &quot;Our Secrets Are the Same&quot;. In July 2005, the band embarked on the &quot;Intimate Tour&quot;, a series of low-key European and UK gigs at smaller venues which ended in December 2005. Andy Gillespie was unable to appear at all the gigs, and Mark Taylor returned to cover for him on several occasions. From this point onwards, the two alternated as Simple Minds&#x27; live keyboard player, depending on Gillespie&#x27;s schedule with his other projects.

===&quot;Black &amp; White 050505&quot; and &quot;Graffiti Soul&quot; (2005–2009)===

With the Kerr/Burchill/Duffy/Gaynor lineup, Simple Minds released &quot;Black &amp; White 050505&quot; (their fourteenth studio album), on 12 September 2005. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Home&quot;, received airplay on alternative rock radio stations in the US. It reached No. 37 in the UK and was not released in North America. The band spent 2006 touring throughout Europe, the Far East, Australia and New Zealand on the Black And White Tour (with Mark Taylor on keyboards).

2007 marked the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary and saw the band embarked on a brief tour of Australia and New Zealand as guests of INXS. The band continued to release audio and video download &quot;bundles&quot; through their official website, featuring live music and several short documentary-style videos recorded during their 2006 tour in Edinburgh and Brussels (including the complete show on 16 February 2006 at the Ancienne Belgique, Brussels, Belgium as &quot;Live Bundles&quot; No. 1 to No. 5 and 6 tracks from the show on 28 August 2006 at the &quot;T on the Fringe&quot; music festival, Edinburgh, as &quot;Live Bundles&quot; No. 6 &amp; No. 7). 

On 27 June 2008, Simple Minds played the 90th birthday tribute to Nelson Mandela in London&#x27;s Hyde Park. The band then undertook a short tour of the UK to celebrate their 30th anniversary. During these concerts, the band performed the entire &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot; album and songs from their other albums in a two-part concert performance. Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill also played a number of concerts with Night of the Proms across Europe in spring, followed by further shows in late 2008.

In June 2008, Kerr and Burchill briefly reunited with the full original band lineup for the first time in twenty-seven years, when meetings with Derek Forbes, Mick MacNeil and Brian McGee led to a studio rehearsal date. However, the reunion rapidly foundered over disagreements regarding control of the band and equal status for all members. Reverting to the Kerr/Burchill/Duffy/Gaynor lineup, Simple Minds released a new studio album entitled &quot;Graffiti Soul&quot; on 25 May 2009. On the November/December Graffiti Soul UK tour they were supported by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark as special guests. A new record label, W14/Universal label, had purchased the Sanctuary label in early 2009. Former Sanctuary Records A&amp;R head John Williams (who had signed the band to Sanctuary) kept his position with the new label, and exercised the option to pick up the remaining Simple Minds albums owed as part of the previous deal.

In May 2009, &quot;Graffiti Soul&quot;″s first single, &quot;Rockets&quot;, was released as a digital download single only. On 31 May 2009, the album entered the UK Album chart at No. 10, becoming Simple Minds&#x27; first album in 14 years to enter the UK Top 10. The album also entered European Top 100 Album chart at No. 9. Interspersed with Simple Minds activity, Jim Kerr recorded and released his first solo album &quot;Lostboy! AKA Jim Kerr&quot; on 17 May 2010 under the name &quot;Lostboy! AKA&quot;. Explaining the project name and ethos, he commented &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to start a new band. I like my band...and I didn&#x27;t want a point blank Jim Kerr solo album either.&quot; A Lostboy! AKA 10-date European tour followed from 18 to 31 May 2010.

===Touring (2010–2014)===
The band played a mini-concert on 2 October 2010 at the Cash For Kids Ball organised by Radio Clyde at the Hilton in Glasgow, and a full-length concert on 10 December 2010 at the Festhalle in Bern. In early October 2010, a new line-up of Simple Minds - Burchill, Kerr, Gaynor, Gillespie with new bassist Ged Grimes (ex-Danny Wilson and Deacon Blue) - completed four weeks at the Sphere Recording Studios in London during which four songs were recorded and mixed for a new compilation album to be called &quot;Greatest Hits +&quot; and for the new Simple Minds studio album. The sessions were produced by Andy Wright and engineered and mixed by Gavin Goldberg. The four songs recorded were an eight-minute-long version of &quot;In Every Heaven&quot; (originally recorded in 1982 during the &quot;New Gold Dream&quot; sessions) and three new compositions: &quot;Stagefright&quot;, &quot;On The Rooftop&quot; and &quot;Broken Glass Park&quot;. From 10 June to 3 July 2011, Simple Minds embarked on the Greatest Hits Forest tour, playing a series of seven dates in woodland locations of England, as part of Forestry Commission Live Music.

From 16 June to 28 August 2011, the Greatest Hits + tour visited European countries: the UK, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Ireland, Gibraltar and Serbia mainly at summer festival venues. Simple Minds played several free concerts (on 4 July 2011 in Potsdam, Germany, on 4 July 2011 in Florence, Italy for the opening of Florence&#x27;s Hard Rock Cafe, on 18 August in Belgrade, Serbia before 110,000 people and on 27 August in Bad Harzburg, Germany before 25,000 people). To coincide with the 2012 5X5 Live European tour, EMI Music released on 20 February 2012 the &quot;X5&quot; box set featuring the first five albums over six discs: &quot;Life in a Day&quot;, &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot;, &quot;Empires and Dance&quot;, &quot;Sons and Fascination/Sister Feelings Call&quot; and &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot; (with &quot;Sons and Fascination&quot; and &quot;Sister Feelings Call&quot; as separate discs in a gatefold sleeve as well as bonus material on each disc, including B-sides and remixes). After a gig on 30 March 2012 at the Døgnvill Festival in Tromsø, Norway, the band embarked on 23 June 2012 in Vienna, on a 25-date tour of European summer festivals which ended on 22 September 2012 in Germersheim, Germany. In July they played at the T in the Park festival.

On 21 April Virgin Records released the band&#x27;s first record ever to be released exclusively for Record Store Day 2012. The 12&quot; single contained two remixes, &quot;Theme For Great Cities&quot; remixed by Moby on side A and the 2012 remix of &quot;I Travel&quot; remixed by John Leckie (who produced the original version of the song in 1980) on side B. The 12&quot; was limited to 1,000 copies worldwide, of which 100 copies were sold in Sister Ray Records in London, where Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill took part in a record-signing session. EMI released on 19 November 2012 a double live album of the tour entitled &quot;5X5 Live&quot;. Simple Minds embarked in late 2012 on an eight-date Australia and New Zealand joint tour with American band Devo and Australian band The Church starting on 29 November 2012 in Melbourne, and ending on 15 December 2012 in Auckland (the only show played in New Zealand).

On 25 March 2013 a new greatest-hits two- and three-disc collection entitled &quot;Celebrate: The Greatest Hits +&quot; was released on Virgin Records, including two new tracks, &quot;Blood Diamonds&quot; &quot;Broken Glass Park&quot;; the three-disc version also includes &quot;Stagefright&quot;, a track which has never been available in CD format before, and unreleased single mixes of &quot;Jeweller to the Stars&quot; and &quot;Space&quot;. The North American version of the album contains only one disc. It was followed by a 30-date Greatest Hits + UK tour, which began with a concert in Dublin on 25 March and ended in Ipswich on 4 May 2013.

In October 2013 they continued the Greatest Hits + tour in Brazil, United States and Canada, followed by concerts in South Africa, Europe and the UK in November, including four arena shows in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London, with guests Ultravox at all four concerts.

===&quot;Big Music&quot; and &quot;Acoustic&quot; (2014–2017)===

In November 2014 Simple Minds released their first studio album in five years entitled &quot;Big Music&quot;, which was followed by a Winter/Spring 2015 UK and European tour (from February to May 2015). On 22 October 2014, Simple Minds were presented the &quot;Q&quot; Inspiration to Music award by Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield and saw the first public outing of new member Catherine AD as part of the lineup. On 2 November 2014, Simple Minds introduced &quot;Big Music&quot; with a special acoustic session for Radio Clyde&#x27;s The Billy Sloan Collection. Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill co-hosted the show, choosing some of their favourite records – including Jet Boy by The New York Dolls, The Velvet Underground&#x27;s Sweet Jane and The Model by Kraftwerk – and playing acoustic versions of songs from &quot;Big Music&quot;, including &quot;Honest Town&quot; and &quot;Let The Day Begin&quot; and David Bowie cover &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.

In December 2014, Simple Minds recorded an acoustic session at Absolute Radio including live unplugged performances of &quot;Honest Town&quot;, &quot;Alive &amp; Kicking&quot;, &quot;Let The Day Begin&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget about Me)&quot; and David Bowie cover &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. The band continued to tour throughout 2015. On 14 November 2015, the band self-released a 29-track double-CD live album entitled &quot;Live – Big Music Tour 2015&quot;. It was recorded during the 2015 Big Music live tour and contained a cross-section of the Simple Minds back catalogue. 

On 7 April 2016, Simple Minds performed their first unplugged gig at the Zermatt Unplugged Festival in Zermatt, Switzerland, followed by a second unplugged show in Zürich on 29 October 2016, also at the Zermatt Unplugged Festival. This was the first concert to feature a secondary acoustic live-and-recording line-up of Simple Minds, with Jim Kerr and Sarah Brown on vocals, Burchill on acoustic guitar and accordion, Ged Grimes on bass, Gordy Goudie returning on acoustic guitar and harmonica and new recruit Cherisse Osei on percussion. In May 2016, they were given an Ivor Novello award where Kerr noted that: &quot;we just wanted to be in a great band and take it round the world. We&#x27;re very fortunate because we get recognition&quot;.

In October 2016, the band embarked on a promotional tour of the acoustic material, including a live concert on 10 November 2016 at the Hackney Empire, London that was broadcast on BBC Radio 2. Simple Minds released &quot;Acoustic&quot; which was recorded with the new line-up during Summer 2016 and which featured acoustic re-recordings of songs spanning their career. On the lead single, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Promised You A Miracle&quot;, the band were joined by fellow Scot KT Tunstall. The two-disc vinyl version of the album was released on 25 November 2016, including three extra tracks: &quot;Stand By Love&quot;, &quot;Speed Your Love To Me&quot; and &quot;Light Travels&quot;. In Spring 2017 they embarked on a two-month (47-date) Acoustic Live &#x27;17 UK &amp; European tour.

On 16 November 2016, Simple Minds were given the Forth Best Performance Award at the Radio Forth awards ceremony in Edinburgh.

===&quot;Walk Between Worlds&quot; and line-up changes (2017–2019)===

Since September 2014, Simple Minds had been working on new material with the electric Kerr/Burchill/Grimes/Gaynor line-up (minus Andy Gillespie), including the songs &quot;Fireball&quot; and &quot;A Silent Kiss&quot;.

On 15 November 2017, the new album title and track listing leaked on Amazon UK. Entitled &quot;Walk Between Worlds&quot;, the album features eight tracks while the Deluxe edition includes three bonus tracks (one live and two studio tracks). On 20 November 2017, a 20-second promo video was released on the band&#x27;s Facebook page, promoting the album. The video featured a snippet of &quot;Magic&quot;, the lead single, as performed by the six-person &quot;Acoustic&quot; line-up (now including Catherine AD). Produced by Simple Minds, Wright and Goldberg, &quot;Walk Between Worlds&quot; was released on 2 February 2018 via BMG and entered at No. 4 - their highest UK album chart position in over 23 years - and No. 2 on the Scottish albums charts, the album&#x27;s highest chart position in all.

In Spring and Summer 2018, the band extensively toured Europe as part of the Walk Between Worlds tour, promoting the new album. Having performed on three tracks on the album, Cherisse Osei now became the band&#x27;s full-time drummer, replacing Mel Gaynor; Catherine AD also joined the live band on additional guitar, vocals and keyboards. The band notably performed &quot;Walk Between Worlds&quot; in its entirety during the eight Spring concerts that occurred from 13 February at the Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow, UK to 22 February 2018 in Berlin, Germany. After a unique show in Mexico City on 20 September 2018, the band extensively toured North America (now minus Catherine AD) from 24 September in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania up to 11 November 2018 in Orlando, Florida as part of the Walk Between Worlds tour.

===&quot;Live in the City of Angels&quot; and cancelled tour (2019–2022)===
In 2019, Simple Minds released &quot;Live in the City of Angels&quot;, a snapshot from the band&#x27;s 2018 North American tour, their biggest ever to date. The live album was made available on multiple formats; the standard CD and vinyl versions feature 25 songs, mostly recorded on 24 October 2018 at the Orpheum Theatre, whereas the Deluxe CD and digital formats contain an additional 15 tracks recorded during sound checks and rehearsals, yielding a 40-song collection to mark the band&#x27;s 40-year career.

In 2019, Simple Minds also released a new compilation album entitled &quot;40: The Best Of 1979-2019&quot;, a retrospective of the band&#x27;s 40-year long recording career. It includes as a new track the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;For One Night Only&quot; by King Creosote.

The first Europe &amp; UK (Winter–Spring) leg of the 40 Years Of Hits world tour 2020 kicked off on 28 February 2020 in Stavanger, Norway but was interrupted with the cancellation of the show due to take place on 11 March 2020 in Herning, Denmark and the cancellation of the rest of the tour due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

===Rescheduled tour, &quot;Direction of the Heart&quot; and &quot;New Gold Dream – Live From Paisley Abbey&quot; (2022–2023)===

The cancelled world tour was rescheduled to 2022 with over 80 dates across more than 20 countries in spring/summer 2022. 

On 17 January 2022, Simple Minds released the single &quot;Act of Love&quot; to mark the anniversary of the band&#x27;s first performance on 17 January 1978 at Glasgow&#x27;s Satellite City. In a statement from the band, the track had ended up shelved in the process of recording Simple Minds&#x27; debut album, though it had a lasting life during various live performances. Kerr and other band members still enjoyed the demo recording so much that they vowed to officially release an alternate version eventually.

On 21 October 2022 the band released their studio album &quot;Direction of the Heart&quot; via BMG. The very same day, they released the lead single &quot;Vision Thing&quot; for free. COVID-19 quarantine restrictions prevented Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill, who both resided in Sicily, from traveling to the UK, so the new album had been recorded in Hamburg, with most tracks written, created and demoed in Sicily. On 9 July 2022, Simple Minds released a lyric video for &quot;Vision Thing&quot; on YouTube. A fourth single from the album, &quot;Solstice Kiss&quot;, released in October 2023, became a hit in the UK, reaching No. 2 on the UK Vinyl Singles Chart and entering the Top 40 on the UK Singles Chart for one week at No. 31. Former member John Giblin died on 14 May 2023.

On 27 October 2023, Simple Minds released the live album &quot;New Gold Dream – Live From Paisley Abbey&quot;, a recording of the one-off performance of their 1982 album &quot;New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)&quot; for Sky TV&#x27;s Greatest Albums Live series, held at Paisley Abbey. On 29 December 2023, Charlie Burchill announced that Erik Ljunggren would be joining the group on keyboards for the band&#x27;s 2024 tour.

===&quot;Everything Is Possible&quot; and &quot;Live in The City of Diamonds&quot; (2024–present) ===
On 10 December 2024, Simple Minds released a brand new single entitled &quot;Your Name in Lights&quot; also featured on the soundtrack of the career-spanning documentary &quot;Everything Is Possible&quot; also available the same day to stream and download on BBC iPlayer.

On 21 February 2025, Simple Minds announced the upccoming release on 25 April 2025 on multiple formats of &quot;Live in The City of Diamonds&quot;, a new live album recorded at a sold out Amsterdam&#x27;s Ziggo Dome on 6 April 2024 that completes the triptych of the &quot;Live in The City&quot; series dating back to 1987.

<text>&quot;
Chur is the capital and largest town of the Swiss canton of the Grisons and lies in the Grisonian Rhine Valley, where the Rhine turns towards the north, in the northern part of the canton. The city, on the right bank of the Rhine, is reputedly the oldest town in Switzerland.

The official language of Chur is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of Alemannic, known as Grisonian German. Romansh and Italian are significantly spoken in the city as a result of the trilingual identity of the canton.

On 1 January 2020 the former municipality of Maladers merged into Chur and on 1 January 2021 Haldenstein also merged. On 1 January 2025 the former municipality of Tschiertschen-Praden merged into Chur.

==History==


Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site, in the Eastern Alps, goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), making Chur one of the oldest settlements in Switzerland. Remains and objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages have also been found in the eastern sector of the centre of the current city. These include Bronze Age Urnfield and Laugen-Melaun settlements from 1300 to 800 BC and Iron Age settlements from the 5th to 3rd centuries BC.

The Roman Empire conquered the area that then came to be known as the Roman province of Raetia in 15 BC. Under emperor Diocletian (late 3rd century AD), the existing settlement of &quot;Curia Raetorum&quot; (later Chur) was made the capital of the newly established province of Raetia prima.

In the 4th century Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north of the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged British king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one in AD 451. The bishop soon acquired great temporal powers, especially after 831 when his dominions were made dependent on the Empire alone.

After the invasion of the Ostrogoths it may have been renamed &quot;Theodoricopolis&quot;; in the 6th century it was conquered by the Franks. The city suffered several invasions, by the Magyars in 925–926, when the cathedral was destroyed, and by the Saracens (940 and 954), but afterwards it flourished thanks to its location where the roads from several major Alpine transit routes come together and continue down the Rhine. The routes had already been used under the Romans but acquired greater importance under the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Otto I granted the town the right to collect tolls in 952 and appointed his vassal Hartpert as bishop of Chur in 958, giving the bishopric further privileges. In 1170 the bishop became a prince-bishop and kept total control over the road between Chur and Chiavenna.

In the 13th century the town had some 1,300 inhabitants and was surrounded by a line of walls. In the 14th century at least six fires damaged or destroyed the monasteries of and and and twice destroyed much of the town. The Gotteshausbund (League of the House of God) was formed in 1367 in Chur to resist the rising power of the Bishopric of Chur and the House of Habsburg. Chur was the chief town of the League and one of the places the League&#x27;s assemblies met regularly. A burgomaster (mayor) of Chur is first mentioned in 1413. The bishop&#x27;s residence was attacked by the inhabitants in 1418 and 1422, when a series of concessions were wrung out of him.

On 27 April 1464 most of the town was destroyed in a fire, which only the bishop&#x27;s estates and St. Luzi monastery survived. With the bishop&#x27;s power waning as he came increasingly under the influence of the nearby Habsburg County of Tyrol, the citizens sent a delegation to Emperor Frederick III. The Emperor reconfirmed the historic rights of Chur and also granted them extensive new rights which freed the city from the bishop&#x27;s power. In 1465 the citizens wrote a constitution that granted all governmental power to Chur&#x27;s guilds. All government positions were restricted to guild members, allowing the guilds to regulate all aspects of life in Chur. Since guild membership had become the only route to political power, local patricians and nobles quickly became guild members, often joining the winemakers guild.

The Chur-led League of the House of God allied with the Grey League and the League of the Ten Jurisdictions in 1471 to form the Three Leagues. In 1489 Chur obtained the right to have a tribunal of its own but never had the title of Free Imperial City. In 1497–98, concerned about Habsburg expansion and with the Bishop of Chur quarrelling with Austria, the Three Leagues formed an alliance with the Swiss Confederation. In 1499 the Swabian War broke out between the Three Leagues and Austria and quickly expanded to include the Confederation. During the war troops from Chur fought under the Bishop&#x27;s Vogt Heinrich Ammann in the Lower Engadin, in Prättigau and near Balzers. Troops from Chur also took part in the 1512 invasion of the Valtellina and the Second Musso War in 1530–31.
In 1523 was appointed parish priest of St Martin&#x27;s Church and began preaching the new faith of the Protestant Reformation. It spread rapidly and by 1525 the bishop had fled the city and Protestant services were taking place in the churches of St Martin and St Regula. The of 1524 and 1526 allowed each resident of the Three Leagues to choose their religion and sharply reduced the political and secular power of the Bishop of Chur and all monasteries in League territory. By 1527 all of Chur except the bishop&#x27;s estates had adopted the Reformation. On 23 January 1529 Abbot was publicly beheaded. Bishop , a friend of Charles Borromeo, tried, but without success, to suppress Protestantism. He died, probably poisoned, on 5 May 1565.

During the 16th century the German language started to prevail over Romansh. In 1479 about 300 houses and stalls burned in another fire. Nearly a century later, on 23 July 1574, a fire destroyed 174 houses and 114 stalls, or about half the city. Two years later, on 21 October 1576, another 53 houses were burned. Two years after the 1576 fire, the perpetrator, Hauptmann Stör, was executed.

After the Napoleonic Wars the Three Leagues became the Canton of Graubünden in 1803. The guild constitution of the city of Chur lasted until 1839 and in 1874 the &quot;Burgergemeinde&quot; was replaced by an &quot;Einwohnergemeinde&quot;. When Graubünden became a canton in 1803, Chur was chosen as its capital.

Chur&#x27;s is in the centre of town, and in the middle of the cemetery is a 13-tonne (13,000 kg) stone monument that dwarfs the nearby gravestones. The huge monolithic block of granite was erected in 1938 and for decades was largely ignored by passers-by until in 2023 a controversy arose after a Swiss historian discovered that it was originally built as propaganda for the Nazi regime.

<doc id="170458" wikidata="Q185047" url="?curid=170458" title="Spring and Autumn period">
<text>The Spring and Autumn period () was a period in Chinese history corresponding roughly to the first half of the Eastern Zhou (256 BCE), characterized by the gradual erosion of royal power as local lords nominally subject to the Zhou exercised increasing political autonomy. The period&#x27;s name derives from the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 481 BCE, which tradition associates with Confucius (551–479 BCE). 

During this period, local polities negotiated their own alliances, waged wars against one another, up to defying the king&#x27;s court in Luoyi. The gradual Partition of Jin, one of the most powerful states, is generally considered to mark the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period. The periodization dates to the late Western Han ().

==Background==
In 771 BCE, a Quanrong invasion in coalition with the states of Zeng and Shen—the latter polity being the fief of the grandfather of the disinherited crown prince Yijiu—destroyed the Western Zhou capital at Haojing, killing King You and establishing Yijiu as king at the eastern capital Luoyi. The event ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty, which is divided into the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States periods. During the Spring and Autumn period, China&#x27;s feudal &quot;fengjian&quot; system became largely irrelevant. The Zhou court, having lost its homeland in the Guanzhong region, held nominal power, but had real control over only a small royal demesne centered on Luoyi. During the early part of the Zhou dynasty period, royal relatives and generals had been given control over fiefdoms in an effort to maintain Zhou authority over vast territory. As the power of the Zhou kings waned, these fiefdoms became increasingly independent states.

The most important states (known later as the twelve vassals) came together in regular conferences where they decided important matters, such as military expeditions against foreign groups or against offending nobles. During these conferences one vassal ruler was sometimes declared hegemon.

As the era continued, larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones. By the 6th century BCE, most small states had disappeared and just a few large and powerful principalities dominated China. Some southern states, such as Chu and Wu, claimed independence from the Zhou, who undertook wars against some of them (Wu and Yue).

Amid the interstate power struggles, internal conflict was also rife: six elite landholding families waged war on each other inside Jin, political enemies set about eliminating the Chen family in Qi, and the legitimacy of the rulers was often challenged in civil wars by various royal family members in Qin and Chu. Once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions, the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the Warring States period, which began in 403 BCE when the three remaining elite families in Jin—Zhao, Wei, and Han—partitioned the state.

==Early Spring and Autumn (771–685 BCE)==
===Court moves east (771)===
After the Zhou capital was sacked by the Marquess of Shen and the Quanrong barbarians, the Zhou moved the capital east from the now desolated Zongzhou in Haojing near modern Xi&#x27;an to Wangcheng in the Yellow River Valley. The Zhou royalty was then closer to its main supporters, particularly Jin, and Zheng; the Zhou royal family had much weaker authority and relied on lords from these vassal states for protection, especially during their flight to the eastern capital. In Chengzhou, Prince Yijiu was crowned by his supporters as King Ping. However, with the Zhou domain greatly reduced to Chengzhou and nearby areas, the court could no longer support the six army groups it had in the past; Zhou kings had to request help from powerful vassal states for protection from raids and for resolution of internal power struggles. The Zhou court would never regain its original authority; instead, it was relegated to being merely a figurehead of the regional states and ritual leader of the Ji clan ancestral temple. Though the king retained the Mandate of Heaven, the title held little actual power.

With the decline of Zhou power, the Yellow River drainage basin was divided into hundreds of small, autonomous states, most of them consisting of a single city, though a handful of multi-city states, particularly those on the periphery, had power and opportunity to expand outward. A total of 148 states are mentioned in the chronicles for this period, 128 of which were absorbed by the four largest states by the end of the period.

Shortly after the royal court&#x27;s move to Chengzhou, a hierarchical alliance system arose where the Zhou king would give the title of hegemon () to the leader of the state with the most powerful military; the hegemon was obligated to protect both the weaker Zhou states and the Zhou royalty from the intruding non-Zhou peoples: the Northern Di, the Southern Man, the Eastern Yi, and the Western Rong. This political framework retained the &quot;fēngjiàn&quot; power structure, though interstate and intrastate conflict often led to declining regard for clan customs, respect for the Ji family, and solidarity with other Zhou peoples. The king&#x27;s prestige legitimized the military leaders of the states, and helped mobilize collective defense of Zhou territory against &quot;barbarians&quot;.

Over the next two centuries, the four most powerful states—Qin, Jin, Qi and Chu—struggled for power. These multi-city states often used the pretext of aid and protection to intervene and gain suzerainty over the smaller states. During this rapid expansion, interstate relations alternated between low-level warfare and complex diplomacy.

===Zheng falls out with the court (722–685)===
Duke Yin of Lu ascended the throne in 722. From this year on, the state of Lu kept an official chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, which along with its commentaries is the standard source for the Spring and Autumn period. Corresponding chronicles are known to have existed in other states as well, but all but the Lu chronicle have been lost.

In 717, Duke Zhuang of Zheng went to the capital for an audience with King Huan. During the encounter the duke felt he was not treated with the respect and etiquette which would have been appropriate, given that Zheng was now the chief protector of the capital. In 715, Zheng also became involved in a border dispute with Lu regarding the Fields of Xu. The fields had been put in the care of Lu by the king for the exclusive purpose of producing royal sacrifices for the sacred Mount Tai. For Zheng to regard the fields as just any other piece of land was an insult to the court.

By 707, relations had soured enough that the king launched a punitive expedition against Zheng. The duke counterattacked and raided Zhou territory, defeating the royal forces in the Battle of Xuge and injuring the king himself. Zheng was the first vassal to openly defy the king, kicking off the centuries of warfare without respect for the old traditions which would characterize the period.

The display of Zheng&#x27;s martial strength was effective until succession problems after Zhuang&#x27;s death in 701 weakened the state.

In 692, there was a failed assassination attempt against King Zhuang, orchestrated by elements at court.

==The Five Hegemons (685–591 BCE)==


===Hegemony of Qi (685–643)===

&lt;section begin=&quot;齊桓公霸&quot; /&gt;The first hegemon was Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643). With the help of his prime minister, Guan Zhong, Duke Huan reformed Qi to centralize its power structure. The state consisted of 15 &quot;townships&quot; () with the duke and two senior ministers each in charge of five; military functions were also united with civil ones. These and related reforms provided the state, already powerful from control of trade crossroads, with a greater ability to mobilize resources than the more loosely organized states.

By 667, Qi had clearly shown its economic and military predominance, and Duke Huan assembled the leaders of Lu, Song, Chen, and Zheng, who elected him as their leader. Soon after, King Hui of Zhou conferred the title of &quot;bà&quot; (hegemon), giving Duke Huan royal authority in military ventures.&lt;section end=&quot;齊桓公霸&quot; /&gt; An important basis for justifying Qi&#x27;s dominance over the other states was presented in the slogan &#x27;Revere the King, Expel the Barbarians&#x27; (). The role of subsequent hegemons would also be framed in this way: as the primary defender and supporter of nominal Zhou authority and the existing order. Using this authority, during the first eleven years of his hegemony, Duke Huan intervened in a power struggle in Lu; protected Yan from encroaching Western Rong nomads; drove off Northern Di nomads after their invasions of Wey and Xing, providing the people with provisions and protective garrison units; and led an alliance of eight states to conquer Cai and thereby block the northward expansion of Chu.

At his death in 643, five of Duke Huan&#x27;s sons contended for the throne, badly weakening the state so that it was no longer regarded as the hegemon. For nearly ten years, no ruler held the title.

===Hegemony of Song (643–637)===

Duke Xiang of Song attempted to claim the hegemony in the wake of Qi&#x27;s decline, perhaps driven by a desire to restore the Shang dynasty from which Song had descended. He hosted peace conferences in the same style as Qi had done, and conducted aggressive military campaigns against his rivals. Duke Xiang&#x27;s ambitions met their end when, against the advice of his staff, he attacked the much larger state of Chu. The Song forces were defeated at the battle of Hong (泓) in 638, and the duke himself died in the following year from an injury sustained in the battle. After Xiang&#x27;s death his successors adopted a more modest foreign policy, better suited to the country&#x27;s small size.

As Duke Xiang was never officially recognized as hegemon by the King of Zhou, not all sources list him as one of the Five Hegemons.

===Hegemony of Jin (636–628)===

When Duke Wen of Jin came to power in 636 after extensive peregrinations in exile, he capitalized on the reforms of his father, Duke Xian (r. 676–651), who had centralized the state, killed off relatives who might threaten his authority, conquered sixteen smaller states, and even absorbed some Rong and Di peoples to make Jin much more powerful than it had been previously. When he assisted King Xiang in a succession struggle in 635, the king awarded Jin with strategically valuable territory near Chengzhou.

Duke Wen then used his growing power to coordinate a military response with Qi, Qin, and Song against Chu, which had begun encroaching northward after the death of Duke Huán of Qi. With a decisive Chu loss at the Battle of Chengpu in 632, Duke Wen&#x27;s loyalty to the Zhou king was rewarded at an interstate conference when King Xīang awarded him the title of &quot;bà&quot;.

After the death of Duke Wen in 628, a growing tension manifested in interstate violence that turned smaller states, particularly those at the border between Jin and Chu, into sites of constant warfare; Qi and Qin also engaged in numerous interstate skirmishes with Jin or its allies to boost their own power.

===Hegemony of Qin (628–621)===

Duke Mu of Qin ascended the throne in 659 and forged an alliance with Jin by marrying his daughter to Duke Wen. In 624, he established hegemony over the western Rong barbarians and became the most powerful lord of the time. However he did not chair any alliance with other states nor was he officially recognized as hegemon by the king. Therefore, not all sources accept him as one of the Five Hegemons.

===Hegemony of Chu (613–591)===

King Zhuang of Chu expanded the borders of Chu well north of the Yangtze River, threatening the Central States in modern Henan. At one point the Chu forces advanced to just outside the royal capital of Chengzhou, upon which King Zhuang sent a messenger to inquire into the heft and bulk of the Nine Cauldrons – the symbols of royal ritual authority – implying he might soon arrange to have them moved to his own capital. In the end the Zhou capital was spared, and Chu shifted focus to harassing the nearby state of Zheng. The once-hegemon state of Jin intervened to rescue Zheng from the Chu invaders but were resolutely defeated, which marks the ascension of Chu as the dominant state of the time.

Despite his &quot;de facto&quot; hegemony, King Zhuang&#x27;s self-proclaimed title of &quot;king&quot; was never recognized by the Zhou states. In the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; he is defiantly referred to as &quot;Zi&quot; (, ruler; unratified lord), even at a time when he dominated most of south China. Later historians however always include him as one of the Five Hegemons.

==Late Spring and Autumn (591–453 BCE)==
===The Six Ministers (588)===

In addition to interstate conflict, internal conflicts between state leaders and local aristocrats also occurred. &lt;section begin=&quot;ministers&quot; /&gt;Eventually the dukes of Lu, Jin, Zheng, Wey and Qi would all become figureheads to powerful aristocratic families.

In the case of Jin, the shift happened in 588 when the army was split into six independent divisions, each dominated by a separate noble family: Zhi (智), Zhao (趙), Han (韓), Wei (魏), Fan (范), and Zhonghang (中行). The heads of the six families were conferred the titles of viscounts and made ministers, each heading one of the six departments of Zhou dynasty government. From this point on, historians refer to &quot;The Six Ministers&quot; as the true power brokers of Jin.

The same happened to Lu in 562, when the Three Huan divided the army into three parts and established their own separate spheres of influence. The heads of the three families were always among the department heads of Lu.&lt;section end=&quot;ministers&quot; /&gt;

===Rise of Wu (584)===
Wu was a state in modern Jiangsu outside the Zhou cultural sphere, considered &quot;barbarian&quot;, where the inhabitants sported short hair and tattoos and spoke an unintelligible language. Although its ruling house claimed to be a senior lineage in the Ji ancestral temple, Wu did not participate in the politics and wars of China until the last third of the Spring and Autumn period.

Their first documented interaction with the Spring and Autumn states was in 584, when a Wu force attacked the small border state of Tan (郯) causing some alarm in the various Chinese courts. Jin was quick to dispatch an ambassador to the court of the Wu king, Shoumeng. Jin promised to supply Wu with modern military technology and training in exchange for an alliance against Chu, a neighbour of Wu and Jin&#x27;s nemesis in the struggle for hegemony. King Shoumeng accepted the offer, and Wu would continue to harass Chu for years to come.

===Attempts at peace (579)===
After a period of increasingly exhausting warfare, Qi, Qin, Jin and Chu met at a disarmament conference in 579 and agreed to declare a truce to limit their military strength. This peace did not last very long and it soon became apparent that the &quot;bà&quot; role had become outdated; the four major states had each acquired their own spheres of control and the notion of protecting Zhou territory had become less cogent as the control over (and the resulting cultural assimilation of) non-Zhou peoples, as well as Chu&#x27;s control of some Zhou areas, further blurred an already vague distinction between Zhou and non-Zhou.

In addition, new aristocratic houses were founded with loyalties to powerful states, rather than directly to the Zhou kings, though this process slowed down by the end of the seventh century, possibly because territory available for expansion had been largely exhausted. The Zhou kings had also lost much of their prestige so that, when Duke Dao of Jin (r. 572–558) was recognized as &quot;bà&quot;, it carried much less meaning than it had before.

===Hegemony of Wu (506–496)===

In 506, King Helü ascended the throne of Wu. With the help of Wu Zixu and Sun Tzu, the author of &quot;The Art of War&quot;, he launched major offensives against the state of Chu. They prevailed in five battles, one of which was the Battle of Boju, and conquered the capital Ying. However, Chu managed to ask the state of Qin for help, and after being defeated by Qin, the vanguard general of Wu troops, Fugai, a younger brother of Helü, led a rebellion. After beating Fugai, Helü was forced to leave Chu. Fugai later retired to Chu and settled there. King Helü died during an invasion of Yue in 496. Some sources such as the Confucian text &quot;Bai Hu Tong&quot; list him as one of the Five Hegemons.

He was succeeded by his son King Fuchai of Wu, who nearly destroyed the Yue state, imprisoning King Goujian of Yue. Subsequently, Fuchai defeated Qi and extended Wu influence into central China.

In 499, the philosopher Confucius was made acting prime minister of Lu. He is traditionally (if improbably) considered the author or editor of the &quot;Spring and Autumn annals&quot;, from which much of the information for this period is drawn. After only two years he was forced to resign and spent many years wandering between different states before returning to Lu. After returning to Lu he did not resume a political career, preferring to teach. Tradition holds that it was in this time he edited or wrote the Five Classics, including the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;.

===Hegemony of Yue (496–465)===

In 482, King Fuchai of Wu held an interstate conference to solidify his power base, but Yue captured the Wu capital. Fuchai rushed back but was besieged and died when the city fell in 473. Yue then concentrated on weaker neighbouring states, rather than the great powers to the north. With help from Wu&#x27;s enemy Chu, Yue was able to be victorious after several decades of conflict. King Goujian destroyed and annexed Wu in 473, after which he was recognized as hegemon.

The &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, &quot;Guoyu&quot;, and &quot;Shiji&quot; provide almost no information about Goujian&#x27;s subsequent reign or policies. What little is said is told from the perspective of other states, such as Duke Ai of Lu trying to enlist Yue&#x27;s help in a coup against the Three Huan. Sima Qian notes that Goujian reigned on until his death, and that afterwards his descendants—for whom no biographical information is given—continued to rule for six generations before the state was finally absorbed into Chu during the Warring States period.

===Partition of Jin===

After the great age of Jin power, the Jin rulers began to lose authority over their ministerial lineages. A full-scale civil war between 497 and 453 ended with the elimination of most noble lines; the remaining aristocratic families divided Jin into three successor states: Han, Wei, and Zhao. This is the last event recorded in the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;.

With the absorption of most of the smaller states in the era, this partitioning left seven major states in the Zhou world: the three fragments of Jin, the three remaining great powers of Qin, Chu and Qi, and the weaker state of Yan () near modern Beijing. The partition of Jin, along with the Usurpation of Qi by Tian, marks the beginning of the Warring States period.

==Interstate relations==

Ancient sources such as the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; and the eponymous &quot;Chunqiu&quot; record the various diplomatic activities, such as court visits paid by one ruler to another (), meetings of officials or nobles of different states (), missions of friendly inquiries sent by the ruler of one state to another (), emissaries sent from one state to another (), and hunting parties attended by representatives of different states ().

Because of Chu&#x27;s non-Zhou origin, the state was considered semi-barbarian and its rulers—beginning with King Wu in 704 BCE—proclaimed themselves kings in their own right. Chu intrusion into Zhou territory was checked several times by the other states, particularly in the major battles of Chengpu (632 BCE), Bi (595 BCE) and Yanling (575 BCE), which restored the states of Chen and Cai.

==Literature==

Some version of the Five Classics existed in Spring and Autumn period, as characters in the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; and &quot;Analects&quot; frequently quote the &quot;Book of Poetry&quot; and &quot;Book of Documents&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; depicts some characters actually &quot;composing&quot; poems that would later be included in the received text of the &quot;Book of Poetry&quot;. In the &quot;Analects&quot; there are frequent references to &quot;The Rites&quot;, but as Classical Chinese does not employ punctuation or any markup to distinguish book titles from regular nouns it is not possible to know if what is meant is the &quot;Etiquette and Ceremonial&quot; (known then as the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;) or just the concept of ritual in general. On the other hand, the existence of the &quot;Book of Changes&quot; is well-attested in the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, as multiple characters use it for divination and accurately quote the received text.

Sima Qian claims that it was Confucius who, towards the close of the Spring and Autumn period, edited the received versions of the &quot;Book of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, and &quot;Book of Rites&quot;; wrote the &quot;Ten Wings&quot; commentary on the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;; and wrote the entirety of the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. This was long the predominant opinion in China, but modern scholarship considers it unlikely that all five classics could be the product of one man. The transmitted versions of these works all derive from the versions edited by Liu Xin in the century following Sima Qian.

While many philosophers such as Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu were active in the Spring and Autumn period, their ideas were probably not put into writing until the following Warring States period.

==Aristocracy==
While the aristocracy of the Western Zhou frequently interacted via the medium of the royal court, the collapse of central power at the end of the first half of the dynasty left in its wake hundreds of autonomous polities varying drastically in size and resources, nominally connected by bonds of cultural and ritual affiliation increasingly attenuated by the passage of time. Whole lineage groups moved around under socioeconomic stress, border groups not associated with the Zhou culture gained in power and sophistication, and the geopolitical situation demanded increased contact and communication.

Under this new regime, an emergent systematization of noble ranks took root. Where the Western Zhou had concerned itself with politics, the ancestral temples, and legitimacy, in the Eastern Zhou politics came to the fore. Titles which had previously reflected lineage seniority took on purely political meanings. At the top of the bunch were &quot;Gong&quot; () and &quot;Hou&quot; (), favoured lineages of old with generally larger territories and greater resources and prestige at their disposal. The majority of rulers were of the middling but tiered grades &quot;Bo&quot; () and &quot;Zi&quot; (). The rulers of two polities maintained the title &quot;Nan&quot; (). A 2012 survey found no difference in grade between &quot;Gong&quot; and &quot;Hou&quot;, or between &quot;Zi&quot; and &quot;Nan&quot;. Meanwhile, a new class of lower-tier aristocrats formed: the &quot;Shi&quot; (), gentlemen too distantly related to the great houses to be born into a life of wielding power, but still part of the elite culture, aiming at upward social mobility, typically through the vector of officialdom.

One individual well attested in the process of fixing the ranks of rulers into a coherent scheme was Zichan of Zheng, who both submitted a memorial to the king of Chu informing him of the proposed new system in 538 BCE, and argued at a 529 BCE interstate conference that tributes should be graded based on rank, given the disparity in available resources.

Alongside this development, there was precedent of Zhou kings &quot;upgrading&quot; noble ranks as a reward for service to the throne, giving the recipients a bit more diplomatic prestige without costing the royal house any land. During the decline of the royal house, although real power was wrested from their grasp, their divine legitimacy was not brought into question, and even with the king reduced to something of a figurehead, his prestige remained supreme as Heaven&#x27;s eldest son.

Archaeologically excavated primary sources and received literature agree to a high degree of systematization and stability in noble titles during the Eastern Zhou, indicating an actual historical process. A 2007 survey of bronze inscriptions from 31 states found only eight polities whose rulers used varying titles of nobility to describe themselves.

==Important figures==
The Five Hegemons (春秋五霸):
With the royal house of Zhou lacking the military strength to defend itself, and with the various states experiencing tension and conflict, certain very powerful lords took the position of hegemon, ostensibly to uphold the house of Zhou and maintain the peace to the degree possible. They paid tribute to the royal court, and were owed tribute by the other rulers. Traditional history lists five hegemons during the Spring and Autumn period:
* Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643 BCE)
* Duke Xiang of Song (r. 650–637 BCE)
* Duke Wen of Jin (r. 636–628 BCE)
* Duke Mu of Qin (r. 659–621 BCE)
* King Zhuang of Chu (r. 613–591 BCE)

<text>James Todd Smith (born January 14, 1968), known professionally as LL Cool J (short for Ladies Love Cool James), is an American rapper and actor. He is one of the earliest rappers to achieve commercial success, alongside fellow new school hip hop acts Beastie Boys and Run-DMC.

Signed to Def Jam Recordings in 1984, LL Cool J&#x27;s breakthrough came with his single &quot;I Need a Beat&quot; and his landmark debut album, &quot;Radio&quot; (1985). He achieved further commercial and critical success with the albums &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot; (1987), &quot;Walking with a Panther&quot; (1989), &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; (1990), &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; (1995), and &quot;Phenomenon&quot; (1997). His twelfth album, &quot;Exit 13&quot; (2008), was his last in his long-tenured deal with Def Jam. He later re-signed with the label and released his fourteenth album, &quot;The FORCE&quot; (2024).

LL Cool J has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Halloween H20&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Mindhunters&quot;, &quot;Last Holiday&quot;, and &quot;Edison&quot;. He played NCIS Special Agent Sam Hanna in the CBS crime drama television series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. LL Cool J was also the host of &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; on Paramount Network.

A two-time Grammy Award winner, LL Cool J is known for hip hop songs such as &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot;, &quot;The Boomin&#x27; System&quot;, &quot;Rock the Bells&quot;, and &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;, as well as R&amp;B hits such as &quot;Doin&#x27; It&quot;, &quot;I Need Love&quot;, &quot;Around the Way Girl&quot; and &quot;Hey Lover&quot;. In 2010, VH1 placed him on their &quot;100 Greatest Artists Of All Time&quot; list. In 2017, LL Cool J became the first rapper to receive the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2021, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence category.

==Early life and family==
James Todd Smith was born on January 14, 1968, in Bay Shore, on Long Island, New York to Ondrea Griffith (born January 19, 1946) and James Louis Smith Jr, also known as James Nunya. His grandfather, who adopted Smith&#x27;s mother, is of Barbadian descent. His 1997 memoir says his father abused his mother. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;[As] a kid growing up middle class and Catholic in Queens, life for Smith was heart-breaking. His father shot his mother and grandfather, nearly killing them both. When 4-year-old Smith found them, blood was everywhere.&quot; In 1972, Smith and his mother moved into his grandparents&#x27; home in St. Albans, Queens, where he was raised. He suffered physical and mental abuse from his mother&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Roscoe.

Smith began rapping at the age of 10, influenced by the hip-hop group The Treacherous Three. In 1984, sixteen-year-old Smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents&#x27; home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, bought him $2,000 worth of equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. During this time, Smith reconciled with his father who &quot;made amends for a lot of things&quot; by offering him guidance at the start of his music career. His mother was also supportive of his musical endeavors, using her tax refund to buy him a Korg drum machine. Smith has stated that by the time he received musical equipment from his relatives, he &quot;was already a rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It&#x27;s like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house.&quot; This was at the same time that NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons founded the then-independent Def Jam label. By using the mixer he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Def Jam.

== Musical career ==
In the VH1 documentary &quot;Planet Rock: The Story of Hip Hop and the Crack Generation&quot;, Smith revealed that he initially called himself J-Ski, but did not want to associate his stage name with the cocaine culture (The rappers who use &quot;Ski&quot; or &quot;Blow&quot; as part of their stage name, e.g., Kurtis Blow and Joeski Love, were associated with the rise of the cocaine culture, as depicted in the 1983 remake of &quot;Scarface&quot;.) Under his new stage name LL Cool J (an abbreviation for Ladies Love Cool James), coined by his friend and fellow rapper Mikey D, Smith was signed by Def Jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the 12-inch single &quot;I Need a Beat&quot; (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating &quot;I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home.&quot; That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating &quot;They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing. ... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said &#x27;This is what I want to do&#x27;.&quot; LL&#x27;s debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of &quot;I Need a Beat&quot;, along with the Beastie Boys&#x27; single &quot;Rock Hard&quot; (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.

===1985–1987: &quot;Radio&quot;===
&quot;Radio&quot; was released to critical acclaim, both for production innovation and LL&#x27;s powerful rap.
Released November 18, 1985, on Def Jam Recordings in the United States, &quot;Radio&quot; earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. Shortly after its release, the album sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Radio&quot; peaked at number 6 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It entered the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on December 28, 1985, and remained there for 47 weeks, while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11, 1986, remaining on that chart for thirty-eight weeks. By 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with sales exceeding one million copies; it had previously earned a gold certification in the United States on April 14, 1986.
&quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot; and &quot;Rock the Bells&quot; were singles that helped the album go platinum. It eventually reached 1,500,000 copies sold in the U.S.

With the breakthrough success of his hit single &quot;I Need a Beat&quot; and the &quot;Radio&quot; LP, LL Cool J became one of the early hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-D.M.C. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986–&#x27;87 &quot;Raising Hell&quot; tour, opening for Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys. Another milestone of LL&#x27;s popularity was his appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; as the first hip hop act on the show, as well as an appearance on Diana Ross&#x27; 1987 television special, &quot;Red Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot;.

The album&#x27;s success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin&#x27;s credibility and repertoire as a record producer. &quot;Radio&quot;, along with &quot;Raising Hell&quot; (1986) and &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. Rubin&#x27;s production credit on the back cover reads &quot;REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN&quot;, referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin&#x27;s production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. Rubin&#x27;s early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.

===1987–1993: Breakthrough and success===
LL Cool J&#x27;s second album was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot;, which was produced by DJ Pooh and the L.A. Posse. This stands as one of his biggest-selling career albums, having sold in excess of two million copies in the United States alone. It spent 11 weeks at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s R&amp;B albums chart. It also reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop albums chart. The album featured the singles &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot;, the revolutionary &quot;I Need Love&quot; – LL&#x27;s first #1 R&amp;B and Top 40 hit, &quot;Kanday&quot;, &quot;Bristol Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Go Cut Creator Go&quot;.
While &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot;, which was a big success, was produced by the L.A. Posse (at the time consisting of Dwayne Simon, Darryl Pierce and, according to himself the most important for crafting the sound of the LP, Bobby &quot;Bobcat&quot; Ervin), Dwayne Simon was the only one left willing to work on producing LL Cool J&#x27;s third album &quot;Walking with a Panther&quot;. Released in 1989, the album was a commercial success, with several charting singles (&quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;, which had originally been released on the 1987 movie soundtrack &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m That Type of Guy&quot;, &quot;Big Ole Butt&quot;, and &quot;One Shot at Love&quot;). Despite commercial appeal, the album was often criticized by the hip-hop community as being too commercial and materialistic, and for focusing too much on love ballads. As a result, his audience base began to decline due to the album&#x27;s bold commercial and pop aspirations. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the album peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was LL Cool J&#x27;s second #1 R&amp;B Album where it spent five weeks.

In 1990, LL released &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot;, his fourth studio album. The Marley Marl produced album received critical acclaim and eventually went double Platinum, selling over two million copies according to the RIAA. &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; marked a turning point in LL Cool J&#x27;s career, as he proved to critics his ability to stay relevant and hard-edged despite the misgivings of his previous album. LL won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 1992 for the title track. The album&#x27;s immense success propelled &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; to be LL&#x27;s top selling album of his career (as of 2002) and solidified his status as a hip-hop icon. During this time, LL also recorded a rap solo for Michael Jackson&#x27;s demo of a song called &quot;Serious Effect&quot; which remains unreleased, but was later leaked online.

===1993–2005: Continued success and career prominence===

After acting in &quot;The Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Toys&quot;, LL Cool J released &quot;14 Shots to the Dome&quot; in March 1993. The album had four singles (&quot;How I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Back Seat (of My Jeep)&quot;, &quot;Pink Cookies in a Plastic Bag Getting Crushed by Buildings&quot;, &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;) and guest-featured Lords of the Underground on &quot;NFA-No Frontin&#x27; Allowed&quot;. That June, the album went gold.

LL Cool J starred in &quot;In the House&quot;, an NBC sitcom, before releasing his album &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; (1995), which went on to sell over two million copies. Its singles included &quot;Hey Lover&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; It&quot; and &quot;Loungin&quot;. &quot;Hey Lover&quot;, featured Boyz II Men, and sampled Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot;. The song also earned him a Grammy Award. Another song from the album, &quot;I Shot Ya Remix&quot;, included debut vocal work by Foxy Brown.
In 1996, Def Jam released this &quot;greatest hits&quot; package, offering a good summary of Cool J&#x27;s career, from the relentless minimalism of early hits such as &quot;Rock the Bells&quot; to the smooth-talking braggadocio that followed. Classic albums including &quot;Bigger and Deffer&quot; and &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; are well represented here. In December 1996, his loose cover of the Rufus and Chaka Khan song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; was included on the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; soundtrack &amp; released as a single. LL Cool J&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; was particularly successful in the United Kingdom, where it topped the UK Singles Chart in early-1997.
Later that same year, he released the album &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. The singles included &quot;Phenomenon&quot; and &quot;Father&quot;. The official second single from &quot;Phenomenon&quot; was &quot;4, 3, 2, 1&quot;, which featured Method Man, Redman &amp; Master P and introduced DMX and Canibus.

In 2000, LL Cool J released the album &quot;G.O.A.T.&quot;, which stood for the &quot;Greatest of All Time.&quot; It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, and went platinum. LL Cool J thanked Canibus in the liner notes of the album, &quot;for the inspiration&quot;. LL Cool J&#x27;s next album &quot;10&quot; from 2002, was his ninth studio (10th overall including his greatest hits compilation All World), and included the singles &quot;Paradise&quot; (featuring Amerie), and the number 1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Luv U Better&quot;, produced by the Neptunes. Later pressings of the album added the 2003 Jennifer Lopez duet, &quot;All I Have&quot;. The album reached platinum status. LL Cool J&#x27;s tenth album &quot;The DEFinition&quot; was released on August 31, 2004. The album debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Production came from Timbaland, 7 Aurelius, R. Kelly, and others. The lead single was the Timbaland-produced &quot;Headsprung&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on the Hip-Hop and R&amp;B singles chart, and No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single was the 7 Aurelius–produced, &quot;Hush&quot;, which peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hip-Hop and R&amp;B chart and No. 26 on the Hot 100.

===2006–2012: &quot;Exit 13&quot; and touring===
LL Cool J&#x27;s 11th album, &quot;Todd Smith&quot;, was released on April 11, 2006. It includes collaborations with 112, Ginuwine, Juelz Santana, Teairra Mari and Freeway. The first single was the Jermaine Dupri-produced &quot;Control Myself&quot; featuring Jennifer Lopez. They shot the video for &quot;Control Myself&quot; on January 2, 2006, at Sony Studios, New York. The second video, directed by Hype Williams, was &quot;Freeze&quot; featuring Lyfe Jennings.
In July 2006, LL Cool J announced details about his final album with Def Jam Recordings, the only label he has ever been signed to. The album is titled &quot;Exit 13&quot;. The album was originally scheduled to be executively produced by fellow Queens rapper 50 Cent. &quot;Exit 13&quot; was originally slated for a fall 2006 release, however, after a 2-year delay, it was released on September 9, 2008, without 50 Cent as the executive producer. Tracks that the two worked on were leaked to the internet and some of the tracks produced with 50 made it to Exit 13.
LL Cool J partnered with DJ Kay Slay to release a mixtape called &quot;The Return of the G.O.A.T.&quot;. It was the first mixtape of his 24-year career and includes freestyling by LL Cool J in addition to other rappers giving their renditions of his songs. A track titled &quot;Hi Haterz&quot; was leaked onto the internet on June 1, 2008. The song contains LL Cool J rapping over the instrumental to Maino&#x27;s &quot;Hi Hater&quot;. He toured with Janet Jackson on her Rock Witchu tour, only playing in Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and Kansas City.

In September 2009, LL Cool J released a song about the &quot;NCIS&quot; TV series. It is a single and is available on iTunes. The new track is based on his experiences playing special agent Sam Hanna. &quot;This song is the musical interpretation of what I felt after meeting with NCIS agents, experienced Marines and Navy SEALs,&quot; LL Cool J said. &quot;It represents the collective energy in the room. I was so inspired I wrote the song on set.&quot;

At South by Southwest in March 2011, LL Cool J was revealed to be Z-Trip&#x27;s special guest at the Red Bull Thre3Style showcase. This marked the beginning of a creative collaboration between the rap and DJ superstars. The two took part in an interview with Carson Daly where they discussed their partnership. Both artists have promised future collaborations down the road, with LL Cool J calling the duo &quot;organic&quot; One early track to feature LL&#x27;s talents was Z-Trip&#x27;s remix of British rock act Kasabian&#x27;s single &quot;Days Are Forgotten&quot;, which was named by influential DJ Zane Lowe as his &quot;Hottest Record In The World&quot; and received a favorable reception in both Belgium and the United Kingdom. In January 2012, the pair released the track &quot;Super Baller&quot; as a free download to celebrate the New York Giants Super Bowl victory. The two have been touring together since 2011, with future dates planned through 2012 and beyond.

===2012–2023: &quot;Authentic&quot;, &quot;G.O.A.T. 2&quot; and recognition===
On October 6, 2012, LL Cool J released &quot;Ratchet&quot;, a new single from his upcoming album titled &quot;Authentic Hip-Hop&quot;. Following that, on November 3, 2012, LL collaborated with Joe and the production duo Trackmasters on his second single, &quot;Take It&quot;.

On February 8, 2013, it was announced that the title of LL&#x27;s upcoming album would be changed from &quot;Authentic Hip-Hop&quot; to &quot;Authentic&quot;, with a new release date of April 30, 2013. A new cover was also unveiled. At around the same time, it was announced that LL Cool J had collaborated with Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen on two tracks on the album.

On October 16, 2013, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced LL Cool J as a nominee for inclusion in 2014. In October 2014, LL announced that his 14th studio album would be called &quot;G.O.A.T. 2&quot; and would be released in 2015. LL stated that &quot;the concept behind the album was to give upcoming artists an opportunity to shine, and put myself in the position where I have to spit bars with some of the hardest rhymers in the game&quot;; however, the album was put on hold. LL Cool J explained the reason for it, saying, &quot;It was good but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was ready yet.&quot;

On January 21, 2016, LL received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In March 2016, LL announced his retirement on social media, but quickly walked back his announcement and indicated that a new album was on the way. LL hosted the Grammy Awards Show for five consecutive years, from the 54th Grammy Awards on February 12, 2012, through the 58th Grammy Awards on February 15, 2016.

In October 2018, LL Cool J was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In September 2019, it was announced that LL had re-signed to Def Jam for future album releases.

On December 29, 2021, LL Cool J canceled his performance at Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2022 after testing positive for COVID-19.

The album was released on September 6, 2024, under Def Jam Recordings, his first under the label since 2008&#x27;s &quot;Exit 13&quot;, and distributed by Def Jam and UMG&#x27;s sister counterpart Virgin Music Group, instead of parent company Universal Music Group. The single &quot;Proclivities&quot;, featuring rapper Saweetie, was released in August 2024. On August 31, 2024, LL Cool J released the album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Murdergram Deux&quot;, featuring Eminem.

==Acting career==
While LL Cool J first appeared as a rapper in the movie &quot;Krush Groove&quot; (performing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot;), his first acting part was a small role in a high school football movie called &quot;Wildcats&quot;. He landed the role of Captain Patrick Zevo in Barry Levinson&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Toys&quot;. From 1995 to 1999, he starred in his own television sitcom &quot;In the House&quot;. He portrayed an ex-Oakland Raiders running back who finds himself in financial difficulties and is forced to rent part of his home out to a single mother and her two children, one of whom moves out with her before the third season.

In 1998, LL Cool J played security guard Ronny in &quot;Halloween H20&quot;, the seventh movie in the &quot;Halloween franchise&quot;. In 1999, he co-starred as Preacher, the chef in the Renny Harlin horror/comedy &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;. He received positive reviews for his role as Dwayne Gittens, an underworld boss nicknamed &quot;God&quot;, in &quot;In Too Deep&quot;. Later that year, he starred as Julian Washington—a talented but selfish running back on fictional professional football team the Miami Sharks—in Oliver Stone&#x27;s drama &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;. He and co-star Jamie Foxx allegedly got into a real fistfight while filming a fight scene. During the next two years, LL Cool J appeared in &quot;Rollerball&quot;, &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, and &quot;Mindhunters&quot;.

In 2005, he returned to television in a guest-starring role on the Fox medical drama &quot;House&quot;; he portrayed a death row inmate felled by an unknown disease in an episode titled &quot;Acceptance&quot;. He appeared as Queen Latifah&#x27;s love interest in the 2006 movie &quot;Last Holiday&quot;. He also guest-starred on &quot;30 Rock&quot; in the 2007 episode &quot;The Source Awards&quot;, portraying a hip-hop producer called Ridikulous who Tracy Jordan fears may kill him. LL Cool J appeared in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s 39th season, introducing the word of the day--&quot;Unanimous&quot;—in episode 4169 (September 22, 2008) and performing &quot;The Addition Expedition&quot; in episode 4172 (September 30, 2008).

In 2009, he began starring on the CBS police procedural &quot;&quot;. The show ran for 14 seasons and is a spin-off of &quot;NCIS&quot;, which itself is a spin-off of the naval legal drama &quot;JAG&quot;. LL Cool J portrayed NCIS Special Agent Sam Hanna, an ex–Navy SEAL who is fluent in Arabic and is an expert on West Asian culture. The series debuted in autumn of 2009, but the characters were introduced in an April 2009 crossover episode on the parent show. In 2013, LL received a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor: Action for his work on the program. In May 2023, following the series finale of &quot;NCIS: Los Angeles&quot;, it was announced that LL would reprise the role of Sam Hanna as a recurring guest star in the third season of &quot;&quot;.

In December 2013, LL co-starred as a gym owner in the sports dramedy &quot;Grudge Match&quot;. From 2015 to 2019, LL hosted the show &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;. He was also cast to play Beth&#x27;s father in &quot;Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising&quot;, as shown in a trailer for the film, but his scenes were cut from the final product.

==Other ventures==
LL Cool J worked behind the scenes with the mid-1980s hip-hop sportswear line TROOP.
He also launched a clothing line (called &quot;Todd Smith&quot;). The brand produced popular urban apparel. Designs included influences from LL&#x27;s lyrics and tattoos, as well as from other icons in the hip-hop community.
LL Cool J has written four books, including &quot;I Make My Own Rules&quot;, (1997), an autobiography cowritten with Karen Hunter. His second book was the children-oriented book called &quot;And The Winner Is...&quot; published in 2002. In 2006, LL Cool J and his personal trainer, Dave &quot;Scooter&quot; Honig, wrote a fitness book titled &quot;The Platinum Workout&quot;. His fourth book, &quot;LL Cool J (Hip-Hop Stars)&quot; was cowritten in 2007 with hip-hop historian Dustin Shekell and Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D.

Throughout his career, LL Cool J has started several businesses in the music industry. In 1993, he founded a music label called P.O.G. (Power Of God) and formed the company &quot;Rock The Bells&quot; to produce music. On his Rock The Bells label, he had artists such as AMyth, Smokeman, Natice, Chantel Jones and Simone Starks. Additionally, Rock the Bells Records was responsible for the Deep Blue Sea soundtrack, which helped to promote the 1999 movie of the same name. Rufus &quot;Scola&quot; Waller also signed to the label, but was ultimately released when the label folded.
LL Cool J founded and launched Boomdizzle.com, a record label / social networking site, in September 2008. The website was designed to accept music uploads from aspiring artists, primarily from the hip-hop genre, and allow the site&#x27;s users to rate songs through contests, voting, and other community events.

In March 2015, LL Cool J appeared in an introduction to &quot;WrestleMania 31&quot;.

==Influence and honors==
&quot;Radio&quot;″s release coincided with the growing new school scene and subculture, which also marked the beginning of hip-hop&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; and the replacement of old school hip hop. This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-1980s, and the rise of a new style featuring &quot;ghetto blasters&quot;. &quot;Radio&quot; served as one of the earliest records, along with Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s debut album, to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of rock music, pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound.

The emerging new-school scene was initially characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s P-Funk and disco-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school. In contrast to the lengthy, jam-like form predominant throughout early hip hop (&quot;King Tim III&quot;, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, &quot;The Breaks&quot;), new-school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for radio play, and conceived more cohesive LPs than their old-school counterparts; the style typified by LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Radio&quot;. A leading example of the new school sound is the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot;, a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self&quot;. It was featured in the film &quot;Krush Groove&quot; (1985), which was based on the rise of Def Jam and new school acts such as Run-D.M.C. and the Fat Boys.

The energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on &quot;Radio&quot;, as well as other new-school recordings by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Schoolly D, T La Rock and Steady B, proved to be influential to hip-hop acts of the &quot;golden age&quot; such as Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy. The decline of the old-school form of hip hop also led to the closing of Sugar Hill Records, one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip hop and that, coincidentally, rejected LL&#x27;s demo tape. As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip-hop music&#x27;s artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.

In 2017, LL Cool J became the first rapper to receive Kennedy Center Honors.

In 2021, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with an award for Musical Excellence.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
Smith dated Kidada Jones, daughter of producer Quincy Jones, from 1992 to 1994.

==== Marriage ====
He married Simone Johnson in 1995. The couple met in 1987 and have four children.

Simone Johnson-Smith, a born-again Christian, was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, a third-stage bone cancer, and was later cancer-free as of 2004. She became an entrepreneur, launching a jewelry line in 2011.

Smith is credited with introducing his wife to singer and close friend Mary J. Blige in 2005, inspiring their friendship; the women launched a collaborative jewelry line, Sister Love, in late 2020 after announcing it two years prior.

In 2023, the couple co-founded a jewelry line for men, Majesty.

=== Ancestry ===
In an episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Smith learned that his mother was adopted by Eugene Griffith and Ellen Hightower. The series&#x27; genetic genealogist CeCe Moore identified Smith&#x27;s biological grandparents as Ethel Mae Jolly and Nathaniel Christy Lewis through analysis of his DNA. Smith&#x27;s biological great-uncle was Hall of Fame boxer John Henry Lewis.

===Political involvement===
In 2002, LL Cool J supported George Pataki&#x27;s bid for a third term as Governor of New York. In 2003, LL Cool J spoke at a U.S. Senate Committee hearing on the RIAA lawsuits against Americans distributing or downloading copyrighted music over peer-to-peer networks. He appeared to endorse the RIAA&#x27;s position, claiming illegal file sharing was hurting his sales and that his session musicians &quot;can&#x27;t live&quot; due to the lost income. Chuck D provided an opposing viewpoint, saying free file-sharing could be leveraged as a promotional tool and the industry was being overprotective of its copyright. LL also voiced his support for New York State Senator Malcolm Smith, a Democrat, during an appearance on the senator&#x27;s local television show; LL worked with Smith in putting on the annual Jump and Ball Tournament in the rapper&#x27;s childhood neighborhood of St. Albans, Queens. In a February 10, 2012 televised interview with CNN host Piers Morgan, LL Cool J expressed sympathy for President Barack Obama and ascribed negative impressions of his leadership to Republican obstruction designed to &quot;make it look like you have a coordination problem.&quot; He was quick to add that no one &quot;should assume that I&#x27;m a Democrat either. I&#x27;m an independent, you know?&quot; In his 2010 book &quot;LL Cool J&#x27;s Platinum 360 Diet and Lifestyle&quot;, he included Obama in a list of people he admired, stating that the then-president had &quot;accomplished what people thought was impossible.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
LL Cool J has his own charitable foundation called Jump &amp; Ball, which is based in his hometown of Queens, New York, and offers an athletic and team-building program for young people. He is also involved in many charitable causes for literacy, music, and arts programs for kids and schools.

<text>General Public were an English new wave band, formed in Birmingham in 1983, by vocalists Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger of the Beat, and which also included former members of Dexys Midnight Runners, the Specials, and the Clash. They are best remembered for their hits &quot;Tenderness&quot; (1984) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; (1994).

==Career==
After the break-up of the Beat in 1983 (known as the English Beat in North America), vocalists Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger decided to continue working together in a new venture. They joined up with keyboardist Mickey Billingham (Dexys Midnight Runners), guitarist Mick Jones (the Clash), bassist Horace Panter (the Specials) and drummer Stoker (Dexys Midnight Runners/the Bureau) to form a supergroup of the UK punk and ska scene. They named the band General Public and were rapidly signed to Virgin Records in the UK and I.R.S. Records in North America.

The band recorded and released the album &quot;All the Rage&quot; in 1984. Jones left General Public part way through the recording process, but he is listed in the album&#x27;s inner sleeve credits as a group member (although he did not appear in any of the band photographs for the album cover). Jones&#x27; replacement, guitarist Kevin White, also played on the album and was also listed as an official group member. White&#x27;s picture also appeared on the album&#x27;s back cover.

In the UK, General Public had a minor hit with the track &quot;General Public&quot;, which reached No. 60 in the UK Singles Chart in 1984. The single&#x27;s B-side &quot;Dishwasher&quot; (an instrumental mix of &quot;Burning Bright&quot; from &quot;All The Rage&quot;) became a surprise Top 40 hit in the Netherlands, after its use as a closing theme tune to the pop radio show &quot;Avondspits&quot;.

Later in the year, the band fared even better in North America, where their second single &quot;Tenderness&quot; was a Top 30 hit in Canada (No. 11) and the US (No. 27). The song&#x27;s success benefited from appearing in the John Hughes films &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984) and &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985) from the time period, and it would later appear in Amy Heckerling&#x27;s &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) and in the horror film &quot;Devil&#x27;s Due&quot; (2014). Meanwhile, another General Public song, &quot;Taking the Day Off&quot; was featured in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986).

For the follow-up album, White and Stoker were replaced by brothers Gianni and Mario Minardi on guitar and drums, respectively. &quot;Hand to Mouth&quot; was significantly less successful than their debut album, and the band dissolved soon after its release. The 1993 reissue of the album includes &quot;Taking the Day Off&quot; and other non-album songs and remixes.

Roger and Wakeling worked on various solo projects for the next few years, before reconstituting General Public in 1994 to perform a cover version of the Staple Singers&#x27; hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; for the &quot;Threesome&quot; film soundtrack. The new General Public line-up retained only vocalists Wakeling and Roger from previous incarnations; the vocal duo was now backed by Michael Railton (keyboards), Randy Jacobs (guitars), Wayne Lothian (bass), Thomas White (drums), and Norman Jones (percussion).

&quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot; was a Top 40 hit in the US and Canada and a minor hit in the UK (No. 73). Jacobs and White then left the group, and new drummer Dan Chase was brought in. The sextet released the album &quot;Rub It Better&quot; for Epic Records in 1995, recorded in the US with the aid of Jerry Harrison, the former keyboardist and guitarist for Talking Heads producing. Guests on the album included former bandmate Mick Jones, Saxa, Pato Banton, and Chris Spedding; ex-band members Horace Panter and Stoker also participated in the album&#x27;s creation, co-writing one song apiece. (Stoker also received an &quot;additional recording&quot; credit.) The single &quot;Rainy Days&quot; met with limited success in the US, but fared better in some international markets, notably Brazil. Sales were less than earlier albums, however, and Roger became tired of traveling to America, and they soon broke up again.

Since 2004, Dave Wakeling has toured the US with a full backing band as the English Beat. They often perform General Public tracks.

&quot;Ranking&quot; Roger Charlery died at his home in Birmingham on 26 March 2019 at the age of 56.

<doc id="170464" wikidata="Q3482342" url="?curid=170464" title="Shirley Ann Jackson">
<text>Shirley Ann Jackson, (born August 5, 1946) is an American physicist, and was the 18th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She was the subject of false claims (made by others, not by Jackson herself) that she invented caller ID and call waiting.

She is the first African American woman to have earned a doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics. She is also the second African American woman in the United States to earn a doctorate in physics.

She conducted breakthrough basic scientific research that enabled others to invent the portable fax, touch tone telephone, solar cells, fiber optic cables, and the technology behind caller ID and call waiting.

==Biography==
Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., and attended Roosevelt Senior High School. After graduation in 1964, she enrolled at MIT to study theoretical physics, earning her B.S. degree in 1968.

Jackson elected to stay at MIT for her doctoral work, and received her Ph.D. degree in nuclear physics in 1973, the first African American woman to earn a doctorate degree from MIT. Her research was directed by James Young, a professor in the MIT Center for Theoretical Physics. Jackson is also the second African American woman in the United States to earn a doctorate in physics. She was featured on the PBS show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; Season 6 Episode 7, where she is noted as one of the leading global pioneers in science all while knowing little about her ancestry. In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.

=== AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories ===
Jackson joined the Theoretical Physics Research Department at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in 1976, examining the fundamental properties of various materials. She began her time at Bell Labs by studying materials to be used in the semiconductor industry. She worked in the Scattering and Low Energy Physics Research Department from 1978, and moved to the Solid State and Quantum Physics Research Department in 1988. At Bell Labs, Jackson researched the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional systems.

Jackson served on the faculty at Rutgers University in Piscataway and New Brunswick, New Jersey from 1991 to 1995, in addition to continuing to consult with Bell Labs on semiconductor theory. Her research during this time focused on the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional systems.


Although some sources claim that Jackson conducted scientific research while working at Bell Laboratories that enabled others to invent the portable fax, touch-tone telephone, solar cells, fiber optic cables, and the technology behind caller ID and call waiting, Jackson herself makes no such claim. Moreover, these telecommunications advancements significantly predated her arrival at Bell Labs in 1976, with these six specifically enumerated inventions actually occurring by others in the time frame between 1954 and 1970.

=== U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ===
In 1995 she was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), becoming the first woman and first African American to hold that position. At the NRC, she had &quot;ultimate authority for all NRC functions pertaining to an emergency involving an NRC licensee&quot;. In addition, while Jackson served on the commission she assisted in the establishment of the International Nuclear Regulators Association. Jackson served as the chairperson for the International Regulators Association from 1997 to 1999. The association consisted of senior nuclear regulatory officials from countries like Canada, France, Germany and Spain.

=== Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ===
On July 1, 1999, Jackson became the 18th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Jackson&#x27;s goal for Rensselaer is &quot;to achieve prominence in the 21st century as a top-tier world-class technological research university, with global reach and global impact.&quot; She was the first woman and first African American to hold this position. Since her appointment to president of RPI, Jackson has helped raise over $1 billion in donations for philanthropic causes.

She led the development of a strategic initiative called The Rensselaer Plan and much progress has been made towards achieving the Plan&#x27;s goals. She oversaw a large capital improvement campaign, including the construction of an Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center costing $200 million, and the East Campus Athletic Village.

On April 26, 2006, the faculty of RPI (including a number of ‘’emeritus’’ faculty) voted 155 to 149 against a vote of no-confidence in Jackson.

After arriving at RPI, Jackson&#x27;s salary and benefits expanded from $423,150 in 1999–2000 to over $1.3 million in 2006–2007. In 2011 Jackson&#x27;s salary was $1.75 million. In 2006–07, and it is estimated she received another $1.3 million from board seats at several major corporations. The announcement of layoffs at RPI in December 2008 led some in the RPI community to question whether the institute should continue to compensate Jackson at that level, maintain a residence in the Adirondacks for her, and continue to support a personal staff. Her presidency created much controversy in the student body; in 2011, the RPI Student Senate passed a motion to request that the administration to review her performance and consider her removal due to a “broad sense of dissatisfaction and low morale among students, faculty, staff and alumni, particularly in opposition to the Institute and President Jackson’s leadership&quot; and her &quot;top down leadership, [and] abrasive style.&quot;

On December 4–5, 2009 Jackson celebrated her tenth year at RPI with a &quot;Celebration Weekend,&quot; which featured tribute concerts by Aretha Franklin and Joshua Bell among other events. Following the weekend, the board of trustees announced they would support construction of a new guest house on Jackson&#x27;s property, for the purpose of &quot;[enabling] the presidents to receive and entertain, appropriately, Rensselaer constituents, donors, and other high-level visitors.&quot; The trustees said that &quot;the funds for this new project would not have been available for any other purpose.&quot; William Walker, the school&#x27;s Vice President of Strategic Communications and External Relations noted &quot;The Board sees this very much as a long-term investment... for President Jackson and her successors.&quot;

On February 2, 2010, the Troy Zoning Board of Appeals denied RPI&#x27;s request for a zoning variance allowing them to construct the new house at a height of , which would exceed the height restriction on buildings in residential areas. The zoning board stated that it is &quot;too big,&quot; and two firefighters believed the property would be difficult to access with emergency vehicles. A new plan was announced on February 25, describing how the president&#x27;s house will be replaced with a new two-story house. The new house will have &quot;9,600 square feet of livable space, divided approximately equally between living space for the president&#x27;s family and rooms for the president to conduct meetings and events.&quot;

In June 2010, it was announced that the Rensselaer Board of Trustees unanimously voted to extend Jackson a ten-year contract renewal, which she accepted. Jackson&#x27;s compensation ranked first among US private university presidents in 2014.

A 2015 &quot;Money.com&quot; article cited Jackson as the highest-paid college President and &quot;took home a base salary of $945,000 plus another $276,474 in bonuses, $31,874 in nontaxable benefits&quot;.

In the fall of 2018, another contract extension was approved by the board of trustees through the end of June 2022.

On June 25, 2021, Jackson publicly announced she would be stepping down from her post as president as of July 1, 2022, after 23 years.

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
In February 2020, Jackson joined the Nature Conservancy Global Board. She is expected to be serving on this board until October 2029. Board Chair Tom Tierney says, &quot;To successfully take on the most pressing environmental challenges facing us, TNC needs people with ambition and big ideas.&quot;

==Honors and distinctions==
Jackson has received many fellowships, including the Martin Marietta Aircraft Company Scholarship and Fellowship, the Prince Hall Masons Scholarship, the National Science Foundation Traineeship, and a Ford Foundation Advanced Study Fellowship. She has been elected to numerous special societies, including the American Philosophical Society. In 2014, she was named a recipient of the National Medal of Science.

In the early 1990s, then-New Jersey Governor James Florio awarded Jackson the Thomas Alva Edison Science Award for her contributions to physics and for the promotion of science.

Jackson received awards for the years 1976 and 1981 as one of the Outstanding Young Women of America. She was inducted into National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1998 for &quot;her significant contributions as a distinguished scientist and advocate for education, science, and public policy.&quot; She received a Candace Award for Technology from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1982.

In 2001, she received the Richtmyer Memorial Award given annually by the American Association of Physics Teachers. She has also received 53 honorary doctorate degrees.

In spring 2007, she was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for &quot;a lifetime of achievements in scientific research, education and senior statesman-like contributions to public policy&quot;.

In 2007, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Ben Carson.

In 2008 she became the University Vice Chairman of the US Council on Competitiveness, a non-for profit group based in Washington, DC. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Jackson to serve on the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a 20-member advisory group dedicated to public policy.

<doc id="170465" wikidata="Q438156" url="?curid=170465" title="Jacob Le Maire">
<text>Jacob Le Maire (c. 1585 – 22 December 1616) was a Dutch mariner who circumnavigated the Earth in 1615 and 1616. The strait between Tierra del Fuego and Isla de los Estados was named the Le Maire Strait in his honour, though not without controversy. It was Le Maire himself who proposed to the council aboard &quot;Eendracht&quot; that the new passage should be called by his name and the council unanimously agreed with Le Maire. The author or authors of &quot;The Relation&quot; took &quot;Eendracht&quot; captain Willem Schouten&#x27;s side by proclaiming:
:“ ... our men had each of them three cups of wine in signe of ioy for our good hap ... [and the naming of] the &quot;Straights of Le Maire&quot;, although by good right it should rather have been called &quot;Willem Schouten Straight&quot;, after our Masters Name, by whose wise conduction and skill in sayling, the same was found.”.

&quot;Eendracht&quot; then rounded Cape Horn, proving that Tierra del Fuego was not a continent.

==Biography==
Jacob Le Maire was born in either Antwerp or Amsterdam, one of the 22 children of Maria Walraven of Antwerp and Isaac Le Maire (1558–1624) of Tournai, who was then already a prosperous merchant in Antwerp. Isaac and Maria married shortly before the Spanish siege of Antwerp in 1585 after which they fled to settle in Amsterdam. Jacob is thought to have been the oldest son, born perhaps the same year. Isaac was very successful in Amsterdam, and became one of the founders of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC). However, in 1605 Isaac Le Maire was forced to leave the company after a dispute and for the next decade tried to break the company&#x27;s monopoly on the trade to the East Indies.

By 1615 Isaac had established a new company (the &quot;Australian Company&quot;) with the goal to find a new route to the Pacific and the Spice Islands, thereby evading the restrictions of the VOC. He contributed to the outfitting of two ships, the &quot;Eendracht&quot; and &quot;Hoorn&quot;, and put his son Jacob in charge of trading during the expedition. The experienced ship master Willem Schouten was captain of the &quot;Eendracht&quot; and a participant of the enterprise in equal shares with Isaac Le Maire.

On 14 June 1615 Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten sailed from Texel in the United Provinces. On 29 January 1616 they rounded Cape Horn, which they named for the &quot;Hoorn&quot;, which was lost in a fire. The Dutch city of Hoorn was also the birthplace of Schouten. After failing to moor at the Juan Fernández Islands in early March, the ships crossed the Pacific in a fairly straight line, visiting several of the Tuamotus. Between 21 and 24 April 1616 they were the first Westerners to visit the (Northern) Tonga islands: &quot;Cocos Island&quot; (Tafahi), &quot;Traitors Island&quot; (Niuatoputapu), and &quot;Island of Good Hope&quot; (Niuafo&#x27;ou). On 28 April they discovered the Hoorn Islands (Futuna and Alofi), where they were very well received and stayed until 12 May. They then followed the north coasts of New Ireland and New Guinea and visited adjacent islands, including, on 24 July, what became known as the Schouten Islands.

They reached the northern Moluccas in August and finally Ternate, the headquarters of the VOC, on 12 September 1616. Here they were enthusiastically welcomed by Governor-General Laurens Reael, admiral Steven Verhagen, and the governor of Ambon, Jasper Jansz.

The &quot;Eendracht&quot; sailed on to Java and reached Batavia on 28 October with a remarkable 84 of the original 87 crew members of both ships on board. Although they had opened an unknown route, Jan Pieterszoon Coen of the VOC claimed infringement of its monopoly of trade to the Spice Islands. Le Maire and Schouten were arrested and the &quot;Eendracht&quot; was confiscated. After being released, they returned from Batavia to Amsterdam in the company of Joris van Spilbergen, who was on a circumnavigation of the Earth himself, be it via the traditional Strait of Magellan.

Le Maire was aboard the ship &quot;Amsterdam&quot; on this journey home, but died en route. Van Spilbergen was at his deathbed and took Le Maire&#x27;s report of his trip, which he included in his book &quot;Mirror of the East and West Indies&quot;. The rest of the crew arrived in the Netherlands on 1 July 1617, two years and 17 days after they departed. Jacob&#x27;s father Isaac challenged the confiscation and the conclusion of the VOC, but it took him until 1622 until a court ruled in his favour. He was awarded 64,000 pounds and retrieved his son&#x27;s diaries (which he then published as well), and his company was allowed trade via the newly discovered route. Unfortunately, by then, the Dutch West Indies Company had claimed the same waters.

<doc id="170466" wikidata="Q16011" url="?curid=170466" title="Spandau Ballet">
<text>Spandau Ballet ( ) were an English new wave band formed in Islington, London, in 1979. Inspired by the capital&#x27;s post-punk underground dance scene, they emerged at the start of the 1980s as the house band for the Blitz Kids, playing &quot;European Dance Music&quot; as &quot;The Applause&quot; for this new club culture&#x27;s audience. They became one of the most successful groups of the New Romantic era of British pop and were part of the Second British Invasion of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 in the 1980s, selling 25 million albums and having 23 hit singles worldwide. The band have had eight UK top 10 albums, including three greatest hits compilations and an album of re-recorded material. Their musical influences ranged from punk rock and soul music to the American crooners Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.

The band&#x27;s classic lineup featured Gary Kemp on guitar, synthesiser and backing vocals; his brother, Martin Kemp, on bass; vocalist Tony Hadley; saxophonist Steve Norman; and drummer John Keeble. Gary Kemp was also the band&#x27;s songwriter. Their debut single &quot;To Cut a Long Story Short&quot; reached No. 5 in the UK in 1980 and was the first of ten UK top-10 singles. The band peaked in popularity in 1983 with the album &quot;True&quot;, as its title track reached No. 1 in the UK and the top 5 in the US. In 2011, it received a BMI award as one of the most-played songs in US history with four million airplays. In 1984, they received a Brit Award for technical excellence and were the first act to be approached by Bob Geldof to join the original Band Aid lineup. In 1985, they performed at the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium.

In 1990, the band played their last live show before a 19-year absence. In 1999, Hadley, Norman and Keeble launched an unsuccessful case in the High Court against Gary Kemp and his Reformation Publishing Company for a share of the band&#x27;s songwriting royalties. Spandau Ballet reformed in 2009 for The Reformation Tour, a sell-out &quot;greatest hits&quot; world tour. In 2014, their archive-only feature-length documentary biopic, &quot;Soul Boys of the Western World&quot;, was world-premiered at SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. It was officially screened at the Rome, Ghent (Belgium) and NYC Doc film festivals and received its European premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, London.

In 2017, Hadley left Spandau Ballet. A year later, singer and actor Ross William Wild became their new frontman for a series of European live dates and a one-off show at Eventim&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo. In May 2019, Wild tweeted that he had quit the band &quot;to pursue my own music with my band Mercutio&quot;, while Spandau bass player Martin Kemp confirmed there were no further plans for Spandau to tour without original singer Hadley.

==History==
===1976–1982: Formation and early success===
Gary Kemp and Steve Norman first decided to form a band, both playing guitar, in October 1976 after witnessing the Sex Pistols perform that summer at Islington&#x27;s Screen on the Green. Close friends and school mates at Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s in Islington, they were joined by John Keeble on drums, Michael Ellison on bass and Tony Hadley on vocals when the school relocated to Potters Bar. They rehearsed at lunchtimes in the school&#x27;s music room, playing sped-up versions of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Silver Train&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; and the Animals&#x27; &quot;We&#x27;ve Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot;. They also played an original Gary Kemp composition, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Roots&quot;, which inspired their band name, Roots. Their first gig was a fourth-form Christmas party December 1976 in the school dining room.

The band changed their name to the Cut when Michael Ellison left, with Steve Norman filling in on bass. In 1977 another Alice Owen pupil, Richard Miller, took over on bass guitar and the band changed their name to the Makers, playing power pop compositions by Gary Kemp or Steve Norman, with titles like &quot;Fantasy Girl&quot; and &quot;Pin-Ups&quot;, inspired by mid-sixties bands like the Small Faces. They received a number of positive gig reviews from the British music press in &quot;Sounds&quot; and the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. The band changed personnel and name once more when their manager, friend and fellow Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s schoolmate Steve Dagger suggested Martin Kemp be brought in as their bass player after seeing how much attention he got from the Makers&#x27; female fans when he was their roadie. The band was now called Gentry and Martin played his first gig on 1 July 1978 at the Middlesex Polytechnic in Cockfosters.

Inspired by London&#x27;s new underground nightclub scene, which began in Autumn 1978 with a weekly Tuesday night hosted by Steve Strange and DJ Rusty Egan at Billy&#x27;s in Soho, the band switched musical direction to embrace the new electronic music. Friend and writer Robert Elms suggested they change their name to Spandau Ballet, a phrase which he told them he had seen written on a wall on a weekend trip to Berlin: “Rudolf Hess, all alone, dancing the Spandau Ballet”. Their first performance was an invitation-only showcase on the morning of Saturday 17 November 1979, at Halligan&#x27;s Band Centre rehearsal studio, 103 Holloway Road, to test the reaction of the key influencers of the new scene. Having passed that &#x27;audition&#x27;, the band&#x27;s first gig as Spandau Ballet was at the Blitz&#x27;s Christmas party on 5 December 1979.

===&quot;Journeys to Glory&quot;===
A series of exclusive &#x27;secret&#x27; gigs in 1980 at unique non-rock venues like the Scala cinema and the cruiser HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, advertised only by word-of-mouth, created the hype for a major record companies bidding war. After the band signed with Chrysalis Records, they released &quot;To Cut a Long Story Short&quot;, produced by Landscape’s Richard James Burgess. It became a top five hit on the UK charts in late 1980, as well as reaching the top 20 in Australia, Ireland and Spain. Their second single, &quot;The Freeze&quot;, was another top 20 hit in the UK, Ireland and Spain, followed by the double A-side &quot;Musclebound/Glow&quot; and the gold-certified debut album &quot;Journeys to Glory&quot; in early 1981.

The band played their first US showcase in May 1981 at New York&#x27;s Underground Club, on 17th and Broadway, with a fashion show by Axiom, a co-operative of the London club scene&#x27;s new clothes designers including Sade Adu. Spandau were the first UK pop band to perform live at the world-famous Ku Club in Ibiza.

Reflecting the rapidly evolving club scene and Soho&#x27;s hippest new nightspot, Le Beat Route on Greek Street, the band changed musical directions again, releasing the funk single &quot;Chant No. 1 (I Don&#x27;t Need This Pressure On)&quot;, which was a No. 3 hit in the UK while reaching No. 17 in the US on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Disco Top 100 in 1981. The song was championed by DJ Frankie Crocker on WBLS.

===&quot;Diamond&quot;===
The follow-up album, &quot;Diamond,&quot; also produced by Burgess, was released in 1982. This album was certified gold by the BPI. The band had Burgess remix every single from both albums for inclusion on each single&#x27;s B-side and for 12-inch club releases. These mixes were later released as a boxed set. However, the second single from &quot;Diamond&quot; was &quot;Paint Me Down&quot;, which broke their run of top 20 hits by stalling at No. 30. The third single, &quot;She Loved Like Diamond&quot;, failed to make the UK top 40 at all.

Trevor Horn remixed the track &quot;Instinction&quot;, which was released as the fourth single from the album. Backed with a special dance remix of &quot;Chant No. 1&quot; on the 12-inch single version, the release was very well received. It returned the band to the UK top 10 after the poor chart performance of their previous two singles.

===1983–1989: International success===
===&quot;True&quot;===
The band released their third album, &quot;True&quot;, in March 1983. Produced by Tony Swain and Steve Jolley, the album featured a slicker pop sound and was recorded at Compass Point in the Bahamas. It was at this point that Steve Norman began playing saxophone for the band. The title track gave the band their first UK No. 1 single. It was a multi-format hit in the US, reaching No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and US &quot;Cash Box&quot; and also entering the US R&amp;B charts. The band played four sell-out shows at The Wilton and The Palace, Los Angeles, in December 1983. The song was also a No. 1 in Ireland and Canada and top 5 in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and Spain. It won a BMI award as one of the most played songs in history when it passed four million airplays in the United States, the equivalent of 22 years&#x27; continuous play.

The follow-up single, &quot;Gold&quot;, reached No. 2 in the UK and the top 5 in Belgium, Ireland and Spain. The album topped the charts internationally, spent 64 consecutive weeks in the top 100 albums chart and reached No. 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The singles &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Communication&quot; peaked at numbers 29 and 59 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On their UK tour they were the first rock band to play Sadler&#x27;s Wells and the Royal Festival Hall.

===&quot;Parade&quot; and Live Aid period===
The follow-up album, &quot;Parade&quot;, was released in June 1984, and its singles were again big successes in the charts in Europe, Oceania and Canada. The album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Only When You Leave&quot;, became the band&#x27;s last American hit. The band&#x27;s first top 10 single in Italy was &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly for You&quot;, a success they repeated later with the singles &quot;Fight for Ourselves&quot; and &quot;Through the Barricades.&quot; At the end of 1984, the band performed on the Band Aid charity single alongside chart rivals Duran Duran, Culture Club and Wham!, and in 1985 performed at Wembley Stadium as part of Live Aid to a global audience estimated at 1.9 billion. The &quot;Spandau Ballet World Parade 84–85&quot; was the group&#x27;s biggest tour to date, spanning Europe, America, the Far East and, for the first time, Australia and New Zealand. Their UK tour ended with six record-breaking nights at Wembley Arena. During the second show at LA&#x27;s Universal Amphitheatre, Steve Norman tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee and the rest of the tour was cancelled. This also resulted in the cancellation of a proposed summer tour of Spain and Italy and a planned six-week tour of the United States supporting the Power Station.

During this same year, Spandau Ballet achieved platinum status with the compilation &quot;The Singles Collection&quot;, which kept the focus on the band between studio albums and celebrated its five years of success. The album was released by Chrysalis Records without the band&#x27;s approval and the band instigated legal action against the label.

===&quot;Through the Barricades&quot;===
After a bitter court case with Chrysalis, Spandau Ballet signed to CBS Records for £1.5 million in 1986 and released their fifth studio album, &quot;Through the Barricades&quot;. With producer Gary Langan, the band moved away from their pop and soul influences to create a stadium rock sound. A dispute between Our Price Records and Sony over trading arrangements resulted in the Our Price chain and its chart return shops refusing to stock any CBS singles, which affected the record sales of their first single release, &quot;Fight for Ourselves&quot;. Though it peaked at 15 in the UK, it was a top 10 hit in Italy and the Netherlands. The title track, a personal favourite of Kemp and Hadley and inspired by the killing of a friend, Thomas &quot;Kidso&quot; Reilly in Belfast by Private Ian Thain, reached the top 10 in the UK and in Europe, as did the album.

This was followed in 1986/87 by the band&#x27;s largest European concert tour to date, &quot;Through the Barricades – Across the Borders&quot;, with six record-breaking nights at the Ahoy Stadium in Rotterdam, another six nights at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, 80,000 at Casa de Campo in Madrid and 50,000 at an open-air concert in Treviso. Hadley and Gary Kemp performed &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; for the Prince&#x27;s Trust at Wembley Arena with the &#x27;house band&#x27; of Eric Clapton, Midge Ure and Phil Collins, and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; with George Harrison and Ringo Starr. In 1988, the band played for the King of Spain in front of the Royal Palace in Barcelona, on the same bill as Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé, to launch the campaign for the 1992 Olympics.

===&quot;Heart Like a Sky&quot;===
After a hiatus from recording, the band released their next album, &quot;Heart Like a Sky&quot;, initially titled &quot;Home&quot;, in September 1989. For the first time, new working methods were employed, as Gary Kemp demoed his new songs programming the drums, keyboards and bass on a porta-studio with Toby Chapman, Spandau&#x27;s session keyboard player, rather than rehearsing with the band. The album and its singles were not successful in the UK and the album was not released in the United States. Nevertheless, the band continued to have success in Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, where the singles &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Be Free with Your Love&quot; entered the top 40. The album included &quot;Motivator&quot;, the first song written by Steve Norman for the band since The Makers.

===1990–1999: Break-up and solo projects===
On Tuesday 6 March 1990, the band played the final date of their 10th anniversary tour at Edinburgh Playhouse before taking a break to pursue other acting and musical solo projects.

Gary and Martin Kemp took the leading roles as notorious East End gangster twins Ronald and Reginald Kray in &quot;The Krays&quot; which premiered in London in April 1990. The film won two Evening Standard British Film Awards for Best Film and Most Promising Newcomer (writer Philip Ridley). Tony Hadley recorded his first solo album in Los Angeles produced by Ron Nevison. Steve Norman moved to Ibiza to collaborate on chilled out Balearic records with local producers. John Keeble continued as drummer with Tony Hadley and formed his own band, 69 Daze, with former Sigue Sigue Sputnik guitarist Neal X, followed by 99 shows across Europe with The Herbs and Pacific with guitarist John McGeoch.

Gary Kemp enjoyed further acting success, moving to Hollywood with actor wife Sadie Frost, to film both &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (with Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner) and &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;, directed by Academy Award winner Roger Avary, produced by Quentin Tarantino. In 1995 Gary released his solo album, &quot;Little Bruises&quot;.

Martin Kemp also appeared in films and TV series in Los Angeles such as &quot;The Outer Limits,&quot; &quot;Murder Between Friends&quot;, and Sugar Town which also starred John Taylor from Duran Duran.

In the 1990s, the band split up after a disagreement about royalties. Hadley, Norman and Keeble launched an unsuccessful court case against Gary Kemp for a share of Kemp&#x27;s songwriting royalties from his work with Spandau Ballet. Although they vowed to appeal against the verdict, they later decided against this. The three non-Kemp members then continued to tour as a trio, but they had to sell their shares in Spandau Ballet&#x27;s company to Gary Kemp to pay off legal debts. Because the company owned the rights to the name of Spandau Ballet, the trio had to tour under the moniker &quot;Hadley, Norman and Keeble, ex-Spandau Ballet&quot;.

After successful surgery for the removal of two brain tumours in the mid-Nineties, Martin Kemp joined &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1998 as one of the British soap&#x27;s most popular bad boy characters, Steve Owen, winning Most Popular Actor at the 2000 National Television Awards and numerous Best Actor and Villain of the Year awards for the British Soap Awards, &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards and TV Quick Awards. He left EastEnders in 2002 for a golden handcuff deal with ITV drama and wrote his best-selling autobiography, &quot;True&quot;. He also wrote and directed his first film, &quot;Martin Kemp&#x27;s Stalker&quot;.

Gary Kemp wrote songs with Paul Stratham, who had written songs for Dido, continued acting on stage, in film and in television, and wrote music and additional lyrics with Guy Pratt for &quot;Bedbug&quot; at the National Theatre in 2004 and &quot;A Terrible Beauty&quot;, with Guy Pratt and Shane Connaughton. He continued acting on stage, in film and on television. He played Serge in the West End production of &quot;Art&quot; in 2001. Films included &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; and &quot;American Daylight&quot; and TV shows &quot;Murder in Mind&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;.

Steve Norman formed chilled lounge band Cloudfish with Rafa Peletey and Shelley Preston in 2001. Tony Hadley released three studio albums. He played Billy Flynn in the West End production of Chicago and won the ITV reality show, Reborn in the USA in 2003 singing &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; to beat Michelle Gayle in the final. He appeared as a guest vocalist on the Alan Parsons album &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, performing lead vocals on the song &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;.

===2009–2019: Reunion===

In early 2009, the official Spandau Ballet website encouraged fans to sign up &quot;for an exciting announcement&quot;, fuelling rumours that a reunion was imminent. Jonathan Ross mentioned during his BBC Radio 2 programme on 21 March 2009, that the band were re-forming and that he had been invited to the reunion party.

The band confirmed the rumours at a press conference on 25 March 2009, on board HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; in London, a return to the venue of one of their first gigs to launch their comeback tour. They were introduced by friend and broadcaster Robert Elms after a Billy&#x27;s and Blitz era DJ set by Rusty Egan. John Keeble and Gary Kemp revealed current musical influences as The Killers, Kaiser Chiefs, MGMT and Florence and the Machine.

The band began a world tour in October 2009, starting with eight dates across Ireland and the UK, the first of which was in Dublin on 13 October 2009. The tickets for the UK and Ireland shows went on pre-sale on the official Spandau Ballet website on 25 March 2009. They went on general release on 27 March 2009. For the general release tickets, the London O2 arena tickets sold out within 20 minutes and an extra two dates were added there because of demand. The band also added Liverpool and an extra date in Birmingham to the tour. Members gave their &quot;first public performance and interview anywhere in the world for 19 years&quot; on the BBC television show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 24 April 2009 performing &quot;Chant No.1&quot; with the original Beggar &amp; Co and &quot;Gold.&quot;

On 19 October 2009, the group released a new album, &quot;Once More&quot;, which featured reworked semi-acoustic versions of 11 Spandau favourites and two new songs, the title track, written by Gary Kemp and Steve Norman, and Love Is All, the first Spandau song to be written by Tony Hadley. The album went Gold in Italy and Silver in the UK. Virgin Media honoured Spandau Ballet as the Best Comeback of 2009 in the Virgin Media Awards.

Spandau Ballet went on tour in Australia during April 2010 with Tears For Fears as part of a world tour. After a headline set at the Isle of Wight Festival on the same bill as Paul McCartney, The Strokes, Jay-Z and Pink, the group played their last UK show of the Reformation Tour at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 June 2010.

In 2014, all five played live again with an anthology world tour to promote a critically acclaimed feature-length archive-only documentary of the band&#x27;s story and the pop cultural history of the Eighties, &quot;Soul Boys of the Western World.&quot; It world premiered at South By Southwest with Spandau also playing as part of the music festival, their first public appearance in North America since 1985. The band played five numbers for the film&#x27;s European premiere at the Royal Albert Hall. There were gala screenings in Sydney, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Auckland and Hamburg. The film had a UK cinema release. It was directed by George Hencken, produced by Steve Dagger and Scott Milaney with archive producer Kate Griffiths and included never-before-seen footage of the band playing and being interviewed at NYC&#x27;s Underground club in March 1981.

It was confirmed on 31 July 2014, that Spandau Ballet were working on new material in the studio with Trevor Horn. In the UK, the band appeared in an ITV show, &quot;Spandau Ballet – True Gold&quot;, in which they performed several hits and were interviewed by Christine Bleakley in front of a studio audience. The band performed their 1980s hit single &quot;True&quot; and a new song called &quot;This Is the Love&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; on 11 November 2014. It was their US late-night TV debut and their first US TV appearance since 1985 when they played on &quot;Soul Train&quot;. They were there to promote their new greatest hits collection called &quot;The Story – The Very Best of Spandau Ballet&quot;, which also contained three new songs. The album reached the UK top 10. Both &quot;Steal&quot; and &quot;This Is The Love&quot; appeared on the US Adult Contemporary chart.

The band embarked on another world tour in 2015. In January 2015, they appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, performing &quot;True&quot;. They also appeared on &quot;The Talk&quot; on 27 July 2015 to perform &quot;True&quot;.

On 3 July 2017, Tony Hadley left the band due to, as he stated on Twitter, circumstances beyond his control. The rest of the band released their own statement explaining that Hadley had made it clear to them in September 2016 that he did not want to work with the band any more and that they had now reached the decision &quot;to move on as a band.&quot;

The initial plan was for Seal to replace Hadley&#x27;s as Spandau&#x27;s singer. According to Gary Kemp, an agreement for a tour was reached with Seal but, as the band was waiting for him to fly in and start to rehearse, he eventually backed off.

On 6 June 2018, after a lengthy audition process Spandau Ballet revealed their new lead singer, Ross William Wild, who had previously performed with Martin Kemp in the West End musical &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot;. The band played live at Subterania Club in West London, a venue they had last played 40 years earlier in 1978 as Gentry when it was called Acklam Hall. Their first song as the new line-up was &quot;Through the Barricades&quot;. Wild said: &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Spandau so much stuff wouldn&#x27;t have happened. They are pioneers.&quot;

Spandau Ballet finished the year showcasing Wild with five live gigs abroad (Milan, Rome, Padova, Utrecht, Tilburg) concluding with another at the Eventim Apollo in London on 29 October, and attracted favourable reviews.
On 16 October 2018, Hadley played the London Palladium with The Tony Hadley Band.

Within five months cracks were appearing in Spandau&#x27;s new line-up. In March 2019, Wild joined a new band called Mercutio, saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t wait around for Spandau! Unfortunately Gary [Kemp] has commitments, so we&#x27;re waiting him to finish until we crack on.&quot; One month later Gary Kemp, touring the US with Nick Mason&#x27;s band Saucerful of Secrets, said in an interview: &quot;There are no plans for Spandau going into 2020.&quot; He said he struggled to imagine Spandau Ballet without Tony Hadley, adding: &quot;I still think that&#x27;s the ultimate goal&quot;. Then on 23 May 2019, Wild tweeted at 6:15am: &quot;I have formally quit the band @SpandauBallet to pursue my own music with my band Mercutio.&quot; By 10:30am Martin Kemp was on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; confirming that Spandau would not be touring &quot;until Tony [Hadley] comes back&quot;.

The next day Spandau thanked Wild via Twitter for &quot;his brilliant performances with them last year and wish him every success with his band, Mercutio&quot;. Within the next few days Wild explained further: &quot;I&#x27;d put my whole life on hold and was sick of waiting around for them to make up their minds. I told the boys I was quitting and then never heard back from them.&quot; The band&#x27;s sax player Steve Norman also said: &quot;I was neither involved in nor informed of any discussions or decision-making regarding the future of my band, least of all Ross&#x27;s position in it.&quot; Wild was subsequently arrested in March 2021 and charged (under his real name, Ross Davidson) with a series of sex offences dating back to 2013. He was convicted in 2024 of voyeurism, raping a woman and sexually assaulting two others.

<text>Jacques Villon (July 31, 1875 – June 9, 1963), also known as Gaston Duchamp, was a French Cubist and abstract painter and printmaker.

==Early life==
Born Émile Méry Frédéric Gaston Duchamp in Damville, Eure, in Normandy, France, he came from a prosperous and artistically inclined family. While he was a young man, his maternal grandfather Émile Frédéric Nicolle, a successful businessman and artist, educated Villon and his siblings.

Gaston Duchamp was the elder brother of:
*Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876–1918), sculptor
*Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968), painter, sculptor and author
*Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti (1889–1963), painter

In 1894, he and his brother Raymond moved to Montmartre in Paris. There, he studied law at the University of Paris, but received his father&#x27;s permission to study art on the condition that he must continue studying law.

To distinguish himself from his siblings, Gaston Duchamp adopted the pseudonym of Jacques Villon as a tribute to the French medieval poet François Villon. In Montmartre, home to an expanding art community, Villon lost interest in the pursuit of a legal career, and for the next 10 years he worked in graphic media, contributing cartoons and illustrations to Parisian newspapers. His work appeared in the satirical weekly &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;. Villon created only seven advertising posters in his career, all of which are in the soft styles of the Belle Epoque.

In 1903 he helped organize the drawing section of the first Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris. In 1904-1905 he studied art at the Académie Julian.

At first, he was influenced by Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, but later he participated in the fauvist, Cubist, and abstract impressionist movements.

By 1906, Montmartre was a bustling community and Jacques Villon moved to Puteaux in the quiet outskirts of Paris. There, he began to devote more of his time to working in drypoint, an intaglio technique that creates dark, velvety lines that stand out against the white of the paper. During this time he worked closely to develop his technique with other important printmakers such as Manuel Robbe.

His isolation from the vibrant art community in Montmartre, together with his modest nature, ensured that he and his artwork remained obscure for a number of years.

At his home, in 1911, he and his brothers Raymond and Marcel organized a regular discussion group with artists and critics such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Francis Picabia, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and others that was soon dubbed the Puteaux Group (or the Section d&#x27;Or). Villon was instrumental in having the group exhibit under the name Section d&#x27;Or after the golden section of classical mathematics. Their first show, Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, held at the Galerie La Boétie in October 1912, involved more than 200 works by 31 artists.

In 1913, Villon created seven large drypoints in which forms break into shaded pyramidal planes. That year, he exhibited at the Armory Show in New York City, helping introduce European modern art to the United States. His works proved popular and all his art sold. From there, his reputation expanded so that by the 1930s he was better known in the United States than in Europe.

==Honors==

An exhibition of Jacques Villon&#x27;s work was held in Paris in 1944 at the Galerie Louis Carré, following which he received honors at a number of international exhibitions. In 1938 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor. In 1947 he was promoted to Officier (Officer) of the Legion of Honor. In 1950, Villon received the Carnegie Prize, the highest award for painting in the world, and in 1954 he was made a Commandeur (Commander) of the Legion of Honor. The following year he was commissioned to design stained-glass windows for the cathedral at Metz, France. In 1956 he was awarded the Grand Prix at the Venice Biennale exhibition.

Among Villon&#x27;s greatest achievements as a printmaker was his creation of a purely graphic language for cubism – an accomplishment that no other printmaker, including his fellow cubists Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque, could claim.

Villon died in his studio at Puteaux.

In 1967, in Rouen, his last surviving artist brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called &quot;Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp&quot;. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

Many important museums include works by Villon in their collections, including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Minneapolis Institute of Arts; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Art Institute of Chicago; Columbus Museum of Art (Columbus, Ohio); Museum of Modern Art, New York City; University of Michigan Museum of Art (Ann Arbor, Michigan); National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia); Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris; and Musée Jenisch (Vevey, Switzerland).

Leading private collections which include the works of Villon are the Joachim Collection of Chicago, the Vess Collection of Detroit, and the Ginestet Collection of Paris.

==Art market==
In May 2004, an oil painting by Villon dated 1913 entitled &quot;L&#x27;Acrobate&quot; and measuring 39 ¼ by 28 ¼ inches sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $1,296,000 (US dollars).
